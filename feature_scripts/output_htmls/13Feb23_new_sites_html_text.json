The project will be implemented in a large proportion of the city\u2019s building stock before the end of this heating season. The Berlin-based company myWarm will carry out hydraulic balancing on around 10 000 radiators in around 50 large public buildings. At the same time, Hamburg is the first major German city to install smart thermostats on a large scale. These come from the EIT's Hamburg-based portfolio company vilisto. The combination of measures is expected to save up to 30 percent or 15 gigawatt hours of heating energy per year in the buildings. This is roughly equivalent to the average annual consumption of 1 800 apartments with an area of 60 m\u00b2. Hamburg\u2019s city government is working together with the commercial real estate agency Sprinkenhof GmbH to make these changes, which go far beyond the requirements of the German government's latest energy-saving ordinance. City of Hamburg as a role model In addition to long-term projects in line with our urban climate plan, the upcoming cold season now also calls for immediate measures with a short-term impact. Our public companies and also public buildings have an exemplary role to play in the challenges posed by the energy crisis. Their scale alone gives them a correspondingly strong leverage effect and they can save significant amounts of energy. The project now underway is very promising and can make an important contribution to saving energy. Dr. Andreas Dressel, Finance Senator of the city of Hamburg Since August, all radiators in approximately 50 properties have been hydraulically balanced by the Berlin-based company myWarm. The company's measurement-based process ensures that all radiators in all rooms are heated evenly, thus preventing additional consumption due to over- or undersupply. After our hydraulic balancing, the heating system gives off the heat optimally to the rooms. This alone significantly reduces energy consumption. In addition, we thus create the conditions for further energy-related renovation measures to take effect in the best possible way. Daniel Kessler, Managing Director of myWarm Deutschland GmbH vilisto's smart thermostats heat only when a room is used While the hydraulic balancing is implemented, the Hamburg-based company vilisto is simultaneously installing its smart thermostats. These automatically detect whether and when a room is being used and heat the room as needed. This is especially important because public spaces such as offices or schools are usually heated continuously but not in use up to 80 percent of the time, for example after work, on weekends or on home office days. With this major project, the city of Hamburg is sending a clear signal for a comprehensive heat transition. The widespread use of innovative solutions not only saves energy, emissions and money in the short term, but is a necessary technical building block for the building sector to achieve its mandatory climate targets by 2030. Christoph Berger, CEO and co-founder of vilisto Landmark buildings such as Hamburg City Hall part of the project The properties involved in the project include office and administrative buildings, fire and rescue stations, police stations, cultural facilities, business parks, and university properties, all with areas ranging from 1 000 to 40 000 m\u00b2. These include, for example, Hamburg City Hall, the Altona, Bergedorf and Harburg City Halls, the Planetarium, the Deutsches Schauspielhaus, the Hamburg Kunsthalle and the courthouse at Sievekingplatz. The technology\u2019s implementation will be carried out during ongoing operations without any significant disruption to workflows. By the end of December 2022, around 25 of the 50 buildings will already be hydraulically balanced and equipped with vilisto\u2019s self-learning thermostats. With our push to implement new technologies, we can respond in the short term to the federal energy-saving ordinance in the 50 or so buildings, and enable our tenants to heat efficiently and intelligently. For example, we can centrally control the 19-degree requirement without any effort on the part of our occupants. We are convinced that the ongoing energy crisis can only be countered through joint action. That's why we're taking responsibility and using the measures to expand the climate friendliness of our portfolio in the long term as well. Jan Zunke, Sprinkenhof Managing Director The Climate Plan and the immediate measures now initiated by the City of Hamburg go hand in hand with both the recommendations of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection as part of the Energy Efficiency Strategy 2050 and the 2nd Energy Saving Ordinance, which came into force at the beginning of October. For public buildings with a floor area of 1 000 m\u00b2 or more, the ordinance requires, among other things, a mandatory hydraulic balance and a reduction in the heating temperature to a maximum of 19 degrees Celsius.", "eit220": "As a summit that\u2019s been dubbed by Politico as \u201cthe world\u2019s premier tech conference\u201d, by The New York Times as \u201ca grand conclave of tech industry\u2019s high priests\u201d, and by The Atlantic as \u201cwhere the future goes to be born\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t be complete without the EIT.

The event was an official part of the 2022 Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Leaders of the European raw materials community gathered in Prague, Czech Republic on 12 September for the discussions. Mr Sch\u00e4fer stressed that Europe has all the means to build a modern and circular economy. He made the key point that a responsible mining industry is crucial to making Europe self-sufficient, less vulnerable, and more competitive. He also highlighted the strategically important role of Eastern Europe in the delivery of raw materials crucial for the achievement of the European Green Deal. Europe faces the challenge of implementing the biggest energy transition in the history of humankind. This will require unprecedented quantities of raw materials, and Eastern Europe\u2019s role is key to regaining the balance of raw material security that Europe once had. The area has always been a vibrant hub for upstream and midstream activities of the raw materials industry. Despite the challenges in discovering new deposits, and developing new projects, there has been positive progress. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer, EIT RawMaterials CEO Mr Sch\u00e4fer told the event that the time has come for a sustainable, European mining sector to redress this raw materials imbalance, and contribute to the defined climate change targets. In his speech, Czech Minister of Industry and Trade, Jozef Sikela, recommended three specific measures to be adopted to regain that balance and strengthen raw materials security for Europe: cooperation with neighbouring countries who have availability of raw materials, an EU wide system of strategic reserves, and exploration of EU territory for strategic and critical raw materials. The event was hosted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. It brought together officials and representatives from all EU member states, as well as other countries in the region including, the Western Balkans, the Baltic countries, and Ukraine.", "eit223": "Highlights and Successes of the Regional Innovation Scheme The EIT Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) is continuing to blaze an innovation trail across the RIS countries.

The RIS countries are emerging as innovation hotspots in the raw materials sector, crucial for Europe\u2019s green and digital transition. The EIT RawMaterials RIS Scheme works to bolster this innovation and develop these opportunities in the region. RIS is implemented through six pan-European RIS Hubs and is a key focus of the EIT RawMaterials Strategic Agenda 2021-2027. Its importance is further underpinned by the recently launched European Innovation Agenda.

The project entails fostering dialogue among stakeholders from different sectors and regions, sharing practical knowledge and good practices, and introducing a systemic and experimental approach. Activities will initially focus on regions in Czechia, Greece and Poland with the objective to expand to other countries in the following years. While coal is still a significant source of energy in the European Union\u2019s energy mix (20 per cent of total electricity production), the necessary efforts to move away from it and towards more sustainable energy sources in Europe is a long-term and complex process already taking place simultaneously in many countries and regions. We count about 31 coal regions in 11 countries in Europe. The major challenge for these places is to succeed in moving away from coal while securing growth, jobs, inclusivity, and sometimes a new identity for the region and its citizens. Previous experiences in coal regions have shown that working towards a climate-resilient future and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is not just about closing mines. It is about designing the future of work, together with public authorities, industry, academia and citizens, which is critical to a fair and inclusive transition away from coal. In response to these challenges, EIT Climate-KIC, together with Climate Strategies, WISE Europa, ERFC and Impact Hub, has launched the Post Coal Future Lab (PCFL) to help co-create this future in a sustainable and systemic way. The PCFL initiative builds on previous EIT Climate-KIC endeavours in coal regions, including the Rybnik Deep Demonstration process in the heart of Silesia, the EU\u2019s largest coal region, and the Reboost initiative involving stakeholders from lignite regions. Practical tool for a just transition The Post Coal Future Lab addresses the complex challenges of the energy transition by facilitating collaboration within and between Europe\u2019s southern, central and eastern regions. The PCFL fosters knowledge sharing, dialogue and co-creation of solutions among actors from different regions to develop innovative initiatives and policies to enhance the benefits of the Just Transition. Thanks to our experience working with traditionally polluting industrial regions, we\u2019ve observed that everyone who deals with coal phase-out mostly thinks about the immediate results of closing a coal mine, but we\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s about more than just an energy transition and how to reskill and upskill people, Anna Brussa, Deep Demonstrations Orchestrator at EIT Climate-KIC, PCFL project lead The goal of the Lab is to help develop long-term plans, that will ultimately contribute to a prosperous future of the European coal regions involving stakeholders in those regions so they can co-create their own path. \u201cIt\u2019s about the identity and the future of the region and it\u2019s about finding the right way to approach the context and the direction that each region wants to take. One region\u2019s future may lie in renewables because the potential is already there. For another region, it may be important to invest in activating entrepreneurialism. There are many different experiences and people share them, but it\u2019s never easy to transfer one experience from place A to place B, and it\u2019s not always possible to apply a solution that worked somewhere, in another context. What\u2019s essential is to take into account both the similarities and the differences of each context, and that\u2019s where the Post Coal Future Lab comes in,\u201d \u2013 Brussa continues. The Post Coal Future Lab is a practical, experimental and participatory pillar of the just transition, complementing existing formal mechanisms, such as the financial resources of the Just Transition Mechanism and the technical support of the Just Transition Platform or Coal Regions in Transition Initiative. \u201cWe must keep in mind that all of these resources ( EUR19.2 billion from the Just Transition Fund plus approximately EUR 36 billion from the other pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism) must be spent in an impactful way, bringing the desired, transformative change and ensure a sustainable, secure and just future. The PCFL will help make smart decisions, built on collaboration, collective intelligence and continuous learning. In this sense, we\u2019re talking about systemic change, that enables better outcomes. \u201c\u2013 said Aneta Skubida from WISE Europe. The Post Coal Future Lab\u2019s mission is to create a space of dialogue and cooperation for stakeholders to test and learn how to achieve a just transition in Europe\u2019s coal regions and to become a partner for decision makers and stakeholders in developing a body of knowledge and expertise to support policy and practice. PCFL is also about disseminating learnings and scaling-up initiatives and practical examples not only from the participating regions but also from coal regions in countries such as Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. \u201cOn the one hand, there are many initiatives in Europe and worldwide bringing stakeholders from different countries to discuss transition issues, and many of them have a high degree of formality. On the other hand, there are more and more engaged stakeholders in the European coal regions, and many of them have already achieved a lot. The question now is how we can bring those experiences together in a less formal way that addresses the real problem and does not shy away from tackling difficult issues. So we don\u2019t want another platform, but a space where practical knowledge can be shared and become an essential help in addressing the challenges of the transition. We want people to leave the meetings in our Lab and say, This is really a solution to my problem, it helps me with my transition, I now know what I need to do. Andrzej B\u0142achowicz, Managing Director of Climate Strategies. Mini Labs to change the bigger picture The Post Coal Future Lab will operate based on multiple Mini Labs and the Main Lab, tools similar to UN Habitat\u2019s urban labs and other urban labs in Europe such as UrbanLab Gdynia, designed for ongoing collaboration among stakeholders, including citizens, and authorities. The Mini Labs will be located in southern, central, and eastern European coal regions and will focus on the challenges of each specific territory. As such, a diverse mix of methods and tools will be tested to generate learnings from and for local ecosystems, helping to enhance policies, projects, programmes and capabilities. \u201dWe designed the concept of the so-called Mini Labs because we know that the problems are very unique. There are so many similarities, but at the same time, there are so many differences. So the question is how to be helpful, right? That\u2019s why we have set up local Mini Labs where essentially all kinds of stakeholders from a particular region are represented and the focus is on local civil society engagement,\u201d \u2013 B\u0142achowicz comments. The Mini Labs will involve various stakeholders such as city authorities, mining unions, businesses, academia, NGOs and activists to get a wide range of viewpoints and approaches to the transition and help to strengthen understanding of the common challenges, goals and trust within these communities. \u201cEurope has a historical debt with coal regions. For generations, these communities have been working hard to provide us with raw materials and energy, developing our economies and keeping our homes warm. Once again, we are asking them to make a great effort to transform, and we are aware that in some places people are extremely tired of being interviewed or invited to workshops which end up with just advisory papers. They might have provided lots of valuable analysis but do not immediately transform into concrete solutions to the challenges. Following those, more practical steps are needed. Therefore, we build on what has already happened, listen to the stakeholders in the regions, and co-design Mini Labs with them, as transformation accelerators.\u201d \u2013 Skubida adds Mini Labs will enable designing experiments that are about trying out and observing how the implementation of different support schemes or the implementation of different innovation activities work in a particular place. It\u2019s about testing how to implement something that should work perfectly in theory but does not work in practice, because of the context. \u201cAn innovation activity might be about designing green bonds and testing the assumptions you put into the design. Whether the solutions you apply in that system actually work well. Are people using the bonds, or are they buying them? It can also be about setting up a citizen lab, for example. That would be an experiment in a place where there has never been a tool for citizens to speak up. This experiment can also be about the design of an innovative solution. So you don\u2019t have to experiment on the implementation. You can experiment with how to design something that is user-driven and user-friendly and addresses the just part of the transition,\u201d \u2013 Brussa comments on experimentation. One of the main ideas behind the Post Coal Future Lab was to create a safe space where stakeholders can talk openly about barriers to transformation, and their failures and share stories about what has turned out to be a success. Anna Brussa emphasises that it will be the people that will run the Post Coal Future Lab: \u201cWe are just building space for them, trying to inspire them, and inviting them to do the work themselves. We are only helping with offering them different tools to connect and put the puzzle pieces together because that\u2019s the best way forward for people in the region to actually shape their future.\u201d Learn more about how EIT Climate-KIC is supporting the most ambitious challenge owners to reach near-impossible climate targets by visiting our COP27 landing page.", "eit225": "EIT Health-supported start-up Leuko has closed a Series A funding of EUR 5 million. The new funding will be used to accelerate clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval in collaboration with leading cancer centres, including Boston Medical Center and MD Anderson in the USA, and Dexeus and Hospital 12 de Octubre in Europe. Leuko is developing PointCheckTM, the first solution that enables at-home non-invasive white blood cell (WBC) monitoring. Low WBC levels is one of the most common as well as most devastating and costliest side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Clinical data indicates that as many as one out of every six chemotherapy patients suffer life-threatening infections and hospital readmissions directly linked to low WBCs. At Leuko, we are working on a solution to help patients and providers prevent these hospital readmissions and improve clinical outcomes, by remotely monitoring WBC levels before infections ensue. Leuko co-founder and CEO Dr. Carlos Castro-Gonzalez Leuko\u2019s solution, PointCheckTM, is a device that\u2019s connected to the internet which patients simply place their finger on for one minute a day. The device measures WBC levels without the need to draw a blood sample.

CHANGE Award: Anna Vanderbruggen, a researcher who works for the start-up Erzlabor, won first place for developing a revolutionary new way to extract graphite from lithium-ion batteries. Her method, the first of its kind, separates the fine powder from crushed lithium-ion batteries in order to obtain two valuable products instead of one. This process enables the efficient and highly-selective recycling of both graphite and metals from used lithium-ion batteries. It could lead to a truly circular battery supply chain and decrease the environmental footprint of battery production as well as reliance on raw material imports from outside the EU. Innovators Award: Bernhard Adler took the top prize for his rotation heat pump, a highly innovative clean technology that combines the advantages of heat pump technology with a centrifuge. It will help speed up the energy transition by providing cleaner, low-carbon industrial heat. Venture Award: Christoph Berger was awarded first place for developing the Vilisto system, a self-learning thermostat that improves energy efficiency in non-residential buildings. In offices and educational institutions, many rooms are unused 80% of the time yet are heated non-stop since usage patterns are not usually taken into account. Vilisto can help companies and municipalities save up to 32% of their heat consumption and reduce their CO2 emissions. Women Leadership Award: Catherine Schreiber, CEO and co-founder of ADVITOS, won first place for developing a 4-in-1 organ support therapy for critically-ill patients. Together with Dr Bernhard Kreymann, her co-founder, she created the device from scratch, launching it from an idea to an EU market-approved (CE mark) product. She now runs a fully-certified MedTech company with 70 employees that boasts numerous awards. Public Award: Sabrina Maria Malpede, co-founder and Managing Director of ACT Blade Ltd, which develops the lightest, most controllable and sustainable wind turbine blade on the market. The ACR Blade is a big technological step forward in the ability to harness wind power and exploit aeroelastic science and expertise. It was awarded an EIT InnoEnergy innovation project grant in 2018 to develop the first full scale blade.

GDI\u2019s proven, patented technology uses a unique, 100% silicon anode design, which allows for >30% greater energy density for advanced Li-ion batteries, and for safe and reliable fast charging from 10-75% in 15 minutes. With the technology initially developed in the US, the USD 13.3 million Series A funding adds to USD 3M in government funding from the US Army Research Labs, a Phase II SBIR from the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency. Now, GDI has established European pilot production in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, with 300kWh production capacity expected to be online by the end of 2022, making GDI a world leader in production capacity of 100% silicon anodes. With this fresh injection of funding and planned strategic partnerships, GDI expects to scale production to over 100MWh by Q1 2024. The significance of 100% silicon Silicon is unique in that it can store vast amounts of Li-ions at rapid speeds, enabling sub 15-minute charging speeds and EVs with over 500 miles of range. Leading OEMs are only able to use a small amount of silicon (<10%) today, and their technical roadmaps target to use much more. GDI is the first company to overcome three key silicon problems that occur when using large amounts of silicon in the anode: Limited cycle-life from silicon expansion/contraction and delamination, Safety issues of silicon powder with too much surface area as well as lithium dendrites forming at low temperatures and/or fast charging, Unscalable or prohibitively expensive manufacturing. GDI has over 10 US patents and over 25 pending patents globally, in various stages. The company has demonstrated its anode\u2019s superior performance by testing multi-layered pouch cells that can charge from 10-75% state of charge in just 15 minutes over 600 times in a row without plating lithium or failing, without added compression or added lithium as competitors require. Crucially, the technology is scalable, and GDI is making anodes on industrial solar and glass manufacturing equipment that is in use worldwide at volumes of millions of square meters per year. \u201cThe future of Li-ion anodes is silicon. GDI is achieving three critical objectives; full substitution of silicon for graphite/carbon in Li-ion batteries, using a massively scalable domestic manufacturing method, and achieving industrial relevant cost to performance targets.\u201d Robert Anstey, Founder and CEO of GDI \u201cThis funding will help GDI move to the forefront of the high-performance battery market, as advanced silicon anodes accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and improve performance of electronic products worldwide with faster charging times, greater energy density and enhanced safety\u201d said Josh Grehan, Principal at Helios Climate Ventures. \u201cGDI\u2019s ability to seamlessly integrate into existing lithium battery architecture and production lines offer significant cost and time-to-market advantages. But, equally important, the use of a silicon anode reduces the dependency of traditional imported materials like graphite, making the European battery value chain more resilient as well as increasing domestic content,\u201d says Roel van Diepen, Investment Director at EIT InnoEnergy, the innovation engine for sustainable energy supported by the European Institute of Innovation & Technology, a body of the European Union (EU).", "eit235": "The Polish Alternative Fuels Association (PSPA) and EIT InnoEnergy will work together to develop and implement a national training program tailored to the needs and capabilities of the growing battery sector. During the New Mobility Congress in Lodz, EIT InnoEnergy and the Polish Alternative Fuels Association signed an agreement to establish the EBA Academy Poland, which will aim to train future experts in the battery sector in Poland. EBA Academy Poland The European Battery Alliance (EBA) Academy is a program aimed at upgrading the skills of employees working in the energy storage industry and related industries. The launch of the program will help fill existing skills gaps. The program was initiated by EIT InnoEnergy as part of the European Battery Alliance, which brings together more than 700 partners across the value chain - from raw material extraction to recycling. Currently, the EBA Academy is already operating in several European Union countries, such as France, Spain and Germany. In addition, a cooperation agreement was signed last year with the Hungarian government, and this year, with the Romanian government. Vice President of the European Commission Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d also mentioned the crucial need to raise the competencies of Polish employees for the development of the battery sector through the EBA Academy in his opening speech on the second day of the congress. \u201cPoland currently ranks first in Europe and fifth in the world in terms of lithium-ion cell production. We are surpassed only by China, South Korea, the US and Japan. Numerous related components are or will also be manufactured in our country, including electrolyte, copper foil, separators, cathodes, and whole traction batteries for electric vehicles, among others. The factories previously in operation are attracting further investment. However, other countries are also developing their potential, so if Poland wants to maintain its leading position in this - key area for new mobility - it must have qualified personnel. PSPA became involved in the EBA Academy Poland project to meet the expectations of potential investors. We believe that this is an initiative that will contribute to strengthening the domestic value chain of the battery sector,\u201d Maciej Mazur, Managing Director of the Polish Alternative Fuels Association Educational service offering The development of the energy storage sector in Poland will mean an increasing demand for skilled workers in the areas of battery design, manufacturing, development, or testing. The EBA Academy combines the substantive knowledge and practical experience of researchers, entrepreneurs, companies, thought leaders and key players from many countries in one comprehensive educational service offering. EIT InnoEnergy, as one of the world's largest investors in sustainable energy innovation, was tasked by the European Commission to create the EBA Academy in cooperation with member countries. The prepared educational program aimed at upgrading and re-skilling the workforce meets the industry's current and future challenges, and includes online learning modules, classroom training and laboratories. \u201cEBA Academy will play a key role in the rapid development of the European battery value chain and the electrification of the automotive sector. The risk of a lack of adequate and highly skilled workforce could result in millions of euros in losses due to delays in starting production,\u201d Diego Pavia, CEO of EIT InnoEnergy", "eit236": "The innovation community being celebrated with this year\u2019s INNOVEIT is working hard to bring about a future that\u2019s green, healthy, and meets valuable social needs.

David Sch\u00f6n: We at VePa Vertical Parking work to reduce the total number of private cars, and we do that by building up a vertical parking system which can store and charge all kinds of mobility and increase the supply of emission-free cars and cargo bikes, scooters, and the like. EIT: How does VePa contribute to achieving sustainability and climate targets? David Sch\u00f6n: We contribute to achieving climate targets by stopping the industry from building underground garages in the first place because they are very bad for the environment, and they cannot be built back. We did the calculation, and we need 98% less CO2 emissions per parking spot compared to an underground garage \u2014 that\u2019s point 1. And the second point is to reduce the total number of private cars and to help people switch to emission-free shared mobility. EIT: During the development of your vertical parking tower, you also placed emphasis on user-friendliness and aesthetics, requirements usually not associated with parking. Why are architectural aesthetics important for a parking tower? David Sch\u00f6n: Aesthetics are important for our parking tower because it\u2019s a tower! So, it\u2019s a structure that\u2019s 10-15 metres high in the city and we have so many beautiful cities, especially all over Europe. And I think we really have to blend into these cities and not have solitaires where people say \u201cOkay, that looks weird,\u201d but really blend in and be functional with our towers and that\u2019s where we have a strong emphasis. EIT: In the next few decades, autonomous vehicles and car sharing will become more prevalent in our everyday lives. How do you see the future of driving and parking? David Sch\u00f6n: I see the future of driving and parking changing drastically. I think one point will be software. So, in the next decade, we have to really use the parking spaces in underground garages and big parklets with software so people can use the free spots everywhere in the city. And then we\u2019ll have to change to autonomous driving where we won\u2019t own a private car, probably, as an individual at least, and parking will not be a part of what the user feels. It will happen in the back end more or less, and then we have to be really space-efficient, and we have to charge while parking those cars. \"We applied to the programme, and we are super proud to be part of it. And we had a lot of benefits.\" EIT: VePa joined EIT Urban Mobility\u2019s accelerator programme in 2021. How did you hear about the EIT? How did EIT Urban Mobility help with finding customers, partners, or investors? And how did it further develop your venture? David Sch\u00f6n: Yeah, that\u2019s a good point regarding how we connected with EIT. As you said correctly, we were part of the Urban Mobility incubator during the summer last year. And the connection was made via UnternehmerTUM. Simon Herzog worked for both entities and played a big role in that. We applied to the programme, and we are super proud to be part of it. And we had a lot of benefits. So first we were part of the Munich Urban Colab where we had access to the industry, to investors, to everything which was important in that phase of our venture. And, of course, we took trips to Barcelona, to Cologne. Johannes Kirschner played a huge role in the EIT because he made so many introductions and helped us to really gain some traction. EIT: What are you looking forward to during the INNOVEIT Berlin event? David Sch\u00f6n: I think, in the first place, telling more people about VePA and how we really changed mobility in cities of the future but also to hear about other great ideas and get more feedback and see what\u2019s happening in the world in the space of mobility and New Bauhaus and aesthetics in cities so we can take this back to our development team and say \u201cOkay, hey, the users or potential customers want this from us and we have to develop it in a certain way.\u201d I think this feedback loop is very important for us.

EIT Manufacturing and P\u00f4le MecaTech will collaborate more intensely in the future, just having agreed on a network partnership. Rooted in a region with amazing innovation potential, P\u00f4le MecaTech will gain access to a wider European network while EIT Manufacturing will deepen their ties with a well-connected cluster in the Walloon region. The first talks were triggered after a meeting at Global Industry fair in Lyon in 2021. Thibaud van Rooden, International Affairs Executive at P\u00f4le MecaTech, and Amardeep Banerjee, Innovation Manager at EIT Manufacturing soon discovered that there are obvious synergies between the ecosystems, especially in the support activities that P\u00f4le MecaTech and EIT Manufacturing offers to SMEs. \u201cEIT Manufacturing develops support tools for companies and entrepreneurs at European level, P\u00f4le MecaTech has a strong reach among its regional ecosystem,\u201d explains Thibaud van Rooden. \u201cEIT Manufacturing can open doors to reference players in manufacturing \u2013 whether they are leading companies or well-renowned research entities, of which there are several in the EIT Manufacturing community.\u201d Tibaud van Rooden International Affairs Executive at P\u00f4le MecaTech \u201cWhen it comes to turning innovation into a marketable product or service, there are two key points: funding and the right partners\u201d, says Amardeep Banerjee. \u201cThe composition of a consortium can decide whether an innovation will live or die, and the funding is necessary to minimise risks for the parties involved. For Walloon players interested in collaborative innovation projects the EIT Manufacturing calls offer an additional entry point beside the P\u00f4le MecaTech funding opportunities.\u201d Amardeep Banerjee Innovation Manager at EIT Manufacturing The collaboration started to intensify from January 2022 with joint communication and articles in January 2022 and developed gradually into proper collaboration agreement. P\u00f4le MecaTech members were presented the EIT Manufacturing Call for Proposal 2023 and both networks scouted partners for consortia in construction actively, so that some collaborations are already ongoing between the ecosystems. As a result of the collaboration agreement, these ties will become stronger and exchange more active. Both organisations will jointly participate in the BEPA battery meeting in Brussels, Belgium 13 September, World Manufacturing Forum Franciacorta, Italy 24-25 November, and the Circular Wallonia days in Belgium 16-18 November.

The EIT RIS is an EIT instrument dedicated to tackling Europe\u2019s persistent innovation divide. By connecting regional actors, innovators, and partners to Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem, the EIT RIS strengthens the innovation capacity of ecosystems in low-innovation performance countries and paves the way for synergies between new networks and local and regional smart specialisation strategies. The EIT RIS is also aimed at attracting and integrating additional participants from the eligible geographical area into the EIT Community\u2019s activities. A network of over 90 EIT RIS Hubs present in all EU Member States and beyond drive the successful implementation of the EIT RIS. The EIT RIS Hubs have helped the EIT Community to significantly widen its geographical spread. Over 1 300 organisations from the EIT RIS countries have become partners of EIT Innovation Communities while some 2 500 start-up teams from eligible countries were coached and prepared to enter accelerators. Building on this success, the EIT will now shift focus towards strengthening local-level synergies and ensuring the presence of the EIT Community in every EIT RIS-eligible country and territory by the end of 2025. The first EIT Community RIS Hubs will be launched as pilots, in Latvia and North Macedonia, by the end of 2022. EIT Community RIS Hubs will differ from the current RIS Hubs by serving as a one-stop-shop for local innovators, partners and interested parties in discovering the whole EIT Community. Through these Hubs, local innovators will be provided with a centralised source of information on all services and opportunities provided by the entire EIT Community, both locally and more widely. They will serve as a gateway to all EIT Innovation Communities, attracting and engaging an increasing number of participants into EIT Community activities. The Hubs will additionally spearhead the EIT Community\u2019s engagement with local authorities, including providing policy support and expertise as required. Where an on-the-ground EIT Community presence already exists, the EIT Community RIS Hubs will consolidate and scale-up ongoing activities and may also implement Joint Innovation Community activities tailored to the local needs. Each hub will be managed by a National Secretary, selected via an Open Call, whose tasks will include: setting up and maintaining a physical space where stakeholders can walk-in to obtain information on the EIT Community; managing the EIT Community Hub\u2019s website, in the local language, with information on EIT Community activities and opportunities; and; facilitating the organisation of EIT Community awareness-raising events locally. To support the establishment of the new EIT Community RIS Hubs, the EIT has published a set of Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles for the EIT RIS Hubs which will additionally serve as a common strategic approach, underpinning the establishment and operation of all EIT RIS Hubs from 2023. Since the launch of the EIT RIS in 2014, EIT RIS Hubs have emerged as the backbone of the Scheme\u2019s \u201cplace-based\u201d approach. The establishment of this new network of centralised Hubs will serve an important role in the European Commission\u2019s, New Innovation Agenda, contributing to the key objective of accelerating and strengthening innovation in European Innovation Ecosystems across the EU and addressing the innovation divide.", "eit239": "The EU is advancing its efforts to establish an AI ecosystem of excellence. One pillar of this strategy is the creation of an AI on-demand repository of experts, tools, and services that are supported by a set of distributed platforms. These platforms shall serve as a resource for the research community to support the European AI model based on the principles of Trustworthy AI. Until the end of 2025, the project AIforEurope will support and facilitate a sustainable digital platform and experimentation environment through the creation of open research channels and mechanisms that foster the European academic and industrial AI research ecosystem, maximise its academic, social, and industrial impact, and seamlessly integrates other projects, platforms, and solutions. The platform will showcase state-of-the-art science being developed by leading AI research centres and laboratories, tackling topics including Human Centered AI, Explainable AI, AI for Good etc. Particular focus will be given to the trustworthiness of resources and the ethical design of hosted AI tools. The platform thereby provides an ecosystem of trust within which public bodies and companies can uptake the assets produced by researchers. The consortium, led by University College Cork, has secured EUR 9 million from the European Union for AIforEurope. With its ecosystem of more than 300 top European academic institutions, corporates, and RTOs, EIT Digital will focus on supporting governance processes, sustainability and participatory engagement in the project.", "eit240": "Exchange between representatives of atim, the Advanced Technology in Manufacturing Cluster in Ireland, and of EIT Manufacturing has been lively from the start \u2013 now the two have agreed on collaborating more regularly and EIT Manufacturing is pleased to welcome atim as a new network partner.

EIT Manufacturing adds the European dimension to these activities. SMEs face particular challenges when it comes to transitioning to green and digital solutions or embedding cutting-edge technologies and processes. They may lack the infrastructure as well as know-how in certain areas. The atim cluster fosters a culture of openness amongst companies, knowledge providers and stakeholders in the region and seeks to spark new ways of learning and collaborating with one another on cluster projects to address their challenges in a dynamic way.", "eit241": "Between 2014 and 2021, EIT\u2019s Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) has supported close to 2500 start-ups, scale-ups, and spin-offs in European countries where the pace of innovation is considered less speedy. Support of ventures under the scheme continues to grow at an impressive rate. The EIT Community notes an average increase of around 40% in the number of ventures that it supports in RIS regions each year. EIT RIS helps transform innovative ideas into marketable products and create positive socioeconomic change. The programme was launched in 2014 to advance the innovation performance of countries in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe classed as moderate and emerging innovators according to the European Innovation Scoreboard. It also aims to minimise innovation disparities among the regions of the European Union and its neighbourhood. The scheme has been applied to several industries, including healthcare, to nurture entrepreneurial talents and support new and early-stage ideas. It supports the entire value chain \u2013 from student to entrepreneur, from concept to product, and from lab to customer. The scheme also helps scale-up successful start-ups, build innovation consortia, and launch products and solutions that can tackle some of the most pressing global challenges. Since its launch, the EIT RIS has helped to expand innovation-fostering activities across Europe, transforming innovation ecosystems in countries and regions where support is needed the most. By the end of 2021, the EIT Community had successfully set up 90 EIT RIS Hubs in all EU Member States and beyond. Since 2014, the EIT Community has channelled EUR 613 million, or 31.5% of the total EIT grant, to entities in countries eligible for the EIT RIS. During this same period, the EIT-supported start-up ecosystem based in the countries eligible for the EIT RIS attracted more than EUR 2.4 billion in investment. The EIT Community involved more than 9000 participants in different EIT RIS programmes.

Women are under-represented in research and innovation careers, with female-led start-ups facing obstacles such as structural discrimination and access to capital. In a world of diverse needs and perspectives, women bring distinctive leadership qualities, social change capabilities and entrepreneurial skills that are essential to innovation. EIT Climate-KIC sees investing in female entrepreneurship as an opportunity to accelerate an inclusive, green transition. This month kicks off our \u201cGender Mainstreaming for Entrepreneurship Programme,\u201d designed to provide gender-equal climate entrepreneurial training for women entrepreneurs. The term \u2018gender mainstreaming\u2019 is used to describe the process of integrating a gender lens into all aspects of an organisation\u2019s strategies and initiatives. Grants from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland (\u2018Irish Aid\u2019) will enable five EIT Climate-KIC partners in the Global South to implement pilot initiatives that support women entrepreneurs from September 2022 to May 2023. These organisations intend to carry out a holistic transformation of their entrepreneurship programmes by conducting a needs assessment to understand how to better serve and support female leaders. EIT Climate-KIC aims to provide equal opportunities for all genders throughout its programmes with the goal of triggering a systematic change on gender across the climate innovation sector. To ensure this transformation, the selected entrepreneurship support organisations will use the WeClim Equally gender-smart handbook as a guide for integrating a gender perspective into their pilot programmes. In practice, this includes applying gender balance when working with course participants, panels or reviewers as well as applying participatory, inclusive practices at work, in workshops or trainings. The Handbook offers a step-by-step guide to help incubators and accelerators attract and support women-led innovations and initiatives through the full lifecycle of business development. \u201cInclusivity is key in our efforts to tackle climate change and the organisations selected to deliver gender mainstreaming projects are committed to gender-smart programme design, increasing the number of women participants and inclusive financing, which should have lasting benefits for thousands of women working to innovate for the climate,\u201d explains Aimee Apel, Gender Mainstreaming Lead at EIT Climate-KIC. The Pilot Projects Westerwelle Foundation (Tanzania) will launch a two-month online and offline educational campaign targeted at 2,000 Tanzanians to build awareness of how companies and individuals can act against climate change. In addition, the organisation will select 10 of the most promising female-led start-up teams to participate in a six-month \u201cAfroGreen Accelerator\u201d with monthly workshops, expert sessions with ecosystem partners and peer-mentoring events. The programme will culminate in a Demo Day with key climate players from the local ecosystem to build networks and strengthen collaborations to tackle climate change and amplify the impact of the start-ups. Cleantech Hub Colombia (Bogota) aims to help climate entrepreneurs, their clients, stakeholders and (indirect) beneficiaries to recognise gender gaps, identify gender-mainstreaming opportunities and become \u201cgender responsive\u201d in their communications. The organisation will develop a gender protocol, policy and procedures and test the materials with the 2023 cohort of 20 entrepreneurs participating in the \u201cInclusive Climate Entrepreneurship Program.\u201d \u201cWe want to deliver a long-term impact together, with our partners, to the climate entrepreneurship ecosystem in Colombia. We want to go beyond inclusivity or gender mainstreaming as a \u2018filter\u2019 or \u2018check the box\u2019 in our programs,\u201d said Gideon Blaauw, Colombia Lead, Cleantech Hub. Love in Action International (Uganda) plans to operate a revolving fund to increase access to climate innovation financing for women, offering workshops in marketing and financial literacy to 10 women and youth groups, as well as facilitating connections with them and other existing financial actors. The grant money will also be used to train the following: five staff and 20 instructors and coaches in gender-responsive programming, women and youth entrepreneurs in gender-smart entrepreneurship and jury members in gender-inclusive climate innovation. Center for Creativity and Sustainability Study and Consultancy (Vietnam) aims to raise gender awareness and integrate gender inclusion in the ClimateLaunchpad programme, a global green business competition powered by EIT Climate-KIC. The organisation will provide gender-bias training to teams, external coaches and jury members and pilot a gender-inclusive ClimateLaunchpad that lays the foundation for future programmes. The documentation of the learning and outcomes will serve as a guide for how to gender mainstream successful businesses founded by men and women entrepreneurs alike. Anza (Tanzania) will conduct research through focus groups and interviews with female entrepreneurs to better understand the current barriers they face. From the results, the organisation will adopt a new marketing and communications strategy to attract the most qualified female candidates. In addition, Anza will recruit 10 women entrepreneurs engaged in climate change mitigation for its three-month \u201cInvestment Readiness Accelerator\u201d and will compare application rates from previous years to assess the impact of implementing a gender-inclusive approach. Additionally, the programme will fund a gender-smart expert to onboard a new EIT Climate-KIC partner, Impact Hub Medellin from Colombia.

The tests are currently used to determine the genetic risk of four types of cancer: breast, prostate, colon cancer, and skin melanoma. Antegenes team has been working for several years to help people identify and prevent some of the most difficult chronic conditions all of us are potentially subject to during our lifetime. Of course, one must overcome enormous challenges to realise such a vision, and we want to support the team as it tackles them. It takes many years to build a great business \u2013 and similarly, create a lasting health change \u2013 and we believe the current milestone boosts the Antegenes team to take some exciting steps towards their future. Timo Rein, co-founder of Pipedrive Antegenes raised EUR 1.6 million from investors in a seed round led by Pipedrive co-founder Timo Rein, Pipedrive\u2019s first investor Peep Vain and entrepreneurs Aare Kurist and Andreas Henn Otsmaa. In addition, other Estonian investors and entrepreneurs participated in the round. The financing round was advised by investment banking company Keystone Advisers and law firm Sorainen. The investments make it possible to bring personalised cancer prevention into wider use in healthcare, including in new markets. In addition to Estonia and the United Kingdom, we have started operations in Sweden, Norway, Portugal, and Spain. In the coming months, we will also enter the German market. To reduce cancer deaths, the genetic predisposition of cancer should be analysed for all people, and our vision is to implement this internationally with our partners. The current investment round is significant for our growth and next steps. We are glad that investors share our vision of the future of healthcare. Dr Peeter Padrik, founder and CEO of Antegenes In addition, Antegenes has received two grants to bring research-intensive innovation to international healthcare. The first is the BRIGHT project, financed with EUR 2.28 million by EIT Health, of which EUR 500 000 is a grant to Antegenes.

The Slovenian government is kickstarting this unprecedented shift by participating in Deep Demonstrations, led by EIT Climate-KIC. Multiple Slovenian ministries and local stakeholders from businesses, industry, research institutions, and local communities are taking an active role in the process, learning from each other and working together to become fully circular. Slovenia may be one of the smallest European countries, but their ambition to fight the climate crisis is inspiring. Circularity is one of the key elements of a sustainable global future and the Slovenian government has decided to take radical steps to make it central to their economy. Thanks to its unique features, this Mediterranean country can serve as a testbed for climate innovations that can be scaled in other locations. In November 2021, the Slovenian government signed an agreement with EIT Climate-KIC to participate in the Deep Demonstrations of Circular, Regenerative Economies, a programme that aims to introduce circularity by activating a coordinated portfolio of innovation actions in key economic sectors and selected value chains. Since then, the Slovenian government has articulated its vision of \u201cSlovenia as a European leader in harnessing circularity to transform and decarbonise its economy while fostering a green economy and designing and promoting the smart and circular transition of local communities through a coordinated and coherent national approach based on local needs and international best practice\u201d. Slovenia has taken on an unprecedented challenge of coming to the fore in Europe\u2019s fight against climate change. The country has decided not only to introduce the principles of circular economy, but also to adopt a systems approach. Transforming a system requires knowledge, capabilities and capacity. To reach circularity by mid-century will also involve critical structural and exponential changes that must occur both rapidly and simultaneously on multiple fronts. So now is the time to step out of our comfort zone and start sharing our best practices, break down the silos and amplify our successes to deliver this ground-breaking change. Bart Stegeman, Slovenian Orchestrator of the Circular Economy and Value Chains Transformation at EIT Climate-KIC The Deep Demonstration process in Slovenia applies a cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary approach to work across boundaries, silos and departments to build partnerships with a range of stakeholders (from local communities and businesses to academic institutions and policymakers) and focuses on creating an accessible, open platform for knowledge transfer. A portfolio approach to transform the entire system The three-and-a-half year project has two phases, running firstly from November 2021 to June 2022 and subsequently until June 2025. The first phase was aimed at establishing relationships with local stakeholders and identifying their needs. The objective was to move away from incremental solutions and to create and implement a portfolio of strategic, coordinated innovative interventions that will have a strategic impact on the entire Slovenian economy. The Slovenian government and a variety of stakeholders started by collectively mapping their activities in the climate context. EIT Climate-KIC facilitated a series of activities such as training and capacity building sessions on circular economy for policymakers and capacity building workshops on systems innovation and circularity topics. Challenge owners (governments, local authorities, city mayors) had the opportunity to learn practitioner perspectives through case studies from other countries or organisations facing similar challenges to spark inspiration and new insights. The participants identified food, forestry, mobility, construction, and manufacturing as five key supply chains that can be simultaneously transformed from three overarching dimensions: Entrepreneurship, Policy and Education. The goal is to impact all five value chains in these three dimensions one by one to achieve real transformative change across the whole system. The process includes sensemaking and constant feedback loops, which help the next stages and enable future replication to other European locations and contexts. Another key element of the project is to find a balance between addressing the concrete and actual needs of ministries while focusing on the longer-term climate challenges that might not be visible yet, but will impact the citizens in the future. Transformative pillars to accelerate systems transformation The Deep Demonstration focuses on systems innovation and creating a portfolio of interventions that will serve as a vehicle to drive Slovenia\u2019s national transformation to a circular economy. Using the research and stakeholder input from the first phase, in the second phase of the project, these portfolios will be created sequentially for each area (i.e., a selected value chain or sector) to focus initially on a smaller portfolio before being combined into an overall portfolio of interventions. The Slovenian government, together with EIT Climate-KIC will work on a portfolio that consists of: Enhancing capacity building in systems innovation and circularity thinking to build a deeper systems mindset across a spectrum of stakeholders and further develop knowledge of systems innovation practice. to build a deeper systems mindset across a spectrum of stakeholders and further develop knowledge of systems innovation practice. Developing a Policy Lab to enable policy experimentation and pilot innovation actions in the public sector. The Lab will aim to create a \u2018sandbox\u2019 environment where policymakers and stakeholders can collaboratively design, prototype and test innovative policies to promote the transition to a smart, circular and low-carbon economy and society.

Supporting research and academic institutions in the transition to a circular economy , as they are vehicles for knowledge transfer in society. The Deep Demonstration team is working with the Ministry of Higher Education and Science jointly with all Slovenian universities to create action plans for new strategies to incorporate the systems innovation and portfolio approach and the use of sensemaking tools to create shared knowledge. The goals are to make the circular economy and sustainability topics more visible in curricula, to encourage collaboration between different higher education institutions on climate-related projects, to manage circular knowledge between science, higher education, public institutions and the business sector to cover innovation capacity and competence building in climate-related areas and to encourage experimental projects in both higher education and science. , as they are vehicles for knowledge transfer in society.

Developing a funding strategy and investment plan to unlock the potential of portfolio activation. With a balanced financial architecture, multiple funding mechanisms could be integrated into the portfolio to accelerate the outcomes. Combining these interventions into a portfolio helps identify and understand interdependencies, causes and effects, unexpected consequences, obstacles and barriers to transformation, potential multipliers, change dynamics and ways to scale. Learning and decision making then take place at each level of the portfolio and across levels. For more information, read this interview with Bart Stegeman.

Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, congratulated the selected cities and stressed that they are at the forefront of climate action in Europe and that the European Commission will support them in this challenge. The meeting was attended by representatives of the selected cities, representatives of the NetZero Cities consortium, as well as members of the European Commission. \u201cCities are at the heart of our fight against the climate crisis. Greening open spaces, tackling air pollution, reducing energy consumption in buildings, advancing clean transport \u2013 there are so many ways cities are the hubs of innovation we need for this transition. We also need to ensure that this is a just transition. It will be just or there will be no transition. The Cities Mission is hugely important for the just transition and the European Green Deal because it will demonstrate that a fair transition to climate neutrality is possible,\u201d said Timmermans. 377 cities from all 27 European Union countries applied to be part of the Mission. The European Commission selected 100 EU cities, representing represent 12 per cent of the EU population, as well as an additional 12 cities from countries associated with Horizon Europe (2021-2027). The cities selected for this Mission will be fully supported by the NetZeroCities programme led by EIT Climate-KIC and will receive EUR 360 million of Horizon Europe funding from 2022 to 2023, to embark on innovation pathways towards climate neutrality.

It also provides an opportunity to share best practices to build joint initiatives and expand collaboration with other EU programmes, which is one of the key aspects of addressing this challenge, according to Dr. Kirsten Dunlop, CEO of EIT Climate-KIC: \u201cThe mission is not just about the \u2018what\u2019, but also the \u2018how\u2019. It\u2019s about solid, thoughtful collaboration. It\u2019s about bringing together departments, budgets, ministries, colleagues and those who don\u2019t normally come together around the same table, bridge silos and sectors where combinations happen because people begin to see the possibilities. 2030 is a number that we have told ourselves matters and what matters about that number is not the actual number. What matters is that we try. And that in this space of possibility every ground we gain, every inch, every heart, and every person who comes to the table with a different spirit to do something together is a triumph. Because the power of imagination, the power of collective effort and the power of learning from each other really give us something that is a dynamic system of actions and that has power.\u201d The event also featured a presentation of the NetZeroCities Climate City Contracts, which will be developed with local stakeholders and signed and implemented by each participating city. The Contracts include plans for the city to achieve climate neutrality, as well as an investment plan.

Innovation shapes markets, transforms economies, stimulates changes in the quality of public services and is indispensable in creating solutions to the most pressing global challenges. The European Commission unveiled the New European Innovation Agenda on 5 July, 2022 set to make Europe a global innovation leader. The EIT as Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem, with its far-reaching network and decade of experience has a big role to play in the flagship strategy. The New European Innovation Agenda leverages the many talents and skills Europe already possesses while focusing on the importance of harnessing a new wave of innovation on its way: deep tech. Deep tech is rooted in cutting edge science, technology and engineering, often combining advances in the physical, biological and digital spheres. The deep tech innovations that are emerging from a growing cohort of innovative start-ups in the EU have the potential to drive innovation across the economy and society. They have the power to transform the EU\u2019s business landscape and associated markets and help address the most pressing societal challenges, including achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Building on this transformative power, the New European Innovation Agenda will launch five flagship actions: Flagship #1: Funding for deep tech scale-ups Flagship #2: Enabling deep tech innovation through experimentation spaces and public procurement Flagship #3: Accelerating and strengthening innovation in European Innovation Ecosystems across the EU and addressing the innovation divide Flagship #4: Fostering, attracting and retaining deep tech talents Flagship:#5: Improving policy making tools EIT Community Support The EIT\u2019s mission is to drive innovation forward, thanks to its unique approach \u2013 building sustainable innovation ecosystems through Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) \u2013 the EIT boasts Europe\u2019s largest innovation network, and has proven success in identifying and nurturing start-ups and innovators at all stages of their innovation journey. The EIT Community, with its 3 000 partners and 80 innovation hubs across Europe, have supported thousands of start-ups including deep-tech innovations that have gone on to become global leaders in the field, such as Swedish Northvolt (EIT InnoEnergy) manufacturing the world\u2019s greenest battery. The EIT will support the five flagships of the New European Innovation Agenda and continue its work in carving out a more inclusive innovation landscape by offering targeted support to female-led ventures and entrepreneurs. This includes supporting women leading deep-tech innovations and connecting the European Innovation Council\u2019s Women Leadership Programme to the EIT network. Programmes such as the EIT\u2019s SuperNova with its four core activities will also further support efforts to increase diversity by helping investors connect and recruit from a more diverse pool of talent, identify new opportunities, offer mentorship and venture investment. The EIT will support Flagship #3 - Accelerating and strengthening innovation in European Innovation Ecosystems across the EU and addressing the innovation divide, by continuously expanding the EIT's Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) focused on developing innovation ecosystems in low-innovation performance regions across Europe and in linking these ecosystems to local and regional smart specialisation strategies. The EIT RIS Programme boasts over 655 organisations connected to the EIT network and dozens of regional hubs across 18 RIS-eligible countries. The EIT will also be instrumental in Flagship #4 - Fostering, attracting and retaining deep tech talents. The EIT will lead a new programme targeting 1 million deep tech talents over a 3-year period across all Member States. The institute will update and scale up its talent and skills development programmes based on the needs of deep tech fields ranging from new materials and synthetic biology to cleantech. Scale-up companies alongside other industry representatives will inform curricula and ensure that they accommodate changing labour market needs in respective technology areas. To compliment this, the European Innovation Council (EIC) and the EIT will also launch an innovation intern scheme in the third quarter of 2023, to create opportunities for over 600 researchers and EIT-labelled students and graduates to gain an innovation experience by 2024. The interns will gain work experience in successful EIC and EIT supported companies, with researcher and associated company needs informing individual internships. Support will also continue to the next generation of young entrepreneurs through the EIT Girls-Go-Circular project which due to its success so far, will be expanded to cover participants from all EU Member States equipping over 40 000 school girls with digital and entrepreneurial skills. The EIT Community is committed to taking its innovation ecosystem to the next step and will support the work of the New European Innovation Agenda in leading the new wave of deep tech innovation. Come join us and make innovation happen!", "eit260": "Bernd Sch\u00e4fer, CEO of EIT RawMaterials and spearheading the European Raw Materials Alliance, highlights the need for an overarching strategy and urgent action to secure the future of Europe\u2019s strategic raw materials sector and ensure it can deliver on the green and digital twin transition. Europe is at an epochal turning point from a raw materials perspective. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, causing shortages of a wide range of raw materials strategic to the implementation of the European Green Deal. The Ukraine war has compounded the impact on the sector\u2019s global competitiveness due to soaring energy prices. These more immediate challenges are set against a backdrop of a worrying and increasing long-term over-dependence on imports of raw materials. Europe has belatedly woken up to the fact that certain raw materials are indeed critical \u2013 critical due to their scarcity, but more increasingly due to their relevance for European sustainability and industrial leadership ambitions. Raw materials are the foundation upon which much of European industry and prosperity is founded, and without access to affordable, sustainable raw materials, the European Green Deal cannot be achieved. To illustrate some of the causes and consequences of our overdependence on imports and the danger it represents, you only need to look at the recent supply crisis in the magnesium industry and its troubling snowball effect on related sectors. Magnesium is a key alloying material for the aluminium, steel, or diecasting industry. For example, magnesium-containing aluminium is largely used in the automotive and construction industry, but also in daily products such as packaging. In the 1990s, China began to illegally dump low-cost magnesium. By 2001, the last European magnesium plant had closed and the European value chain hollowed-out. With over 93% of its demand dependent on Chinese imports today, Europe is in a position of near-complete dependency. When production in China is curtailed, Europe has no influence over escalating price increases, and it is China that decides how disruptive this will be to our manufacturers. This is exactly what happened. Due to the Chinese government\u2019s effort to curb domestic power consumption, the supply of magnesium originating from China has either been halted or reduced drastically since September 2021, resulting in an international supply crisis of unprecedented magnitude. China massively curtailed its magnesium production, and within days magnesium prices rose to levels five to seven times higher than the already expensive post Covid market prices. Industries in Europe were not only confronted with skyrocketing prices, but suddenly had no more supply at all. The issue has become increasingly important for Europe, which consumes a fifth of the global magnesium supply, since the west imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the invasion. To mitigate the impacts of the current crisis and avert future supply shortages, the European Union has launched a drive to restart domestic output of magnesium with at least three organisations working on projects. In a European Commission working document made available to Reuters in May 2022, it stated that the EU should aim to source 15% of its magnesium needs domestically by 2030. This is good news, because the potential to produce and recycle more magnesium for the energy transition is significant and untapped. The recycling potential for aluminium is also impressive. European aluminium is already a clear leader, with recycling rates of 76% for beverage cans and 90% for automotive and transport as well as building applications. This is in stark contrast to the 1% baseline that is recycled for more rare earth elements. Also, at the legislative scale, more and more progress is being made by the EU towards addressing strategic autonomy in critical raw and primary materials. The European Commission Action Plan, the establishment of the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), and the European Parliament\u2019s report on a European strategy for critical raw materials set out a series of measures that can make a significant contribution to delivering sustainable and secure raw materials for Europe. Diversifying supply, strengthening existing EU-based value chains It is important to look at the aluminium sector. One of Europe\u2019s most complete value chains in the raw materials sector today, the sector creates 1 million direct and indirect jobs and generates EUR 40 billion in annual turnover in Europe. A key component in renewable energy, batteries, electricity transmission and resource- and energy-efficient building or mobility, European aluminium is essential for the development of clean technologies and the circular economy. Thanks to its permanent properties, it is circular by nature and has a carbon footprint of only one-third of the Chinese average. It has become evident that the Green Deal cannot be delivered without a healthy and dynamic European aluminium sector, but this sector is increasingly facing an existential threat. As with magnesium, aluminium is subject to the same Chinese dominance which was enabled due to the generous state subsidies and tax exemptions. State subsidised overcapacities, under-pricing, and resource shuffling are means that China has used to erode Europe\u2019s industry for more than two decades. By no means is there reciprocity for any one of these conditions, nor for their current environmental, social and governance standards. Therefore, this situation must be addressed with great urgency, in order for a fairer level playing field to be authorised. Since 2008, Europe has lost more than 30% of its primary aluminium production, a trend that has worsened in recent months, leading to a further 900 000 tonnes of aluminium production being halted or idled between autumn 2021 and now. The increasing import-dependency on Chinese aluminium also threatens Europe\u2019s decarbonisation efforts. Europe\u2019s work on securing raw materials \u2013 from rare earths to base metals \u2013 and working towards strategic autonomy must be at the very centre of our sustainability and industrial strategy. Materials such as aluminium or magnesium are too strategically important to be left to third countries with weaker sustainability and questionable trading practices. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer, CEO of EIT RawMaterials, which manages ERMA We, as EIT RawMaterials, as well as European industry and policymakers, must continue developing a holistic, long-term, and overarching strategy that recognises the strategic importance of materials like aluminium by mobilising financing for investments to accelerate European industry now. We must ensure robust and consistent trade and industrial policies that defend and incentivise EU production and allow for long-term investments to be accelerated. Finally, we must further facilitate access to affordable green energy that is necessary for a largely energy-intensive raw materials sector. Both industry and policymakers must work together to create a level playing field between domestic and international operators if we are to reverse the damaging trend of carbon and investment leakage, and ensure that import dependency does not undermine the Green Deal. Today in Europe, we can mine underground, have state-of-the-art operations, and electrify whole supply chains. Europe is widely admired globally for its leading role in the circular economy \u2013 these factors have accelerated the great potential for the primary and secondary raw materials industry. A promising future for Europe is, therefore, well underway and well within our grasp. However, we must address these critical challenges now. Originally published on Euractiv.", "eit261": "At the 4th annual RawMaterials Summit over 60 panel sessions speakers, all leaders from policy, industry, innovation, research, NGOs and education sectors within the raw materials sector, discussed why securing raw materials is so fundamental and how to do it. The main message was clear: the acceleration towards clean energy is very fast, it is a very unusual transition needed in such a short period of time and there is no plan B. Europe will face critical shortfalls of battery materials without urgent action now. The tone in the discussions at the Summit was severe, but optimistic. Industry leaders and policymakers expressed optimism about Europe\u2019s capability to build a strong and resilient raw materials sector but warned that we cannot lose the momentum ushered in by the war in Ukraine. In the case of batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage, we will need up to 60 times more lithium, and 15 times more cobalt in 2050, compared to the current supply to the whole EU economy. Kimmo Tiilikainen, CEO of the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) The EU holds considerable geological potential to produce these essential metals and minerals. In order to unlock the mineral potential, policymakers in the Economic Union and the Member States need to take concrete actions in the industrial, research, infrastructure, regulatory, social and environmental development. Leading representatives of the mining sector highlighted the need for increased predictability and transparency of the licensing of new mining projects. If current expenditure continues, Europe will not be able to get its own mining production up and running on a timetable that would enable the green transition and climate targets to be achieved within the current target timetables. Mikael Staffas, CEO of Boliden, was one of the representatives who highlighted that permitting regulatory obstacles are what\u2019s preventing mining projects taking off in Europe. He said: What we really need is action. At the end of the day, we need to get the mines on our own ground. Mikael Staffas, CEO of Boliden Tremendous pressure from customers The RawMaterials Summit 2022, following a two year hiatus to the pandemic, filled the Berlin Convention Centre. Speaker, Jarkko Vesa, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment Finland, said the Summit sent a clear message: No one was left in any doubt that raw materials is a very hot topic right now. The Commission\u2019s message was also clear: Europe must be more self-sufficient in the production of critical metals and minerals in the future. Jarkko Vesa, Senior Adviser, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment Finland Mining is a fundamental building block of the green energy transition and now, more than ever, it\u2019s clear how critical a responsibly sourced supply of minerals and metals is for a resilient, clean and green Europe. But of course, the mining industry carries with it environmental and social concerns and future mining projects will need to be handled sensitively. Thor Bendik Weider, Chairman of REE Minerals, a rare earth mining company from Norway, said that investors, mining projects, and local and national authorities need to cooperate to speed up the permitting process. In Europe, we can mine underground, have state-of-the-art operations, and electrify the whole supply chain\u2014these can solve the old historic perspectives on the mining industry. If everyone thinks the green shift is so important, we should get going. Thor Bendik Weider, Chairman of REE Minerals The Nordic countries Finland, Sweden and Norway are mining nations and pioneering countries in sustainability. The Nordic mining industry is considered the most sustainable in the world, thanks to efficient production methods, lower emissions than the industry in comparable countries and a good working environment. Nordic and Baltic countries can give access to sustainably produced metals and minerals which are crucial for us when creating green battery value chains. Olli Salmi, Managing Director, EIT RawMaterials Baltic Sea and North Innovation Hubs Transparency and stakeholder engagement Representing WWF, Tobias Kind-Rieper, Global Lead of Mining & Metals, acknowledged Europe\u2019s need for raw materials to facilitate the green transition and the need for more mines to be built in Europe. One of the key issues with expanding mining initiatives, he said, is transparency and stakeholder engagement. Social and environmental impact assessments must be done properly to be successful, and environmental due diligence should not be seen as a risk, but rather as an opportunity. We need to find common ground, trade-offs and red lines and red flags. Tobias Kind-Rieper, Global Lead of Mining & Metals, WWF Kind-Rieper emphasised the value of know-how sharing and said that European companies can lead the way for the Global South. The overarching theme that emerged throughout the course of the discussions was the need for better communication between stakeholders. One of the resounding notes was the need for transparency, trust, and community engagement. One way to achieve this, he pointed out, was to have NGOs involved from the very beginning of any new mining projects. Although Europe has the highest standard of mining, this needs to be communicated to the public in order to change perceptions.", "eit262": "The Series A round was led by Finch Capital.

World manufacturing generates 30% of the global anthropogenic CO2e emissions i.e. 15.810 out of the 51.000 million of tonnes of CO2e per year. These emissions encompass the three Green House Gases Scope emissions in other words the direct energy, non-energy industrial process emissions and along with indirect emissions from purchased electricity. Besides, from 90\u2019s level to 2022 direct industrial emissions had a significant increase of approximately 70%. The top three emitting industries are Iron & steel, non-metallic minerals (cement, glass, lime), chemical & plastics account together for 70% of the manufacturing industry CO2 emissions. Click here to learn more! That\u2019s why, the decarbonisation of global manufacturing is pivotal to achieve this goal nevertheless what will this entail, and how will it work? Therefore, manufacturers need to serve as potent levers to resolve the numerous hindrances of the carbon conundrum and avert the climate change at its worldwide level. The Moonshot project aims to decarbonise manufacturing and meet Paris Agreement and European Union\u2019s \u2018Fit for 55\u2019, which refers to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030 and being climate neutral by 2050. The GHGs encompass carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and fluorinated gases (hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and natrium trifluoride (NF3)). Manufacturing decarbonisation means to phase out the carbon dioxide equivalent output of the atmosphere due to anthropogenic effects (Protocol & Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative 2004). Only a multi-pronged approach with a life carbon assessment of the whole manufacturing value chain can achieve decarbonisation. A focus must be determined towards the largest CO2 industry consumptions such as Iron and Steel, Chemical & Plastics and Cement. Decarbonisation will be enabled through a set of concepts such as carbon storage and capture and use (CCS or CSU), monitoring the three scopes GHG emissions to enable the awareness into CO2 emissions from direct and indirect sources as well as with the implementation of policies and social acceptance. To build low-carbon economy, sustainable and resilient manufacturing, it is pivotal to lose the reliance of fossil-fuel energies. A change of behaviour is needed to achieve a better sustainable model for instance by building industrial-urban symbiosis, circular regions and industrial clusters or communities that could be fostered to pave the transition towards a resilient future. To achieve these goals, a holistic approach is needed with many key drivers such as zero-carbon hydrogen production, circular economy, alternative materials (e.g. green steel & concrete, wood products, biofuels, etc.), carbon pricing, R&D financing, even energy efficiency standards, or even a global core of ESG-driven investors. The weight of Europe in global CO2e emissions In Europe, manufacturing sector is currently employing 32M people which is the equivalent of 16% of the EU working population whose 13 million jobs in the emerging high-tech manufacturing industry and moreover 16.1% of the EU-28 GDP share was brought by manufacturing industry in 2016 (i.e. EUR 7.11 trillion of turnover) [III][IV]. Henceforth, the manufacturing is pivotal to bring Environmental, Social and Governance sustainability to enhance the European community. In 2021, the EU-27 countries emitted 4 GtCO2e and thus account for 7% of global GHG emissions. In Europe, the manufacturing industry account for approximately 25% of the total emissions. In the last quarter of 2021, the EU emitted 1.05 GtCO2e that is slightly higher than the pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2019. Compared to the last quarter in 2020, the three European countries that emitted the most in the last quarter of 2021 were Estonia, Bulgaria and Malta with 28%, 27% and 23%, respectively.

Later, the Ona robot will travel to Hamburg (Germany) and Debrecen (Hungary). The event was attended by the Minister for Transport, Mobility and the Urban Agenda, Raquel Sanchez; the Mayoress of Esplugues de Llobregat, Pilar Diaz; the rector of the UPC, Daniel Crespo; the executive and scientific head of CARNET, Laia Pages; and the director of EIT Urban Mobility Innovation Hub South Daniel Serra, as well as different partners of the project. For the Minister of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda, Raquel Sanchez, \u201cthis is not science fiction today; it is what we will experience in our cities in the coming years.\u201d The minister highlighted the importance for Esplugues of hosting this pilot project, the result of collaboration between public administrations, universities and companies, and a fundamental axis for achieving safe, digitalised mobility that respects the planet and people\u2019s health. The autonomous vehicle is included in the objective of digitalisation and decarbonisation pursued by the Ministry. This process entails challenges already contemplated in the Sustainable Mobility Law, which will soon reach the Spanish congress. \u201cThe future is here\u201d, said the mayoress of Esplugues de Llobregat, Pilar Diaz, who highlighted that Ona \u201cis an example of putting technology at the service of problem-solving, in this case for the distribution of last-mile goods\u201d, while highlighting the \u201cecological and sustainable\u201d aspect of the initiative. This pilot demonstrates that future mobility in our cities is already a reality. The commitment of the Spanish government, the town of Esplugues de Llobregat and the Metropolitan area of Barcelona also proves that when the right actors work together, we can design the future of our cities. As facilitators of the project and founders of the largest European community transforming mobility, we are excited and honoured to see how the future is happening now. With our headquarters in Barcelona, EIT Urban Mobility emerges as the instrument of the European Union that enables the collaboration between the agents necessary to carry out this type of initiatives. In our common challenge for the decarbonisation of cities, the collaboration between public and private agents, companies, research centres and universities is essential for making the future a reality.

They are one of four winners eligible to take home the Grand Jury Award, selected by the Joint Research Centre, and featuring a prize of \u20ac10,000. The winner will be announced at the upcoming Ideathon Awards Ceremony, taking place during the New European Bauhaus Festival. The Turtle team consists of Damaris B\u00fcchner, Dimitrios Asproulis, Cindy Leticia Montano and Teresa P\u00e9rez Ciria. The team was formed during the 2021 EIT Climate-KIC Climathon in Zurich. The group didn\u2019t know each other prior to the Climathon and formed organically through the event\u2019s team-building activities and group discussions. They discovered they were all driven by making a positive impact, and bringing more circularity and sustainability to the world of fashion. The team went on to win the Climathon Jury Award. \u201cClimathon was a unique experience for us, as we met each other, worked together for 24 hours to prototype our solution and started building our network to support our project\u2019s rollout,\u201d said Dimitrios Asproulis. \u201cWe highly recommend to everyone to participate in the next Climathon event in their city, as it is truly a wonderful opportunity to learn and become active in your community. We were really impressed how the event fosters\u2014both offline and online\u2014an environment of creativity and collaboration that inspires innovative and community-based solutions to global environmental challenges that affect everyone.\u201d The idea for Turtle was the result of the group\u2019s reflection\u2014as young citizens\u2014about the sustainability challenges we are facing today, especially regarding the negative environmental impact of fast fashion such as the emissions, water use and material extraction due to increasing production, as well as the short lifespan of clothing and the resulting pollution and textile waste. According to the Ellen McArthur Foundation, every second the equivalent of a rubbish truck full of clothes is burnt or buried in a landfill. Currently, there are a number of places one can purchase second-hand clothes\u2014physical shops, online platforms, marketplaces, pop-up markets, etc. However, these options are scattered, making it more difficult and time-consuming to search through second-hand items than through mainstream fast fashion. \u201cAlthough over 60 per cent of people from our research indicate they are willing to buy more second-hand clothes, the current second-hand shopping experience is not as pleasant as that of fast fashion retail shops,\u201d said Damaris B\u00fcchner. \u201cWe identified that the main pain points for consumers are the limited inventory, low level of trust, and significant amount of time and effort needed to find what they are looking for.\u201d Turtle addresses these pain points by connecting customers with second-hand shops through a digital platform, and matching demand with supply efficiently by consolidating all the available second-hand clothing in just one place, under one transaction. The app focuses on local options to increase community connection and reduce CO2 transport costs. \u201cWe want to inspire more sustainable fashion consumption, by making local second-hand clothing more visible and accessible to everybody in an easy-to-use, smart and trustworthy way,\u201d said Cindy Leticia Montano. \u201cOur vision is that Turtle becomes synonymous with accessible and high-quality second-hand fashion, enabling a more circular and environmentally-conscious fashion paradigm.\u201d Currently, Turtle is testing its business model by attracting customers and onboarding second-hand stores in the city of Zurich in a pilot. It plans to launch in three other European cities by the end of 2022. Its goal is to expand its coverage by creating a trusted network of second-hand stores across Europe and promoting Turtle through an integrated marketing campaign in each city. Longer-term, the Turtle team would like to introduce further features to the platform, including meta-search functionality, upcycling and repairing options, as well as engage in more social events such as swap parties and sustainable fashion shows. Turtle is up for the Grand Jury Award at the forthcoming EIT Community New European Bauhaus Ideathon Awards Ceremony. \u201cWe are thrilled that our idea was recognized by the EIT Community New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards and that we will become part of the EIT Climate-KIC community across Europe,\u201d said Teresa P\u00e9rez Ciria. \u201cWith the Awards Ceremony approaching this month, we are eager to join the programme in-person, share our progress with potential partners and investors, as well as meet and learn from the successes of other impactful teams on how we can further grow and make Europe more sustainable together.\u201d She continued: \u201cOf course, the potential of winning the Grand Jury Award is also very important, as it will help us accelerate our scaling-up and greatly support us in our mission to make second-hand fashion more visible and accessible than ever before. Finally, we are really grateful for this opportunity to share our project with the world and for EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s support in helping us make the fashion ecosystem more sustainable.\u201d Register here for the EIT Community New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards Ceremony!", "eit270": "This year\u2019s EIT Health Catapult competition crowned Ebenbuild, Leuko and SolasCure as champions at the EIT Health Summit.

The key is to support people with handling stress, managing their attitude and mood, and meeting their social needs - to improve their ability to change. \"Stress, loneliness, and lack of money influence our behavior. When people come into difficult situations, they immediately lose their good intentions,\" explains Chantal Linders, CEO and co-founder of the start-up. The company employs a scientific approach to behavioural change. When someone joins, they receive a full kit in the mail, including a training book, a water bottle, a booklet for journaling and the rules of the game. They are also instructed to download the Greenhabit app. The software uses gamification to keep users engaged, presenting daily activities, and rewarding progress. With help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Greenhabit is able to identify the needs of patients to tackle the underlying cause of unhealthy behaviour.", "eit273": "How EIT Digital's Professional School builds competitiveness If we continue to learn throughout our lives, we continue to grow, according to Asja Kamenica, Head of the EIT Digital Professional School. \"I have made learning part of my daily life, and I regularly look for opportunities to learn formally or through daily challenges\", she says. \"I find personal pleasure in this habit, but I also believe that a certain amount of regular learning is essential in today's fast-changing world\". The ability to take in new skills and information - and sometimes unlearn information that is no longer valid - are indispensable qualities of successful professionals, according to Kamenica, whose career includes 15-plus years of managing and directing higher education programmes in Europe. An appreciation of the benefits, and challenges, of continuing education shapes the design of the portfolio Kamenica currently leads at EIT Digital's Professional School. The courses offered by the school address the need for upskilling, particularly in digital skills, and enable the kind of lifelong learning that is essential in our knowledge-based economy. \"We understand that access to knowledge and its efficient and innovative application is key for the competitiveness of companies and vital for professional development, performance, and employability\", Kamenica says. \"The opportunity to participate in additional study or personal development programmes can have a major impact on the life of professionals, as well as their team or their company\". The importance of continuing training throughout our careers is recognised widely. As a European Commission publication on adult education notes: \"A multitude of evidence has been gathered over the years showing that adult education and training - both formal and non-formal - can contribute to individuals' employability, health and well-being\". Identifying and building the right skills Many professionals, especially those whose companies assist in talent development and have a learning and development (L&D) agenda, become conditioned to recognising their own development needs, and the needs of their teams, says Kamenica. \"They steer their careers by regularly upskilling themselves and overseeing the knowledge upgrades that are needed to maintain and increase their team's performance,\" she explains. The wisdom of companies encouraging continued learning is noted by Andrew McConnell, a CEO whose article in Forbes singles out Google's programme to give employees 20% of their time to explore areas beyond their main responsibilities: \"The idea is to create space for employees to explore and grow outside of their day jobs. This growth and exploration certainly benefit the employees as individuals, but it also creates better results for the business. Gmail and Google Maps both started as side projects\". To be truly effective, the learning we do must involve more than simply taking in information, according to a recommendation on lifelong learning from the EU Council. \"In the knowledge economy, memorisation of facts and procedures is key, but not enough for progress and success. Skills, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, ability to cooperate, creativity, computational thinking, self-regulation are more essential than ever before in our quickly changing society\", the recommendation says. Meanwhile, according to research for the European Commission, the type of information we require and use is constantly changing: \"Competence needs are not static; they change throughout life and across generations. It is therefore important to make sure that all young people and adults have the opportunity to acquire the required competences in initial education and training, higher education, continuous professional training, adult education or different forms of non-formal and informal learning\". Asja Kamenica, Head of the EIT Digital Professional School The importance of digital skills A review of the current competence needs in today's market makes it clear that digital upskilling is more necessary than ever, according to Kamenica. The digitisation trend has been going on for years now, and more recently, the pandemic prompted many companies to adapt more quickly to new technologies. \"Technology is a key driver for many businesses. It evolves quickly and can advance industries at a fast pace, but the rapid pace of change often creates a gap between the existing workforce's skills and the skills that have become necessary to execute their jobs effectively\", says Kamenica. \"Through investment in regular training and L&D management and budgets, many companies take care to advance employees' skills to bridge this gap. This naturally leads to benefits such as less turnover, increased growth opportunities, and better productivity and employee satisfaction\". The World Economic Forum has identified continuing trends that point toward greater importance for digital upskilling: \"Half of us will need to reskill in the next five years, as the \u2018double-disruption' of the economic impacts of the pandemic and increasing automation transforming jobs takes hold,\" according to a WEF publication. \"The Forum estimates that by 2025, 85 million jobs may be displaced by a shift in the division of labour between humans and machines. But even more jobs - 97 million - may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labour between humans, machines and algorithms\". Another WEF publication notes the close relationship between the digital and green transitions, and points out the potential benefits beyond the labour market: \"Upskilling may even have wider environmental benefits. The more digitally literate we are, the more we are able to create efficiencies that contribute to environmental sustainability\". EIT Digital's own Digital Technologies and the Green Economy Report also identified how the digital transition benefits the economy and environment by enabling sustainable development. And research by PwC shows benefits for innovation from upskilling: \"PwC's Talent Trends 2020 found organisations with the most advanced upskilling programmes saw three times the improvement in innovation\", says a PwC publication. The EIT Digital philosophy on digital upskilling The main objective of the EIT Digital Professional School is to keep European professionals at the forefront of today's fast-paced digital technologies, according to Kamenica. She says this approach enables professionals to undertake meaningful innovation. \"We emphasise the business value of the courses. The executives and managers who are upskilled in our courses are able to realise value from their new skills in the short and long term\", she explains. \"The courses achieve this by offering hands-on learning and engaging professionals in crafting the best solutions for their companies through practical sessions\". Companies also realise value from these skills, she notes. \"Firms that enjoy digitally-enabled leadership, management, and talent are in a special position to leverage the full potential of digitalisation\", according to Kamenica. \"The professionals who take our courses are able to take part in modernising their company's technology, thereby contributing to its strategic success\". A unique benefit of EIT Digital educational programmes is the backing of EIT Digital's powerful network of international partners from industry, research and academia. This enables the EIT Digital Professional School to develop a solid portfolio of courses with several of Europe's top-ranking technology universities, working in close cooperation with EIT Digital industry partners, Kamenica says. The industry partners bring an awareness of the real needs of businesses, and they also add to an appreciation of what matters to professional learners, according to Kamenica. That includes consideration of busy schedules. \"EIT Digital Professional School courses are designed to be consumed in a short time frame with minimum time away from work,\" she says. \"We understand that short courses fit well into the busy schedules of managers and executives.\" As Kamenica explains, catering to busy professionals while providing practical hands-on training in the appropriate subjects is essential to delivering real value through the EIT Digital Professional school.", "eit274": "Get ready for Europe's largest innovation event of the year!

The project will act as a collaboration centre for industry and policymakers while creating an important source of knowledge and innovation. Built by Nature, a network and grant-making organisation with a mission to accelerate the timber building transformation in Europe, has announced a EUR 250 000 Accelerator Fund grant to support research into perception barriers to mass timber adoption in Italy. The initiative, coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, will establish a physical and digital prototype building to drive understanding and adoption of mass timber, while maximising the amount of timber used in construction of the one-million-square metre Milano Innovation District (MIND) complex. EIT Climate-KIC will coordinate collective learning as part of the research initiative and the Accelerator Fund grant will connect to EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s Deep Demonstrations of Healthy Clean Cities EU CINCO, funded by the Laudes Foundation. The aim of the CINCO project is to learn how can cities shape the markets for carbon-neutral buildings through two experimentations for bio-based and circular construction in Milan and Madrid. Both initiatives set the stage for collaboration with local stakeholders, the city, developers, and designers by supporting the creation of skills, motivation, and leadership to collaboratively explore how to activate levers for timber transformation of buildings. Built by Nature and EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s partner networks will share the outputs of the project. Thanks to the vision and commitment of Built by Nature and Laudes Foundation, we can help cities tackle deep-seated, seemingly intractable challenges. Our ability to collaborate with the private sector, research experts, and the City of Milan means we can develop insights and actionable knowledge useful to all cities about circular building materials and how to reduce carbon emissions in the built environment. Further, we can connect this work to all cities across Europe through our leadership of NetZeroCities. Thomas Osdoba, NetZeroCities Programme Director, EIT Climate-KIC, Partners in the project include multinational property and construction company Lendlease (which provides co-funding of EUR 528 000), Waugh Thistleton Architects (who are designing the prototypes), Fondazione Politecnico di Milano (who is conducting a review of scientific literature on mass timber sustainability implications in Italy), as well as University College of London, Arup and Stora Enso. Built by Nature\u2019s Accelerator Fund provides grants of between EUR 50 000-EUR 250 000 to teams and solutions that scale up timber building and raise the bar on the positive climate impact of using timber from sustainably sourced forests. Since launching in October 2021, the Accelerator Fund has already supported leading-edge work by Holland Houtland in scaling biobased buildings through a new blended finance and valuation model; Waugh Thistleton Architects and its \u2018New Model Building\u2019 methodology for building residential developments using engineered timber, and the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunya\u2019s Valldaura Labs (IAAC) in convening frontrunners and exhibiting solutions ahead of Barcelona\u2019s \u2018European Forest City 2022. This is an extremely exciting Accelerator Fund initiative on several levels, bringing together a local network in Italy to develop knowledge and innovation in a demonstration project setting, as part of a larger city scale project that has the potential to really unlock the timber building transformation locally. We are pleased to deepen key Built by Nature partnerships with EIT Climate-KIC and local research partners like Politecnico di Milano, and support city and industry frontrunners such as Milano and Lendlease. James Drinkwater, Chair, Built by Nature Investment Committee Built by Nature connects key actors across the built environment and forest communities to spark city-scale projects and amplify stories of groundbreaking timber projects and solutions.

After passing through a period of 10 weeks of intense mentoring and validation facilitated by a top-class group of mentors, EIT Health and Biogen experts, the \u2018neurotechprize\u2019 teams pitched their ideas to an independent panel of experts, consisting of leading neurologists, patient representatives, startup experts and payors. Fives Lives showed great promise with their mobile app which aims to empower individuals aged 50+ to track their brain health via clinically validated risk assessment. As a result, Fives Lives can provide lifestyle advice based on their individual dementia risk level, with positive messaging and gamified experience. This helps reduce their individual risk of future dementia through lifestyle improvement. Neurocast turns everyday digital interactions, such as smartphone use, into clinically approved outcomes, enabling doctors and researchers to passively measure individual patients. Through tracking each patient\u2019s performance in daily life, medical professionals can proactively act upon changes. EIT Health and Biogen launched \u2018neurotechprize\u2019 in late 2021 to find new solutions to combat the growing challenges associated with addressing AD. Dementia, of which AD is the most common form, has become one of the most pressing health concerns of the 21st century and is now regarded as a public health crisis. In line with our ageing population, incidence of AD is growing \u2013 over 55 million people live with dementia worldwide, and forecasts project that this figure will rise to 78 million by 2030. While there is currently no cure for AD, early diagnosis and treatment can help to slow disease progression and manage symptoms. However, stigma remains a key barrier to diagnosis. Public health bodies and organisations across the world are working to improve diagnosis, and such improvements will require innovative solutions for the subsequent management of newly diagnosed patients. \u201cThe variety of solutions submitted by the various start-ups was unbelievable. It was hard to choose a winner. But we are happy to now announce two exciting winners: Five Lives and Neurocast. With our experienced partner, EIT Health, we are proud to support the winners to realise solutions that promise to reduce the individual risk of future AD through lifestyle improvements and for those affected to make the diagnosis of AD easier,\u201d said Dr. Thorsten Lambertus, Head of neurotechlab, Biogen. The journey continues: Biogen is also working to find technology-based solutions for other neurological diseases in the future.

For Europe\u2019s innovators to thrive, their ideas and creations need to be protected through intellectual property rights. However, it is often the case that knowledge gap exists preventing innovators from benefiting from these rights. By working more closely together, the EIT and EPO can help ensure that the EIT community, Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem helps not only bring new ideas to market, but also protects those innovations and investments. By establishing a framework for close partnership and dialogue through the MoU, both EPO and EIT will work hand in hand to respond to the needs of their stakeholders responding quickly to the changing demands and conditions of a dynamic global patent system. At the EIT, we support innovation in order to address today\u2019s major global challenges ranging from health to climate change. We are delighted to work together with the European Patent Office, in order to offer its expertise to our innovators, helping them to protect and utilise the Intellectual Property generated when they turn their ideas into products and services for European citizens. Particularly SMEs and start-ups often lack capacity and knowledge to do so themselves. With this cooperation between EIT and EPO, we expect to see more of our innovations being grounded on business models that can sustain themselves and create a bigger impact. - Martin Kern, EIT Director Our partnership with the EIT will help us share knowledge even more effectively and support innovators, start-ups, SMEs and businesses across Europe with best-in-class expertise. This will enhance the impact of the European patent system at the same time as improving access to patent information and raising awareness of the power of patent knowledge. - Ant\u00f3nio Campinos, EPO President The two organisations have already enjoyed a fruitful collaboration since 2018, with the EPO participating in the EIT Innovation Communities\u2019 working group on IP and \u201cInnovation Panel\u201d meetings to provide tailor made training on IP issues. Since then, additional targeted training has been offered to different parts of the EIT Community. The EIT Community was also introduced to the \u201cPATLIB network\u201d to find synergies with the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme \u2013 a program which aims to boost innovation in countries and regions which are considered by the European Innovation Scoreboard to have modest or moderate levels of innovation. With the signed MoU, the EPO and EIT have agreed to develop specific activities, projects and programmes to be implemented in a spirit of co-operation and common commitment. The aim of this cooperation is to support innovators and entrepreneurs across Europe in turning their ideas into products and services, thus creating highly-skilled jobs and economic growth and also to promote a modern IP culture in Europe among researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs by improving their access to the European IP system.", "eit278": "The European Commission has selected 100 European cities (plus 12 additional cities coming from associated countries) to join its Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities. The cities selected for this Mission will receive comprehensive support from the NetZeroCities programme led by EIT Climate-KIC and work on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate neutrality. Home to 75 per cent of Europeans and responsible for more than 70 per cent of global CO2 emissions, cities can lead the European Union\u2019s pathway to a zero-carbon world. The main goal of the NetZeroCities programme is to engage local authorities and other stakeholders to deliver over 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, and to ensure that these cities serve as test-beds for innovation to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. \u201chis Mission represents the most aggressive and ambitious effort among cities to lead the way in responding to the global climate emergency. Europe is seeking to do its part and invest in learning how to achieve climate neutrality quickly and to share what we learn across all of Europe and the world. Reaching climate neutrality will be difficult for any municipalities, and our job is to help them on that journey, especially with innovation and learning that touch every aspect of a city,\u201d said Thomas Osdoba, Director of NetZeroCities. A total of 377 cities applied to be part of the Mission and work with NetZeroCities to overcome the current structural, institutional and cultural barriers they face in order to achieve net-zero by 2030. The European Commission selected 100 EU cities coming from all 27 Member States, as well as 12 additional cities coming from countries associated or with the potential of being associated to Horizon Europe, the EU\u2019s research and innovation programme (2021-2027). Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Krak\u00f3w, Leuven, Madrid, Malm\u00f6, Milan and Sarajevo, who are already working with EIT Climate-KIC through its Healthy, Clean Cities deep demonstration programme will join the cohort of cities that the EU chose for the Mission. The Cities Mission will receive EUR 360 million of Horizon Europe funding covering the period 2022-23, to start the innovation paths towards climate neutrality by 2030. The research and innovation actions will address clean mobility, energy efficiency and green urban planning, and offer the possibility to share best practices to build joint initiatives and extend collaborations with other EU programmes. One central element of the programme is the Climate City Contracts, which are developed together with local stakeholders and signed and implemented by each participating city. The Contracts include plans for the city to achieve climate neutrality and an investment plan. They are not only a tool for cities but also a long-term commitment that ensures cooperation between cities and other levels of government. NetZeroCities consists of 33 partners from 27 European countries and will act as a a platform tailored to cities\u2019 sustainability needs and supported by climate practitioners. It will provide European cities the support and solutions they need to achieve their net-zero goal in a socially inclusive way. NetZeroCities will also support a series of pilot projects to help drive rapid learning on how to achieve climate neutrality at the city level and implement a twinning programme to facilitate peer-learning.

The cooperation with the EIT will further reinforce the new European Research Area and will strengthen Europe\u2019s capacity to address scientific, technological and societal challenges.\u201d - Ronald de Bruin COST Director. As a first step, the EIT Jumpstarter programme has been identified as an area for collaboration with COST initiatives. This EIT Innovation Community pre-accelerator programme supports early innovators from Central-Eastern and Southern-European countries. COST and the EIT are convinced that Research and Innovation are the key drivers for sustainable growth and competitiveness. Better integration of the knowledge triangle and advancing the innovation performance of more countries and their regions across Europe, are preconditions for enhancing Europe\u2019s performance in global competition and ensuring a sustainable future for all. The synergies between both organisations aim to create complementary activities with huge potential to build upon each other\u2019s impact. Background The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) networks are effectively bridging the innovation divide and participation gaps in Europe and providing a large spectrum of opportunities for young generations of researchers and innovators. Interdisciplinary research often results in discoveries, innovations and breakthroughs that are crucial in the ambition to boost jobs, economic growth, investments, and improve the quality of life of Europe\u2019s citizens and the environment. As part of its strategic priorities COST has introduced additional activities such as COST Innovators Grant, which aimed at exploring innovation potential, to further bridge scientific research performed in COST Actions and marketable applications and/or follow\u2010up funding. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is an EU body created by the European Union in 2008 to strengthen Europe\u2019s ability to innovate. The EIT is an integral part of Horizon Europe, the EU\u2019s Framework Programme for Research, and Innovation. The EIT supports the development of dynamic, long-term European partnerships among leading companies, research labs and higher education. These partnerships are called EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities, and each is dedicated to finding solutions to a specific global challenge, from climate change and sustainable energy to healthy living and food.", "eit283": "Climate change is going to get worse, but curbing global warming is not hopeless. The science says actions can prevent some of the worst effects if done soon. On 4 April, the UN\u2019s climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released the last of three installments of its Sixth Assessment Report. The 3,675-page long report focuses on solutions to curb greenhouse gas emissions. It provides a roadmap for how to rapidly reduce emissions in the next three decades and urges countries to make immediate and deep emissions reductions to avoid the worst-case warming scenario. This report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a litany of broken climate promises. It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world. We need to create a grassroots movement that can\u2019t be ignored by demanding the end of fossil fuel subsidies and the massive deployment of renewable energy. We are on a fast track to climate disaster: Major cities underwater. Unprecedented heatwaves. Terrifying storms. Widespread water shortages. The extinction of a million species of plants and animals. This is not fiction or exaggeration. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres The report shows that rapid mitigation measures such as reductions in fossil fuels and better building practices are essential to avoid extreme global warming. But without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is beyond reach. It is now or never, the scientists warned during a press conference. According to the IPCC, global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero in the 2050s to stabilise global warming at the target agreed upon in the Paris Climate Accords. The report provides details on the last remaining paths to stop irreversible damage to the planet. It makes clear that there is no one silver bullet solution to solving global warming. Instead, governments, businesses, communities and individuals all have a role to play in transforming economies, embracing new habits, and shaping a safer and more sustainable future. An article on Climate Home News lists five key takeaways from the report: Without immediate action to cut emissions, the chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C is slipping away Leaving coal, oil and gas in the ground is necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goals Carbon-cutting and low-emissions technologies are becoming cheaper and the economic benefit of limiting warming to below 2C is higher than the cost of action Carbon capture and storage technology is needed for the industrial sector to reach net zero CO2 emissions, but the technology remains underdeveloped and is facing technological, economic and environmental barriers In wealthy nations, behaviour and lifestyle changes (diet, mobility, etc) can reduce global emissions \u201crapidly\u201d with support from policy and design infrastructure. The report comes amid recent concerns over the global supply of oil and natural gas due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In opinion pieces recently published in the media, EIT Climate-KIC CEO Kirsten Dunlop writes that the EU can stop the import of Russian gas and Innovation is key to enable the EU to break free from Russian energy.

More information on the 2021 Call for Proposals", "eit289": "The New European Bauhaus initiative (NEB) is an environmental, social and cultural initiative to combine the aesthetic experience, sustainability, and inclusivity complimenting the European Green Deal. Mapping challenges and developing solutions in collaboration with citizens is key to delivering transformation. Citizen engagement that reflects the diversity of voices in the community is essential to developing long-term solutions that match the wider community's needs\u2014working together for an expected higher goal results in a true synergy of innovation, creativity, and design, improving citizens' quality of life in cities. For citizens, this can increase social acceptance of change and encourage a shift to more sustainable behaviours. Moreover, it can help the private sector adapt and tackle regulatory frameworks and reconsider the fundamental value systems and norms they are founded upon. Successful citizen engagement will increase the ability to create, experiment, demonstrate, scale, and deploy innovative solutions for a just, equitable and prosperous future. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), together with our thematic pan-European Innovation Communities, is well placed to play a vital role in the design, delivery and dissemination phases of the NEB. A close collaboration between the EIT Community (namely EIT Food, EIT Urban Mobility, EIT Climate KIC and EIT Digital) in 2021 focused on new citizen engagement activities and capitalising on existing innovative solutions and scaling them to cities. Through our activities, we have tested the application of Bauhaus principles to current challenges facing the world, such as climate, mobility, digital, health and food challenges. We have further positioned these activities in the context of the global pandemic and economic and social recovery. Finally, we examine which of the Bauhaus principles can be replaced with new ways of thinking and actively question the humanist ideas behind the movement using the Knowledge Triangle, bringing together business, academia and citizens to develop and test new concepts of future ways of living. Discover the selected projects that were conducted under two EIT - New European Bauhaus calls, Citizen engagement Capitalising on existing innovative solutions and scaling them to new cities Selected projects from the NEB Citizen Engagement Call The aim of this Cross-KIC NEB Calls for proposals was to work on activities where citizens and end-users are asked to identify relevant challenges of their city and empowered to co-create together potential solutions in an ideation process. EC Boost Mataro Lab (Matar\u00f3, Spain) The project boosted local energy communities among vulnerable consumers of the neighbourhood of Cerdanyola, a deprived area in Matar\u00f3. Supporting an open business model for self-consumption installations in energy communities for social economy entities (commercials, technicians, mediators, ethical banks, etc.), catapulting the contribution of entities with social and environmental value in cooperation with the municipality the citizens. ECOSERVEIS has developed a business model for self-consumption energy communities based on SSC (the MONDCE project, currently ongoing), which served as the basis for the reflective process regarding access to energy in Matar\u00f3 and definition and boosting of future energy communities. The EC-Boost Matar\u00f3 Lab project brought energy players and citizens together, with the aspects of new initiatives arising, combined with massive sensitisation and engagement campaigns. Through the project's development, the local authority's implication has been vital to getting to know the local context. The municipality had no experience either in shared self-consumption or communitarian projects. Therefore, this project shared several business models to implement a public-communitarian collaboration. The project listed different case studies and grouped them into three different categories. The three core business models identified and suggested for the municipality to build innovative public-communitarian energy production initiatives along with citizens, including vulnerable users, are as follows: Rooftop leasing to third parties Leasing of the use of PV panels with fee or fee-free Public-communitarian collaboration Adopt the Ugly Foodling (Oulu, Finland) The main objective of the Ugly Foodling project was to create awareness among young consumers about the reasons and challenges of food waste and bring them together with more experienced consumers (elderly) who spend their youth in different conditions (non-abundance of food, participation in food-producing etc.). The Ugly Foodling represents food that is still edible or still has value, but it ends up in the rubbish. The work of the co-creation event focused on changing the fate of the Ugly Foodlings towards a sustainable and inclusive \"happier end\" for all, the environment, the city and its citizens, the food producers. Four storylines of the adventures of the Ugly Foodlings at the food production site, in the market, in the restaurant and at home will be produced by the young adult participants and presented in digital format. Lugoj for kids, by kids (Lugoj, Romania) The project \"Lugoj: For kids, by kids\" improved the public space in the town of Lugoj, Romania, through an innovative \"grassroots\" approach by connecting pupils with the public administration. The main objectives of the \"Lugoj \u2013 For kids, by kids\" project were to identify, with the help of pupils, obstacles children face in cycling to school, using the relevant infrastructure, and co-create solutions. The secondary aim of the pupil engagement phase was to stimulate their participation and involvement in the decision-making processes of their school by forming a long-term working group to deal with school projects. The pupils and the municipality formed a powerful bond and connected through a shared vision, improving the public realm through Creation of a GIS StoryMap showcasing problematic areas of the cycling infrastructure in the town and proposed solutions. The project's main output is the visualised ArcGIS based Interactive and Story Maps, which offers the possibility to visualise in real-time the information and data collected (entered) by the students involved in the project. Selected projects from the NEB Capitalisation Call This Cross-KIC NEB call will offer regions, cities or affiliated entities the possibility to select project solutions to drive a specific challenge in their urban transformation. Cities and regions can benefit from existing work aiming for immediate impact within 2021. The following projects contributed to higher use rates, improved physical facilities, urban greening, more inclusive access, and active mobility. \"Orti Urbani\" Container gardening project (Turin, Italy) The container gardening project contributed to the aesthetic and functional redevelopment of a part of the University of Turin that has been unused and abandoned for years, including a waste dump. The idea is to use the paradigm of the New European Bauhaus applied to urban regeneration and the redevelopment of a place through food. The material used for building the infrastructure is completely retrieved through circular economy processes. In particular, a co-design and co-creation of a space dedicated to producing fruit and vegetables through container gardens were used. The creation of the box gardens was done by implementing a co-creation process and co-design of the area in question. The mapping of local actors was carried out, and collaborative and co-designing relationships were activated. Specifically, in addition to several visits by students, lecturers and administrative staff representing university citizenry, the project also involved citizens, elders, and a nursery school, and created a network with other urban garden initiatives in the city, as well as interacting with a social cooperative that manages urban gardens in a neighbouring area and the citizen hub that deals with the social inclusion of disabled people grouping all the leading relevant organisations. During the meetings, the spaces, management rules, stakeholder needs, inclusive design, crops, and types of plants were co-designed and co-selected. Later, the area was also cleared of 860 kg of waste. The history of the site was reconstructed, also from the point of view of the tree species that were present. The choice of plants was inspired by the stories we heard and the various testimonies of those who grew up in these spaces. CLIME - transgenerational climate voyage through time and space via AR technology (Pula, Croatia) The CLIME project was designed to optimise heritage experiences to climate resilience and the recent experience of climate and connected cultural change and adaptation and inclusivity and revive 'Councils of Elders' connection with youth. The purpose is inverting the relationships between city and nature by conceptualising cities in the natural environment by providing a gamified AR mobile app, the Equinox XR, for youth, where they can \"clime\" both physically through nature and culturally as experienced by our elders. In Western culture, independent living \"devalues\" people as they age. The generation gap is highly pronounced, with the elderly being socially excluded and their knowledge and experience not visible. Therefore the main goal was to connect generations in a common goal of tackling climate change by using technology to share an experience that stretches over the lifetime of elderly citizens and benefiting from their strategies of living in rapid climate change. By mapping the narratives of the elderly, an AR tour of the city and city surroundings was designed, through which educational content on sufficiency will be adopted in a fun and recreational way. The \"Clime\" AR mobile app connect generations and give us educational content about life in the past, life before plastic, before significant climate change, about the self-sufficient life of our elders. With this mobile application, users will be able to take a tour of Pula, generate a physical map of the city of Pula based on stories and create an open database based on research. Furnish (Barcelona, Spain) From 2020 the Municipality of Barcelona has set the project \"Protegim les escoles\" as a high priority strategy to provide Barcelona's schools with safe, comfortable, and healthy public spaces that act as meeting places for children, their families and neighbours. By 2030, it is expected that all the 585 schools in Barcelona will offer safe and comfortable surroundings. In line with this, FURNISH emerges as an opportunity to help in this pacification. The project provided interesting and instigating interactive prototypes to stimulate permanence in these areas. These places have the potential to work as transitional spaces, connecting the urban and school environments creatively, promoting more extended stays before and after school hours, and enabling its use as extensions of classrooms and playgrounds, engaging children to play, be active and learn. The school community had tested the prototypes, and their implementation integrates the engagement of the school community in the decision-making process. Two teams were selected to develop the co-creation process and composed by Fab Labs, research groups, architects, engineers, designers and makers; they were able to produce rapid solutions to the urgent spatial opportunities of the new public space. The activities were mainly focused on the co-design and co-fabrication processes, the citizen engagement activities (including co-creation workshops, presentations and participatory construction of elements) and the assessment and impact analysis. An essential part of the design strategy for the prototype were the ideas of participation, modularity, and sustainability.

The programme offers significant scientific and economic benefits to both Europe and Israel, and holds immense potential for learning, exchange and collaboration. An example of such exchange is the Ecosystem Summit organised by the EIT Hub in Israel, launched as part of the 2019 EIT Global Outreach Programme. The conference has become a must-attend event to discuss the latest global trends and challenges in the ecosystem world. A win-win exchange: cooperation between the EU and Israel On December 6 2021, the agreement on Israel\u2019s association with Horizon Europe, the world\u2019s largest research and innovation programme with a total budget of EUR 95,5 billion, came into force after being signed by Mariya Gabriel, EU Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth and Haim Regev, Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the EU and NATO. Over the past 25 years, cooperation between the EU and Israel has been consistently evolving, bringing many benefits along the way. Israel\u2019s innovation processes are very agile, with a \u201cfire-fighting\u201d approach that deals mainly with short-term timelines. And they have proven that this works: Israel has the largest number of start-ups per capita in the world (about one per 1,400 inhabitants) and ranks first in the world in R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. One of the key ingredients of Israel\u2019s innovation ecosystem is deeply embedded in the country\u2019s daily reality. It lies in the sense of urgency and constraints to survive and innovate today for a better tomorrow. With the example of Israel in mind, it is exciting to see the potential when start-ups unite around a common mission. For Europe and beyond, this can be the driver that enables companies to excel and deliver truly unique and innovative solutions rapidly. Bram Pauwels, Strategic Partnership Manager at European Business and Innovation Centre Network. On the other hand, Europe has a long-term approach to certain societal issues. This allows European countries to be proactive rather than reactive. While the action takes longer, decisions are made in a structured, evidence-based way. From the perspective of this continuum, Europe and Israel are clearly complementary. We represent two extremes, and knowing that the best combination tends to be in the middle, our alliance ensures that we both move forward and reinforce the best on each side. Michal Seror, Ecosystem Development Director at Start-Up Nation Central. Europe\u2019s goal of becoming the first carbon-neutral continent and leading the global green transition might inspire and gently push Israel\u2019s high-tech sector to address the climate emergency. Although there are exciting initiatives in Israel such as the Climate Solutions Prize (a USD 1M prize for innovative responses to the climate crisis sponsored by KKL-JNF in collaboration with Start-Up Nation Central and the Peres Centre for Peace and Innovation), a holistic strategy by the so-called \u2018Start-up Nation\u2019 to solve the climate crisis could make a global difference. The Ecosystem Summit: Building the European-Israeli innovation community A successful example of EU-Israel collaboration is the aforementioned EIT Hub Israel, launched as part of the 2019 EIT Global Outreach Programme. The EIT Innovation Communities involved are EIT Health (lead), EIT Food, EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Urban Mobility, EIT RawMaterials and EIT Digital as observers. The Hub supports European innovators in attracting Israeli customers, partners and investors and has developed powerful programmes targeting specific audiences, such as Disrupt me (European companies looking to introduce Israeli innovation) or Mission Innovation (an immersion bootcamp for European diplomats), and Connect & Experience (professional training for ecosystem leaders) which facilitates The Ecosystem Summit, the annual conference to celebrate, consolidate and expand the European-Israeli innovation community.

With an ageing population chronic diseases such as TR, a life-threatening condition, become more prevalent among our elderly. TR causes the main valve between the chambers on the right side of the heart to stop functioning properly. The blood leaks backwards, posing a greater risk of mortality. Currently, the only option to treat this chronic condition is open heart surgery, often unsuitable for frail elderly patients. Cro\u00edValve was founded in 2016 and is a spin-out from EIT Health partner Trinity College Dublin. It has created a minimally invasive device that replaces and repairs the heart\u2019s main valve, without the need for surgery. This solution meets a previously unmet clinical need with the potential to become available to a wider cohort of candidates suffering from TR, who would otherwise go untreated. \u201cWe met a number of partners through EIT Health. They supported us with our pre-clinical testing. It\u2019s both a timely and costly pre-clinical test journey. Securing support from EIT Health was hugely transformational \u2013 without that, it certainly would have been far more challenging.\u201d - Lucy O\u2019Keeffe, Cro\u00edValve CEO As well as HBAN, other investors that participated in the Series A funding round include Atlantic Bridge University Fund, Broadview Ventures, SOSV, Enterprise Ireland, Elkstone, Ascentifi and DBIC. The funding will support a European Feasibility Study of the Cro\u00edValve Transcatheter Tricuspid DUO Coaptation Valve System. \u201cStart-ups such as Cro\u00edValve face a long road through clinical trials as they work to provide a solution to a chronic problem that affects so many of our elderly population. We at EIT Health are committed to supporting these revolutionary products and services to reach markets sooner so they can have actual impact on the lives of European citizens. We congratulate Cro\u00edValve on this latest round of investment.\u201d - Leslie Harris, EIT Health Ireland-UK Managing Director Learn more about Cro\u00edValve\u2019s solution, and track it\u2019s journey to date.", "eit297": "EIT Manufacturing West continues growing with the incorporation of a new network partner, ACCI\u00d3, the Catalan Government\u2019s agency for business competitiveness.

Founded in Ireland, ProVerum has developed ProVee, a novel treatment solution for patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The funding will help them to bring their innovative device to market in Europe and the US. BPH, also known as prostate enlargement, is a common urological disease which nearly 1 in 4 men will suffer from in their lifetime. If medication is not effective, BPH is often treated with surgery. ProVerum\u2019s founders created ProVee as a less invasive alternative. ProVee will provide urologists with a treatment option for BPH that can be administered as an outpatient-based procedure. In 2016, EIT Health provided ProVerum with funding and local opportunities in Ireland which enabled the company to spin out from Trinity College, Dublin. We have since supported ProVerum with market validation across Europe. The team pitched at the EIT Health Summit in Barcelona in November 2016, at the Global Investor Forum in February 2017, and as a Catapult Finalist in December 2017. ProVerum went on to win funding by EIT Health as an innovation project in 2019, supporting our focus of improving care pathways. We congratulate ProVerum on this successful investment round and celebrate their potential to make a real impact on BPH care pathways. As they bring their product to market, with our continued support, ProVerum promises to significantly improve care and outcomes for those with BPH, in Europe and beyond. \u201cThis is a very exciting time for us and EIT Health has been extremely supportive in getting us to this stage. Funds from this Series A investment will support further clinical trials and regulatory approval for the ProVee system in Europe and the US.

It features EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s Deep Demonstration concept which draws upon a decade\u2019s worth of work on climate change mitigation and adaptation, community and innovation ecosystem development, and systems change. Funded by EIT Climate-KIC as part of its Resilient Food Systems and Diets Deep Demonstration, the book was produced in partnership with EAT, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University and the Nordic Council of Ministers. We can and must work with the strategic innovation of food systems to solve some of our greatest societal challenges. This is the fundamental proposal of the book, \u201cCookbook for systems change: Nordic innovation strategies for sustainable food systems.\u201d In essence, this cookbook of strategies demonstrates the role that a strong public innovation system can play in the drive towards sustainable food systems, proposing a method for deliberate food system transformation\u2014a mission-based approach\u2014that can support people, the planet and society. But while mission-led strategies have received increasing attention in policy circles at national and EU levels, they are still rather loosely defined and there are very few examples of their implementation. Moving from intent to action has been slow as there is no existing playbook (or cookbook) to go by\u2014resulting in mission-thinking being often overlooked in new policy proposals. This strategy cookbook will provide the ingredients\u2014templates for developing interventions, guides for how to get started and examples of cross-cutting projects\u2014that you can use to create your own recipes for change. To accomplish this, we offer a new, emergent way of working with complex and dynamic systems. The cookbook is intended primarily for national and regional innovation agencies, as governments have both a mandate and more authority than any other entity to lead the change needed to achieve sustainable food systems. However, because innovation ecosystems include a variety of different actors, this strategy cookbook also provides valuable insights into the roles that entrepreneurs, civil society and research organisations can play in cultivating change from the bottom up. Drawing inspiration from a Nordic innovation alliance, this cookbook suggests that the Nordic countries\u2019 most important global contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals may not be a specific technology, business model or policy innovation. Rather, this contribution can come in the form of demonstrating how a strong public innovation ecosystem is the missing link to overcome the complex societal challenges defining our times.

The medical device company headquartered in Barcelona, Spain, announced that its first product \u201cMOWOOT II Intestinal Transit Management System\u201d has been granted the breakthrough device designation by the FDA. With this important recognition by the USA's highest authority for medical devices the company joins a select list of companies to receive this designation since the programme began in 2016. \u201cThe Breakthrough Device Designation is a significant milestone for our company and validates our belief that our solution offers significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, per FDA requirements. Our clinical results show clear benefits for severely constipated patients, and we look forward to working with the FDA to introduce our technology to the US market as quickly as possible to improve bowel management in patients with neurogenic bowel disorders, for better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare expenditures.\u201d Dr. Markus Wilhelms, CEO and cofounder of MOWOOT. The MOWOOT device, with its patented \u2018Intermittent Colonic Exoperistalsis\u2019\u2122 technology, offers a novel, purely physical, non-drug and non-invasive treatment for patients with chronic constipation, a condition which affects 17% of adults in Europe. The receipt of Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) demonstrates that MOWOOT can offer significant advantages over existing alternatives for more effective and efficient management of neurogenic bowel disorder (NBD), a severe form of chronic constipation that affects up to 80% of neurological patients, such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Conventional solutions focus on pharmacological or invasive approaches, such as laxatives, constipation drugs, trans anal irrigation systems and solutions that require surgery, which in many cases have low efficacy and several side effects for NBD patients. In contrast, the MOWOOT device has demonstrated its safety, a high clinical responder rate, and important improvements in clinical outcomes and patients\u2019 quality of life, in a recently published international clinical trial. \u201cIn our service we see the most severe and refractory cases, so I was sceptical about this therapy; but we have now tried MOWOOT therapy in several patients who had failed all other treatments, with substantial benefit in the majority.\u201d Dr. Yan Yiannakou, Professor of Neuro-gastroenterology at the County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust (UK) Breakthrough device designation The BDD is a seal of approval for medical devices that provide more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The following criteria must be met for such devices: Device provides more effective treatment or diagnosis of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition Device represents breakthrough technologies No approved or cleared alternative device is currently marketed in the US Device offers significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives Device availability is in the best interest of patients. The breakthrough devices programme was created to provide patients and providers with timely access to medical devices. It offers selected companies the access to a fast-track program towards the US market entry, with priority treatment and support. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are currently evaluating a special rule that would cover a breakthrough medical device for four years starting on the date of FDA authorisation. This guaranteed access to public healthcare reimbursement would be a very positive signal to medical device manufacturers and investors alike. Interest from Investors In medical devices, investors are extra wary of the risk posed by the FDA regulatory process and want to be assured that a company\u2019s product has value to both patients and physicians. They also want to see a return on their investment. A BDD gives investors added confidence in a company. If the FDA has recognised a medical device company\u2019s product as one that will advance public health and/or offer superior treatment, that company will be more attractive to investors. MOWOOT is currently running a fundraising campaign with a goal of two million Euros to expand their global market reach.

The winners of EIT Food\u2019s 2021 aquaculture competition presented their projects to an audience of aquaculture experts, investors and other stakeholders at the Aquaculture Showcase event Event speakers outlined the challenges and opportunities the aquaculture sector faces in achieving sustainable production to address several of the SDGs by 2030 such as SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 12, SDG 13 and SDG 14 The event created a sense of urgency around tackling the challenges within aquaculture production, while also celebrating the progress that has been made so far. DOWNLOAD THE EIT FOOD AQUACULTURE SHOWCASE EVENT REPORT It is clear that aquaculture is a key food system in addressing several of the UN targets around the ocean, land, climate change, sustainable consumption and production, but always with a strong drive to end hunger and poverty. As highlighted at the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit, there is a greater understanding of how sustainable seafood can meaningfully contribute to and be at the heart of global food systems. At the EIT Food Aquaculture Showcase event, 12 EIT Food partners presented their aquaculture projects which are transforming aquatic farming into a more sustainable, profitable and efficient sector. EIT Food, the world\u2019s largest and most dynamic food innovation community, is supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union. At the event, it was highlighted that sustainable aquatic foods are an excellent source of important nutrients, with a lower carbon footprint compared to many animal-derived foods. Importantly, aquaculture also supports the livelihoods of many citizens in less-developed countries, which suggests it has a role to play in securing future food security. EIT Food\u2019s Aquaculture Showcase event also featured special messages from Manuel Barange, Director UN FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture, Lara Barazi, President of the Federation of European Aquaculture Producers (FEAP) and Peter Thomson, United Nations Secretary - General's Special Envoy for the Ocean. \u201cOur first aquaculture showcase welcomed many aquaculture experts from across Europe. Our outstanding speakers showed that we are making excellent progress in transforming the aquaculture sector into a sustainable form of food production. Although it is evident that there is also room for improvement and much remains to be done for this transformation, it was amazing to see that everyone cares about the future of our food, wants to make a difference and build a better future for all.\u201d Mercedes Groba, Innovation Programme Manager at EIT Food \u201cThe SDGs are one of the internationally agreed frameworks that we can unite around. Aquaculture can support the success of many of the ambitions through providing nutritious foods in a sustainable way, to benefit both people and the planet. Thank you EIT Food for playing your important role, sharing this message and showcasing innovative solutions. It was a privilege to speak at your event.\u201d Melanie Siggs, Director of Strategic Programmes at The Global Seafood Alliance \u201cInnovation and technology is key to the transformation of the aquaculture sector. Technology can help to address challenges such as transparency, diversification of farmed aquatic species, depleting marine ecosystems and unsustainable fish feeds. For example, blockchain technology can be used to trace aquaculture products to its original source to increase consumer trust.\u201d Laura Krishfield, Senior Research Associate at Lux Research The following aquaculture projects, which tackle challenges such as food waste, sustainable production, animal welfare and education and entrepreneurship, were presented at the Showcase event: Food waste SuSeaPro was presented by Mark Chryssolouris, CEO at SuSea. This project is developing novel processing technologies that extend the shelf-life of seafood products to reduce food loss and waste from farm to fork. A portfolio of projects at Matis was presented by Aquaculture Researcher Alexandra Leeper. Matis has contributed to a range of EIT Food aquaculture projects including the Nordic Cereals project which converts waste from oat processing into aquatic feed. Sustainable production SustainFeed was presented by Alessio Bonaldo, Professor at the University of Bologna. This project aims to support European aquaculture by developing novel sustainable feeds for marine fish, that use low carbon and zero waste ingredients. Delta Futuro was presented by Paola Landri, Scientific Director at Delta Futuro. This project is developing a shellfish juvenile sustainable production model for aquaculture that will decrease the fluctuation of seed supply to farmers. Creating a Sustainable Tuna Industry was presented by Paul-Daniel Sindilariu, CEO and Co-founder of Next Tuna. This project is creating the first sustainable European source of tuna by reproducing Atlantic Bluefin Tuna in a land-based, eco-friendly recirculating aquaculture system.

Cities are envisioned to lead in this respect, achieving net zero carbon emissions faster and ensuring our decarbonisation efforts are equitable and contribute to the well-being of European communities. This level of impact is an extraordinary undertaking for each city and will require profound and systemic changes. Government leadership will be critical, and actions by industry, education and research institutions, and civic organisations must align in terms of policies, governance, and how we arrange for the needed capital investments. Launched in October 2021, NetZeroCities is a four-year project designed to help cities overcome the current structural, institutional, and cultural barriers they face in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The project will enable European cities and citizens to show the way forward towards an inclusive, thriving, climate resilient and sustainable future and this will be achieved by working in: The development of a service-oriented platform supported by world-class practitioners. The co-creation of solutions needed to achieve net zero goals in a socially inclusive way Capacity building on systemic change, citizen engagement and democratic governance, capital and financial structuring, and social innovation The development and promotion of new and existing tools, resources, and expertise into a one-stop shop platform that will be accessible to all cities through an online portal Supporting of up to 30 pilot cities to help drive rapid learning about how to achieve climate neutrality at the city scale Cities will benefit from an intensive support relationship and dedicated services to achieve their net zero goals.

It will provide the newly formed teams with expert mentoring and coaching, and access to its vast network across Europe. The teams will also receive funding of up to EUR 1.5 million each. Eye and vision care is both an under-innovated and underinvested area of healthcare. The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study ranked vision impairment, including blindness, as the third leading cause of years lived with disability. Globally, at least 2.2 billion people around the world have a vision impairment, from which, according to the World Health Organization, almost 50% could be prevented or cured. Now in its fourth year, the Wild Card programme is part of our open innovation offering, which provides the opportunity for teams and individuals including innovators, medical professionals, and entrepreneurs from all walks of life to come together and solve pressing health challenges. Wild Card builds game-changing life science companies to break new ground in health by challenging the status quo in areas of high unmet need. Beginning with challenges that we set, the annual Wild Card programme invites talented innovators from across Europe to respond with their ideas. Successful applicants start their journey with a deep dive; putting them through their paces on everything from team formation, critical thinking, business model validation and pitching. Finally, participants pitch their solution to a panel of industry leaders to secure funding to incorporate their company and bring their solution to market. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to announce our support for PeriVision and INVENTION, which marks our commitment to improving innovation in the field of eye and vision care. As well as EUR 3 million, we\u2019re providing access to our cross-border, cross-discipline, expertise, and network so that we can innovate together. We hope to rapidly bring new safe and effective technologies to Europeans living with debilitating eye and vision conditions,\u201d Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO, EIT Health. About the teams selected PeriVision, a team of six, from Switzerland will focus on developing a novel artificial intelligence device that will allow for faster diagnosis of glaucoma. \u201cGlaucoma is the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and PeriVision wants to reimagine the way we detect and monitor this condition. We provide private practices and hospitals with a portable and AI-based fast visual field-testing device to optimise workflows and better manage glaucoma. The Wild Card programme helped us tremendously to understand who benefits most from our solution and how we build a sustainable business. The mentors made us look at the problem from a patient, clinician, payor, and investor viewpoint. We are now looking forward to finalising our solution and helping patients and clinicians worldwide,\u201d Patrick Kessel CEO & Cofounder of PeriVision. INVENTION, a team of three from Sweden, will develop a natural therapeutic contact lens for the treatment of eye conditions such as myopia and dry eye. \u201cGlobally, more than 2.6 billion people have poor distance vision (myopia) and 1.1 billion suffer from dry eye according to recent WHO reports. Despite the technological advances for treating these conditions separately, millions still suffer from both conditions and are underserved as the existing treatment options are suboptimal. We are developing a Natural Contact Lens made from the same material as the human eye that can help manage myopia in dry eye patients. The EIT Health Wild Card programme helped us better understand the need and examine our assumptions towards developing a solution for addressing a major unmet need in eye and vision care,\u201d Mehrdad Rafat, Cofounder of INVENTION. 2022 Wild Card challenges announced Following the announcement of the 2021 selected teams, we have launched the focus of our Wild Card challenges for 2022: early detection of cancer and mental health. Topics which were selected in consultation with medical, corporate, and financial experts. Urgent action is needed to address the impact of COVID-19 on cancer and mental health, which were both exacerbated by the pandemic. Modelling in several European countries predicts thousands of excess cancer deaths due to the disruption in diagnosis and care. Currently, 52% of people with cancer do not survive, however survival rates are generally higher when the disease is diagnosed and treated early. The Wild Card 2022 cancer challenge has been set to contribute towards innovation that can help to improve the detection of cancer earlier, when it can be more easily and successfully treated. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a considerable impact on the mental health of citizens, with a rise in the reporting of many mental health conditions. One in four people will be affected by a mental health or neurological condition in their lifetime, and around 450 million people are already suffering. The scale of the problem places such conditions among the leading causes of ill-health and disability worldwide. The Wild Card mental health challenge aims to find solutions that can facilitate access to care as well as improve the overall outcomes of those affected. EIT Health Wild Card programme", "eit308": "On 7 December 2021, EIT RawMaterials hosted the final pitching of the Regional Innovation Competition 2021 among innovative start-ups and raw materials changemakers from countries of the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS).

The framework is part of the Package for Efficient and Green Mobility which includes a revision of the TEN-T regulation, ITS Directive and an action plan to boost long-distance and cross-border passenger rail services. Transportation determines how cities look like, how liveable, equitable and healthy they are. If recommendations are taken on board, the new communication can foster more sustainable urban mobility and is a welcomed push for more action from Member States. Notably, the Commission plans to strengthen the role of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) and publish by the end of 2022 a recommendation to Member States on the national programmes to support regions and cities in the roll-out of effective sustainable urban mobility plans that would help achieve EU goals. Further work will be done to refine comprehensive indicators for urban mobility data collection (SUMI), improve zero emission logistics (including data collection) and the safety of micro-mobility devices. The amended TEN-T Regulation proposes to improve urban mobility in urban nodes as Member States have to ensure better connectivity and multi-modal hubs among others. SUMPs (or an equivalent \u201clong-term, all-encompassing integrated mobility plan for the entire functional urban area,\u201d including indicators and targets to measure progress) will be required for all urban nodes by 2025. The number of urban nodes will also increase, as all cities above 100 000 inhabitants (or capitals of an NUTS2 region) on the TEN-T will be considered an urban node if the proposal is adopted (raising the number of urban nodes to approximately 400 from the initial list of 88). According to the new TEN-T Regulation, urban nodes should also be able to collect data covering at minimum greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes, modal share for all modes, and access to mobility services. \u201cThe new urban node approach is a long-awaited one that finally puts the urban dimension at the centre of the TEN-T. Only by tackling local transport we can arrive at the ambitious 90% emissions reduction in 2050. As urban areas grow, they will continue to generate substantial traffic volumes. It is key to be proactive and pre-empt and curb bottlenecks by improving first and last mile connectivity through sustainable and innovative solutions for both freight and passenger transport.\u2019\u2019 Dr Maria Tsavachidis, CEO of EIT Urban Mobility The measures needed to achieve the decarbonisation of transport in cities like fleet electrification, modal shift, encouraging more active modes and better mass transit can raise costs and need step wise investments. An EIT Urban Mobility study modelling the urban mobility transition towards the Green Deal goals estimates that European cities need extra investments of EUR 86 billion in sustainable urban mobility compared to business-as-usual, leading to net benefits of up to EUR 177 billion by 2030. Of these net benefits, cities have the potential to generate EUR 79 billion in saved health costs linked to externalities avoided such as pollution and traffic accident fatalities. On average, each euro invested in the transition can generate up to EUR 3,06 by 2030 (i.e. up to EUR 2,14 in revenues, and EUR 0,92 in externalities savings).", "eit310": "Supporting novel business ideas to boost the sustainable management of critical raw materials The availability of critical raw materials (CRMs) is under massive pressure. However, these materials are essential for products, technologies, and solutions to some of the world\u2019s most crucial issues \u2013 such as the energy transition. The small numbers of suppliers, geopolitical tensions, price volatility, environmental and social damage from mining, and costly time and energy-consuming extraction processes are just a few of the many associated challenges. Addressing the criticality of raw materials is one of the most complex sustainability challenges of our time.

The \u2018Fast Track scheme\u2019 helps to significantly speed up the process and reduce administrative burden for applicants wishing to apply to the EIC Accelerator. Introduced under Horizon Europe , the scheme allows the EIC to give a streamlined treatment to applications stemming from projects already funded by the EIT KICs (and other eligible EU schemes) under Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. EIC and EIT have reinforced their collaboration to support the best European entrepreneurs. This will enable innovators, innovative SMEs and start-ups to receive quality support services to deploy and scale up innovations faster and with greater impact. - Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth The Fast Track scheme recognises that start-ups and scale-ups emerging from the EIT Innovation Communities already have a proven track record, which gives them a faster access to the EIC Accelerator funding. Subject to an identification and review process undertaken by each EIT Innovation Community, companies will be invited to directly submit their full proposal to the highly competitive EIC Accelerator without going through the initial \u2018short proposal\u2019 stage of the evaluation procedure. They can also directly benefit from three days of tailored-made coaching to prepare the full proposal. Once fast-tracked to the EIC Accelerator, applicants have up to one year to develop and submit their full proposals. This gives them time to apply to any of the regular EIC Accelerator cut-off dates throughout the year. Interested start-ups and scale-ups, which are already beneficiaries of Business Creation Programmes of the EIT Community, should contact their respective KIC for more information about the process and the relevant deadlines. Background Information The EIC and EIT are part of a wider ecosystem that the EU put in place under Horizon Europe to give Europe's entrepreneurs every opportunity to become world-leading companies. In January this year, they signed a Memorandum of Understanding that strengthened the support that the EIC and EIT are already providing to thousands of innovative start-ups and SMEs to scale up in Europe and to ensure mutual access to advisory services and networks. The EIC Accelerator offers start-ups and SMEs grants of up to EUR 2.5 million combined with equity investments through the EIC Fund ranging from EUR 0.5 to EUR 15 million. In addition to financial support, all projects benefit from a range of Business Acceleration Services that provide access to leading expertise, corporates, investors and ecosystem actors.

Earth observation and geographic information have the potential to provide tools, indicators and measurements to understand, forecast, mitigate and tackle local and global climate change challenges. The tremendous amount of data and information collected by satellites or remote sensing devices through the EU Copernicus Programme can be used in multiple climate-related applications: monitoring forest fires, floods, or urban heat islands, or supporting decision making at a local, regional or national level to mitigate these risks and improve the liveability of our planet. But this can only be achieved through a qualified workforce that understands the potential of the EO*GI sector and knows how to use its resources. To bridge this skills gap, the EO4GEO Alliance has been working on upskilling and reskilling EU\u2019s workforce in the Earth Observation and Geoinformation sector, resulting in the release of the Space/ Geoinformation Sector Skills Strategy in November 2021. The strategic document\u2019s vision is to foster growth within the sector by ensuring a workforce with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time \u2013 and defines the goals that will define a long-term action plan to address the skills needed by the sector. According to the report: \u201cA skilled and educated workforce will enable the [EO*GI] sector to attract high value, innovative and knowledge-based businesses, adapt more readily to the challenging technological environment and respond better to societal challenges [such as climate change].\u201d The report is a practical guide that aims to stimulate leadership in the sector, including high-level goals and strategic operational objectives for skills development. Its aim is to develop capacity and skills on Earth Observation and Geoinformation by fostering the uptake and integration of Copernicus data and services in end-user applications. The strategy further proposes skills development recommendations to unleash students\u2019 and workers\u2019 potential to become the innovators of tomorrow. The EO*GI sector is linked to many other domains that influence each other and are transforming rapidly (agriculture, energy, transport, local government, maritime, etc.): As a consequence, the knowledge, skills, and competencies that are required to help answer the challenges we face today need to adapt to change. EO*GI is a key sector in achieving the objectives of the European Commission\u2019s Green Deal and the Digital Strategy, as it is leveraging data and information to enforce laws on nature protection. The work undertaken by EO4GEO addresses various levels of education to promote the use of Earth observation and geographic information in Europe and ensure that the available data is integrated into climate services for citizens, businesses, organisations and local and national authorities. Download the Report", "eit313": "On 24 November 2021, Members of the European Parliament voted for the adoption of the Critical Raw Materials report put forward by MEP Hildegard Bentele. Under the new proposal, the EU strategy will boost strategic autonomy and resilience in the supply of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs). Critical raw materials are vital in high technology applications for automotive, renewable energy, defence and aerospace. Securing a sustainable supply of CRMs is fundamental for Europe\u2019s transition towards a green, digital and circular economy. We have now a consistent and ambitious package that tackles the urgency of stable and sustainable critical raw materials supply chains while at the same time ensuring Europe\u2019s competitiveness and jobs. All forecasts predict a higher demand for critical raw materials due to the twin transition. We, therefore, pledge to enhance our efforts to make full use of the circular economy, but since recycling effects will kick in only in a mid- to long-term perspective, we also ask to increase sustainable sourcing. Hildegard Bentele, Member of the European Parliament A strong emphasis was made on enhancing both primary and secondary markets of critical raw materials as well as on securing investments in the sector in general. The European Commission was urged to ensure that CRM policies are part of national resilience and recovery plans under NextGenerationEU, that investments in recycling capacities are being made, that new finance instrument with regard to risk sharing are promoted, that former coal mining regions are targeted. Member States will play a vital role in the implementation of the report, especially with regard to speeding up permitting procedures while guaranteeing environmental and social standards. Since Member States are conducting till today independent CRM policies, it is pointed out that more coordination at EU level is needed to monitor the CRM situation. Hildegard Bentele called for increasing domestic sourcing, the need to diversify supply chains and boosting recyclingefforts in the EU. Europe\u2019s dependence on strategic mineral resources poses geopolitical pressure. Hildegard Bentele considers that one of the prerequisites of strengthening domestic sourcing is a political framework that will enable responsible mining as well as raising awareness and sharing best practices for sustainable sourcing in Europe. The European Commission and the Member States were urged to create an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on Critical Raw Materials to strategically and sustainably plan for demand for the twin transition, covering requirements, sources of supply and (social, environmental and financial) costs. The IPCEI should cover all the relevant topics to reduce criticality and dependence, such as recycling, reuse, substitution, reduction of material use and mining. IPCEI projects will help unlock the unfulfilled potential in CRM-rich EU countries that have large untapped sources and contribute to Europe\u2019s open strategic autonomy and resilience. The role of ERMA in Europe\u2019s resilience and open strategic autonomy As the demand for critical raw materials is growing, the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) is addressing the main challenges connected to raw materials supply for Europe. ERMA was established to address the challenge of securing access to sustainable raw materials, advanced materials, and industrial processing know-how for EU industrial ecosystems. ERMA supports the adoption of the report on Critical Raw Materials by Hildegard Bentele. Our vision to diversify Europe\u2019s supply chains, create jobs, attract investments and enable the best framework for raw materials and the circular economy are well aligned with the strategic scope of the European Parliament. The new report welcomes the creation of ERMA. In the light of the global geopolitical situation and high dependence on producers from rich non-EU countries, ERMA\u2019s current focus on the most Critical Raw Materials, such as rare earth elements and magnets, will support the long-term supply relationships for a huge range of small and large manufacturers in the EU and reduce the current reliance on a few non-EU countries. The European Raw Materials Alliance must be further strengthened, its projects in the field of permanent magnets now need to be implemented, and new initiatives in the area of storage and recycling need to be supported. Hildegard Bentele, Member of the European Parliament On 30 September, ERMA issued an Action Plan \u201cRare Earth Magnets and Motors: A European Call for Action\u201d, which highlights the challenges related to the highly vulnerable global rare earth supply chain and provides specific actions that the EU, its Member States, industry, and innovation communities should implement to diversify EU supply chains. Among the next steps for ERMA is the development of a new action plan on Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion. The work is already ongoing under the second ERMA Cluster with a comprehensive outlook on the supply chains for green energy technologies (fuel cells and electrolysers, battery materials, alternative energy storage and conversion, materials in solar energy). The report on Critical Raw Materials underlines ERMA\u2019s role as an \u2018investment pipeline\u2019 and supports this initiative as a great tool to unlock public and private investments for environmentally assessed and sustainable projects on Critical Raw Materials. ERMA has recently announced its plans to enable high standards in sustainability by establishing a raw materials investment fund planned to be launched in 2022. To date, ERMA\u2019s ecosystem comprises 600 partners from universities, RTOs, trade unions, NGOs, national authorities and ministries, financial institutions, associations and industry. The new report highlighted the importance of engaging a vast network of stakeholders in the area of Critical Raw Materials. Moreover, the Alliance wants to consolidate ERMA\u2019s role, international impact and visibility. ERMA will work closely with the European Commission and DG GROW to target specific parts of the world that are important in their strategic development agenda, such as Australia, Canada, Ukraine and the United States. ERMA welcomes new partners to work closely on CRM projects and contribute to Europe\u2019s open strategic autonomy in the most critical and vital supply chains.

The programme series bridges the gap between healthcare experts\u2019 education and practical knowledge in operating and implementing AI. Expanded from a summer school to a complete education programme on AI in healthcare, HelloAI has impacted over 1,750 participants in the last four years. This summer, 530 young talents and university students completed the HelloAI RIS series. HelloAI RIS targets participants from the countries included in the EIT Health Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS), to close the gap between the most advanced regions and the regions that are achieving innovation at a more moderate pace. HelloAI Profressional, the most comprehensive course available on AI application in healthcare, is tailored for experienced healthcare professionals, looking to implement AI in their roles. Close to 350 healthcare experts from all over Europe and beyond recently graduated from HelloAI Professional which EIT Health has recognised as a \u2018High Quality Project\u2019 following an evaluation by an international panel of independent experts. Healthcare is generating an enormous volume of data annually with ever-increasing numbers. Thanks to the revolution of AI, countless applications are already available to support routine clinical practice. The potential is vast, the global market for AI in healthcare, which was valued USD 6.7 billion (approximately EUR 5.9 billion) in 2020, will grow at a growth rate of 41.8% to USD 120.2 billion (approximately EUR 106.05 billion) by 2028. According to the EIT Health and McKinsey & Company report, \u2018Transforming healthcare with AI\u2019, AI has the potential to enrich and refocus the work of healthcare professionals towards their main motivation for realising their career \u2013 direct patient care. The technology will facilitate the automation of mundane tasks for healthcare professionals who currently spend up to 70% of their time on administration. Healthcare organisations must allow for fundamental shifts in how patients are cared for, and healthcare workers must leverage increasingly comprehensive pools of AI-mediated medical data to deliver better care. Yet the explosion of data, in addition to the shortage of professionals, increasing costs, access and quality concerns are raising significant major issues in healthcare. \u201cAI has a huge potential to transform how healthcare is delivered. However, there is a tremendous gap in healthcare experts\u2019 practical knowledge and education on operating and implementing innovative technologies.

To ensure that the views of the next generation are heard during crucial discussions about the future of the food system, EIT Food has worked closely with 10 innovators aged 18-24, appointing them as \u2018FutureFoodMakers\u2019 to spearhead a call for radical change. EIT Food is the world's largest food innovation community, supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). These FutureFoodMakers have developed a \u2018Menu for Change\u2019 of six priority demands for the food system to improve access to healthy, sustainable and affordable food, which is being presented to an audience of policymakers and food system leaders at the Future of Food Conference 2021. The six demands reflect the areas the FutureFoodMakers feel will be the most impactful in ensuring that the next generation can inherit a future-fit food system. The Menu for Change calls upon European food sector stakeholders to: Target 25% of EU agricultural land to be managed under regenerative practices by 2030 and develop a training body to support existing and new farmers in the transition to regenerative farming Define uniform EU nutrition and labelling guidelines which are easy and accessible, meet individuals\u2019 needs and include the environmental impact of food products Develop an inclusion policy that considers the effects of regulations on food costs among vulnerable populations and the provision of vouchers for nutrient-rich foods Develop an EU-wide true cost of food policy that mandates the calculation of the true cost of foods produced by medium-large corporations and multinationals through the implementation of life cycle analysis and impact assessments Tackle food waste in supermarkets and through the development of the Bioeconomy strategy by creating supermarket reduction monitoring plans that feed into the EU-wide food waste monitoring programme and accelerating the development of substitutes to fossil fuel-based materials that are biobased, recyclable or biodegradable at EU level Include the nutritional, health, and environmental implications of food in education curriculums for children, as well as provide support and resources for parents and teachers on healthy and sustainable diets. Find out more about the Menu for Change here The Menu for Change reflects new research that reveals young people across Europe want an overhaul of the global food system to protect the environment. The new research, commissioned by EIT Food, surveyed over 2,000 18-24 year olds from across the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Spain. The findings show that nearly eight in 10 young people (78%) think we need to take urgent action to make the way we produce and consume food more sustainable. Meanwhile, two-thirds (66%) feel that our current food system is destroying the planet, and that the situation is only getting worse, as 61% think the food sector has become less sustainable in recent years. Food sustainability is of growing concern for this age group, with two-thirds (64%) saying it has become more important to them in the past 12 months, while 65% think that Gen Z cares more about this than older generations. Of agriculture practices and food products, Gen Z consider fruit and vegetable farming to be one of the most sustainable options, with 74% saying they believe this to be sustainable. This is followed by growing food locally (74%), organic farming (72%) and plant-based foods (70%). Meanwhile, half of young people (50%) consider importing food to be unsustainable. \u201cIn a crucial year for global climate talks, we need the next generation \u2013 who will be most affected by the climate crisis \u2013 to have a seat at the table in shaping a future-fit food system. We know that the world cannot achieve its goal of limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees without addressing global food systems, yet food could have been more prominent on the agenda at COP26. That is why, as we look to make food a high priority in global sustainability dialogues over the next year, we have brought together 10 young FutureFoodMakers to represent young people across Europe, and make their views, needs and recommendations known through the Menu for Change.\u201d Dr. Andy Zynga, CEO of EIT Food", "eit317": "EIT Digital has announced the four digital technology ventures to receive international growth support worth EUR 50,000 As part of the New European Bauhaus initiative launched by the EU Commission to enable the Green Deal transformation, EIT Digital launched a pilot call to identify the most promising high-impact digital technology ventures that develop innovative solutions making Europe sustainable, inclusive and improving citizen\u2019s quality of life.

Less than three years ago, the team raised a USD 7,8 million Series A round. Now, they close the year with USD 320 million in funding and the current round valuation at USD 1.8 billion. We\u2019re proud to have supported SWORD Health on their journey and wish them the very best of luck in their continued success\u201d Kurt H\u00f6ller, Director of Business Creation at EIT Health Virgilio Bento, founder and CEO of SWORD Health launched the company after a traumatic personal experience during which he personally witnessed how challenging it is for families to recover from a health event. SWORD Health has developed clinically validated digital solutions that work across all the major musculoskeletal issues, at any point in the journey, from prevention to acute conditions, chronic pain or post-surgical recovery. \u201cThis investment round will enable SWORD Health to accelerate its mission to free two billion people from physical pain through more personalised MSK based offerings\u2014from prevention to post-surgical care\u2014while still remaining at the forefront of value-based digital MSK care and expanding local and global operations among self-insured employers, health plans and other entities\u201d Virgilio Bento, founder and CEO of SWORD Health The Series D funding was led by Sapphire Ventures and other investors such as Sozo Ventures, Willoughby Capital, ADQ, and Localglobe.", "eit319": "Under the Deep Demonstrations programme \u201cForging Resilience in Dolomites\u201d, the authorities of four Dolomite provinces have for the first time jointly discussed climate change adaptation measures. The portfolio of co-designed actions touches on areas such as transboundary cooperation, education, youth mobilisation and democratisation of climate action in rural areas. This long-term process, which began in 2019, aims to support communities in the Dolomites to foster the resilience and production chains to extreme climate-related events. It also addresses the economic and financial uncertainties and the resulting social changes. The process brought together partners such as the Edmund Mach Foundation, the Innovation Hub Trentino and the University of Trento, Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering (DICAM). The Dolomites area, comprising four territories: the Veneto Region, the Autonomous Region of Friuli Venezia Giulia and the Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano, is known for its high natural, artistic and cultural heritage and has been recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 2009. These landscapes attract several million visitors every year, but also experience an aggravation of extreme weather events such as landslide and debris flows, storms, heavy rains and droughts. Climate lesson learned In 2018, the region was hit by a severe storm, Storm Vaia (or Storm Adrian) which caused massive damage to the mountain ecosystem. The winds, which reached 220 km/h, knocking down about eight million cubic metres of timber, and massive rain that caused flooding, killed eleven people in two days. The storm affected the forest-timber value chain and related activities such as tourism and agriculture. This highlights the dramatic consequences that extreme weather phenomena have on the environment, the economy and people\u2019s lives in the region. \u201cWe have been concerned for many years about how climate change is affecting our region and how nature is changing. That is why we decided to join the EIT Climate-KIC community in 2017, but we focused even more intensely on resilience after storm Vaia hit our land. This raised the issue of resilience \u2013 the community was shocked and became determined to improve adaptation measures to prevent damage of this scale in the future. This turning point convinced us to move forward with the collaboration and to join the Race to Resilience programme.\u201d Alessandro Gretter, Senior Technologist from the Edmund Mach Foundation. The storm also brought together a sub-regional community of residents and institutions who decided to act together to repair the storm damage by planting new trees or reusing the damaged wood to make speakers or other products out of the fallen timber. Together for a better tomorrow The devastation caused by Storm Vaia has also prompted regional authorities and regional institutions to adopt resilience measures and develop adaptation strategies. This has led to an unusual cross-border collaboration between municipalities in the four regions, which until this point had been isolated from each other and not working together. \u201cThere has been an amazing collaboration of people from different provinces and different sectors of society like city governments, business, education, sitting around the same table for the first time, and envisioning a sustainable future together. It gave them the opportunity to talk to each other, to collaborate and to think outside the box. These climate challenges do not care about administrative boundaries. The problem can only be solved if we manage to build a relationship that goes beyond them.\u201d Alessandro Gretter, Senior Technologist from the Edmund Mach Foundation. Building an inclusive community The collaboration has developed a portfolio of activities focused on three main areas: forestry and agriculture, tourism and community engagement. Activities related to forestry focus on promoting long-term conservation and biodiversity while maintaining productivity, mapping ecosystem services at the local level and modeling and forecasting the impacts on forests, promoting the development of insurance scheme for the forest ecosystem services (with the pathfinder project \u201cHolistic Resilience\u201d). The project also focuses on promoting sustainable tourism, flexibility and sustainable management of tourist flows, and how to mitigate and compensate the impacts of tourism. The initiative also aims to identify strategies and tools to support innovation in mountain areas, but also new technologies and new collaborations for warning systems that can reach remote areas. Current activities also focus on engaging citizens and tourists in mitigation strategies, as well as skills and capacity building among the younger generation. The power of youth Social innovation is more than relevant. Building an active community and investing in youth is forward thinking because they will become our leaders one day. Young people in the Dolomites already feel empathy for the topics of climate emergency. The idea is to involve youth from different parts of the Dolomites, not only from bigger cities but also from rural, scattered regions. Alessandro Gretter, Senior Technologist from the Edmund Mach Foundation. Since people in rural regions are more vulnerable to extreme weather events, the project emphasises democratising climate action in non-urban areas. This requires greater engagement from the local community, but according to Gretter, there is already a big shift in mindset that is taking place over the years. In order to mobilise the younger generation and get them more involved in community building activities, educational and cultural programmes are being carried out to find talent and draw their attention to climate change. For a number of years, there has been an educational programme for young people, giving selected participants the chance to attend the UN climate change conference. This year, twelve Trentino university students and researchers had the opportunity to attend COP26. The idea is to gain knowledge and experience and upon their return to put their new ideas into practice locally. To engage people in climate action, partners in the region also organise Climathon and many more initiatives. EIT Climate-KIC is proud to be a partner of the UN High Level Champion\u2019s Race to Resilience campaign, which is working to step-up global ambition for climate resilience in the run-up to COP26 and beyond.

We are now entering an even more exciting stage as we are starting to reap the rewards of our hard work. The European Commission has welcomed ERMA\u2019s Action Plan on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors, and we are looking forward to our close collaboration with Commissioner Breton. We see the need to ramp up investment in the sector to secure Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy in critical raw materials for the green and digital transition. I am happy to announce ERMA\u2019s plan to frame a raw materials investment fund in 2022. I encourage our sector to mobilise forces with us. It\u2019s time to act! Bernd Sch\u00e4fer, CEO and Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials The establishment of ERMA was announced in September 2020 as part of an Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials and the publication of the 2020 List of Critical Raw Materials. The European Commission mandated EIT RawMaterials to lead ERMA. Currently, the Alliance ecosystem comprises universities, RTOs, trade unions, NGOs, national authorities and ministries, financial institutions, associations and industry. ERMA partners bring expertise in primary raw materials, advanced materials and intermediate products, final products and recycling. Launch of investment channel The strategic scope of ERMA entails the identification of investment cases to build capacities across raw materials value chains, from mining to recovery and product design for a circular economy. ERMA has already identified over 30 investment proposals on projects from across the value chain with a value of EUR 11 billion. We encourage you to submit your project proposal. Strengthening the domestic supply chain of rare earth magnets and motors Launched in December 2020, the first Cluster of ERMA on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors brings together nearly 400 members to deal with one of the most critical value chains for many key EU industrial ecosystems. Rare earth permanent magnets are vital for wind power, electric mobility, and communications technology; however, more than 90% of rare earth magnets are currently produced in China. Ensuring a sustainable supply of rare earth magnets and motors is crucial for the green future of Europe. A European Call for Action On 30 September 2021, the ERMA Cluster on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors published Rare Earth Magnets and Motors: A European Call for Action, a report presenting current and projected European demand for Rare Earth Elements and the urgent steps which should be taken to secure their supply. Get your copy! Supporting the domestic production of raw and advanced materials for the battery value chain in Europe The second Cluster of ERMA on Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion was launched in February 2021. Our partners are working in four task forces with a special focus on supply chains for green energy technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolysers, battery materials, alternative energy storage and conversion, materials in solar energy. The cluster is working on the list of action points addressing the key raw materials issues of the energy storage and conversion sector, which will be presented in an action plan next year. Next steps for the Alliance After publishing the Cluster 1 Action Plan, ERMA will work closely with the European Commission and Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for Internal Market, to integrate the outlined actions in the framework and timeline of EU policies. Alignment and integration with other activities and agenda of the European Commission are important to consider in this process. The Cluster 2 Action Plan release is another important milestone that we aim to achieve in the first half of next year. We want to make sure that we collect and process the full scope of valuable feedback from our community and other organisations outside the community. This will make the plan stronger. ERMA has also taken the lead in the newly established Task Force on Clean Tech Materials. The new Task Force will identify funding opportunities and identify eligibility criteria for projects to boost investment capacity. ERMA will continue to grow and consolidate the partnership while extending its geographic coverage. The strength of ERMA is in its ability to integrate the activities along the entire raw materials value chain and develop industries around these activities. This will continue to be the key focus area of ERMA. The Alliance wants to consolidate ERMA\u2019s role, international impact and visibility. ERMA will work closely with the European Commission and DG GROW to target specific parts of the world that are important in their strategic development agenda, such as Australia, Canada, Ukraine and the United States. Our goal is to extend our portfolio of investment cases and continue to support high-impact projects and drive their success. Join ERMA", "eit322": "The built environment accounts for close to 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions globally. And with cities becoming increasingly populated and growing rapidly, there is an urgent need to make construction more sustainable by seeking alternative low-emission materials. EIT Climate-KIC is partnering with Laudes Foundation\u2019s Built by Nature to achieve just that, working with the cities of Milan and Madrid as testbeds for innovation. Using a mass timber superstructure in buildings would not only require less steel and concrete but also deliver a lighter foundation, reducing building embodied emissions by almost a third, according to a study by EIT Climate-KIC partner Materials Economics. This presents a big opportunity for the construction sector to transition to more sustainable practices and have a positive impact on the planet and society. To support this transition, Laudes Foundation has launched Built by Nature, a multi-million euro grant-making fund and network that aim to drive forward the timber building transformation and fully decarbonise the built environment \u2013 working with nature, not against it. The initiative includes an accelerator fund to help businesses bring positive climate impact by developing solutions that scale up timber building from sustainably sourced forests. Additionally, a network is being launched that connects key actors across the built environment and forest communities through national and city networks and events. This will result in increased research, innovation and regulatory work needed to go beyond pilots and spark city-scale projects, and will amplify the stories of ground-breaking timber projects and solutions, changing perceptions around construction with timber. The initiative includes a range of partners enacting positive change such as Bauhaus der Erde, the Centre for Natural Material Innovation at the University of Cambridge, the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (CNCA), Cities4Forests and EIT Climate-KIC. EIT Climate-KIC joined Built by Nature through its \u201cHealthy, Clean Cities: European Cities for Carbon-Neutral Construction\u201d (HCC EU CINCO) project, working with developers, designers, investors, asset owners and insurers, alongside policymakers and city leaders in the municipalities of Milan and Madrid to shape the market for circular and bio-based embodied carbon neutral buildings. The project integrates the systemic approach of EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s Deep Demonstration methodology, bringing transdisciplinary, cross-cutting alignment towards shared societal goals, with the objective to: Reduce Scope 3 emissions from the production of materials in buildings and infrastructure Better integrate circularity principles in the built environment Redesign supply chains in two regeneration projects in the cities to increase use of bio-based materials, sequester carbon, and replace more carbon-intensive Ensure collective learning, so that the two participating cities, Milan and Madrid, share knowledge and experience.", "eit323": "The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is pleased to announce the EIT HEI Initiative\u2019s new call for proposals supporting up to 40 consortia of higher education institutions (HEIs) and non-academic organisations with a maximum of EUR 1.2 million each. With the support of the EIT Community, Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem, HEIs will design activities that will improve their entrepreneurial and innovation capacity at all levels becoming engines of innovation. Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth said: \u2018'Higher education institutions are at the heart of Europe's innovation and industrial ecosystems. The additional support offered by the EIT Community to boost the innovation capacity of higher education institutions across Europe is fully in line with the Commission's priorities. I look forward to seeing these priorities translated into concrete actions that will help achieve our objectives of supporting the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators that will transform global challenges into opportunities for the future.\" Gioia Ghezzi, Chair of the EIT Governing Board added \u2018During Europe\u2019s recovery it is more important than ever that our Higher Education Institutions play an even stronger role in helping their students to become innovators and in turning research into concrete solutions. Boosting innovation capacity in Higher Education is a key priority for the EIT and we already work with hundreds of HEIs through our Knowledge and Innovation Communities. It is therefore only natural that we mobilised Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem to make a systemic impact, improving entrepreneurial and innovation capacity of HEIs. This new call will increase the number of universities we support and will help us to deliver the innovations needed for a more sustainable future. The EIT HEI pilot initiative builds on the success of its first call launched earlier this year which saw close to 750 organisations from across Europe apply for support. As a result, the pilot awarded 24 projects involving 142 HEIs and 155 non-academic organisations (companies, research centres, public authorities and associations) a total of EUR 28.8 million of funding, mentorship, and access to the EIT\u2019s innovation ecosystem.

The agreement, signed today at the UNFCCC COP26, will promote knowledge sharing and project collaboration opportunities between California\u2019s state agencies, facilitated by the Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Research, and EIT Climate-KIC and its partners across Europe. \u201cIn the spirit of international cooperation that the UN Climate Change Conference embodies, the Office of Planning and Research is pleased to create this global peer-learning partnership with the EU\u2019s EIT Climate-KIC. For decades the European Union and California have demonstrated climate leadership and innovation, and our team at OPR looks forward to accelerating climate action with the EIT Climate-KIC team and network.\u201d Sam Assefa, Director of the Office of Planning and Research For the past year, EIT Climate-KIC has been working closely with the Office of Planning and Research to learn and collaborate on projects that bring together both European and Californian innovation and solutions to climate challenges. \u201cThe message from COP26 could not be clearer: we need exponential change in decarbonisation rates and strengthened climate resilience \u2013 and we need it now. This cross-Atlantic collaboration exemplifies our shared vision to take climate innovation to the next level and dramatically accelerate climate action. By bringing our innovation ecosystems together, we combine multiple solutions into rapid experimentation and acceleration loops, working in partnership with governments, local businesses and global industry, communities, and innovators, to build new economic models, new value chains and greater public/private value.\u201d Kirsten Dunlop, Chief Executive Officer at EIT Climate-KIC The Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Research is the State of California\u2019s long-range planning and research agency charged with guiding local and state climate adaptation and resilience efforts, supporting an equitable economic transition, and investing in community resilience. EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s mission is to catalyse systemic change through innovation in areas of human activity that have a critical impact on greenhouse gas emissions (such as cities, land use, materials and finance) and to create climate-resilient communities. Together, OPR and EIT Climate-KIC will co-design and execute peer learning opportunities to support existing and new projects, including OPR\u2019s Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resilience Program and the Community Economic Resilience Fund, as well as EIT Climate-KIC Healthy, Clean Cities Deep Demonstration. They will also explore new financing mechanisms to accelerate investment in areas such as building retrofits, electrification of public transport, agriculture, renewable energy, and high road industries and jobs. \u201cShared vision and a culture of knowledge exchange are critical to limiting global temperature increases to 1.5C. We\u2019re already witnessing the devastating impacts of climate change in California, highlighting the urgency to support a community of global practice and exchange that can more rapidly deploy solutions here in California and beyond.\u201d Nuin-Tara Key, Deputy Director of Climate Resilience at the Office of Research and Planning Shared Vision to Equitably Achieve Carbon Neutrality The State of California will achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, having adopted ambitious emissions reduction targets across its sectors, transforming its economy, and placing equity and communities at the centre of the transition. Leading the nation and world in climate action, California has become a model for how to aggressively address climate change while growing its economy. The state\u2019s forward-thinking approach and progressive policies have helped exceed its 2020 climate target four years ahead of schedule and created six times more clean jobs than fossil fuel jobs. The European Green Deal will transform the European Union into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy by ensuring no net emissions of greenhouse gasses by 2050; ensuring economic growth decoupled from resource use; and no person and no place left behind. EIT Climate-KIC is actively supporting the implementation of the EU Green Deal through research and innovation programs, including helping 100 cities to rapidly decarbonise through the NetZeroCities programme. Progress on California and the EU\u2019s climate agenda necessitates continued driving down of emissions across sectors, moving adaptation to the centre of the agenda, increasing community resilience amidst climatic events, and support for communities, cities, and regions as key implementing partners.", "eit327": "A new digital Global Innovation Hub has been launched at COP 26 by UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) to significantly boost the effectiveness and scale of climate change and sustainability innovation as a driver of more ambitious climate action. To achieve this, the hub will have new approaches to facilitate the development and deployment of transformative and innovative climate solutions. The hub promotes a \u201cmoonshot approach\u201d which will assist practitioners to base climate action pledges and commitments on what science says is needed, as opposed to what is perceived as possible with current solutions and technologies. The initiative is launched by the UN Climate Change and supported by core partner organizations such as EIT Climate-KIC, the Research Institute of Sweden (RISE), the European Commission, Mission Innovation, and the Open Earth Foundation. In its recent Working Group 1 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that limiting global average temperature increases to 1.5C requires a reduction of CO2 emissions of 45% in 2030. Yet current emission reduction pledges fall far short. Unless urgent action is taken, the current level of ambition is likely to put the world on course for a 2.7C average temperature increase and ever-increasing extreme weather events. Significantly greater ambition is thus required to keep the 1.5C goal within reach. Current pledges often fall short because they are based on the perceptions of what can be achieved in the context of current climate solutions and technologies. The hub aims to support the translation of commitments and pledges into demand for climate and sustainability solutions that will drive the identification or development of innovative responses and their effective implementation. Innovative responses beyond current solutions mean that pledges and commitments can become significantly more ambitious. The hub is a digital platform that hosts (i) databases of demand for solutions as well as solutions, (ii) tools to determine the impact of climate action and (iii) a space to facilitate the financing of climate solutions. The hub sets the agenda for an expanded space of climate innovation for all practitioners. It showcases people\u2019s everyday needs, such as mobility, access to goods and services, and social connection. The hub then fosters the development of innovative climate-friendly responses beyond any status-quo solutions such as cars or conventional power and, importantly, without focusing on one single solution in isolation. For example, instead of focusing only on the development of EV cars, the hub will promote climate innovations that challenge the need for a car in the first place. It will explore options for the design of compact and complete cities connected with low carbon public transportation that will reduce the need for mobility. It will even go one step further and challenge mobility as a need to have access to products and services. For example, it will develop solutions that replace trips to get a product or a service the same way online shopping replaced trips to shops. These solutions will enable greater climate action ambition, be aligned with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and enable the repurposing, as much as possible, of the knowledge, skills and physical assets of disrupted value chains. The solutions offered by the platform are integrated with each other to form a cluster of solutions that can include technologies, policies and regulations, business models, and financing instruments that reflect a holistic approach. Because the development of a solution is demand-driven and the solutions are integrated to form a cluster, the hub will not stockpile underdeveloped inventions as is often the case with innovation platforms. The Global Innovation Hub will have world-class standards in line with the Paris Agreement goals for impact assessment of climate change solutions. The hub will have a physical pavilion at COP where events are organized to express demand for climate solutions or to broadcast solutions. All interested practitioners are invited to visit the hub.

We believe that inclusive systems innovation, which enables all people and places to participate and benefit, is essential to a strong food system that is better for everyone. This requires us all to work together to come up with innovative solutions to the huge food challenges our world is currently facing. Supported by the EU, we invest in projects, organisations and individuals that share our goals for a healthy and sustainable food system. This is helping us to unlock innovation potential in businesses and universities and create and scale agrifood startups to bring new technologies and products to market. The innovation projects we support are delivered with a combination of industry, education and research partners to improve environmental and health outcomes by developing solutions in the most promising innovation areas. This joined-up approach helps us to ensure that solutions are designed to take into account the diverse perspectives of different actors in the food chain. The innovation areas we focus on include alternative proteins, circular food systems, digital traceability, sustainable agriculture, sustainable aquaculture and targeted nutrition. A new innovation funding call, open to everyone For the past five years, EIT Food has launched a series of innovation funding calls, which have been open to current members of our community.

The Citizen Participation Forum (CPF) took place between late 2020 and early 2021 in order to gain a deeper understanding of consumer attitudes towards the food chain, particularly the role trust plays in that relationship. The Forum involved an online community of 178 participants from 13 European countries, who engaged in open discussions, photo assignments, questionnaires, short polls and five live focus group sessions. Trust in the food chain is vital to encourage people to eat more healthily and sustainably. The insights from the CPF were used to co-create three key themes which play a role in influencing consumers to eat more healthily, more sustainably, and to be more open towards food innovation. Barriers and motivations The CPF found that motivation to adopt a healthier and more sustainable diet is high, and that most consumers have a good idea of what a healthier diet is. However, there are large differences in people\u2019s ability to eat healthily and many struggle due to factors such as price, knowledge and time. Furthermore, although most consumers report they would like to eat sustainably, it is often not a primary consideration when making food choices. \u201cI am prepared to adopt a more sustainable diet such as organic food if I can find it easily in stores but it\u2019s often very expensive; only a few products can be purchased each month because of my budget, or I try to take advantage of promotions to buy more.\u201d Olivier, FR, 54 Pathways to trust Consumers suggested a range of solutions for building trust which can be grouped into three main areas: Transparency and control: Make the food chain transparent so that everyone can see what is happening and make informed choices as a result. Make the food chain transparent so that everyone can see what is happening and make informed choices as a result. Simplicity: Increase simplicity to make it easier to know what good food is, how it is produced and where it comes from. Increase simplicity to make it easier to know what good food is, how it is produced and where it comes from. Building love: Foster deep and genuine affection for (a certain) food to enhance trust. EIT Food has been studying consumer trust in the food chain since 2018, and this is the latest report we have published on this important issue. The knowledge we gained from previous studies was used to inform the dialogue in the CPF and enabled us to focus the discussion on specific topics. \u201cThis is an incredibly important study. We know that trust plays an important role in the food system, and we are working with consumers to explore what that means to them. We need to reconnect people with their food in order to build trust. Insights from consumers who have engaged with the CPF are helping us to identify ways of doing this.

Coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, the four-year project will support European cities in drastically cutting down greenhouse gas emissions to achieve climate neutrality, one of the biggest challenges our societies face today. NetZeroCities is funded by the Horizon Europe Framework Programme, supporting the European Green Deal in building a low-carbon, climate resilient future through research and innovation. In response to the current climate emergency and objectives set out by the Paris Agreement, Europe has pledged to lead on climate action and cut its emissions by 55 percent by 2030, with the objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. As cities keep growing and increasingly represent centres of economic activity, knowledge generation and hubs for innovation and technology, their role in the climate transition is more important than ever. In a context where fast and rapid decarbonisation needs to occur, cities have a leading role to play: not just in meeting the climate goals and targets set out by international policy frameworks, but in ensuring our decarbonisation efforts are equitable and contribute to the wellbeing of European communities. To achieve this, NetZeroCities is bringing together 33 partners from 13 countries to help cities overcome the current structural, institutional and cultural barriers they face in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. This will be achieved through: Development of a service-oriented platform supported by world-class practitioners Co-creation of solutions needed to achieve net-zero goals in a socially-inclusive way Capacity building on systemic change, citizen engagement and democratic governance, capital and financial structuring, and social innovation Development and promotion of new and existing tools, resources, and expertise into a one-stop shop platform that will be accessible to all cities through an online portal Support of up to 30 pilot cities to help drive rapid learning about how to achieve climate neutrality at the city scale. This will ultimately enable European cities and citizens to show the way forward towards an inclusive, thriving, climate resilient and sustainable future, and contribute to the European Union\u2019s Mission 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 by seeking to scale the activities of this project across 100 cities, and to tackle the unprecedented capital investments needed to make such a transformation possible. Achieving this level of impact will be an extraordinary undertaking for each and every city and will require profound and systemic changes. Government leadership will be critical, and actions by industry, civil society, education and research institutions must align in terms of policies, governance and arrangements for needed capital investments. NetZeroCities is coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, Europe\u2019s largest public-private innovation partnership focused on climate innovation to mitigate and adapt to climate change, set up by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).

Entitled Rare Earth Magnets and Motors: A European Call for Action, the report outlines current and projected European demand for Rare Earth Elements and steps which should be taken to secure their supply. The EU has committed to the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050. The raw materials needs to facilitate this energy transition are massive, and Europe urgently needs to secure their supply. This Action Plan outlines the steps we must take to ensure that the rare earth elements upon which the EU Green Deal relies remain available for European industry and society. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer, CEO of EIT RawMaterials \u2013 the Innovation Community which manages the European Raw Materials Alliance The demand for high energy density rare earth permanent magnets is growing exponentially. They are vital for applications like wind power, electric mobility, and communications technology, making their supply crucial to the European Union\u2019s stated ambition to transition to a green, digital economy. While the EU is a world leader in the manufacturing of electric motors, it is almost fully import dependent regarding rare earth permanent magnets, more than 90% of which are produced in China. The Commission\u2019s in-depth review of critical supply chains and key technologies has highlighted the EU\u2019s high level of foreign dependency on inputs required for our green and digital transition and our continent\u2019s resilience. The EU depends on others \u2013 mainly China \u2013 for the import of permanent magnets, as well as the rare earth elements they are made of. The European Raw Materials Alliance plays a key role in addressing these dependencies. Thierry Breton, EU Commissioner for Internal Market The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) is addressing the main challenges connected to raw materials supply for Europe in thematic clusters. The first of these topical clusters is the ERMA Cluster on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors. With the input of more than 180 industry stakeholders, ERMA has developed the Action Plan to highlight the challenges related to the highly vulnerable global rare earth supply chain and to provide specific actions that the EU, its Member States, industry, and innovation communities should implement with the aim of triggering a disruptive change to diversify EU supply chains. The Action Plan contains 12 actions that are summarised in four key recommendations: European policymakers will need to create a level playing field, since the cost of EU production is intrinsically higher than the Chinese production cost, which is massively lowered by a set of direct and indirect state subsidies. European OEMs (original equipment providers, in this case the producers of components making use of rare earths) will need to consider potential commitments to buying a significant percentage share of rare earth materials from European producers. The EU will need to ensure that end-of-life products and waste materials containing rare earths stay in Europe, facilitating their reprocessing and recycling. There is a unique opportunity to trigger large private investments in the emerging European rare earths value chain by match funding. For this reason, the EU and its Member States should pull all financial levers including state aid, such as a dedicated Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI). The European Raw Materials Alliance is currently working on a second Action Plan covering materials for energy storage and conversion, such as batteries, fuel cells, solar and hydrogen and other alternative energy storage and conversion systems.

Tons of food that could have a new life is thrown away or lost around the world every day. The International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste is the perfect opportunity to reflect on how innovation can help prevent food waste on a planet where hunger has inevitably increased since 2014. International and local organisations are called upon to take immediate action to curb a phenomenon that damages food security and harms climate change. Maximising the use of the food produced and minimising waste should be the goals of a sustainable and resilient food system. The examples offered by the EIT Community combine new technologies and straightforward ideas. The following are some of the success stories that engage in food system change on a daily basis. KITRO With the support of EIT Climate-Kic, KITRO has succeeded in developing a tool to quantify food waste in kitchens from households to professionals. With the ambition to minimise food waste, KITRO is a fully automated system that aims to eliminate human error and perform tasks efficiently. The aim is to bring the value of food back into the focus and support companies and people that encourage this effort. \u201cAs KITRO\u2019s use becomes more widespread in commercial kitchens, private households will also pay more attention and help achieve a \u201cminimal food waste\u201d society.\u201d Anastasia Hofmann, Kitro\u2019s co-founder. Follow KITRO on Instagram , Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn Mimica Mimica, a start-up part of EIT Food's RisingFoodStars, is one of the most promising solutions to prevent food waste. Its product, Mimica Touch, is a label that determines the effective preservability of a food product, whose shelf life for precautionary reasons - would be underestimated. 60% of wasted food is still perfectly edible. Here Mimica Touch comes in. It manages, through the temperature of the food, to establish a shelf life longer than the one on supermarket labels. A simple but innovative idea that sustainably looks to the future. \u201cI really believe we can inspire positive behaviour change. We don\u2019t need to be wasting the amount that we\u2019re wasting today. We just need to put some collaborative thought into how to make it better.\u201d Solveiga Pak\u0161tait\u0117, Director and Founder of Mimica Orbisk Orbisk, yet another success story from the EIT Food family, is a start-up that minimises food waste with Artificial Intelligence through image recognition. Orbisk sets up a monitor in large professional kitchens which quantifies and selects the food that is thrown away to increase the quality and efficiency of the food production chain. \u201cEverybody who works in food has an opportunity but also a responsibility. We need to take care of our Earth and there\u2019s only one thing to do, and that\u2019s to take action,\u201d Richard Beks, CCO of Orbisk.

The International Day of Clean Air for blue skies, in its second edition, is a United Nations initiative aimed at raising society's awareness regarding the level of pollution in the air people breathe every day. It has been estimated that nine out of every ten people are breathing unclear air, causing an increase in the number of deaths related to respiratory diseases each year. Immediate action is needed locally and globally to counteract the impact that air pollution levels are having on the entire ecosystem. Human health is only one of the elements put at risk, but it certainly needs to be addressed urgently concerning the changes in respiratory habits linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. The EIT Community is leading the change with some success stories that cannot be missed on this day. Climeworks With the purpose of cleaning the air from CO2 and then reusing it, Climeworks has been part of the EIT Community since 2012 when it obtained the first grants to develop a proof of concept in the direction of a zero-carbon economy. Nearly ten years later, Climeworks is a global leader in clearing the air from CO2 and plans to keep expanding to capture 1% of global CO2 by 2025. Indeed, after graduating from the EIT Climate Kic Accelerator business incubator programme in 2013, Climeworks has continued to build a pan-European support network that led to its inclusion on Bill Gates' Breakthrough Technologies list in 2019. Today, at the forefront of change, Climeworks is ready to make true pioneers out of all those who want to, removing CO2 in their name. If you wish to be part of the change, contribute here. Leading scientific studies indicate that by mid-century 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide will need to be removed from the air every year. Direct air capture is one solution that can help achieve this goal. In order to scale direct air capture up to the levels required, we need to start today and #actnow. Climeworks Green City Solutions Have you ever thought that moss could save city streets from daily pollution?

The report finds that global warming of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occur in the coming decades. The report also finds that human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. These felt effects came into sharper relief for Europeans recently; as of July 2021, several countries have been affected by floods, including the United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Croatia and Italy. At least 229 people have died in the floods, including 184 in Germany, 42 in Belgium, one in Italy, one in Austria and one in Romania. Recently, wildfires broke out in Greece over a week-long heatwave and have displaced over 2,000 people. \u201cThe latest report from the IPCC underlines the urgency of action to reverse climate change and regenerate our planet. 2050 is too late. We need to push for net-zero by 2030 to avoid catastrophic climate change effects. For this, we urgently need to accelerate and implement innovation for climate action at all scales and in integrated, holistic ways.\u201d said Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC. \u201cThe risk of not acting is far greater by orders of magnitude than the risk of acting. We have everything to lose by not trying.\u201d The current state of the climate It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Improved knowledge of climate processes, paleoclimate evidence and the response of the climate system to increasing radiative forcing gives a best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3\u00b0C, with a narrower range compared to AR5. Figure SPM.1: History of global temperature change and causes of recent warming, Sixth Assessment Report, IPCC, 2021 Possible climate futures Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least the mid-century under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades. Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. They include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, and heavy precipitation, agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions, and proportion of intense tropical cyclones, as well as reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost. Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation and the severity of wet and dry events. Under scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the ocean and land carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries to millennia, especially changes in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level. Limiting future climate change From a physical science perspective, limiting human-induced global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. Strong, rapid and sustained reductions in CH4 emissions would also limit the warming effect resulting from declining aerosol pollution and would improve air quality. Scenarios with low or very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions lead within years to discernible effects on greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, and air quality, relative to high and very high GHG emissions scenarios. Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years, and over longer time periods for many other climatic impact-drivers.

It supports the development of local innovative healthcare projects based in progressing European regions. Its aim is to bridge the funding gap in EIT RIS regions and to support the proof-of-concept phase of local innovation projects, as well as to help teams in their EIT Health innovation journey. Projects are supported by funding, mentoring and training services, and further strengthened by networking opportunities. Additionally, participants are given the chance to be matched with EIT Health partners, to apply to the EIT Health Amplifier Programme and to prepare teams to be scouted for EIT Health Business Plan Innovation Calls. Impact of past EIT Health RIS Innovation Calls Since it began three years ago, the EIT Health RIS Innovation Call has supported a number of success stories. Just one example is STEMI, an innovation to save critical time diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. The Slovak project supported in 2019 won the 2021 EIT Health Bridgehead Global. It also reached the top at the House of Med Tech Luxembourg Call as well as at the Central European Initiative (CEI) \u201cEarly response COVID 19\u201d category \u2013 and ranked fifth in the GLOBAL Unicorn Cup in 2020. Another 2019 winner was DocuMental, with an innovation to improve diagnostic and treatment reliability in mental health. According to DocuMental CEO Eduard Maron: \u201cPeople from EIT Health look at your project as a whole: how comprehensive it is, how well it is designed from a scientific perspective, as well as how it will be disseminated. I have learned how we need to change our concept. We would all like to help patients; that\u2019s not the question. The question is how to make it realistic, and how to make it successful. This is what we have learnt from EIT Health.\u201d", "eit357": "Episode 6 of Conversations in the Park sparked an insightful discussion about the ideal city of the future. Guests offered their hopes and vision on what the ideal city can look like. Anna Clark, President of Women EIT, describes it as somewhere greener, cleaner, quieter. Augustin Friedel, Corporate & Sustainability Strategy VW Brand at Volkswagen AG, sees it as a city where mobility is more diverse, a mixture between shared and personal transport modes and hopefully more active mobility. Mouchka Heller, Automotive and Autonomous Mobility Lead at World Economic Forum, stresses the importance of a human-centric approach. So, what is the ideal city of the future and how do we build it? A report by the European Commission outlines these steps in making our cities smarter and greener. Reliable, affordable, and safe public transport is a key to sustainable mobility. Rather than focusing on low fares, agencies should develop an incentivising, time-varying pricing scheme. Like the one in Singapore. Introduction of Mobile navigation apps, so users can have data on the best way to get from A to B, such as Barcelona\u2019s LIVE platform. Initiating dialogue with major employers to introduce more flexible working hours, so traffic does not coincide with home-to-work and work-to-home trips Many are citing Paris as an example city of the future, with its 15 Minute neighbourhood initiative. Essentially the idea is to provide everything a person would need within a 15-minute walking distance; hence reducing the need for cars and vehicles and relying more on walking and cycling. Such an initiative would improve citizens\u2019 health, both because of more movement and the reduction of harmful pollution from fossil fuels. And, of course, there are the general environmental benefits of fewer carbon emissions. On a different scale, reducing the need for cars would improve equality, as it becomes cheaper to move around. The initiative has proven very effective among Parisians and in 2019 alone, Paris managed to reduce car traffic by 8%. It\u2019s not a secret that the pandemic dramatically changed the way we move and what we need from our cities. Most of us worked from home, reducing the morning and evening commute and hence traffic. Mouchka Heller describes how our cities are currently designed around the typical 9-5 worker, which excludes many. With everyone re-thinking when and how they work, that raises the need to re-think mobility infrastructure. The NYC challenge is one example of that. Augustin Friedel talks about the importance of tailoring solutions to the specific city, rather than using a copy-paste approach. The abundance of new mobility modes which have grown rapidly over the past five years, from e-scooters to ride-sharing, means cities can adopt an \u00e0 la carte approach, and incorporate what does \u2013 or doesn\u2019t \u2013 work best for them. Mouchka Heller also highlights that our approach has shifted from owning a mobility solution to needing a service to get from A to B and then B to C and onwards, resulting in a multi-modal journey. In the above article, Imogen Pierce, Head of City Engagement and Integration at ARRIVAL, says \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a fundamental shift where public transport operators are not viewing other modes of transport as competitors, but more as critical elements of the overall transport system that they need to work closely with.\u201d There is certainly a lot to be discussed about the future of urban areas and what we want them to be. The pandemic only accelerated this process by giving us a different perspective and shifting our needs and priorities. It is now up to us and the \u2018designers\u2019 of our cities to turn that vision into a reality. In the podcast episode speakers discuss baby steps that need to be taken, as well as some challenges to achieving this vision. They also discuss whether there is good or bad mobility, and will the car ever be made completely redundant?

The research commissioned by EIT Food, the world's largest food innovation ecosystem, supported by the EIT, surveyed over 2,000 18\u201324-year-olds from across the UK, France, Germany, Poland, and Spain. The findings point to a generation that is very interested, knowledgeable, and entrepreneurial when it comes to their eating habits, and especially how they link to their wellbeing and mental health. Download the full report, Our Food, Our Food System Over half of 18-24 year olds (52%) track their food in some way, though this figure differentiates starkly across countries, rising to 65% of young people in Germany compared to just 38% in France. This suggests that Gen Z are very interested and engaged with their eating habits. The majority of this tracking (36% of young people) is focused on counting calories, however, a quarter of all young people (24%) also track the macronutrients (or \u201cmacros\u201d) of the food they eat. These savvy Gen-Zers prefer whole, organic, and plant-based foods as some of their healthiest options, and 79% consider processed foods unhealthy. Ongoing attention to health amidst the Covid-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of the importance of this to young people, with over half (58%) saying the pandemic has made them more aware of eating healthily. Meanwhile, two-thirds (67%) say that healthy food is simply fashionable at the moment. Advice gap leads young people to rely on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram for healthy eating tips Despite this keen interest and engagement with healthy eating, young people feel they aren\u2019t getting the support they need from educators, industry, and policy makers to do so. Three-quarters (75%) say they need clearer advice on how to eat a healthy, balanced diet, with two-thirds (65%) reporting they didn\u2019t get enough education on how to eat healthily while at school. Having a trusted, reliable source of information was identified as being vital by many respondents, with just under two thirds (61%) reporting they feel it can be hard to know how to eat healthily as there is so much conflicting advice. Young people are looking for more detailed information from brands, especially when it comes to how food is made. Nearly eight in 10 young people (78%) would like food labels to have clearer information on the way food is processed, not just the ingredients, while three-quarters (75%) think food brands need to be more transparent with consumers about their ingredients and processes. Young people are taking things into their own hands and attempting to fill this advice gap themselves, with two-thirds (67%) reporting they regularly look at social media content (such as TikTok or Instagram) about healthy food and healthy recipe ideas. Over half (52%), meanwhile, say they rely on social media or their friends for advice on eating healthily. Gen Z want advice that doesn\u2019t harm their mental health As part of this advice, young people want a narrative around healthy eating that doesn\u2019t risk being harmful to their mental health \u2013 such as by focusing too much on calories alone. In fact, just over half of young people surveyed (55%) think that including calorie counts on food labels and menus can be detrimental to people\u2019s mental health \u2013 a figure that rises to six in 10 in the UK (62%), France (60%) and Germany (61%). What\u2019s more, young people don\u2019t necessarily see low calorie foods as automatically healthy: just 54% do, while a third (34%) consider them to be unhealthy. Instead, nearly eight in 10 (77%) say young people need better advice on the link between what they eat and their mental health, a figure that rises to 82% of young women. Access and affordability key to promoting healthy eating When it comes to how to encourage young people to eat healthily, discounted or subsidised healthy food ranked highest amongst respondents (43%) \u2013 which is little surprise given that two-thirds (67%) think that healthy food is more expensive than unhealthy food. Having access to healthier options was also key for a third of respondents (37%), whether for home delivered food (such as through Uber Eats or Deliveroo) or at school, college, and university. This is being driven by a lack of existing options in food environments, with seven in 10 young people (73%) finding it difficult to eat healthily while on the go, or at their place of education or work. Self-starting Gen Z look to careers in food innovation When considering careers in the food sector, their interest in healthy eating is leading many young people to pursue jobs in food education, innovation, and equality over more traditional routes such as hospitality or farming. Two-thirds of young people would consider taking a job in food education (66%) or food innovation (64%), the highest ranking of all roles across the food sector. Just under two thirds (61%), meanwhile, would be interested in taking a role that improved equality of food access. EIT Food launches campaign championing the voices of young people EIT Food is launching a new campaign, \u2018Our Food, Our Food System\u2019 to help young people have their say on the future of food. The campaign will recruit 10 young FutureFoodMakers to spearhead a call for radical change in the food sector, tackling access to healthy, sustainable and affordable food. It is being launched during a landmark year, which will see the first ever United Nations Summit dedicated to food systems. \u201cYoung people are fundamental for the transformation towards healthy and sustainable food systems. Yet our research clearly shows that they are being let down. Across Europe, 18-24 year olds find healthy food more expensive, harder to find on the go, and lacking the information and advice they need to make informed nutritional decisions. The voice and asks of this young and dynamic food generation need to be heard by everyone across the food sector, and they need to be involved and empowered in shaping what comes next. That\u2019s why we are launching our campaign \u2018Our Food, Our Food System\u2019, to give our young people the voice they deserve and help everyone in the food systems to understand their needs.\u201d Dr. Andy Zynga, CEO of EIT Food Read more about the \u2018Our Food, Our Future\u2019 campaign", "eit359": "The annual awards ceremony is designed to celebrate the leading green, social and sustainability bond deals globally. As part of an EIT Health project, the pioneering health bond scheme was designed to support the prevention of type 2 diabetes, improving the lives of citizens but also reducing costs to healthcare services. \u201cInstead of asking healthcare budgets to cover the cost of treating people when they get sick, the health bond provides pay-outs when people improve their health through preventative measures. This approach can ultimately reduce illness and the cost of healthcare and is an example of how we need to transform our thinking and approach towards healthcare. Budgets cannot rise in line with demand, and we must move towards preventative models that are both achievable and deliver high value outcomes. I congratulate the team on winning this prestigious award in recognition for their innovative solution to an age-old problem.\u201d Jan Phillip Beck, CEO, EIT Health The EIT Health Project was started in 2017 and involved EIT Health Partners RISE, Stockholm Region, Karolinska Institutet, IESE Business School, West Midlands Academic Health Science Network, Semmelweis University and City of Rotterdam, as well as commercial partners MSD and Apoteket. At the end of the project, the spinout company, Health Integrator, was launched, and work began to design an investment model that could provide financial rewards for good health outcomes, resulting in the bond available today. The bond is financed through a SEK 30 million loan (Health Impact Bond) from Skandia, an insurance company. If a participant develops type 2 diabetes, Skandia covers part of the cost, but if the participant is found to have reduced the risk of diabetes, Skandia receives a return of up to 10% percent of the investment. One unique aspect of the solution is that the Stockholm Region does not incur any costs in the first few years. After five years, the region would pay around SEK 23-33 million, depending on outcomes. There will also be savings if people stay healthy and do not require expensive care. Stockholm Region expects to receive up to 100% return on investment. 21,000 people at risk of diabetes are now enrolled into the programme. With the support of a personal health coach and tests, participants can buy preventative health services and products through the Health Integrator platform. Each user gets a \u201cwallet\u201d loaded with money to shop for selected health services such as nutritionist or smoking cessation against the plan set out with their health coach. In the short term, this leads to better health, and in the longer term, changed lifestyle habits can prevent them from developing type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases, helping to prevent the increasing burden of type 2 disease, for individuals and for society. \u201cWe are very honoured to receive the award Social project bond of the year. Just as Region Stockholm has played a leading role in the work with green bonds, we also have the ambition of being forward-thinking in the fields of social entrepreneurship and social financing. We have therefore developed a Health Impact Bond, which has a unique financial structure.\u201d Frida Korneliusson, CEO of Region Stockholm Treasury Read more about the project here", "eit360": "Major German corporate group sets the ambition to accelerate start-up solutions that remove carbon dioxide from the air via the newly launched EIT Climate-KIC ClimAccelerator programme.

Irish Aid first decided to team up with EIT Climate-KIC to help leverage private finance towards climate action. Ireland was quick to embrace the opportunity to invest in positive, innovative and forward-looking solutions to this global challenge. The programme\u2019s investment in long-term development resonates with Ireland\u2019s international development strategy by addressing climate change while simultaneously strengthening livelihoods. \"EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s approach aligns strongly with Ireland\u2019s priorities for international climate action, including support for adaptation for the most vulnerable and climate justice. The initiative contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation in key sectors of relevance to poorer communities such as small-scale renewable energy and sustainable fisheries. We are increasing our support for EIT Climate KIC\u2019s efforts to include more women in this programme. We further welcome efforts to enhance consideration of the longer-term environmental, developmental, and local impacts of EIT Climate-KIC programmes in countries.\" Sinead Walsh, Climate Envoy for Ireland Thanks to Irish Aid\u2019s ongoing support, ClimateLaunchpad\u2019s international competition continues to observe a rise in participation from the African continent. The initiative has proved to be a success with one third of the applications in 2020 coming from African countries. In fact, Leafy Ke, a clean fuel start-up from Kenya won the sixth edition of ClimateLaunchpad in 2019. \u201cThis means so much to us. This means parents will be able to look after their families better. Children won\u2019t have to sleep with smoke in their homes from dirty fuel. And carbon emissions can be significantly reduced.\u201d Peter Gachanja, COO of Leafy Ke Irish Aid will be the key partner of the ClimateLaunchpad Finals in Africa taking place in September this year.

The round was led by Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Equity via its two subsidiaries, Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Equity Germany and Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Innovation. In addition, ADVITOS received funding from the European Union\u2019s European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund as part of the EIC Accelerator Pilot blended finance programme. The EIT Digital Accelerator has been supporting ADVITOS during this fundraising with dedicated coaching and targeted introductions to a selected pool of investors interested in their space, size and geography. This financing round is a major step in the further development of ADVITOS. It will enable us to grow much faster and seize the enormous market potential this unique and certified therapy has, not only in Europe, but globally. commented Dr. Bernhard Kreymann, Founder and CEO of ADVITOS. We have been lucky in taking advantage of the fundraising program offered by EIT Digital, and valued the expertise, persistence and outreach that the EIT Digital Accelerator team has offered to us. Providing this kind of highly competent hands-on fundraising support is a strongly needed and highly effective measure to secure and enable scaling of European deep tech innovations. added Catherine Schreiber, co-founder of ADVITOS. ADVOS - treating multiple organ failure ADVITOS developed the ADVOS multi device (ADVanced Organ Support) to provide an integrated 4-in-1 multi-organ support therapy that enables simultaneous support of all three main detoxification organs \u2013 liver, lungs, and kidney \u2013 and corrects blood acid-base imbalances. Pilot trials in critically ill patients have shown that this therapy increased survival in severe organ failure from 20% up to 50%. Multi-organ failure causes the deaths of approximately half a million intensive care patients in Western Europe and the USA every year. This is about 60% of all deaths in intensive care units. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this number has increased to around 750,000 patients in the past year. On the other hand, conventional extracorporeal procedures such as mechanical ventilation, ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), dialysis, and liver-assist therapy only support the function of one or two organs. By treating all three organs simultaneously, and not consecutively like with existing solutions, ADVOS offers a holistic approach giving the patients a much better chance to recover. The ADVOS therapy is CE marked, recognised by international experts, and is already in use in the intensive care units of over 20 hospitals throughout Germany, including a number of leading university hospitals. The company currently employs 55 people. It has received numerous awards, including the 2020 Innovation Award Bavaria, and is listed in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards 2019.

Today, these industries are experiencing some of the greatest challenges in recent history. The causes are diverse, and they can only be tackled together. That\u2019s why the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) will launch a new Knowledge and Innovation Community, EIT Culture and Creativity, bringing together research, education and business to enable CCSI to flourish with innovation like never before. From architecture, film, television and video games to cultural heritage, music, publishing and performing arts, Europe\u2019s CCSI play a crucial role in our society. At the end of 2019, they represented 4.4 % of the EU\u2019s GDP in terms of turnover and employed 7.4 million people \u2013 3.7 % of total employment. In addition to generating growth, they are at the heart of Europe\u2019s identity and values, creating social cohesion by establishing a shared sense of history and culture. These societal benefits as well as their economic potential mean the CCSI are capable of delivering world-class solutions to global challenges. Unfortunately, CCSI have rarely faced as many challenges as they do today. Surviving in a changing world Digitisation and globalisation especially are affecting the business of culture and creativity. Across Europe, creative and cultural organisations of all kinds are facing a lack of entrepreneurial and cross-cutting skills and are struggling to engage with new generations. Culture and creativity have strong local roots and high growth potential, but they are diverse, fragmented, and often micro-sized in terms of organisation. The COVID-19 crisis is an acute additional challenge, squeezing already tight margins and causing a 30 % job loss since the pandemic hit in 2020. If the CCSI are to survive this crisis or, better yet, emerge stronger, they need a long-term approach that aims to make the sector crisis-resistant by addressing the root causes of unsustainability. In short: a lack of entrepreneurial skills, mentoring and the room to experiment and innovate are serious obstacles on the road to success. And that is precisely where the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) wants to step in. As Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem, we will support CCSI in not only making them more resilient and more connected industries and sectors, but also in harnessing their power to deliver solutions to challenges through our unique innovation model. Rising to the challenge To stimulate the development of innovative ecosystems, the EIT has set up Knowledge and Innovation Communities: pan-European partnerships among leading companies, research labs and higher education. These partnerships, of which there are currently eight, are dedicated to finding solutions to specific global challenges, from climate change and sustainable energy to healthy living and food. To date, the EIT Community has generated more than 13 000 jobs, EUR 3.3 billion in external investments, more than 1 170 innovative products and services and more than 3 100 graduates completing EIT education programmes. The EIT powers innovations of tomorrow and sees the early potential in start-ups to grow and scale. To date, the EIT has supported two unicorns (privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion): Lillium \u2013the world\u2019s first electric vertical take-off and landing jet, and Northvolt \u2013 a European supplier of sustainable, high-quality battery cells and systems. Tapping into the potential of the creative and cultural sectors and industries, the EIT will soon be launching its ninth community, EIT Culture and Creativity, which will target the CCSI with the aim of launching innovative solutions and a new generation of entrepreneurs. Given its multi-disciplinary approach, The EIT wants to create more opportunities dedicated to innovators, learners and entrepreneurs from the CCSI. Creating an innovative future, together Establishing an innovation ecosystem with the cultural and creative sectors and industries will enable them to leverage their potential together \u2013 boosting European sustainable growth and competitiveness. Innovating with the EIT could help kickstart CCSI transformation into future-proof, resilient sectors and at scale industries with the ability to tackle current and upcoming challenges. EIT Culture and Creativity will break down barriers to innovation across boundaries, sectors and disciplines. It will accelerate the sectors\u2019 transition to new technologies and digital platforms. And it will power new ventures and equip the next generation of creative innovators with needed entrepreneurial skills. Are you ready to rise to the challenge?

The report extrapolated micromobility behaviour in the city of Munich across 100+ European cities and combined it with various, validated scenarios to create projections of the impact of a systemic electric, shared, and connected micromobility rollout by 2030. Looking at the status quo, the report identifies major hurdles around micromobility adoption like the current limitations on vehicle types, making them unfit to transport groceries, pick up children from school or accommodate parcel deliveries. In addition, short vehicle lifespans, high operational costs, regarding charging and relocation, and lack of integration into European cities\u2019 transport systems are hampering uptake. In consequence, micromobility today accounts for less than 0,1% of all trips within cities. The initial rollout of the first generation of micromobility fleets was hastily done, with little thought put into how to best fit them into a larger mobility system. As a result, the vehicles did little to solve existing challenges such as air pollution, traffic jams, high noise levels, or increasingly crowded urban centres. In fact, this has created new problems that have hurt the perception and the business case surrounding micromobility. Jennifer Dungs, EIT InnoEnergy\u2019s Energy for Transport and Mobility Thematic Leader, and author of the report Systemic multi-stakeholder approach needed To overcome those hurdles, EIT InnoEnergy recommends a systemic and sustainable multi-stakeholder approach. This includes a shift to higher quality components and improved serviceability \u2013 particularly motors and batteries \u2013 more local manufacturing, consequent recycling, a focus on developing and utilising purpose-built vehicles, leveraging analytics platforms for relocation and charging and implementing more favourable regulations for micromobility fleets. Massive impact potentials by 2030 In addition to creating almost 1 million direct and indirect jobs (990 000), this approach could lower CO2 emissions by more than 30 million tons and save up to 127 TWh of energy consumption per year. The report estimates a EUR 111 billion increase in GDP could be realised as a result of almost one billion (999 million) person-hours saved per year due to decreased congestion \u2013 more than the combined GDPs of Malta, Cyprus, Latvia, and Estonia. In addition, 48 000 hectares of inner-city land could be freed up, equivalent to more than 4x the total area of Paris. We need to press the reset button if we want micromobility to play an outsised role in the much-needed redesign of our cities and their transport systems. Leveraging innovations like purpose-built vehicles or battery swapping stations is one part of the solution. Another one is to establish platforms enabling a structural exchange between cities and providers to help guide the process. Looking at the potential benefits for urban life quality, the environment and our economy we should all have a vested interest to support and accelerate this transition. Jennifer Dungs, EIT InnoEnergy\u2019s Energy for Transport and Mobility Thematic Leader, and author of the report Download the full report \u2018Examining the impact of a sustainable electric micromobility approach in Europe", "eit381": "Horizon Europe, the EU\u2019s Framework Programme for Research and Innovation marks an important milestone for many innovators, entrepreneurs, researchers, learners, R&D enthusiasts, citizens and policymakers alike. Now, the updated EIT Regulation and Strategic Innovation Agenda 2021-2027 have also been formally adopted by the European Council and European Parliament, paving the way for more innovation across Europe. At the EIT, we foster innovation\u2019s reach to power a healthier, a greener and more digital Europe. Since innovation\u2019s reach is all encompassing, building an innovation ecosystem \u2013 the mission of the EIT - is made even more important to keep the constant flow of ground-breaking new ideas, products and services thriving. So, what does the EIT innovation ecosystem look like, and how will it support Europe and its citizens in the next seven years? An ecosystem in nature is often described as an environment made up of elements that work together to create an \u2018environment of growth\u2019. Ecosystems are multifaceted, multi-layered and are very much co-dependent: \u2018every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor\u2019. The EIT Community, Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem, has set up an environment that is conducive to powering innovation. By connecting leading business, higher education and research organisations (also known as the knowledge triangle), we create favourable conditions for innovators, entrepreneurs, and students to spark innovation. In our ecosystem, we offer three main pillars of support: entrepreneurial education, innovation projects and business creation. Together we create a community that generates cutting-edge solutions for Europe and an environment where innovation can flourish. The EIT innovation ecosystem has given life to a diverse set of innovations, tackling some of Europe\u2019s most pressing societal challenges. From climate change, digitisation, sustainable energy, and manufacturing to food, health, raw materials, and urban mobility, EIT Community solutions are far reaching, and they continue to grow. To date, the EIT Community has delivered more than 13 000 jobs, EUR 3.3 billion in external investments raised by more than 3100 ventures supported, more than 1 170 innovative products and services and more than 3 100 graduates completing EIT education programmes. However, like any ecosystem in nature, we are susceptible to a variety of elements and maintaining an ecosystem in an ever-changing world is also not easy; we have to work hard, think big, adapt and change. The EIT\u2019s new ambitious strategy for 2021 to 2027 focuses on four main elements that reflect the needs of European innovation and will help our ecosystem thrive even more. First, the EIT will strengthen the impact of its Knowledge and Innovation Communities. To keep an innovation ecosystem thriving, it is not enough to simply bring business, education and research partners together. What we need is to facilitate and accelerate cooperation and connection between all three. That is exactly what happens in EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities where these players come together connecting more than 2000 partners and 60 innovation hubs across Europe. They deliver a wide range of innovation and entrepreneurship activities across Europe that fall under each of our three pillars: entrepreneurial education, business creation and acceleration services and innovation driven research projects and this support will continue to grow in the coming years. Second, the EIT will put a stronger focus on working more closely with higher education institutions (HEI) to boost their ability to innovate as part of the EIT HEI Initiative - Innovation Capacity Building for Higher Education. Our aim is to help these institutions teach innovation and entrepreneurship by encouraging these institutions to build their capacities and develop concrete actions to increase their impact. Universities will be equipped with the right tools to support innovation across their campuses and beyond, enabling them to play a more active role in shaping and nurturing ideas, equipping students and graduates with the right entrepreneurial skills and mind-sets to springboard to success. Third, the EIT will increase our regional development efforts. Through the EIT\u2019s Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) support is made available to target and bridge innovation gaps that exist between EU regions and Member States by connecting regional partners, sharing good practices, experience and know-how emerging from the EIT Community. It is not only about expanding the EIT Community\u2019s innovation capabilities to more regions but also about making Europe\u2019s largest innovation ecosystem more diverse. It is proven in nature that ecosystems with higher biodiversity tend to be more stable with greater resistance and resilience and the same goes with innovation. More diversity not only means more pan-European collaboration but it also means more women entrepreneurs leading businesses and more young girls in tech and science, another important aspect of the EIT Community\u2019s activities. Last but not least, the EIT will also grow with two new Knowledge and Innovation Communities, one operating in the field of the Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries with a call for Proposals coming in 2021 and the other on Water, Marine and Maritime Sectors and Ecosystems. The new EIT strategy for the next seven years is both ambitious and bold and to achieve this, the EIT has a budget of EUR 3 billion under Horizon Europe. The EIT Community is committed to taking our innovation ecosystem to the next step \u2013 to create a biome, an atmosphere where innovation flourishes across Europe and beyond. Come join us and make innovation happen!", "eit382": "On 19 May, EIT Health-backed S4DX has announced the successful closing of EUR five million in series A fundraising. The funding comes from private investors including SARSTEDT AG & Co., KG, as well as the EIC Fund, established in 2020 by the European Commission for direct equity investment in breakthrough technologies, and will be used to help the innovative blood sampling system, which has already launched in Germany, and to scale to other markets. As many as three in four medical decisions are based on diagnostic results \u2013 often blood samples. Currently, this process is being managed manually which can lead to errors and can cause many issues including slow diagnosis, repeated tests on the patient, and wasted resources. We need to revolutionise this crucial but underdeveloped area of the healthcare value chain to bring innovation where it can have an instant and substantial impact. Dr. Hans Maria Heyn, CEO and co-founder of S4DX S4DX was formed in 2018 as part of the EIT Health Wild Card programme, which focuses on building game-changing life science companies to break new ground in health by challenging the status quo in areas of high unmet need. Beginning with two challenges set by EIT Health, the annual Wild Card programme invites talented innovators from across Europe to respond with their ideas. Successful applicants start their journey with a hackathon; putting them through their paces on everything from team formation, critical thinking, business model validation, and pitching. Finally, participants pitch their solution to a panel of industry leaders to secure a spot in the finals, at which point they pitch for EIT Health investment to incorporate their company and bring their solution to market. Since then, the start-up has developed the \u2018digital human blood sample fingerprint\u2019, a complete data-picture of all quality aspects for human blood samples from collection to arrival in the lab. Unlike current manual processes of taking blood, the data is collected and instantly reported into the laboratory whilst the patient is still present. This allows for any errors to be identified and corrected immediately, therefore not only increasing the accuracy of the data but also avoiding the need for repeat patient visits. Through ongoing support from the EIT Health programmes Gold Track and Bridgehead, the team also received access to strategic mentoring, finance, investors, and the largest European healthcare innovation network. We are immensely proud of all that the S4DX team have achieved, including the latest funding round and attention of private investors as well as the EIC. As our first \u2018Wild Card\u2019, it is encouraging to see the swift progress that has been made since we first met them just a few short years ago.

The ambitious new Coalition \u2013 catalysed by the World Economic Forum\u2019s CEO Action Group for the European Green Deal \u2013 aims to decarbonise the European food system, while maximising other benefits such as soil health and farmer resilience. The \u2018Carbon+ Farming Journey\u2019 project will take a farmer-centric approach to focus on increasing the uptake of regenerative and climate-smart agriculture practices, identifying the roadblocks to adoption, designing solutions with economic, practical and ecological benefits to farmers. Agriculture is our greatest chance for delivering on our commitments under the Paris Agreement, and inclusive innovation will be the key enabler for a just transition to net-zero, nature-positive food systems. By pooling resources, avoiding duplication of efforts, sharing, and establishing best practices in such collaborative partnerships, we can achieve greater impact more effectively. EIT Food believes and invests in people-centric and systemic innovations, where no one is left behind. We are thus excited to join this coalition of pioneering organisations in a shared vision for a better future. Dr. Andy Zynga, CEO of EIT Food EIT Food\u2019s involvement in the Coalition reflects the commitment and extensive work on farmer-centric, sustainable and regenerative agriculture. Some of EIT Food\u2019s initiatives in this area include: The Regenerative Agriculture Revolution programme, which involves offering training to farmers in Europe on the principles of regenerative agriculture and how to apply these to their farms, as well as working with agrifood companies to transition their supply to regenerative agriculture. Grow Workshops, educational workshops on emerging practices and technologies that aim to establish regional and European networks of farmers and support the uptake of sustainable and circular solutions by farmers. The Test Farms programme, links agricultural start-ups with farmers and testing-land, and it helps agritech innovators test their products and services on real-life farms. The Innovator Fellowship, a six-month skills and mentoring programme for innovators in the agrifood sector, working on responses to global food challenges. The programme includes dedicated creative challenges on soil health and agrifood sustainability. For more information, please contact Sam Mehmet, Greenhouse PR.

The city is taking part in EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities, and has set ambitious goals to become carbon neutral and inclusive. The past year has seen a breakthrough in the city council\u2019s approach from siloed to systems thinking, leading to a series of experiments developed to bring the city closer to carbon neutrality. In Poland, most energy is still derived from coal, which plays an important role in heating homes but results in high levels of air pollution. The residents of Krakow were the first in Poland to realise that a massive improvement in air quality was needed, as air pollution levels were far above World Health Organisation recommendations. A joint effort by residents and local authorities led to the creation of the Clean Air Programme, resulting in a ban on burning coal and wood in homes from September 2019. Towards a holistic, city-wide plan The Clean Air Programme has given Krakow an appetite for greater change. In 2019, EIT Climate-KIC brought together a diverse group of local stakeholders, led by Andrzej \u0141az\u0119cki, Deputy Director of Municipal Services Department and an engineer with over 30 years of experience. The group also included officials such as Andrzej Kulig, the First Deputy Mayor. The common goal of EIT Climate-KIC and the city of Krakow was to expand the city\u2019s existing initiatives, link them together and fill strategic gaps to build a portfolio of experiments. They started with a series of meetings and workshops on systems thinking, policy innovation, and much more. This process was born out of the idea that it is crucial to have a long-term vision for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to be convinced that our actions are aimed at making a greater impact on the climate situation. Participation in this process is of strategic importance to us. When we joined Deep Demonstrations two years ago, we had high expectations for this programme and the opportunities that were presented to us exceeded our expectations. Andrzej \u0141az\u0119cki, engineer and Deputy Director of the Municipal Services Department. Economic models as a lens for the city\u2019s capabilities One of the first steps Krakow took was to build a business case for decarbonisation, using the scenario analysis model offered by EIT Climate-KIC partner Material Economics. The local team worked closely together to collect and analyse data to identify the most effective ways to achieve environmental impact in a financially and socially sustainable way at a city-wide level. The analysis revealed that Krakow emits an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide each year from transport, buildings, heating, and electricity. Multi-level experiments to scale up the potential for change The emerging portfolio of experiments aims to enable rapid learning and create the opportunity to scale the actions that will enable Krakow to achieve its net-zero target by 2030. The portfolio is characterised by themes that reflect critical ingredients for developing new transformation pathways for the city. These themes, which derive directly from the city\u2019s barriers and challenges, include citizen engagement, clearer and more holistic approaches to internal municipal governance and organisation, accelerating action in response to COVID-19, and a positive decarbonisation narrative for future scaling and support. Krakow has also set a goal to increase the amount of green space in the city. The city government will take a leading role in developing and implementing the portfolio of experiments. Action is needed to strengthen the local community. Talking about a global problem is not very convincing, it is crucial to bring the problem down to the local level, to issues that residents can engage with. Andrzej \u0141az\u0119cki, engineer and Deputy Director of the Municipal Services Department. Engaging citizens in experimentation Another example of experimentation in Krakow focuses on mobility and supports a city-wide shift to public transport, walking, and cycling. The idea of developing a Climate Quarter within Krakow\u2019s second ring road in the city centre could offer the potential for decarbonising mobility. Behavioural changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the focus on cycling as part of the national recovery plan also offer the opportunity to accelerate this change. The Climate Quarter and improved cross-district bike routes will serve as a testing ground for this experiment. This could be a green turnaround for the whole city. Awareness of the climate crisis has grown tremendously in the last two years, both among residents and city officials. We have recognised this gap and are ready for far-reaching changes. Andrzej \u0141az\u0119cki, engineer and Deputy Director of the Municipal Services Department.

New activities, meetings and competitions are planned for 2021. The current initiatives, linked to the World Manufacturing Forum, are open to 18\u201330-year-olds who share a passion for manufacturing, comprising both students and young professionals. Learn more about the initiative in this interview with Giulia Dimonopoli, Junior project Manager of the Young Manufacturing Leaders initiative. What is your long-term goal with this community? The long-term goal of YML international network is to create a new generation of manufacturing ambassadors that will be part of EIT Manufacturing networks, as well as bring other fellow students, young entrepreneurs, and professionals on board. We want to create a community to nurture the world\u2019s future manufacturing talents, by providing them with information about recent trends and technologies, while boosting soft skills and growing their professional network. Through this initiative, we hope to raise awareness about the opportunities the manufacturing sector can offer, and the role the industry will play in the transition to a more sustainable, circular, and digital Europe and world. Does this community influence the perception of the manufacturing industry? Still today, the perception of the manufacturing sector does not always meet the reality. We want to help to challenge this perception and attract more young people to the industry and related fields of study. How will we do this? By sharing news about the recent industry trends and technologies, and new ways of working. We also want to inspire a dialogue about how the manufacturing sector will contribute to the green and digital transformation. To address these challenges, the YML offers its members access and information about various global activities, and events as well as bring opportunities for collaboration with sector experts. We are convinced that this is the starting point to nurture the next generation of manufacturing leaders, with the right network, skills, and passion to become long-term sector ambassadors. What were your key achievements in 2020? In 2020, the Young Manufacturing Leader initiative created the first five local City-Hubs in Europe and started engaging members from both EU and Non-EU countries. The first international activities were launched involving YMLs in the initiatives of the World Manufacturing Foundation: the 2020 YML Essay Contest gave the chance to five winners and three special mentions to be featured in the 2020 WM Report, together with other 50 experts from over 30 countries. Furthermore, seven YMLs were involved in the first edition of the \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 initiative becoming contributors to the Focus Groups by analysing the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing and researching possible solutions to face the pandemic challenge. In November 2020, the first edition of the YML Main Event was organised in the framework of the World Manufacturing Week, reaching more than 150 online attendees. The event consisted of an Opening Session where YMLs had the opportunity to share their experience in the network, followed by a five-day matchmaking event during which YMLs realised 38 meetings among peers, and a communication thematic workshop \u2018Leadership is Influence\u2019. What are you planning to do in 2021? For the second year in a row, the YML network is involving its members in different international and local activities. The project partners are involving YMLs in the activities of the World Manufacturing Foundation, and recently launched two open calls: A dedicated Young Manufacturing Leaders\u2019 event to be held in October 2021 in conjunction with the World Manufacturing Week \u2013 18-22 October. Over the coming months, the community will also launch a Mentoring Programme involving both universities and companies, and an Innovation Contest giving the members a possibility to put their knowledge into practice. Moreover, the local City-Hubs are currently organising various thematic webinars on focusing manufacturing innovation-related topics. Raising awareness on gender equality and inclusivity in manufacturing is also a key objective of the 2021 activities to enlarge the manufacturing talent pool. About Young Manufacturing Leaders The Young Manufacturing Leaders project (YML) aims to create an ambassadors\u2019 community of young people, with an interest in the manufacturing sector. The objective is to nurture and inspire the community with information as well as supporting them in organising events and activities to spread awareness about modern manufacturing. The project is led by Politecnico di Milano, together with six other partners: Chalmers University, Czech Technical University in Prague, Tecnalia, TU Braunschweig, IMH Advanced Manufacturing Campus, University College Dublin, University of Porto and the World Manufacturing Foundation. The World Manufacturing Foundation is also the organiser of the World Manufacturing Forum, an annual meeting with international manufacturing experts and stakeholders to discuss the last trends and innovations of the sector.

The 'EIT Urban Mobility Knowledge base of innovative solutions in urban mobility and living labs' report aims to provide the wider transport community with an understanding of the potential of successfully ran living labs and their essential contribution to the transformation of the current urban mobility system. This report will help the urban mobility innovation community to better understand the scope of the mobility living labs movement in Europe, the shapes and forms of these labs, their added value for the mobility transition, and the barriers and opportunities they are facing. The in-depth analysis presented in this report focuses on the following topics: origin duration main topics addressed key owners and stakeholders involved relation to policy initiatives real-life environment characteristics co-creation and end-user involvement operational structure business models kind of activities facilitated key challenges areas of support needed Download the full report Since 2006, the concept of the living lab is recognised by the European Commission as a key tool for open innovation. Living labs have spread over Europe in various waves, first focusing on new ICT tools but later also extending to other fields, such as sustainable energy, healthcare, safety, and mobility. Nowadays, newspapers are full of news on living labs, promoting networks of living labs recently created, and covering European projects that organise their activities within the living labs setup. The present report illustrates the operational setup, local urban mobility strategies, as well as the goals of the main key stakeholders that have led in practice to a large variety of urban mobility living labs in Europe. The key elements of living labs \u2013 active user involvement, multiple-stakeholder platform for innovation in real-life contexts, multi-method, and co-creation approach \u2013 are completely aligned with EIT Urban Mobility\u2019s vision and mission. This mission covers improving people\u2019s quality of life by creating more liveable urban spaces through innovation and transformation in urban mobility, decarbonising transport and making Europe\u2019s economy and the transport sector more competitive. Therefore, living labs are a key strategic instrument within EIT Urban Mobility to boost the uptake of innovative sustainable urban mobility solutions and accelerating the transition to scale by engaging directly with the citizens and the local community, and all stakeholders in a real-life environment.

Start exploring the life of your phone The Materials Matter initiative, a creation of the Restart project \u2013 supported by the EIT RawMaterials Academy, REPLAY and Refer projects, and several museums across Europe, provides a space for education and awareness on the entire lifecycle of a mobile phone. The initiative is perfect for 8-12-year-olds and everyone who wants to learn about raw materials for modern life. Your phone is with you for a few years of your life, but did you know it had already experienced a lot before it reached you? Equally, after you stop using it, your phone\u2019s story is far from over. The lifecycle of your phone has a big impact on the planet. Your phone contains raw materials \u2013 the minerals and metals inside. But where do these raw materials come from? And what happens when you recycle your phone? Your phone consists of many different materials that have one thing in common: they are mined from the earth. Minerals, metals, and advanced materials are essential for modern technologies. Did you know there are more than 40 different materials in a smartphone? Each material has its own complex supply chain. Often, the minerals used to produce components for your phone, like the battery, are mined outside of Europe. Currently, Europe is highly dependent on the supply of minerals and metals coming from developing and emerging countries. Some materials for your phone come from politically unstable countries with limited environmental and workers\u2019 health and safety regulations. This is why the CERA, innovation project, supported by EIT RawMaterials, is developing a certification process for raw materials to ensure the materials we need for modern technologies are sourced through a sustainable value chain. Explore the life of your phone Someday, your phone might break and cannot be repaired. Then it becomes electronic waste. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) or e-waste, includes computers, TV sets, fridges, and mobile phones. It is basically any old, discarded, or no longer in use electrical or electronic equipment that requires a power source, either electric or battery/accumulator power. According to the Global E-waste Monitor (2020), approximately 53.6 million tonnes of e-waste were generated in 2019. It is estimated that the amount of e-waste generated will exceed 74 million tonnes in 2030. Thus, the global quantity of e-waste is increasing at an alarming rate of almost two million tonnes per year. But there is something you can do. Recycling can help us extract some of the raw materials from a broken phone There is good news: the recycling rates for materials in batteries are increasing. That means that we can extract a larger proportion of the raw materials to reuse them. Recycling electronic devices to extract the raw materials is a difficult process. It takes a lot of energy and complicated work. Companies around the world are inventing new and simpler recycling processes to recycle phone batteries. What you can do To help our planet, we encourage you to check the WEEE4Future project. You can use an e-waste calculator to discover which appliance materials can be recycled and the potential emissions saved. And if you live in Germany, Italy, Ireland, or Slovenia, you can check for e-waste collection points near your home to recycle your old devices and give the valuable materials in your phone a second life!

The report concludes that AI and digital solutions are urgently needed, with healthcare workforces already straining to meet demand due to increasing populations and people living longer. This pressure is set to increase given estimations that by 2050 one in four people in Europe will be over the age of 65 and will likely have complex healthcare needs \u2013 which means only a proportion of additional years will be spent in good health. Progress in medical science has raised life expectancy, however as longevity increases, healthcare systems face increasing demand, with patients having more complex needs, costs rising and the workforce struggling to meet demand. Without major structural and transformational change, healthcare systems will become unsustainable, and the European promise of universal healthcare will be threatened. Building on a series of roundtables exploring the topic \u2018Healthcare Workforce and Organisational Transformation with AI\u2019, this new report identifies a range of focus areas that need to be addressed at an EU and national level, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to maximise the potential of AI and technology in healthcare. The outcomes of the AI Think Tank Report have given us clear and consistent messages on how to drive AI and technology forward within European healthcare systems. We already know that AI has the potential to transform healthcare, but we need to work quickly and collaboratively to build it into current European healthcare structures. The challenge of the pandemic has undoubtedly helped accelerate growth, adoption and scaling of AI, as stakeholders have fought to deliver care both rapidly and remotely. However, this momentum needs to be maintained to ensure that benefits to healthcare systems are embedded long-term and help them to prepare for the future\u2013 something which will benefit all of us. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO at EIT Health Key recommendations from EIT Health include improving collaboration and exchange of best practice across the EU, building on existing networks and infrastructures to support AI integration, improving education and skills, and developing value-based financial models that incorporates AI and acknowledges the longer-term cost-saving. At a wider EU level, EIT Health is pushing for a more robust data infrastructure for Europe, to ensure member states and healthcare systems can share data, allowing experts to track diseases, diagnose more quickly and develop new and improved AI-based solutions. The advances in AI and technology can be of immense benefit to current healthcare systems and allow front-line workers to spend more time on patient care. Data from a joint EIT Health and McKinsey and Company published in 2020 highlighted that AI automation could help alleviate workforce shortages, accelerate the research and development of life-saving treatments, and help reduce the time spent on administrative tasks. Activities that currently occupy between 20 to 80 percent of doctor and nurse time can be streamlined or even eliminated by using AI. But, for these benefits to become embedded within healthcare, existing systems will need to undergo significant change. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of AI in some areas, but the broad impact remains sparse. Countries and regions are fragmented in their approach, so too are start-ups and the healthcare industry, and this is hindering uptake. Looking ahead, EIT Health will continue supporting institutions to adapt, and can play a key role in upskilling and reskilling the healthcare workforce. Key to this will be facilitating the much-needed transparency and collaboration between innovators and practitioners that will support the successful scaling of AI across European healthcare, as well as engaging policy makers on legislative changes needed.

Not only because urban mobility is something many people use to manage and shape their daily lives. Far more is at stake. Our current over-reliance on cars to get around cities has many negative effects on urban populations. These include noise and air pollution, the risk of accidents and the privatisation of public space, to name but a few. Mentioned circumstances require changing systems of urban mobility to allow people and goods to move affordable, fast, comfortably, safely and cleanly, but at the same time enable cities to reclaim public space from cars to make cities better places for people to live, work and play. Therefore, at EIT Urban Mobility, the mission is to accelerate change towards a sustainable model of urban mobility for liveable urban spaces, and eventually achieving three societal impact goals: Improved quality of life in cities; Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change; Job creation and strengthening of the European urban mobility sector. As the leading European Innovation Community for urban mobility, EIT Urban Mobility fosters integration by bringing together the key players across the whole value chain of mobility. It facilitates collaboration between cities, industry, academia, research and innovation and puts the challenges facing cities at the centre of all its activities. By breaking down the silos between the different players in urban mobility and ensuring a central role for cities and citizens, EIT Urban Mobility aims to have a significant impact on the ground. New innovative ways of moving around the city will greatly improve people\u2019s quality of life, free up public space and give a significant boost to the competitiveness of Europe\u2019s mobility industry. Creating forefront knowledge and breakthrough concepts for sustainable urban mobility and attracting the best European talent to this critical and strategic area will make Europe a leader in urban mobility. EIT Urban Mobility\u2019s Strategic Agenda 2021-2027 defines the objectives, goals and strategic priorities, and outlines how EIT Urban Mobility works towards their realization within all its programme areas.

The clinical trial will assess the safety and efficacy of this novel therapy. Building on the proven preclinical efficacy and safety of the Omomyc cell-penetrating mini-protein in mouse models, and Peptomyc\u2019s successful development of this compound for the treatment of several tumour types, this latest milestone represents a greatly anticipated \u2018leap\u2019 in clinical research, and an important step forward in becoming the first-ever clinically viable and direct inhibitor of Myc. Myc is a protein that plays an important role in the survival and proliferation of cancer cells, and therefore attacking it could prove successful in combating a number of different cancers \u2013 it could become a so-called \u2018universal cancer treatment\u2019. However, Myc has been largely considered \u2018undruggable\u2019 because it lacks effective binding pockets on its surface, in other words, it was thought that potential treatments would have nothing to \u2018grab onto\u2019. Myc has been considered an \u2018undruggable\u2019 cancer target for many years. We have previously shown that Myc blockade has an excellent therapeutic effect in several mouse models, with mild side effects that are well tolerated and reversible. Now that we have received approval to initiate our early phase clinical trial, we can further progress in testing the safety and efficacy of our Omomyc-based therapy for the benefit of those who matter most \u2013 our patients. Dr Laura Soucek, Co-Founder and CEO of Peptomyc Laura set up Peptomyc as a spin-off (a company born out of another; typically, a research institution) of the Vall d\u00b4Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) and the Catalan Institute of Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), determined to prove cynics wrong and demonstrate that Myc inhibition holds great promise that can be translated into benefits for patients. Peptomyc has been supported by EIT Health throughout its journey, benefitting from vital financial and business support to enable the new start-up to flourish. Access to EIT Health\u2019s vast network meant Laura received bespoke strategic advice from internationally renowned consultants, gained training on engaging with investors, and had the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with founders of other start-ups. Ultimately, the network enabled Dr Soucek to progress towards clinical trials and build an evidence base to demonstrate the potential of her therapy. We\u2019re extremely proud of Laura and the entire team at Peptomyc for their tenacity and commitment in finding and proving novel methods for new, safe and effective potential cancer treatments for patients with cancer.

This enables technology owners to document the reliability of their claims and differentiate them from competitors, and it helps technology purchasers identify innovations that suit their needs. ETV is implemented by accredited Verification Bodies in three technology areas: Water treatment and monitoring (e.g., monitoring water quality, treatment of drinking water and wastewater) Materials, waste and resources (e.g., separation and sorting of solid waste, recycling of materials, end-of-life products and chemicals, biomass-based products) Energy (e.g., renewable energy, energy generated from waste, energy efficiency) The call is open to any partner and start-up of participating in the EIT Community (EIT RawMaterials, EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Food, EIT Manufacturing and EIT Urban Mobility) with a technology included in any of the previously defined areas that has been supported in any ongoing or finished demonstration project. A webinar defining main aspects of the call and ETV requirements will be organised on 29 April from 10:30 to 12:00. The webinar will include a presentation of the Circular Economy project and call description, a detailed presentation of ETV main requirements and finally a presentation of the new ETV Secretariat; the webinar will also include a specific final session for questions. Further details can be found here. Call on Circular SMEs Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the economy, steering our economy towards a more circular model. However, their small size means that they face unique challenges on the path to closing loops and improving resource efficiency. Some of those unique challenges can be linked to lack of company environmental culture, financial support, adequate legislation, innovation legislation and support mechanisms, information and many others. The six EIT Knowledge & Innovation Communities involved in this initiative are a diverse set of publicly and privately funded bodies uniquely positioned to tackle the above barriers for the circular economy adoption by SMEs. The overall aim of this call is to enable the joint competencies and capacities of the EIT Community to help solve a more systemic circularity in an orchestrated effort as well as possible specific approaches towards circularity in SMEs. Partners of participating EIT Knowledge & Innovation Communities are invited to submit an application for the work on the development of an in-depth analysis covering the following topics: Investigation of the current situation regarding Circular Economy and SMEs in Europe considering mainly those sectors covered by the participating EIT Knowledge & Innovation Communitites Investigation of main barriers hampering Circular Economy implementation in SMEs and potential measures to overcome those barriers, including EIT Community activities. Investigation and analysis of current activities carried out by participating EIT Knowledge & Innovation Communitites to support Circular Economy implementation in SMEs and estimation of efficiency. Clear and detailed proposal for both how to improve current support activities and new possible actions considering individual EIT Knowledge & Innovation Communitites but mainly joint actions from joint EIT Community projects. Clear analysis of how those support activities should be coordinated with other initiatives to avoid overlapping and increase efficiency. The project should create an advisory board composed of relevant experts and SMEs representatives providing advice to the project development. All existing partners of participating EIT Community (EIT RawMaterials, EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Digital, EIT Food, EIT Manufacturing and EIT Urban Mobility) are eligible to apply.", "eit397": "The Nordic teams of EIT Urban Mobility Innovation Hub North and EIT Climate KIC are happy to announce that starting from January 2021, both teams are now sharing a common office in Copenhagen, Denmark. The strategic decision to share offices was made in the belief that the challenges in urban mobility and climate change require a strengthened partnership and a new way of collaboration. The Copenhagen joint office co-location is EIT Urban Mobility\u2019s first of it sort since EIT promoted the cross-KIC co-location initiative. Co-location Centres (CLCs) are the main instrument for managing KIC activities and knowledge flow. They bring together diverse teams from across the \u2018Knowledge Triangle\u2019 in one specified physical location and provide the focal point for a KIC\u2019s activity in that area. Geographical proximity is essential for facilitating interactions among KIC partners within a geographical area. This decision was initiated earlier in 2020 and resulted in an extensive search for suitable collocation opportunities that could foster the goals of both Copenhagen-based teams. Eventually, EIT Urban Mobility provisional office site at BLOXHUB was chosen as the preferred joint solution. Copenhagen BLOXHUB provides access to a vibrant community of innovators consisting of 350 companies, research institutions, organisations, and municipalities working towards sustainable urbanisation. In this environment, both teams are confident that a strengthened cross-KIC collaboration will lead to innovative and leading-edge results benefiting the \u2018knowledge triangle\u2019 communities. EIT Urban Mobility\u2019s new office collocation with EIT Climate-KIC has resulted in over 40% cost savings and will lead to greater resource efficiency allowing us to cut down on wasted space, as well as the furniture and equipment costs. Next to financial savings, the co-location will allow for enhanced cross-KIC collaboration through the planning and organisation of joint activities, harness the power of networks, and enhance visibility for each of the collocating KICs as well as the EIT Community in the Nordic and Baltic region.", "eit398": "C-SNIPER, an EIT Food funded project, seeks the development of a natural antimicrobial to help reducing Campylobacter in the farm, slaughter and/or processing poultry and to be integrated into existing hygiene protocols. Campylobacteriosis is the most frequent food-borne illness in Europe, with 220 682 reported cases in 2019 and an estimated associated cost of EUR 2 400 M per year. Consumption of chicken meat contaminated with the bacteria Campylobacter is considered the most common route for human infection. Current control measures are mostly based on the use of antibiotics at farm level, which contributes to the spreading of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter strains. Although some phage-based products against other food pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella are already on the market, there is a lack of Campylobacter-specific products. C-SNIPER is an EIT Food funded project delivered by five European organisations (AZTI, Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research PAS, University of Turin, Phage Technology Center GmbH and O.R.A. Societ\u00e0 Agricola), that seeks the development and validation of a natural antimicrobial to help reducing the prevalence of Campylobacter in the farm, slaughter and/or processing poultry and to be integrated into existing production and processing hygiene protocols. C-SNIPER provides an alternative to antibiotics which, being highly specific against a single genus of bacteria (Campylobacter), is harmless to plants, animals, and humans, as well as to the rest of the surrounding natural microbiota. Moreover, this solution makes it possible to control the spread of this pathogen without affecting the appearance and quality of the final product. According to the results obtained in a survey conducted by C-SNIPER among poultry producers and consumers, 90% and 85% of respondents respectively were prone to accept bacteriophages as a standard biocontrol measure in food production and processing. Campylobacter, still unknown for the general public However, Campylobacter remains largely unknown to the public. Therefore, within the project, different educational materials have been developed, such as videos and infographics, to raise awareness. These materials explain what the main source of contamination is and how the risk of infection can be minimised in the domestic environment, as well as familiarise consumers with the safety, efficacy, and ubiquity of bacteriophages, thus strengthening the anti-Campylobacter strategy. The C-SNIPER project will contribute to the growth of the EU poultry sector by improving animal health and poultry meat safety, consequently reducing public health expenditure, and improving food safety in Europe. Moreover, it will help to increase consumer protection and their confidence in the quality and safety of poultry products.

EIT Urban Mobility supported the implementation of this platform to help Milan\u2019s streets to be safer and more efficient. This is a good example of how EIT Urban Mobility contributes to making urban spaces more liveable for the benefit of European citizens. The EIT Urban Mobility\u2019s business acceleration services enabled Vianova to strengthen its connection with AMAT (Agenzia Mobilit\u00e0 Ambiente e Territorio), a mobility and environment agency owned by the municipality of Milan, and to investigate the possibility to pilot the Vianova technology in Milan. In October 2020, EIT Urban Mobility invested EUR 45.000 in Vianova to implement a pilot in Milan together with AMAT. The data platform developed by Vianova consists of a digital layer between cities and connected transportation services, enabling better integration and collaboration between the two. It will now be fully scaled to supervise shared mobility services in Milan, such as e-scooters, bikes, mopeds and shared cars. While doing this, Vianova will also provide digitisation of all regulations of AMAT and it will work on the development of an audit feature to verify operators\u2019 compliance. The pilot has already kicked-off and it will run throughout 2021, including the platform customisation to the needs of the city of Milan and the integration with the city\u2019s shared mobility operators. Thanks to the collaboration with Vianova, the city of Milan will be able to equip itself with a useful tool to better monitor the demand for shared mobility and plan specific interventions to ramp up the mobility offer with new services. This will allow to achieve the goals of EIT Urban Mobility to integrate user-centric mobility services and products and give a significant boost to the market growth. Valentino Sevino, Director of Mobility Planning and Monitoring Area at AMAT About Vianova Vianova, a French start-up based in Paris and founded in 2018, is one of the leading European data platform providers for enabling cities to manage connected, shared, and autonomous mobility in the urban public realm.

EIT Food explains some of the steps required to help entrepreneurs on their way. EIT Food's Business Creation offer While entrepreneurs and start-ups spend a lot of time, energy, and money on their idea or technology, they typically neglect to understand the needs of their customers and therefore, develop and supply a product or service for which there is no market demand. What is market validation? Market validation is the process of identifying whether there is a market for your idea. It involves gaining insights from the key market(s) your technology or product aims to serve including industry or other prospective customers, end-users, and other stakeholders. This helps to ensure you develop the right product for the right customer. As such, market validation helps to establish early in the commercial journey if your business model is viable. If you discover your idea is in fact not commercially viable, this gives you the option to get out early i.e. \u2018Fail Fast, Fail Forward\u2019 or pivot towards something where there is market demand, before too many resources are wasted. A lot of funding is required to take your technology from concept to commercialisation and therefore it takes time to regain this investment before a new product or service returns revenue from customers. Investors will therefore want to see evidence of market validation in your business plan because they do not want to invest in a product or service that is not commercially promising. Therefore, undertaking market validation demonstrates that you are not only reducing your risk of failure but reducing this for your investors as well. What steps are involved in market validation? Market validation requires you to talk to potential customers, end-users, and domain experts. Validation is about listening and gaining valuable insights and it enables you to test your assumptions and find out the following: What is the problem(s) that the customer needs solving? How big is the problem; where does it occur; and how frequently? Who is currently looking for a solution to the problem and how much are they willing to pay to solve it? How does your solution address the customer-identified problems? Where does the new technology fall short of satisfying customer needs? Why hasn\u2019t this problem been solved already? What are the current and future barriers that will prohibit the use or implementation of the new technology to solve the problem? How to access market validation support \u2013 EIT Food Seedbed Incubator case study The Seedbed Incubator helped Crover reach their target customers, of farmers and grain merchants, for their grain storage monitoring solution. The EIT Food Seedbed Incubator programme will help you overcome your market validation challenges, including: Defining your market and reaching customers Understanding food system challenges and regulatory hurdles Navigating through a dominated or crowded market A successfully completed market validation project will greatly improve the probability that your technology gets to market to solve real customers\u2019 problems.

On 23 February 2021, President von der Leyen, in the opening speech at the EU Industry Days 2021, highlighted the importance of the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) to build Europe\u2019s resilience, reduce dependency on third countries, improve resource efficiency and circularity to ensure Europe\u2019s ambition for a green and digital future. Green and digital technologies currently depend on a number of scarce raw materials. We import lithium for electric cars, platinum to produce clean hydrogen, silicon metal for solar panels. 98% of the rare earth elements we need come from a single supplier: China. This is not sustainable. So we must diversify our supply chains. And at the same time, we must invest in circular technologies that re-use resources instead of constantly extracting them. This is the goal of our Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials. This is why we have proposed to create a European Raw Materials Alliance. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) was announced on 3 September 2020 as part of the Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials and the publication of the 2020 List of Critical Raw Materials. EIT RawMaterials manages the Alliance and is committed to contributing to the achievement of the objectives set by the EU Green Deal as raw materials are indispensable drivers for the transformation from the brown to the green economy. Raw materials play a vital role in the revival, autonomy and resilience of Europe\u2019s industrial ecosystems. The European RawMaterials Alliance has grown to over 450 members, from Greenland to Australia. Over 100 investment cases are currently being evaluated, and we are committed to creating sustainable, responsible and resilient value chains to boost Europe\u2019s green and digital transition. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer, CEO, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials Metals, minerals, and advanced materials are the key enablers for a globally competitive, green, and digital Europe The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) contributes to ensuring reliable, secure, and sustainable access to raw materials. ERMA\u2019s vision is to secure access to critical and strategic raw materials, advanced materials, and processing know-how for EU industrial ecosystems. ERMA aims to make Europe economically more resilient by diversifying its supply chains, creating jobs, attracting investments to the raw materials value chain, fostering innovation, training young talents, and contributing to the best enabling framework for raw materials and the circular economy worldwide. Raw materials are the key enablers of the transition from the linear to the circular economy. Besides its role in boosting investments in the raw materials sectors and increasing EU\u2019s resilience, the European Raw Materials Alliance is a funnel for recommendations on specific actions that are economically, socially, and environmentally sound and responsible, to the benefit of the whole community. Massimo Gasparon, ERMA Director The Alliance involves all relevant stakeholders, including industrial actors along the value chain, Member States and regions, trade unions, civil society, research and technology organisations, investors, and NGOs. By 2030, ERMA\u2019s activities will increase the production of raw and advanced materials and address the circular economy by boosting the recovery and recycling of critical raw materials.

As soon as they enter \u2018Change Game', players are put in control of the world and their destiny. They have to decide how to use resources to advance their civilisation while dealing with the consequences of their decisions. They can invest in research, education and entertainment, and have to be mindful of the health, happiness and prosperity of their community. The higher the level of emissions players generate, the greater the challenges they will face, as all game scenarios are based on real climate data and scientific research. Just like in the real world, their cities may then encounter heatwaves, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and/or the spread of new diseases. Every action taken has consequences, positive or negative, on the planet: everything is governed by the climate emergency. Change Game allows people to learn, while playing, about many aspects of climate change, even if they are not very familiar with its impacts or with strategies to reduce emissions. Players do so by managing the production and consumption of energy, water and food, while coping with natural disasters. They also have the opportunity to adopt innovative solutions, to exploit the technologies of the future, to influence people\u2019s behaviour while interacting with nearby cities and to face scenarios that we already see happening in the real world. Eleonora Cogo, Senior Scientific Manager at the Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change (CMCC) Change Game represents the complexity of the climate system and its interactions with humankind and natural ecosystems. To translate this complexity in an accessible way, teachers and educators can use accompanying materials, which can help them foster a better understanding of the underlying assumptions that govern the climate change process.

With its business units FibriCheck, a medical app that detects heart rhythm disorders, and Extra Horizon, a secure, scalable platform that accelerates the launch of medical apps for other eHealth companies, Qompium stands at the cutting edge of innovation in eHealth. This capital injection will enable Qompium to continue to play a leading role in the digital transition of the healthcare sector. A transition that is now in overdrive due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qompium completed the new capital round with success, retaining the full trust of its current investors, including LRM, and medical experts. Qompium was founded in 2014 to accelerate and improve the implementation of digital health solutions. COVID-19 sparks accelerated growth Both FibriCheck and Extra Horizon have experienced exponential growth as a result of COVID-19. The pandemic sparked a significant rise in the use of mHealth (mobile health) solutions. During the lockdown, cardiologists began using FibriCheck on a massive scale to monitor patients remotely as part of the TeleCheck-AF project, initiated together with EIT Health partner Maastricht UMC+. At the same time, both new and established players rapidly began developing new medical applications and looked for solutions to bring them to market faster. Discover FibriCheck Qompium will use the newly invested EUR 9 million to further accelerate the growth of both its business units. FibriCheck has international growth in its sights, among others in Australia where the application was recently given the green light by the local regulator. As such, the app is rapidly evolving into a truly integrated solution, making remote monitoring a reality via a full range of consumer devices including wearables and hearables. Extra Horizon, in turn, is also seeing an increase in demand for technological support from companies looking to build secure, compliant and scalable medical applications. The transformation of the healthcare sector is progressing at a lightning pace. We have played a pioneering role in the field of digital health for six years now. COVID-19 has had an enormous impact on Qompium. The digital health market is in full transition mode and over the past year, we have been able to get a very accurate picture of our sweet spot in the market. Thanks to our investors, we are now in an even better position to realise our ambitions and expand our team not only to continue our growth but to remain at the forefront of digital health. Lars Grieten, CEO Qompium Qompium/Fibricheck was a winner of the EIT Health Catapult contest in 2017 and a beneficiary of the EIT Health Headstart and Bridgehead programmes, as well as an EIT Venture Award winner in 2018.

World Cancer Day is the global uniting initiative led by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). By raising worldwide awareness, improving education and catalysing personal, collective and governmental action, they work together to reimagine a world where millions of people are saved from preventable cancer and access to life-saving cancer treatment and care is equal for all. Through life-changing innovations, the EIT Community is taking part in tackling this challenge. Meet three of our EIT Award nominees from the past years and learn how they are fighting cancer through their innovative and unique solutions. Martin Boutiere - Nutr'Avenir Cancer patients are commonly fed with high protein diets to tackle malnutrition and this implies a risk of tumour growth. Nutr\u2019Avenir is a preclinical platform focused on nutrition for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. There is no other existing enteral nutrition research platform of this kind. The project will reduce morbidity and mortality among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. It will enable caregivers to positively affect the health conditions, recovery rate, and quality of life of their patients. Healthcare systems will subsequently benefit from a successful and economically effective option for cancer treatment. In 2020, Martin Boutiere won second place in the EIT CHANGE Award, the award that recognises graduates of EIT education programmes who spur innovation and entrepreneurship, inspiring change for a sustainable future. Martin completed his EIT-labelled Master in Technological Innovation in Health at the University of Grenoble Alpes.

By using big data and Artificial Intelligence, Inveox is making cancer diagnosis faster and safer. Between one and fifteen per cent of tissue samples are vulnerable to mix-ups, contamination, or getting lost. This can lead to false-positives and false-negatives. Inveox's products are designed to prevent that from happening. In 2019, Maria Sievert won second place for the EIT Woman Award. Inveox won the EIT Health Headstart in 2018 and this helped the start-up to expand its network. Watch Inveox pitch video Laura Soucek - Peptomyc The protein Myc is found in most human cancers and plays a significant role in the growth of new tumours. It is difficult to attack with drugs due to its location in the nuclei of the cells and its role in the division of healthy cells. Peptomyc relies on peptides, another fundamental component of the cell, to create therapeutics able to fight these Myc proteins. Peptomyc's peptide-based solution is a new treatment option for cancer options. The treatment is non-toxic, does not cause resistance, improves life-expectancy among patients, and can be used in combination with standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In 2018, Laura Soucek won the first EIT Public Award. Peptomyc has received support through three different EIT Health programmes.

Download the EIT Food Trust Report 2020 A study of 20 000 consumers across 18 European countries reveals trust in the food sector has increased over the course of 2020, yet the majority of consumers don\u2019t consider the sector to be working in the public interest. The EIT Food Trust Report surveyed 19 800 consumers from 18 European countries to measure trust in the food system and confidence in food products. The study was conducted by a consortium of pan-European academic partners including the University of Reading, the European Food Information Council (EUFIC), Aarhus University, KU Leuven, and the University of Warsaw. The report shows that consumer trust in all parts of the food sector has increased, and with it the confidence they have in food products, with overall increases of between 3% and 8%. Farmers hold public trust \u2013 but governments and manufacturers lag behind Of all players within the food sector, farmers are the most trusted by the public, with two-thirds (67%) of European consumers reporting that they trust farmers compared to just 13% that do not. Trust in both government agencies and food manufacturers, however, has lagged behind, with less than half of consumers across all countries (47% and 46% respectively) stating that they trust these groups. Meanwhile, over a quarter of consumers (29% and 26%) actively distrust government authorities and manufacturers respectively. Consumer demands on health and sustainability not being met by industry When it comes to confidence in food products themselves, consumers believe that food safety, on the whole, has improved, with an 8% increase from 2018 in those agreeing that food is generally safe, to a total of 55%. In the UK, this rises to 74%. Likewise, just three in 10 consumers (30%) are confident that food products are generally produced in a sustainable way - meaning environmentally friendly, resource-efficient, and ethically responsible, compared to 42% that consider them to be unsustainable. As the global population moves towards 10 billion by 2050, we need innovative technologies and collaborative approaches from farm to fork to deliver accessible and healthy food products in a sustainable way. The EIT Food Trust Report shows that there are clear opportunities for the food industry to demonstrate how it is acting in the public interest and meet consumer demand regarding health and sustainability. Professor Klaus Grunert, Department of Management at Aarhus University Ultimately, to create a future-fit food system, we must put consumers at the centre of the development, production, distribution and promotion of food. Many of our EIT Food projects work directly with consumers to increase transparency, thereby empowering healthy and sustainable food choices.

Workshop attendees may range from colleagues to friends to community members. The handbook\u2019s pragmatic and evidence-based principles for how to talk about climate change in daily life - on the bus, at work, at a sports event, or home over dinner. The Talking Climate training materials are based on the following foundational ideas: Day-to-day conversations about climate change matter. Social science shows that people are profoundly affected by the behaviour and views of those around them, particularly those they respect and trust. Politicians also need evidence of social consent before they will take radical policy action. That means public discussion, and breaking the \u2018climate silence,\u2019 is an important part of responding to the climate crisis. Every community matters. We cannot meet ambitious climate targets without universal engagement. Climate change conversations, therefore, need to be taking place across different parts of society, or climate policies will be rejected. Facts and figures are not enough. Providing more information about the causes and impacts of climate change is an important part of the puzzle in motivating people to take action\u2014but it is not the whole story. Research shows that people are also strongly influenced by the stories they hear around them, their values, and the connections they form. Talking Climate is about providing the tools to build skills in this area. Since the 1990s, psychologists, sociologists and other social scientists have been investigating how to get people thinking about and acting in response to the climate crisis. The Talking Climate Handbook synthesises this considerable evidence base with data from a wide range of sectors on how to have constructive conversations, combined with a 2019 citizen science experiment exploring how to have good climate conversations.

Read the report The beginning of a new decade asks for a fresh perspective on the local innovation ecosystem of Slovakia. On the one hand, one can identify the increasing quality and ambitions of Slovak founders, as well as increasing interest and support for open innovation initiatives from corporates and universities. On the other hand, start-ups and innovation initiatives are starting to have a more concrete, sector-specific character and cannot be put into a single category anymore. The formation of these specific communities may represent a turning point and a tremendous opportunity for the Slovak innovation ecosystem. Sector-specific communities of entrepreneurs, corporates, and researchers can be better positioned to retain and attract talent, create meaningful connections between start-ups, corporates, and universities, or make the regional Research and development (R&D) base more attractive and investable. They can generate more tailor-made support for entrepreneurs by aggregating valuable sector-specific knowledge, streamlining growth opportunities, and engaging the local or regional economies. If well supported and nurtured, sector-specific innovation communities can drive the growth, competitiveness, and attractiveness of Slovakia\u2019s regional economies. This report puts five emerging innovation communities to the forefront of a wider discussion: healthcare, climate resilience, fintech, digital and creative, and mobility.

All in all, technology allowed the EIT Community once again to embrace the extended urban mobility ecosystem from a distance and to exchange insights and views on how we can contribute to make sustainable urban mobility a reality. To go fast, you should go alone, but to go far, you should go together. We believe that there is no other way than going fast together to go far. Maria Tsavachidis, EIT Urban Mobility Chief Executive Officer In the morning of 10 December, participants had the privilege to be the first to hear the Director General of the European Commission for Transport and Mobility, Henrik Hololei, debating about the EU's Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy that had been adopted the day before by the European Commission, which will pave the way towards mobility compatible with the European climate-neutrality ambition. A strategy supporting urban mobility and making cities more liveable and citizens' lives easier, as Henrik Hololei stated during the institutional session. To make all this possible, further collaboration on urban mobility between the public and private sector is needed, as Karima Delli, Chairwoman of the TRAN Committee at the European Parliament, stated. This session has also been the occasion for Mohamed Mezghani, Secretary General of UITP, to describe his vision for the way we will move around in 2030: people in cities will be moving less, move more locally and mainly walk in cities, while the speed limit will be 30 km/h, with less privately-owned cars, and the road will be shared with public transport. Participants also had time to reflect on how our unexpected guest of 2020, COVID-19, has impacted our lives and the ways we understand mobility and safety in urban spaces. Throughout the Summit, participants learned more about how entrepreneurs and start-ups have become this year\u2019s heroes by working on developing solutions that could neutralise the spread of the virus. Keep reading about the topic The Summit allowed participants to explore also the views of young researchers on urban mobility. The researchers that are putting their ideas at the disposal of creating solutions that help organisations build more efficient and sustainable means of urban mobility. And participants learnt from others who have implemented successful strategies on urban mobility, which will enable cities to provide better mobility opportunities to their citizens. The golden closing of these very thrilling days was the InnovaCity Awards Final. Innovacity is a two and a half-day hackathon-style workshop providing participants with the essential skills of design thinking and the opportunity to apply these skills while working to solve the biggest mobility challenges.

Furthermore, an extensive user survey was conducted in the cities of Munich, Copenhagen, Tel-Aviv, Budapest, Barcelona and Stockholm and data were collected for informing about the typical usage forms of e-micromobility, useful for decision makers and urban planners. Best practices and results of e-micromobile integration potentials have been identified and analysed with calculations and visualisations. Proposals on how transport, and particularly public transport, can be strengthened and made more attractive if e-micromobility is integrated into the traffic systems of European cities in an appropriate way have also been put forward. Specific safety aspects of e-micromobility, including an analysis and understanding of main safety problems and priorities have been established based on accident frequencies, severities and suitable measures and techniques/technologies for safety improvement were derived. Finally, a conference was organised by UnternehmerTUM on 12 November 2020 which disseminated results of the MOBY project. All MOBY-related reports are now available The specific conditions and solutions in the field of e-micromobility have been mapped. The analysis consisted of two parts, first the regulatory, planning, financial conditions for usage of these new transport modes were assessed, then the mobility-related requirements including user needs and travel behaviour were discovered.

Read the full report In this report, an in-depth review of research and statistics to illustrate how e-micromobility has become an integral part of urban mobility systems. The report argues that e-micromobility should be seen as a new mode of transportation, that responds to widespread demand for multimodal urban transport. In this way, micromobility could constitute an important part of an attractive alternative to private motoring and fossil-fuelled vehicles. In line with the above, this study provides examples of current best-practices of e-micromobility in European cities (including Tel Aviv), as well as examples of the problems and complaints that the principles of e-micromobility have been met. As a silver line, this report will present a toolkit for regulations, policies, etc. that will help release the potential of micromobility as a vital part of sustainable, intermodal urban transport.

They must meet regulatory and company monitoring and performance demands and respond during supply outages. Spottitt's power and gas network monitoring services allow TSOs and DSOs to increase monitoring accuracy and frequencies without investment in personnel or hardware. Satellites remotely capture high-resolution imagery and data across hundreds of thousands of square kms daily. This data is accurately analysed at scale to provide data on a range of asset risk and performance KPIs (vegetation and building encroachment and height, fire risk, land motion, flooding, risk detection and gas leaks). Pilot in Poland The Polish national gas distribution network provider Polska Sp\u00f3\u0142ka Gazownictwa sp. z o.o. PSG for short own and maintain some 185,000 km\u2019s of underground gas distribution pipelines, of which approx. 8000 km are medium elevated and high pressure pipelines. PSG have a legal requirement to monitor these high medium elevated and high pressure pipelines on an annual basis for issues with vegetation and building encroachment. Like many gas network providers PSG conduct annual visual monitoring via the use of helicopters who fly the length of the high pressure network, in a pilot Spottitt showed the advantages of using satellite images as alternative. Even with no-go buffer zones of just a few meters either side of the pipeline, the algorithms developed by Spottitt accurately classified and flagged trees, buildings and potential gas leaks along the entire 80km of gas distribution pipeline monitored. Spottitt\u2019s estimated service provision cost for annual monitoring approx 25% cheaper than traditional aerial visual inspection. Anticipated increased detection rates of vegetation, building and potential gas leak issue detection via automated analysis of each image pixel versus traditional aerial visual inspection.

The platform has been launched on Thursday 17 December, the launch event took place online and included a virtual tour of the platform and the life cycle analysis (LCA) e-learning tool, as well as hearing perspectives from two Nordic municipalities that are working with wood, Viken and V\u00e4xj\u00f6. This project is supported by EIT Climate-KIC in partnership with the Danish Technological Institute, WeThinkNordic, Arkitema and COWI. The whole event was recorded, relieve the launch here We are proud to present NoMu Wood, and we hope that it can be the catalyst for change amongst municipalities in Norway. The platform will give Nordic municipalities a great grounding in wood construction and LCA knowledge and equip them to lead the charge in the low-carbon construction revolution. Anders Vestergaard Jensen, Project Manager of the Nordic Wood in Construction Secretariat at EIT Climate-KIC With an abundance of sustainably sourced timber, infamous architectural prowess and some of the world\u2019s most ambitious climate targets, the Nordics are well-positioned to play a central role in the coming low-carbon revolution in construction: wood. Through local procurement, municipalities have the power to drive local supply chains towards timber construction, support local bioeconomies and cut carbon emissions in the construction sector \u2014 all while creating beautiful and healthy places to live for their citizens. NoMuWood aims to provide the resources to enable municipalities to make that transition. By gathering resources and information to guide them through the process, NoMuWood gives Nordic Municipalities interested in building with wood everything they need to get started. The platform also includes a case library with numerous and varied examples of wooden buildings from around the region and offers guidance from the idea and tender stage to the end of life. With life cycle analysis (LCA) playing an increasing role in assessing the carbon impact of different construction materials, the platform is also home to an LCA e-learning tool. Seven online training modules give municipal actors the skills and knowledge they need to work with LCA through the tendering, design, and operation phases, and how wood buildings perform under these analyses.

Where does our food come from? How does food affect our health? And our planet? Knowing the answers to these questions are crucial to overcome the major problems our society is facing today in terms of obesity, food waste and the impact of our food system on the environment. Read on to find out how the WeValueFood project engaged and empowered the next generation of European consumers to make improved food choices. Infotainment for children in Iceland In Iceland, project partner Mat\u00eds designed the Krakkar Kokka (Kids Cooking) programme, through which primary and lower secondary school children learned about the United Nations\u2019 global goals, food traditions, local resources and sustainability through play and education. This \u2018infotainment\u2019 method aims to increase children\u2019s knowledge about regional food production and raise their awareness of responsible consumption behaviour and sustainable production methods. As part of this programme, children went on field trips to primary food producers in the area and gathered raw ingredients in the wild. Afterwards, they learned how to cook these ingredients and had a chance to eat what they prepared. These trips were documented so children all over the country could learn from them. For this purpose, children themselves were involved in making the videos, with the help of their teachers. Via the Krakkar kokka Instagram, children and their parents, as well as local food producers can learn about local food resources and how to prepare them. Another infotainment approach was the \u2018Food in space\u2019 day. Children between the age of 12 -15 years old learned about the history of space travel, food and food circulation in space, our senses, and how our perception changes in space. Children participated in several practical exercises focussing on our senses and food in general and within the context of space. Virtual store and farm visits in Finland and Poland In Finnish and Polish schools, the project partners the University of Helsinki and the University of Warsaw, introduced the Finnish food educational tool called \u2018Trip to the store\u2019. This initiative aimed to increase the interest and understanding of third-fifth grade pupils regarding food. Children were educated about the origin of food and healthy eating. The idea was that by raising young people\u2019s interest in food, their awareness and appreciation of food also increased. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, trips to the stores were conducted virtually. Via a remote connection, children had the opportunity to speak to a store manager and to go online grocery shopping. By doing this, they have learned where the products in a store come from, which bread is the richest in fibre and which food products are domestically produced. Besides the store visits, children also visited a goat farm and enjoyed an online chat with a farmer. Lesson plans for these and over 350 other educational tools can be found in a decision support tool, called Database for Educators: Choices for Incorporating Food (DECIFood). DECIFood can be used by educators across primary, secondary, and tertiary educations levels, to help them retrieve and utilise suitable resources about food education, based on defined criteria selected by educators. Access the DECIFood tool Peer-to-peer communication in the UK and Spain In the UK and Spain, young food-savvy consumers, called Food Champions, were recruited to inspire their peers through sharing food-related knowledge on social media and school networks. In this way, the Food Champions contribute to a society that is more knowledgeable and discerning about the origin of food and how it affects our health and planet. At Queen\u2019s University Belfast, a group of students who were already highly engaged with food matters, received training and support from communication experts on how to share evidence-based information, to amplify their voice online, and to engage with followers. The students communicated the value of food through social media and peer-to-peer activities, empowering their existing networks to make healthy lifestyle choices. Another group of students, more disengaged with food issues, participated in a parallel programme aimed to develop their food skills. Through online workshops and cooking classes, students learned about topics such as food waste, food labels, and food safety. In Spain, IMDEA Food and the Food Science department of the University of Madrid (UAM), fostered a network of Food Champions. These Food Champions included food and science graduates, and they were encouraged to attend online events addressing nutrition and health-related topics as well as to create their own social media channels and communicate about such topics. The Food Champions were inspired to build a meaningful connection with their audience, combining a flair for communication with a robust background in food and health science. In the video below, the Spanish Food Champions Madres Cientificas, CocinaCorreCome, beFEEDus, Fermentilandia, introduce themselves and their social media channels, the reason why they decided to join the WeValueFood project, and their project activities. About the WeValueFood project The WeValueFood project is a two-year Grand Challenge project funded by EIT Food, aimed to educate, engage and advance the young Europeans\u2019 knowledge and appreciation of food, thereby empowering the next generations to make the best choices about the food that they eat. The project involves 12 European partners from education, academia and industry, and communication sectors. WeValueFood ran from 2019-2020 and was led by Queen\u2019s University Belfast.

Corrosion is a disease to materials and poses a significant risk to many industrial facilities and structures such as pipelines, storage tanks, boilers, heat exchangers, and other equipment and systems. Overall, corrosion is one of the critical materials failure mechanism in industry and annually responsible for costs amounting to trillions of euros. In the EIT RawMaterials up-scaling project 'CorTools', corrosion on-line monitoring and prediction software tools are developed to respond to the needs of raw materials industry. We need to understand the behaviour of construction materials of tanks, containers, pipes, mixers, i.e. stainless steels in the operation conditions. In this project, we focus on raw materials processing conditions and are creating a materials selection tool, a virtual expert and corrosion on-line monitoring solution. Elina Huttunen-Saarivirta, Research Professors, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd The unique Cortools consortium: Boliden Harjavalta Oy, DMS, Ferritico, Outokumpu Stainless AB, Metso:Outotec, Tecnalia, ZAG and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, enables the co-creation and industrial validation of the tools. For the industrial project partners, the developed tools enable more than 1 M\u20ac annual savings through the prevention of corrosion failures. For the European raw materials industry in whole, the project may allow billions of euros in savings. The software tool will make it easier to support our technical marketing and sales. The tool will decrease the need for time-consuming corrosion testing and it will be easier for the industry to choose the most optimum stainless steel grade as construction material. Lena Wegrelius, Head of Corrosion, Outokumpu Stainless AB Collaboration across the whole industrial value chain is carried out in the project to cover multiple dimensions (laboratory, pilot, operational environment) in the tool prediction capabilities and thus facilitate market penetration of the software tool. The use of digital on-site measuring technologies and computer modelling will connect various operational scales, therefore contributing to an improvement in material- and energy efficiency of the raw materials processing industries. Machine learning creates \u201dvirtual expert\u201d The corrosion on-line monitoring and prediction software tools provide the raw materials sector yet another footstep towards digitalisation. Another giant progress is the link to artificial intelligence (AI). In this project, AI is used in computational modelling. Furthermore, a remote collection of on-line monitoring data allows later for the hidden causalities in the project conditions (e.g. mineral quality in hydrometallurgy) and the detected corrosion rate to be disclosed with the aid of AI. The software tool is developed by the project partner Ferritico. We make use of the available data when creating this virtual expert. Industries have huge sets of experimentally measured corrosion data and this is a big source of information and motivation to develop a machine learning tool. We are predicting failure events based on all of the available features instead of developing complex physical or chemical models of corrosion. Satish Kolli, Materials Informatics Engineer, Ferritico The user needs are twofold. First, a materials selection tool, a \u201cvirtual expert\u201d, that allows for evaluation of a corrosion risk of materials under various operation conditions emerged. Based on machine learning, this \u201cvirtual expert\u201d finds the safe operating conditions for a given material and estimates the lifetime of materials in specific conditions. Second, on-line corrosion monitoring systems in industrial facilities reveal the actual corrosion rate of the materials and makes it possible to evaluate the remaining lifetime of the components.

In less than six months, a team of five EIT Digital Master School students went from successfully winning a high-profile European hackathon to incorporating their start-up, Entremo, where more than 20 people are currently contributing. Entremo is about to deploy their main product, a wristband to remotely monitor the vital signs of patients, in hospitals and nursing homes in Hungary. Entremo\u2019s journey within EIT Digital is testimony to how teamwork, talent and entrepreneurial spirit can quickly generate results. It all started with a group of friends passionate about using technology to improve people\u2019s health and wellbeing, all of them involved in different EIT Digital Master School programmes: Data Science graduate Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo, teamed up with M\u00e1rton Elodi (Human Computer Interaction and Design), Mikl\u00f3s Knebel (Autonomous Systems), Levente Mitnyik (Embedded Systems) and Peter Danos (Visual computing and communication). Together with another friend, motion graphic designer Krist\u00f3f Nagy, they formed Team Discover, a group of developers which successfully took part in several hackathons in the last two years. They received a special EIT Health award at the Hack the Crisis Hungary hackathon in early 2020. In April they went on to win the European Commission #EUvsVirus hackathon\u2019s Healthcare category with a prototype of their 3D-printed remote monitoring device. The device originally came in the shape of \u2018smart glasses\u2019, worn by patients to check parameters such as body temperature, oxygen saturation, pulse and respiratory rates. The measured data is then made available to the medical staff via an online platform. As a result, instead of one patient, nurses are able to check on dozens of them at the same time. Then things started moving fast. In mid-2020, EIT Digital Innovation Factory launched the \"DATA against COVID-19\" initiative, with the objective of quickly developing digital tools to fight back the pandemic. The EUvsVirus award had given the team significant international exposure and put them on the radar of companies and institutions, so they quickly found four partners: ELTE-Soft, MOHAnet and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lorand University from Hungary and InnoTractor from the Netherlands. The activity was selected by the Innovation Factory and received EUR 500 000 of support from EIT Digital. Later, the Entremo team decided to pivot their product, dropping the \u2018smart glasses\u2019 shape for a more convenient and practical wristband, with similar features but better usability. The glasses were more invasive, and they also might be in the way of oxygen masks for COVID patients. In addition, people are used to having watches on their hands 24/7, so that doctors can get analysis from night activities as well. Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo All the other missing pieces ended up falling into place. We've been developing our product with the four partner companies for the past six months and it's been quite a hectic journey; there were so many new experiences that we went through. But I\u2019m happy to say that now we have all the pipeline ready: from the measuring device to its communication with the data collection hubs, and then the communication of the data collection hubs with our servers, up to pushing the data from the servers to the display of the medical staff . Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo. Right now, the team is 3D printing the first batches of 50 devices which will be used in the first two product deployments in Hungary, scheduled in December, with two other Hungarian pilots planned for January. Entremo is currently looking for investors to further scale the company.", "eit432": "Sweden has submitted a new national strategy developed in cooperation with EIT InnoEnergy on batteries to the Swedish Government. It shows how Sweden can take a leading position in the development of the sustainable battery value chain. The battery regulations proposed by the European Commission on 10 December highlights the need of minimising both the social and the carbon footprint of the battery industry. The national strategy is supported by companies across the value chain as well as universities and environmental organisations. National strategy for the Swedish battery industry Last week a proposal of the new battery regulation was adopted by the European Commission. The proposal is ambitious \u2013 it aims at minimising both the carbon footprint and the social footprint of the batteries. This is accelerated by the European Battery Alliance, launched by EU Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovic in 2017, with the aim of building a sustainable battery value chain in Europe. The Swedish strategy for a sustainable battery value chain shows how actions in Sweden will contribute to the European battery industry development. The development of sustainable battery production is not only important for achieving climate goals, but also enables the emergence of a competitive industry that creates growth and jobs throughout the battery value chain. The big demand for electrification in the transport sector and industry processes have made battery manufacturing a bottle-neck. Sustainably produced batteries can become the next big Swedish industry expansion. Svante Axelsson, National Coordinator for Fossil Free Sweden Ideally placed to take a leading position In Bloomberg NEF\u00b4s \u2018Global Lithium-Ion Battery Supply Chain Ranking\u2019 Sweden is projected to climb from number 10 to number 4 by 2025, only lagging behind China, Japan and the U.S. Sweden has a strong position, with access to raw materials, cheap and fossil-free electricity, expertise and policy instruments that promote continued electrification with high environmental requirements. In addition, Sweden has strong actors along the entire value chain, from recycling and mining to the manufacture of active materials, complete battery cells and battery packs, to applications in the automotive industry as well as in the power system. Supported by key actors across the value chain The national strategy for a sustainable battery value chain is developed by the government initiative Fossil Free Sweden in cooperation with EIT InnoEnergy who also developed the foundation of the European Battery Strategy for the European Commission. The strategy is supported by actors from the entire value chain from the Swedish mining industry to the battery-cell producer Northvolt, vehicle manufacturers like Volvo Cars, Volvo Group and Scania and electricity distributor Vattenfall as well as universities and environmental organisations. Sweden is already today an integral part of the European battery ecosystem, but there is room for development in many parts of the value chain and here the strategy can be an important tool. We are impressed by the commitment of everyone involved and look forward how the example of this strategy work can be used as a role model for other European countries to follow. Kenneth Johansson, CEO EIT InnoEnergy Scandinavia Five areas in focus The strategy makes a list of demands for national policy within five areas: Sustainable batteries for a fossil-free energy and transport system: Stimulate demand for and use of sustainable batteries Sustainable battery production, a new industry for Sweden: Create conditions for the development of a sustainable battery value chain in Sweden Recovery and extraction of materials for a sustainable and circular battery industry: Create conditions to enable the mining industry and the recycling industry to contribute sustainably produced raw materials Skills development for a charged future: Invest in research, innovation and education for skills development Collaboration and dialogue for growth and export: Implement and follow up the action proposals through broad collaboration throughout the battery value chain Visit EIT InnoEnergy website to learn more about sustainable energy innovations", "eit433": "The EIT Digital Accelerator congratulates KONUX, the Munich-based Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scale-up , on reaching an important milestone in their mission to transform railway operations.

On 8 December, the first meeting of the ERMA Rare Earth Magnets and Motors Cluster was held online. Over 100 ERMA partners from industry, universities and research organisations, national authorities, different association and financial institutions participated in the meeting. Six rare earth related projects were presented to identify investment opportunities, synergies and collaboration across the value chain. The first draft of a rare earth action plan for Europe developed over the last months by a group of stakeholders from the REE sector was also presented during the meeting. The work on this action plan continues within the ERMA Rare Earth Magnets and Motors Cluster through specific task forces that will identify challenges and regulatory bottlenecks along the value chain and develop recommendations and actions for Europe. All members of the Cluster are invited to join these task forces. Please contact ERMA team at erma@eitrawmaterials if you are interested in joining the Rare Earth Magnets and Motors Cluster. More about ERMA", "eit437": "The SaferPlaces project, supported by EIT Climate-KIC, has created a climate service to increase climate resilience in urban areas. Cities are expected to experience more frequent and severe flooding, due to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events many Europeans are vulnerable to their impacts. Future projections are not reassuring either, since the combination of climate change with other factors, such as the increase in population concentration and permeability of soil in urban environments, is further contributing to the risks associated with flooding. Cities need to start transitioning into more climate and flood resilient urban spaces Cities must act quickly by planning and re-designing with climate projections in mind and provide concrete steps to create more resilient urban spaces. Flood risk information is an essential element of urban planning: it can be used to make informed decisions about climate adaptation strategies that promote economic growth and boost wellbeing, while at the same time mitigating risks. SaferPlaces, a project co-financed by EIT Climate-KIC, coordinated by GECOsistema Srl and developed together with research institutions such as Fondazione Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC) and Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam (GFZ), universities, such as the University of Bologna and Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, and private companies such as the Meteorological and Environmental Earth Observation (MEEO), aims to contribute to the creation of dedicated tools for decision-making and the design of urban regeneration interventions, both necessary to mitigate the risks associated with climate change. More about SaferPlaces The project aims to create a climate service to assess the risks and dangers of rain, river, and coastal flooding in urban environments. In order to improve urban flood-proofing, new resource-effective tools are needed to support data-driven climate services, and resilience and adaptation in our cities. The use of innovative climate, hydrological, hydraulic, topographic, and economic modelling techniques allows relevant stakeholders to examine current and future climate scenarios which will help inform the appropriate means to plan, design and build safer and more resilient communities. As part of the project, an online platform has been developed, providing information to support climate adaptation plans in cities and providing different simulations of possible flooding scenarios. These scenarios provide an excellent basis for collaboration among all actors involved in urban planning and flood management, such as public authorities, engineers, civil protection agencies and insurance companies. These actors can use SaferPlaces\u2019 results to identify the best risk reduction and climate adaptation strategies, but also to calculate the economic benefits of different mitigation options. The SaferPlaces platform is currently operational for four pilot case studies: Rimini and Milan (Italy), Pamplona (Spain) and Cologne (Germany). To date, most of the project\u2019s activities have been focused on Rimini, a city potentially exposed to coastal flooding due to sea-level rise and increasingly intense storm events, and home to the largest urban regeneration project in Italy, called \u2018Parco del Mare\u2019, or Sea Park. Increasing climate resilience in Italy The Rimini Sea Park \u2018Parco del Mare\u2019 aims to improve the environmental and landscape conditions of the seafront promenade in the area of south Rimini Sud. In addition, it increases the resilience of the entire community in the face of climate change, providing protection against torrential rains and sea intrusion. \u2019Parco del Mare\u2019 is considered a Nature-Based Solution, a concept used by the European Commission to define all those interventions inspired by nature, which provide environmental, social and economic benefits and at the same time help to increase urban resilience to climate change. The SaferPlaces platform carried out a detailed analysis of the potential damage associated with different scenarios of coastal storm flooding, torrential rains, or exceptionally high sea level. The effect of the sea park as a tool for the prevention and mitigation of flood damage was also evaluated. After evaluating the cost-benefit ratio of Rimini\u2019s \u2018Parco del Mare\u2019, the amount saved with this adaptation far exceeds the expected investment. The sea park is therefore efficient and economically sustainable, which in addition to the regeneration and aesthetic improvement of the new sea promenade, will protect the entire city from future flooding generated by climate change. The SaferPlaces team is hoping to expand to two other pilot case cities, Pamplona and Cologne. The potential of this climate service is enormous for the many countries and cities around the world that are increasingly threatened by the danger of flooding. Given the success SaferPlaces have seen, combining climate scenarios with urban mapping, risk assessment and economic impact modelling has great potential to be extended to other types of climate risks, such as heatwaves in the future.

Discover EIT Urban Mobility Academy Urban planning and tactical urbanism By releasing its first MOOC \u2018Designing the cycling city\u2019, co-developed with HumanKind, Competence Hub put the spotlight on sustainable urban planning and on tactical urbanism. This course is directed by Lior Steinberg and George Liu, two strong cycling activists and recognised academics. It provides insightful knowledge on how to design cities to be more cycling friendly. This five-week course explores the best practices in bicycle infrastructure design and how to bring these elements to your own city and home context. It also includes a final design project that enables participants to develop a plan for transforming the street of their choice. Register for the course The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly driven change in cities for more sustainable means of urban mobility. In collaboration with RMIT University, the EIT Urban Mobility WebTV has travelled to London, Barcelona and Milan to discover three agile approaches to tackle the COVID-19 challenge. These initiatives provide interesting examples of how tactical urbanism, the use of low cost, short term, and scalable solutions to initiate long term changes in cities, has been successfully used by cities over the past few months. The Barcelona Superblocks are also another good example of tactical urbanism. In a series of five videos, Salvador Rueda, one of the founding fathers of the Superblock concept, explains what these traffic-free neighborhoods are about and what they can achieve. This ambitious model has inspired many cities around Europe, such as Brussels. The Minister of Brussels-Capital Region in charge of Mobility, Public Works and Road Safety, Elke Van den Brandt, explains how the \u2018Good Move\u2019 project is transforming mobility in Brussels. In Stockholm, the \u2018Future Streets\u2019 project enabled the temporary redesign of three streets close to schools to give more space back to people. Interviewed for the WebTV, Dan Hill, Director of strategic design at Vinnova and Tobias Nordstr\u00f6m, CEO and Urban Planner at Spacescape, explain how the project also included the children of the schools at an early stage in the design process.

Over 74 students are currently enrolled in the Master programme and 100 students have completed the PhD which focuses on innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and leadership. Students who have successfully passed an EIT-labelled educational programme will be provided with the skillset to create a real impact in business and address major food system challenges. From January 2021, recruitment is open for the next cohort of entrepreneurs set to develop cutting edge solutions to societal problems. Interested participants can find out more via the EIT Food website. Both programmes are supported by over 15 leading European universities which support a diverse network of Pan-European students. Discover more about the EIT Food Education Programmes This major achievement demonstrates the commitment of EIT Food Education and their Partner Network to develop and implement highly innovative, relevant programmes to nurture top talent that will drive positive impact throughout the food system. The EIT Label clearly signals to employers that the graduates from the programme are equipped to act as innovators and respond to societal challenges. They have the entrepreneurial and technical skills to imagine and drive innovations towards a world where everybody can access and enjoy sustainable, safe, and healthy food, with trust and fairness from farm to fork. We are already welcoming the EIT Label Review for next year and are hoping this is only the starting point of having our other programmes awarded the EIT Label too. Dr Maarten van der Kamp - Director of Education at EIT Food Master of Food Systems \u2013 Programme of EIT Food Education The Programme \u2018Master in Food Systems\u2019 (MFS), developed by six participating universities, is an integrated graduate degree programme organised by academic institutions and industrial partners from across the EIT Food partner network. Its goal is to prepare students to drive a future transformation of the food system. The MFS programme promotes a deep knowledge of the food system as an integrated value chain by providing students with the opportunity to study consecutively at three academic institutions which provide distinctly different semester blocks, each one of them focusing on specific areas of the food system. This is coupled with partner-mentored activities and thesis work jointly offered by pan-European industrial partners. Currently, six universities are participating, which include: University of Madrid, Queen's University of Belfast, University of Warsaw, University of Reading, University of Turin and University of Hohenheim. I consider the network one of the biggest advantages of the programme and I plan to continue to make use of it long after I graduate. The Master also made me realise that it\u2019s a huge advantage to gain knowledge across many fields, rather than being a specialist in only one area. The course gave me the ability to look at things from a different, broader perspective and allowed me to assume the position of \u2018dot-connector\u2019 - so finding relationships between stakeholders and between seemingly unrelated things to better solve problems. Rieke Sproten - Belgian student in the Master of Food Systems Programme Global Food Venture \u2013 Programme of EIT Food Education The Global Food Venture Programme supports highly qualified PhD students from across Europe to transform their research into a viable business in the Food and AgTech space.

One of the must-attend annual events of the European health calendar, the EIT Health Summit has moved fully online this year and continues on 1 and 3 December 2020. Find out more and register About 1 500 participants had already registered by the beginning of the event, said Alexander von Gabain, EIT Health Supervisory Board Chair, in remarks to open the Summit Series on 24 November 2020. He took the opportunity to reflect on EIT Health\u2019s growth in the last five years, and its current direction, which he noted is aligned with the mission of Horizon Europe. It is now time for strategic integration and consolidation to set the right impact by transforming healthcare systems, and to utilise the entire network which we have available in Europe. Alexander von Gabain - EIT Health Supervisory Board Chair Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health, shared his thoughts on the challenges and opportunities facing EIT Health as a network of healthcare innovators. As COVID 19 is painfully showing us again, population health is the very backbone of our society, of social cohesion and, ultimately, economic prosperity. So, of course COVID has tested our health systems, but it has also sparked digital innovation and, maybe most importantly, transformative thinking, showing us what\u2019s truly possible when we collaborate. Jan-Philipp Beck - CEO of EIT Health The first two sessions All sessions in the EIT Health Summit Series are recorded, so if you miss anything, you can watch it online. Artificial Intelligence - Tuesday 24 November 2020 The panel topic for the opening day was Implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare: Success Beyond the Buzzword, which was moderated by EIT Health\u2019s director of innovation, Jorge Juan Fern\u00e1ndez. He noted that EIT Health\u2019s extensive work with activities that involve AI encouraged research and discussions, as well as the publication of EIT Health\u2019s report on \u2018Transforming Healthcare with AI\u2019. Panellists Dr Bertalan Mesk\u00f3 and Dr John Halamka agreed that AI will not replace clinicians but rather those clinicians who use AI will replace those who do not. Dr Mesk\u00f3, director of The Futurist Institute, maintained that AI will relieve administrative burdens, allowing medical professionals to spend more time focused on patients. Dr Halamka, president of the Mayo Clinic Platform, noted that by analysing raw data from patient monitors in the home, AI enables remote medicine. It delivers the same quality and the same outcomes at a lower cost in non-traditional settings. By 2030, the Mayo Clinic will see a significant expansion in the amount of care delivered at a distance in non-traditional settings, and we will train the next generations of professionals to do this. Dr Halamka - President of the Mayo Clinic Platform Watch a recording of this session High Value Care - Thursday, 26 November 2020 The session covering High Value Care was moderated by Christina \u00c5kerman, Chair of the EIT Health High Value Care Forum Advisory Board. We need to take the waste out of the system and make the care high value care. Christina \u00c5kerman - Chair of the EIT Health High Value Care Forum Advisory Board Three expert panellists presented the ways in which their organisations had taken a high value care approach to reduce healthcare costs and improve results by focusing on what patients want. Henk Veeze, Senior International Medical Director of Diabeter Nederland, a diabetes care centre that rewards good health outcomes to encourage high value care, presented an interview with one of his patients who said that his experience with Diabeter was the first time anyone had asked him what he wanted as a patient. Jan Hazelzet, Professor of Health Care Quality and Outcome of Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, said the big challenge to implementing High Value Care in an institution is encouraging buy-in from staff, while on the European level the challenge is achieving comparable patient data. When you ask what can EIT Health do, for me the answer is: stimulate, educate and integrate!

Recycling as a major pillar of raw materials supply. Raw materials are essential to securing the transition to green energy technologies, growth and sustainable consumption. Hence, the European Green Deal recognises access to resources as a strategic security question to fulfil its ambition. Considering the materials needs of a growing world population, recycling will have to evolve from a side stream to a major pillar of raw materials supply. Currently, recycling rates of some base metals are higher than 50%. However, many crucial elements are almost completely lost in the value chain. This is particularly the case for Critical Raw Materials, where many of them have recycling rates below 1% and production from primary resources often comes with large environmental footprints and socio-economic issues. EIT RawMaterials fosters the shift from linear to circular economy. Raw, processed and advanced materials, from primary and secondary sources, are the backbone of Europe\u2019s economy. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer - CEO of EIT RawMaterials EIT RawMaterials supports projects and new businesses that scale up and introduce new technological solutions on recycling and circularity. These are aimed at driving the process of transformation, improving both the amount and quality of raw materials recovered from end-of-life products, industrial residues, tailings, and urban and landfill mining, while addressing sustainability and decarbonisation. Supported and currently ongoing projects in this area include: Improving battery recycling processes. The projects ReLieVe and AutoBatRec2020 intend to develop innovative closed-loop processes to recycle Li-ion batteries from electric vehicles and industrialised recycling processes in Europe that provide a sustainable raw materials source for its high-tech industry. Transforming waste into useful metallurgical products. As a great deal of valuable industrial waste with high metallic content is unused, diluted with other waste streams or dumped in landfills, CarSiFer intends to produce raw materials dedicated to foundries from wastes containing carbon/graphite, silicon and metals such as carbon, silicon and iron. Employing fully recyclable basalt derived mineral fibres. To reduce the energy consumption of cars, critical raw materials can be replaced by fully recyclable polymer composite materials. C2CC is developing new basalt derived mineral fibres, which are associated with thermo-set resins derived from biomass to produce Basalt-PMC. This can be chemically \u2018cleaved\u2019 to recover both a polymer, used to produce car interiors, and the fibres, which are reused for the original components. Recycling end-of-life products for new products. Even though LED allows a significant reduction in energy consumption for lighting in buildings, towns or transport, there is no technical solution for recycling LED as of today. Hence, REDLED develops a technology to recycle LEDs and to develop a new source of secondary resources for the circular economy. EIT RawMaterials facilitates new technologies, research, and developments The European industrial ecosystems have a great potential to build on and to further develop disruptive solutions, which are addressing the Circular Economy needs. However, the European Union\u2019s economy still loses a significant amount of raw materials due to lacking recycling capacities as well as transportation and transaction inefficiencies. In addition, current waste streams are confronted with inadequate collection systems and sub-optimal sorting and recycling performance. End-of-life products must be considered as a resource for another cycle, while losses and stocks of unused materials must be minimised and valorised along the value chain as well as from a design perspective. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer -CEO of EIT RawMaterials EIT RawMaterials carries out different activities to accelerate innovation in new technologies and to promote developments that support the raw materials industry. EIT RawMaterials\u2019 work is based on partnerships between industry, research institutes and universities, and is built on three pillars: acceleration, matchmaking and networking, and the RawMaterials academy. Acceleration activities ensure the development, demonstration and transfer of innovative processes, technologies, products and services towards the market. Actions range from upscaling projects to improving their success rate of market entry, and up to boost their growth by helping to create novel businesses from innovative technologies, products and services. Matchmaking and Networking activities stimulate internal links between EIT RawMaterials\u2019 partners as well as external links with other stakeholders and initiatives. The Raw Materials Summit, last held in September 2020, gathers experts to discuss strategies concerning raw materials supply and access, innovation, entrepreneurship and education. Further actions include a digital networking, collaboration and knowledge platform (InfoCenter) or innovation events providing a forum to exchange ideas, knowledge and best practices. RawMaterials Academy strives to educate the raw materials game-changers of the future. Offers include masters and PhD programmes, learning courses for professional training and projects for school pupils.

ERMA's most important task is to secure raw materials supply in Europe by identifying investment opportunities for sustainable and socially responsible access to raw materials in Europe from primary and secondary sources. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer - CEO of EIT RawMaterials, in charge of the European Raw Materials Alliance At the kick-off meeting, an investment process coordinated by EIT RawMaterials was presented as well as an investment update, where a current status of 23 investment cases have already been given priority. Those cases could reach a significant volume of up to EUR 10 billion, covering rare earth/magnets, raw materials for energy storage and conversion and others for materials contributing to other industrial value chains, in more than 14 European countries. ERMA partners are invited to submit potential investment projects to strengthen domestic sourcing and improve the supply of secondary raw materials through resource efficiency and circular economy. The alliance focuses on the first step on rare earth for magnets and motors as well as advanced materials for energy storage and conversion while addressing the potential of other base metal activities. Rare earths for magnets and motors Rare earths are indispensable to most industrial ecosystems in the EU, including renewable energy, defence, and space. Although once discovered and commercialised by European scientists and engineers, their production is currently almost entirely dominated by China, with a market share of 80-100% depending on the sector. ERMA aims to strengthen the domestic supply chain for rare earths and permanent magnets. Possible investment cases include brown- and greenfield mining addressing various aspects of the circular economy including recycling, processing, and product design. Advanced materials for energy storage and conversion The success of the European energy transition is based on the availability of solar and fuel cells or batteries. However, these green technologies are currently heavily dependent on imports of high-purity advanced materials. ERMA, therefore, supports the domestic production of, for example, ore concentrates and primary and secondary cell-grade energy storage materials. This way, gaps in the battery value chain in Europe can be closed. Concrete investment scenarios range from greenfield mining to processing and refining to provide input material for battery, solar and fuel cell production. Support from industry, research, politics, and civil society Since the presentation of the EU Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials and the launch event in September, ERMA has attracted a growing number of public and private sector stakeholders. Speakers at the kick-off meeting included Thierry Breton (EU Commissioner for Internal Market) and Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d (Vice-President of the European Commission), and industry representative.

The programme unites policymakers, entrepreneurs, youth, business leaders, hackers, academics, students and professionals in tackling the defining climate challenges of their cities\u2013 from urban planning to waste, circular economy, green infrastructure, sustainable food and mobility. This year\u2019s edition of Climathon will be hosted completely online and will be made up of 100 ideathon events lasting from eight to 72 hours happening simultaneously across five continents. Many of the teams are determined to bring to life ideas that can contribute to a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In Zurich, Switzerland, for instance, teams will try to answer the question \u2018In the context of COVID, what can we do tomorrow?\u2019. Whereas in Cali, the most populous city in southwest Colombia, participants will create concepts on how to better manage the waste generated by COVID-19 such as gloves, face masks and eye protection. Cities and their citizens are already experiencing the devastating and damaging effects of climate change. As centres of scientific, technological, cultural and social identity and innovation, cities are also the places and spaces where opportunities for creating change can have the greatest impact. Climathon is designed to empower citizens to make a change in their own cities. By offering people a platform where they can come together in their own community to put forward innovative ideas to local decision-makers, Climathon provides citizens with an opportunity to design the future. Climathon 2020 will once again bring together extraordinary and courageous minds, determined to make change happen, and I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the ideas that emerge from this collaboration.

EIT Health-supported start-ups have reported a successful quarter three in terms of fundraising, with EUR 72.7 million secured. The 19 start-ups hail from 10 European countries and will use the funds to further develop their solutions addressing health challenges such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. The strong results come following concern that the COVID-19 pandemic would severely impact investment in start-ups, leading to cash flow challenges. Recognising the risk to young companies, EIT Health injected EUR 5.5 million in May 2020 into 11 European start-ups to alleviate the financial shock posed by COVID-19 in its Start-up Rescue Instrument. After a challenging spring when health care investors were focused on the operative and thus financial impact of COVID-19 on existing portfolio companies, the investment landscape has improved considerably since summer and new financing rounds are being closed again. I\u2019ve been privileged to participate in the EIT Health community and in investment rounds of start-ups from its network, including Tubulis GmbH, and have seen the positive impact of EIT Health first-hand. Valentin Pi\u00ebch - Managing Director at VP Venture Partners The start-ups reporting funding of over EUR one million in quarter three include: It is always fantastic to see start-ups go on to attract external fundraising rounds following our support \u2013 this is the ultimate goal for us at EIT Health as we focus on developing and maturing promising start-ups and making them attractive to commercial investors so that they can continue to grow and flourish.

The best six teams from each of EIT\u2019s six innovation communities will present their business idea to the EIT network, and perhaps also in front of their next potential customer, partner, or test lab. The EIT Jumpstarter is an award-winning entrepreneurial training programme designed to support teams in commercialising their innovative technological ideas. A five-month programme EIT Jumpstarter participants were enthusiastic to collaborate with EIT Manufacturing in solving a multitude of manufacturing challenges while creating viable business models. Over a duration of five months, teams participated in the EIT Manufacturing RIS online Bootcamp, presented their ideas to experts and peers in a pitch day, and received targeted advice and mentoring in local training. Participating teams prioritised, tested, and validated critical business assumptions, and received expert advice on immersing in their local start-up ecosystems and approaching suitable incubators. The three local training organised by EIT Manufacturing RIS took place by INESC TEC in Porto (PT), University of Tartu (ET) and Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (SK). In total, the EIT Innovation Communities organised 18 local training in locations throughout Europe. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) within the context of its Regional Innovation Scheme (EIT RIS), selected more than one hundred teams to participate in this year\u2019s EIT Jumpstarter, an award-winning entrepreneurial training programme designed to support teams in commercialising their innovative technological ideas. In the context of the EIT Jumpstarter, every year, Knowledge and Innovation Communities of the EIT (EIT KICs) join forces to support teams and their innovative and promising ideas with a greater focus on the ones coming from EIT RIS countries, modest or moderate innovating European countries.

A mix of longer-form writing, short profile pieces and artwork, Branch explores the potential for the internet to become a more just, inclusive and sustainable space. The magazine is the result of a collaboration between EIT Climate-KIC, Mozilla Foundation and online community Climate Action.tech. Creating change requires all kinds of practices, art and design, professional development, civic participation, policy and advocacy, imagination and positive visions for our future. This magazine is our small attempt to gather what inspires and challenges us and to publish that in the open. Michelle Thorne - Branch Managing Editor and contributor, Senior Program Officer at Mozilla Foundation According to Nature, even before we pivoted to our screens so fully in 2020, uptake, information and communications systems accounted for two per cent of the world\u2019s carbon emissions. The authors point to the music video for the hit song \u2018Despacito\u2019 by Luis Fonsi feat. Daddy Yankee, which has five billion views on YouTube, and argue that to generate this kind of energy would take either 850 000 barrels of oil or 93 wind turbines running for an entire year. In the first quarter of 2020, Facebook reportedly removed 2.2 billion fake accounts, with each active profile estimated to account for 281 grams of CO2 \u2013 the same carbon footprint as a medium latte. And in 2019, the average user living in Europe scrolled the equivalent of 180 meters a day, exposing themselves on average to 1 700 carbon intensive - but ultimately ineffective - banner ads per month. In an effort to interrogate and understand the climate impact of technology better, the team behind Branch invited 25 people to share their vision for an internet that is instead a positive force for climate action. Contributors range from developers and designers to activists and artists, and content varies from advice on direct action to green daily professional practise to more profound systemic approaches to dismantling power structures and making a just, clean internet a reality. For deeper change to happen, internet professionals must understand the underlying structural issues of the climate crisis and its inequalities. We must go beyond tech solutionism and towards intersectional climate justice work. Going forward we see the need to further develop interdisciplinary practices and tools for greening the internet. We strive to connect sustainability to root causes and inequalities experienced at different intersections - gender, race, class, ability, and so on. Chris Adams - Branch Editor, from Climate Action.tech In making the magazine, the team was careful to ensure the online proposition lived up to the ideals of a sustainable internet, following a GOLD framework - Green, Open, Lean and Distributed - inspired by more mainstream accessibility principles in web design. We know that technology isn\u2019t neutral, so we set out to embed the values of a more sustainable, just internet into our own website design and development. The digital realm, and the internet in particular, can be a silent killer for the environment. It can feel sustainable because the damage is less visible and graspable, but oftentimes the opposite is true. However, with Branch we are motivated by joyfulness instead of fear, and we\u2019re using aesthetics as an entry point towards systemic change through a sustainable and just internet.

The finalists are invited to compete for three financial prizes, consisting of EUR 100 000 each, at the EIT FAN finals in early November. The three winners will be revealed during the EIT Food Venture Summit on 18 November 2020. Held in Israel, Spain, Finland, Switzerland, Germany, and the UK, the EIT FAN aims to make Europe the go-to innovation hub for the world\u2019s most promising agrifood start-ups by sparking start-up corporate partnerships. The fourteen finalists were selected from a group of 60 agrifood technology start-ups participating in the 2020 EIT FAN programme. The finalists were selected by an experienced panel of investors, industry experts and entrepreneurs based on their positive impact on our food system as well as their economic viability. The selected finalists offer solutions to various challenges inherent in our food system today. More specifically, the selected start-ups are focusing on functional foods and health, alternative proteins, sustainable agriculture, and harnessing side streams. The selected finalists clearly demonstrate that transforming our food system in a positive way and one that is economic viability are complementing each other and not contradicting. Christoph Mandl - EIT Food Accelerator Manager Over a four-month acceleration period, these start-ups, selected from a record number of applications, have had access to tools, connections, mentors and expertise to help them succeed. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme was held mostly online. We all miss social interactions and face to face conversations which you would normally find at our accelerator events. But at the same time, we experienced that delivering the programme online lead to more targeted interactions, thereby allowing start-ups to form close ties with relevant actors in the European and global agrifood space. Christoph Mandl - EIT Food Accelerator Manager Start-ups have faced an increased level of uncertainty and market volatility during COVID-19. At EIT Food, we believe that innovation holds the key to fixing our food system so that it is healthier and more sustainable for all. We are confident that not only the 14 finalists but all programme participants will continue to thrive and play an integral part in our efforts to build a high-impact entrepreneurial network that can support our recovery from this crisis.

With the support of the EIT Digital Accelerator, the company launched its fundraising process earlier this year and was quickly oversubscribed. They finally decided to close the round at USD 20 million, led by Wellington Partners (Germany) and ASABYS Partners (Spain), with participation by existing investors Novator (UK) and Frumtak Ventures (Iceland). The healthcare landscape has shifted significantly this year as a direct result of COVID-19, accelerating the adoption and demand for digital health solutions. We have grown our customer base sharply in recent months, adding new partnerships with global pharmaceutical firms and leading US-based healthcare organisations. These developments have confirmed our vision to bring healthcare into people's homes, augment traditional medical care outside the bricks-and-mortar clinical setting, and empower patients to take control of their own health. Our new investors bring tremendous value to the table, supporting our continued growth in Europe, and helping Sidekick to continue to expand its operations in the US. Dr. Tryggvi Thorgeirsson - Sidekick CEO and Co-Founder Sidekick will use the proceeds for validation and development into new therapeutic areas, as well as to drive product development forward to increase its lead in patient engagement and retention, and to further position itself as the preferred provider to expand pharmacotherapies.

The event took place in Copenhagen (and online) and it brought together all relevant stakeholders across the whole EIT Urban Mobility network and beyond. The official opening of EIT Urban Mobility Innovation Hub North Henrik Morgen, Director of EIT Urban Mobility Innovation Hub North, opened the event and marked the official inauguration of the hub, with a warm welcome, and introduction of the EIT Urban Mobility. EIT Urban Mobility is a network-based organisation, and Henrik Morgen ended by urging cities, industry and universities to express their potential interest in becoming a partner of the EIT Urban Mobility network of core-, network- and project-partners. The number of partners is constantly growing, and there is room for more. Maria Tsavachidis, CEO EIT Urban Mobility took over with a short presentation on the EIT Urban Mobility take on the future, and how we see the way forward towards building more liveable urban cities. Both Henrik and Maria emphasised that cities are at the centre of EIT Urban Mobility, and that we aim to build a strong community to deliver on our objectives to accelerate liveability in European cities. Discover EIT Urban Mobility Nordic Perspective Summit \u2013 Relieve the six sessions: Three parallel sessions were organised in the morning and in the afternoon, where both the speakers and the participants were in the auditorium at DTU Campus in Lyngby (Denmark) and virtual online creating a very dynamic environment. Here is a short summary of the most interesting take-aways from the day. Long-distance cycling Cycling has had a new boost in COVID-19 times as public transport ridership has dipped. How can we take advantage of this and keep up high levels of cycling in the future? This coupled with more new results on the high socio-economic benefits of cycling projects (11% internal rate of return. New study 8-11%, up to 25-28% IRR with new health benefit values) makes it the ideal time to take the conversation forward and continue supporting cycling as a serious mode of transport in cities. Jeppe Rich, Professor at DTU Management, has in the following days been quoted in the Danish media with these interesting findings regarding socio-economic benefits, that might increase the political willingness to invest in bike related infrastructure even more. Behavioral change and citizen engagement Behavioural change is hard, and any measures for behavioural change need to be adapted to the local circumstances. This was once again reiterated in this session. For those of us working in mobility, we need to understand how we make the \u201cgood\u201d choice the easy choice. Open and local co-working space in the suburbs of Stockholm has proven to be very popular as an intermediate between working from home and commuting to workplace. Is this the beginning of the re-vitalisation of suburban areas? Link between transport infrastructure and urban planning More than half of our time (up to 70%) in public transport trips is used on walking or waiting, and 80% of impression is visual. Therefore, increasing focus on building nice surroundings influence how time is perceived\u200b. Electro Mobility: towards 100% electrification Things are moving fast in the field of electromobility. Electric roads, Vehicle to Grid, electric buses and trucks are no longer future technology but are here today. Now the issues are how to scale, while adapting advances in technology and plan and manage a large-scale electric vehicle introduction. We are a long way to electrified transport today with only 5% of fleet electric. Intelligent transport systems Autonomous driving has the last decade or two been 2-5 years away, and most likely still is also a decade from now. Technology is still far from being ready. But nevertheless \u2013 get prepared. Mobility labs as way for cities to promote and enable future mobilities. \u200b Transport in the time of the pandemic COVID-19 has caused a dramatic change to traffic patterns, with congestion levels still significantly and consistently below pre-COVID levels across the world. However too early to tell if this will be the 'end of traditional working hours'. Keep reading here The whole event was recorded, discover the outcomes here", "eit476": "In this interview, Chahab Nastar, EIT Digital\u2019s Chief Innovation Officer, explains how venture creation is a priority at EIT Digital. Bringing innovations quickly out of the labs and into the market is a critical element to remain competitive. EIT Digital is convinced that venture creation and scaling is the right answer to such rapid innovation cycles, because it takes the agility, commitment, and focus of entrepreneurial minds to manage the high pace of innovation. EIT Digital has identified venture creation as a key strategy for building a strong digital Europe. How does this work in practice? At EIT Digital, we support venture creation through two main instruments. The first one, our Innovation Factory, brings together organisations from all over Europe to launch deep tech ventures as the vehicle of their innovation. The second instrument is the Venture Programme. It supports teams of entrepreneurs from the so-called RIS countries to launch their Minimum Viable Product and establish a venture in record time. In both instruments, EIT Digital provides matchmaking, incubation, and financial support. In return, EIT Digital holds equity in the created ventures, contributing to our sustainability strategy. What are some of the recent success stories in venture creation at EIT Digital? One example for the Innovation Factory is the SARA Social Robot. This robot helps care institutions and hospitals to improve care recipients' quality of life and provides support to alleviate caregiver-staffing shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic led to visit restrictions for families and friends of care recipients and SARA was able to serve as a communication link in these difficult months. Other examples include LMAD, who operates autonomous last-mile delivery robots, and PeasyPay, a payment system based on biometric identification. Recently we announced the outstanding results of the 2020 Venture Programme. Among the 28 start-ups launched, Polish payment start-up Restpay stands out with a Business Angel investment received directly at the end of the programme. The eHealth start-up Amygdala from Bosnia and Herzegovina is another success story that will continue its growth as part of the H+ Innovation Programme implemented by the InsurTech Hub Munich (ITHM) and the Medical Valley Digital Health Application Centre. You mentioned that the SARA robot received special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Have you supported other innovations dedicated to mitigating the impact of the Corona disease? We have indeed. One example is the application of physical tokens for COVID-19 contact tracing. We are currently running four pilots in different settings across Europe: in the Nordics, in the UK, in Benelux and in Italy, with deployments planned by the end of the year. Another great example is a 3D printed remote monitoring device that can measure vital signs of corona patients. The device enables nurses to safely monitor multiple patients at the same time. This innovation was developed by a group of EIT Digital Master School students, who won the EU-run hackathon, joined up with EIT Digital partners, and now receive our support to develop their Minimum Viable Product to hit the market. What does the current pandemic crisis mean for mature tech start-ups (the so called scale-ups), and EIT Digital Accelerator support? The saying goes that \u2018In every crisis lies an opportunity\u2019. That is especially true for tech ventures in the current crisis, because digital is at the heart of the 'new normal' \u2013 work from home, Software as a Service, or remote monitoring and maintenance, to name a few examples. The new normal calls for new innovations and new champions to emerge. Our Accelerator is there to support them in a hands-on way. While these days it has become harder for individual scale-ups to meet the right international customers and investors, that is precisely what our Accelerator team makes happen, thanks to a distributed team of business developers and fundraising experts and their pan European network of customers and VCs. Examples of scale-ups that have joined us recently include MIPU, an AI technology for the digital industry, or Flynex, a drone platform for industrial surveillance. This week, we also communicated about the success of CashDirector, an AI-enabled Digital CFO for SMEs. The outcome of our 2020 EIT Digital Challenge scale-up competition is another indicator for the unbroken interest in our support. The record-breaking number of 403 scale-up applications is a clear sign that digital entrepreneurs are working hard and are seeking support also \u2013 and especially \u2013 in times of a pandemic. I am looking forward to the final event on November 12, where the top 20 scale-ups will be showcased.

It is the only company to have a particle mix which is customised for each project. Intrapore patented NMP allow us to remediate even the most challenging forms of contamination. Purified Metal Company (PMC) (Netherlands) is the first company in the world with an environmentally friendly and economically feasible method to recycle contaminated steel scrap into high-quality raw materials for the steel industry. The newly constructed plant makes a valuable contribution to the decarbonisation of the EU\u2018s steel industry: it will save 150 000 tons of CO2 per year compared to the production of steel from iron ore. Scientific Visual (Switzerland) technologies improve the quality and speed of sapphire processing by objectively identifying and quantifying internal defects in sapphire at earlier stages in the production cycle than previously possible. For the first time, sapphire users are able to establish objective, observer-independent and traceable quality control processes that reduce production costs and streamline their supply chain with SapphiroScan.

Home to one third of Scotland\u2019s population and provider of 33% of the nation\u2019s jobs, the Glasgow City Region is at risk from climate change. The region along the river Clyde faces many complex and interrelated challenges that need more than superficial, mainstream solutions. The project Clyde Rebuilt aims to understand the web of interrelations that create these urgent problems and identify a variety of innovations that can be explored, combined, applied, and scaled in the region. Clyde Rebuilt is one chapter of EIT Climate-KIC \u2018Deep Demonstration Resilient Regions\u2019 programme. Read more about EIT Climate-KIC The citizens of the Glasgow City Region face the risk of more frequent floods and other dangerous weather events, resulting in damage to homes, roads and railways, and stresses to hospitals and emergency services as global temperatures rise due to climate change. Clyde Rebuilt is a ground-breaking project in which representatives from across the region jointly develop interconnected projects for adapting to these climate change challenges by 2030. Clyde Rebuilt will bring together community groups, local councils, universities, businesses, government agencies and other bodies. They will collaborate to identify a range of joined-up actions that can change the way the region\u2019s society, economy and environment operate together, making them stronger as the effects of climate change become ever more apparent. The new collective is based on the idea that climate change can best be tackled if different groups from one city or region join forces to find solutions to their specific problems. Clyde Rebuilt was formed by Climate Ready Clyde, an existing group of 15 local organisations, and EIT Climate-KIC, the EU\u2019s climate innovation agency, that specialises, among other things, in identifying innovations to help regions both slow down climate change and deal with it. Clyde Rebuilt will give organisations across the Glasgow City Region a process in which they can voice their ideas, test those ideas and see whether they will work at a scale that can make a big difference. We intend to move from gradually improving our climate resilience to making larger shifts more quickly. James Curran - Chair of Climate Ready Clyde That means switching focus from stand-alone projects like concrete flood walls to more systemic solutions that might couple river restoration with wetland creation, flood forecasting and warning systems, and new insurance mechanisms. Regions are a bridge between the local and national, so let\u2019s start here. Ellie Tonks, Project Lead at EIT Climate-KIC The project is co-funded by Climate Ready Clyde and EIT Climate-KIC, and managed by Sniffer, a Scottish sustainability charity, with climate-and-culture experts at Creative Carbon Scotland and climate-change finance experts at Paul Watkiss Associates. Clyde Rebuilt is part of EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s \u2018Resilient Regions\u2019, a programme that aims to help representatives from affected regions in Europe come up with concrete and connected projects to prepare for, recover from, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. In Glasgow City Region, Climate Ready Clyde and EIT Climate-KIC are now identifying a first set of projects, scheduled between 2021 and 2023, and are planning to use the success of this approach to attract support to extend the programme to 2030. The next decade of innovative projects will help support a \u2018green recovery\u2019 by building a more resilient economy and society, creating a flourishing Glasgow City Region with benefits in increased health, equality and income for its citizens. Clyde Rebuilt will have the potential to make a significant contribution to the Scottish Government\u2019s Second Climate Change Adaptation Programme \u2013 even more crucial now that the world is aiming for a green recovery after COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented global crisis which has fundamentally changed every aspect of our lives, but the climate emergency has not gone away and must be central to our recovery from this difficult time. We will only meet our climate goals by bringing together the talent that we have and by working together, and this exciting development by Climate Ready Clyde puts the Glasgow City Region in a great position to help lead Scotland\u2019s fight against climate change, and will contribute to our wider ambitions for the Clyde corridor, reflected in the \u2018Clyde Mission\u2019 approach being developed across Scottish Government and partners.

There are many things that will impact what the future of our urban logistics and food supply chains will look like in our cities in ten years\u2019 time. This Cross-KIC workshop organised by EIT Urban Mobility (Innovation Hub North), EIT Food and with the participation of EIT Climate-KIC and EIT Health, spent two sessions in September 2020 thinking of the future of sustainable logistics and food supply, and what role the EIT\u2019s Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KIC) might have in shaping this. A Cross-KIC workshop The workshop was held as a side event of the La Futura conference. The starting point was understanding the direction for EIT Urban Mobility and EIT Food for the timeframe 2030. We at EIT Urban Mobility are working on our strategic agenda, but what is clear is that we want to work for a sustainable urban mobility, in terms of environmental, social and economic sustainability, based on the needs of cities. Henrik Morgen - Director of the EIT Urban Mobility Innovation Hub North Andrew Carling, Director of Strategic Programmes at EIT Food presented EIT Food\u2019s vision and strategic objectives. The direction of travel for these KICs is ambitious and points towards a healthy, sustainable future, but how can the KICs leverage the power of their organisations and community to help achieve this? Read more about EIT Food During two sessions, the workshop used three workshop techniques to engage participants to discuss on this topic. Participants worked on identifying trends, developing scenarios and designing impact pathways, based on the visions and strategic objectives of the KICs. Results and next steps Through animated discussion, participants identified impact pathways that sought to promote societal and industrial change through e.g. education, tools/ framework development, and product innovation. All scenarios that were developed focused on transitioning towards sustainable food and logistics systems. However, much discussion focused on to what extent consumer behaviour (e.g. dietary preferences) and food production would support or hinder this change. A key tension highlighted was whether technological innovation, in the form of digitalisation and automation of supply chains and logistics could be managed and regulated effectively to promote sustainability and not solely economic growth. Over 100 trends were identified by participants, the top trends (key drivers) were related to food innovation, technology, people and society, and sustainability. This workshop was a first step: we want to look forward and see how we can work together with other KICs, and also as EIT Urban Mobility in understanding how we can best have impact in helping to create sustainable city logistics.

Their device allows contactless monitoring of breathing patterns while a person sleeps. The Sleepiz One is a small box that is simply placed on a person\u2019s bedside table to measure their physiological parameters, such as their breathing pattern, in a completely contactless manner while they sleep. It does this by measuring the patient\u2019s chest movement, using wireless millimetre wave technology and sensor fusion. Currently, the existing technology for monitoring a patient during their sleep could be considered intrusive and not effective for long-term monitoring: the patient\u2019s breathing pattern is measured with a chest effort band, a nasal canula or through manual visual analysis. The CE mark certifies that the product is compliant with the relevant EU legislation and that it may be sold anywhere in the European Economic Area. With CE certification achieved, Sleepiz One is now undergoing additional clinical trials to be validated as a Class IIa medical device for diagnosis purposes under the European Medical Device Regulations. The CE certification follows another major milestone reached in March 2020, when the quality management system of Sleepiz received ISO 13485 certification, which qualifies Sleepiz as a medical device manufacturer with an emphasis on safety and efficacy.

The launch of the forum comes on the back of significant research undertaken by EIT Health into the advancements of health care systems in implementing organisational change to pave the way for the restructuring of health care delivery towards outcomes that matter most to patients. This culminated in the creation of the Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) handbook that describes the key steps health care providers can take to fully realise the opportunity presented by VBHC. Across Europe, the number of patients requiring care is rising exponentially and costs are growing. This challenge is exacerbated by inefficiencies: the World Health Organisation and the OECD estimate that 30% of health care resources are wasted on avoidable complications, unnecessary treatments or administrative inefficiencies. More treatment should not be the goal of health care, better health should always be the driving force. EIT Health has been repeatedly asked by different health care providers and institutions in Europe to play a leading role beyond the traditional conferences and training programmes. The launch of the HVC Forum aims to discover what makes HVC projects successful and share those successes among those who can drive transformation in their own organisation to ultimately benefit patients, providers and health care systems. Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda - Director of Innovation at EIT Health The forum will provide support for those in the health care industry to drive change within multi-stakeholder, multidisciplinary organisations, offering: Education and training for health care professionals; patients, families and carers; and decision makers and policy makers. Best practice sharing so that health care providers and national/regional health systems can learn from each other on how to successfully implement high value care. The HVC Forum will include a library of case studies from HVC pioneers across Europe, in order to gather lessons learnt and inform future activity. There will also be training opportunities to provide a strong and well-tailored curriculum for health care professionals; patients, citizens and carers; and policy makers. The Forum is set-up in partnership with both academic and institutional organisations with the aim of leading efforts in high value care in Europe whilst remaining strategically connected to other international initiatives. With an extensive network of innovators backing the initiative, there is vast experience that can be leveraged to further these aims. The High Value Care Forum will be guided by a dedicated Advisory Board representing all relevant stakeholders. With hands-on experience of transformation towards high-value care, this group will be instrumental in the ongoing implementation of the High Value Care Forum. Their practical knowledge will be central in supporting the development of the initiative to make sure the Forum will have a real-world impact.

EIT RawMaterials will manage the stakeholder consultation process across the entire raw materials value chain, working with an innovation project-driven community, which brings together more than 150 industrial and non-industrial actors with the common objective of securing the supply of sustainable raw and advanced materials for industrial ecosystems in order to build Europe\u2019s resilience and competitiveness. Today, the European Commission, represented by Vice President \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Commissioner Breton, launched the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA), with the presence of other EU Institutions, national Ministers, industry, unions and civil society organisations as well as key industry stakeholders. The new alliance has been established in recognition of the critical importance of raw materials to the EU\u2019s security, sustainability and industrial leadership. If Europe is to deliver a Green Deal, a digital transition and remain a leader in future technologies, it faces a significant increase in demand for critical raw materials. The European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) will identify barriers, opportunities and investment cases to build capacity at all stages of the raw materials value chain, from mining to waste recovery. In a first phase, the alliance focuses on the most pressing need, which is to increase EU resilience in the rare earths and permanent magnets value chains, as these are vital to most EU industrial ecosystems. In addition to rapidly rising demand driven by electric vehicles and energy storage, demand for rare earths critical for products like wind turbines could increase ten-fold by 2050. Later, it will expand to address other critical and strategic raw material and base metal needs, such as Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion. Our strategic foresight shows clearly that the demand for critical raw materials is only going to rise, especially given the ongoing transition towards a green and digital economy. The pandemic has also highlighted the criticality of raw materials for our recovery. To secure a sustainable supply of raw materials we need to join forces across Europe, as we have done for the EU Battery Alliance. The European Alliance on Raw Materials will mobilise industrial and innovation actors, Member States, regions, the EIB, investors and civil society \u2013 to help build our capacities and investment cases along the entire value chain, from extraction to processing and recycling. This will in turn strengthen our resilience and boost our open strategic autonomy. Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d - Vice President of the European Commission The European Raw Materials Alliance is an important step in strengthening the industrial ecosystems that depend on raw materials. The Alliance will accelerate the green and digital transition by reinforcing value chains, diversifying supplies and involving all willing partners in implementing the necessary actions. We invite all stakeholders, civil society organisations, researchers, companies large and small, Member States and regions, and to help us achieve these objectives. Thierry Breton - Commissioner for Internal Market The alliance is already supported by over 150 stakeholders across multiple industrial sectors and value chains. The alliance is open and will mobilise all industrial and innovation actors, Member States, regions, the EIB, investors and civil society. Supporters are asked to sign a declaration, committing to ERMA\u2019s shared vision, and to actively contributing to the alliance\u2019s work. The Alliance is managed by EIT RawMaterials, the world\u2019s largest knowledge and innovation community in the raw materials sector. Raw materials will play a vital role to the revival, autonomy and resilience of Europe\u2019s integrated industrial ecosystems. With the European Raw Materials Alliance, we have a true European answer based on the knowledge and expertise of more than 150 stakeholders/partners. Together we can turn Europe\u2019s raw material dependency into a major strategic strength for our continent, while continually applying the highest environmental and social standards. We are honored to manage the European Raw Materials Alliance, which will drive diversification of sustainable supply and help make better use of the resources available within the EU. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer - CEO of EIT RawMaterials ERMA\u2019s launch is part of a wider action plan on critical raw materials presented by the European Commission early in September, aimed at bolstering Europe\u2019s resilience. Raw materials are key enablers for a globally competitive, green, and digital Europe Metals, minerals, and raw materials are vital to most European industries, including renewable energy, automotive, consumer electronics, defence and aerospace. Reliable, secure, and sustainable access to raw materials is a precondition for Europe\u2019s Green Deal, digital transition, and the continent\u2019s future industrial competitiveness and innovation capacity of Europe. At present Europe is highly dependent on raw materials from countries with less stringent environmental, social and human rights standards, and less stable economies.

Developing raw materials into a major strength for Europe \u2013 Purified Metal Company (PMC) has made an important contribution to the vision of EIT RawMaterials in opening the first recycling plant for contaminated steel scrap worldwide. Guest of honour, His Majesty the King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, welcomed numerous guests and solemnly opened the plant, underlining the importance of the issue: a sustainable Europe is no longer a mere idea, it is already taking shape. A sustainable use of natural resources is the basis for a prosperous European economy. Across the globe, primary raw material sources are depleting, while the amounts of industrial waste and end-of-life-products are rapidly increasing. These waste streams contain valuable raw materials that can be extracted to meet the growing demands from global industrial production and consumption. PMC is the first company in the world with an environmentally friendly and economically feasible method to recycle contaminated steel scrap into high-quality raw materials for the steel industry. Thereby the newly constructed plant makes a valuable contribution to the decarbonisation of the EU\u2018s steel industry: it will save 150 000 tons of CO2 per year compared to the production of steel from iron ore. Those CO2 savings equal the annual emissions of 45 000 passenger cars. Purified Metal Company (PMC) plant in Delfzijl, the Netherlands From start-up to market leader The idea of PMC was born in 2011. The combination of steel with hazardous substances can be found in various steel objects, such as valves, railways, tubes, bridges and heating devices. Without PMC, those objects are cleaned, provided this is economically feasible, and then sold as raw materials or as end products. If cleaning is not possible, the material is disposed of in landfills. In this way, entire trains disappear underground. Through the new process developed by PMC, substances such as asbestos are broken down into harmless components and the steel scrap is converted into a new premium raw material - high-quality Purified Metal Blocks (PMB). The hermetically sealed factory guarantees the safety of people and the environment during processing and transport. Only tried and tested techniques are used, which have already clearly proven their reliability in other areas. On its way from start-up to technological leadership, PMC received support from EIT RawMaterials, the largest innovation community in the raw materials sector worldwide. Amongst others, EIT RawMaterials provides funding and entrepreneurship coaching to early-stage start-ups, with a focus on idea-to-market. With this experienced supporter on the side, the former start-up grew into a well-established Small and Medium Enterprise (SME). In 2017, PMC was even nominated for the EIT Venture Award, recognising the most promising entrepreneurs and innovators in Europe. Considering the materials needs of an exponentially growing world population, recycling will have to evolve from a side stream to a major pillar of raw materials supply if we want to protect our planet and make business sustainable. PMC is taking an important pioneering role here and for us as EIT RawMaterials it is exciting to be able to support such valuable innovations on their way to the market. Bernd Sch\u00e4fer - CEO at EIT RawMaterials It was an intense process to connect the right parties to our ambitious plan for a circular solution for contaminated steel scrap. We are very grateful for the contribution of EIT RawMaterials that helped the success of this project. Jan Henk Wijma, Nathalie van de Poel and Bert Bult - Co-founders of PMC A big step in decarbonising the European steel industry The recycled steel by PMC is a high-quality raw material that can be used by steel manufacturers to produce new steel products. Therefore: every kilogram of Purified Metal Blocks processed saves 1 kg of CO2 because the steel is not produced from iron ore. Not only does PMC thus solve a waste problem: it also lowers CO2 emissions by 50% at factories that produce steel from the blocks of PMC compared to factories that make it from iron ore. The European Parliament\u2019s \u2018Green Steel for Europe\u2019 Pilot Project (GREENSTEEL) supports the EU towards achieving the 2030 climate and energy targets and the 2050 long-term strategy for a climate neutral Europe, with effective solutions for clean steelmaking. In this regard, the opening of the PMC is an important step in the EU\u2019s mid- and long-term strategy to decarbonise the steel industry and the EU\u2019s effort to secure raw materials and foster a circular economy.

You don\u2019t have to work in climate change or city planning to have heard the ubiquitous term \u2018build back better\u2019, or to be lectured that cities are \u2018at the frontline\u2019 of COVID-19 and \u2018testbeds\u2019 for green recovery strategies. (Though we have certainly made these points many times!) Collaboration, systemic change and citizen engagement are other buzzwords and entreaties, and Google Alerts for \u2018systemic change\u2019 are starting to get much more copious, and interesting, including this article in the Financial Times \u2013 Building back better requires systemic shifts. Is it possible to overcomplicate the big picture stuff? Are incrementalism and technological innovation the straw man of systemic change? It\u2019s easy to think so, but intention and systems impacts matter. Systemic change is required when efforts to change one aspect of a system fail to fix the problem. The whole system needs to be transformed. Systemic change means that change has to be fundamental and affects how the whole system functions. Systemic change can [in some cases] mean gradual institutional reforms, but those reforms must be based on and aimed at a transformation of the fundamental qualities and tenets of the system itself. Micha Narberhaus from Virtual Teams for Systemic Change For this reason, \u2018stories\u2019 of systemic change can be thought of as episodic \u2018case studies in motion\u2019, certainly at this point in our journey towards systemic change. So how do we decide which interventions have \u2018systems impacts\u2019 and which perpetuate negative patterns or introduce new ones? How can we understand which combinations of innovations \u2013 across education, technology, art, finance, procurement, citizen engagement and other relevant levers of change \u2013 offer a fast track to emissions reductions, economic health and social justice? EIT Climate-KIC has set up a framework for working with Europe\u2019s most ambitious cities, to help the community map and understand the interacting local and big picture systems that drive unwanted outcomes in cities, vision new futures together, and build portfolios of joined-up innovations aimed at place-based transformations. Milan, Madrid and Amsterdam are just three of the fifteen cities in the first cohort of EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities. Join EIT Climate-KIC CEO Kirsten Dunlop and the city partners online at #EURegionsWeek on 20 October 2020 to hear some early insights from these \u2018case studies in motion\u2019 and to register your interest in joining the programme\u2019s second wave, as a funder of ambitious systemic change or as a city government.

The European Commission has today announced that the EIT Health project MACH is a winner of the prestigious Horizon Impact Award. The awards are designed to recognise and celebrate societal advancements through research and innovation. The 'Mobile Autonomy for Children in end stage Heart failure' (MACH) project is an international collaboration between RWTH Aachen University and Uniklinik RWTH Aachen, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle University and Berlin Heart GmbH to develop and launch a mobile driving unit for the EXCOR\u00ae ventricular assist device, a blood pump to assist a failing heart. This programme successfully brought together experts from academia, healthcare and industry to work towards a common goal \u2013 to improve the lives of children waiting for a heart transplant. Professor Carina Benst\u00f6m, Project lead The EXCOR\u00ae Active driving unit provides mobility to children with end-stage heart failure waiting for a heart transplant. Children can spend months and sometimes several years in a hospital waiting for an organ. The goal of this project was to reduce the stress impact of a long term hospitalisation on children on the waiting list and their families, by offering them mobility and autonomy in their daily lives in the hospital environment. Children who have been very sick need to recover, build up muscles, explore and play. The new mobile device helps make this possible. During the waiting time for a donor heart, these young heart patients are looked after by a team of dedicated nurses, intensive care doctors, surgeons, cardiologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, play leaders and psychologists who help the family to cope and to become experts in their child\u2019s care. Patients and families were given a voice in the project through interviews discussing how to make their experience more positive. The device and the new learning platform will benefit the family as well as the child waiting for a donor heart. Dr Emma Simpson from Newcastle\u2019s Freeman Hospital The Berlin Heart EXCOR\u00ae Paediatric is the only Ventricular Assist Device approved worldwide for short to long term support in children of all ages with heart failure*. This project supported development of a smaller, lighter and more mobile driving unit with a longer battery time by switching from a compressor technology to piston drivers, which are lighter and quieter. Since attaining CE Mark last year, the \u201cEXCOR Active\u201d has supported the first patients in Germany. At Berlin Heart, we understand that patient-centred innovation requires close collaboration between engineering, health care professionals and end-users. Sven-Rene Friedel We are happy to see the positive impact of the EXCOR Active recognised by such a prestigious award. Dr Ares K. Menon, Managing Director of Berlin Heart The EUR 10 000 prize money from the award will be donated to projects such as a facility that supports families staying near their hospitalised children in Munich and key initiatives with long-term benefit to patients at Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. *Access to some or all mentioned products may be restricted by country-specific regulatory approvals.

The system was first rolled out in Budapest and is currently being piloted in Guadalajara, Spain. Slovenia and the UK will follow. No wallet, smartphone or credit card needed. European customers will be able to enter a shop, choose what they want and pay without having any of the above with them. PeasyPay, incorporated in Hungary, is letting people pay by just showing their faces and taking a picture of the palm of their hands, making the whole process faster and more convenient. PeasyPay was launched by EIT Digital within its Innovation Factory, where a number of EIT Digital Partners come together to launch a deep tech venture into the market. The project\u2019s codename is \u201cPay with a Smile\u201d and it is within the Digital Finance portfolio of the EIT Digital Innovation Factory. The partnership behind the initiative includes two Spanish partners, Ci3 and Liberbank, two Hungarian ones, E-Group and OTP Bank, and Slovenia\u2019s AV Living Lab. \u201cThe system is composed of three elements,\u201d PeasyPay\u2019s product leader Csaba K\u00f6rm\u00f6czi explained, \u201ca smartphone app for the customer (used only during registration), a smartphone app for the merchants, and the payment terminal\u201d. Digital profiles of the customers\u2019 palms and faces are created through the app (available on both Android and iOS) by taking a selfie and a picture of their palm with their mobile\u2019s camera. Afterwards, they have to register their bank card details on an integrated, secure payment gateway. The actual in-store payment process is implemented by using a special point-of-sale (POS) machine, equipped with cameras and facial recognition software that scans customers\u2019 faces and palms and compare them to the biometric template created in advance. In the case of a match, the payment is authorised, and the amount charged to the credit card registered in the payment gateway of the corresponding PeasyPay account. The combination of face and palm scanning solves the issue of mismatching a person, as facial recognition systems\u2019 accuracy degree can vary significantly depending on the person, software and situation. The PeasyPay solution has also been designed to be fully compliant with all European regulations, especially GDPR and national data protection laws. Under GDPR\u2019s provisions, the processing of biometric data for uniquely identifying purposes is not authorized, unless the data subject has given explicit consent for a specified purpose. Another factor that makes the startup\u2019s technology stand out from the competition is that other payment solutions are fully dependent on a proprietary infrastructure and ecosystem, whereas PeasyPay is based on an open system; any bank and any merchant can join. The PeasyPay solution has been operational in Budapest since December 2019 - with a break in the spring due to the pandemic - in a coffee shop frequented by the tech-savvy employees of the city\u2019s second district. OTP Bank and e-Group are joining forces to spread PeasyPay further in the Hungarian capital: a marketing campaign will engage members of the local hospitality industry and retail sector. A pilot use case of PeasyPay, targeting the city\u2019s food, retail and hospitality industry, is currently ongoing in Guadalajara, Spain. The trial started in July, in four small shops located in the city centre, and is being extended to other businesses. In total, 25 proximity shops (bakeries, butcher\u2019s shops, grocery stores, caf\u00e9s, bookstores, print shops, and herbal shops) will be participating in the Spanish pilot. The plan is to make the PeasyPay solution available in department stores as well. More pilots are planned elsewhere. In the UK, the system is being set up to let taxi drivers seamlessly pay the fee to enter Glasgow Airport\u2019s parking area. In Slovenia, the pilot will take place in a restaurant. During the pilot phase only customers based in Hungary, Spain, Slovenia and the UK will be able to download PeasyPay from their local app store.

MaaS stands for Mobility as a Service and it is conceptualised as a form of integrating different modes of transportation to create less friction and to provide benefits to its regular users, through the application of information technology. The term comes from the recognition that transport has increasingly been treated as a service, in line with broader economic changes that put an emphasis on the service sector and in a subscription model for the renting of goods, rather than ownership. There is general agreement that public transport is the backbone product of any MaaS offer. However, considering the increase of digitalisation, the need to have a more flexible and safer transport, the introduction of new mobility services normally offered by private companies, and the pressure to have more liveable urban spaces, MaaS would help to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure and help enhance sustainable mobility including public transport planning. In Covid19 days, due to restrictions in our public transport capacity, demand and offer are usually unbalanced and users have some concerns about using sharing services. MaaS will help administrations to have more efficient, reliable, and safer transport in Covid19 times. In our Mobility Talks\u2019 episode 5, EIT Urban Mobility will invite a high-level panel of international experts and will guide a constructive discussion on the three most important challenges of MaaS: whether a suitable governance scheme (not technology) is key for MaaS to thrive. data as a cornerstone for any MaaS architecture for better managing mobility, addressing societal goals (sustainability, equity, accessibility) and enabling new viable business models around mobility services. the most interesting industry developments for more integrated user experience as a real and competitive alternative to the private car. With the support of Factual, an innovation and strategy consultancy focused on mobility, we will share insights about the current situation of Maas in Europe. Three relevant start-ups in MaaS in Europe will present their MaaS solutions for urban mobility\u2019s challenges and experts coming from public administrations will share with us their ideas on how MaaS will revolutionise transport and mobility in the very near future. The webinar will take place on 17 September between 15:00 to 16:30h CET.

Comprising four EIT Digital Master School students - Kacper Skawinski, Waliyah Sahqani, Ferran Montraveta Roca, and Javier Benitez - as well as University of Manchester alumna Maria Maci\u0105gowska, the team members of Grape (Digital Grocery) Inventory won the Growth Package Prize of the EIT Digital Venture Program out of more than 300 applications from 20 EU Countries. In July, the Grape Inventory team successfully finished the 2-months pre-acceleration program delivered by Krakow Technology Park and started their company in Poland. According to Grape Inventory\u2019s CEO, Maria, Grape is... ...on a mission to make homes free of food waste and help people save money while saving our planet. Grape Inventory is being built by a team of visionaries who want to drive real change. Their ambition is to become a pioneer of consumer grocery analytics and lead the way in digital food tracking. In order to tackle the food waste problem, Grape Inventory\u2019s team developed an automated grocery inventory solution, which scans shopping receipts, tracks expiry dates of products purchased and notifies users when items are approaching expiry. By these means, Grape Inventory empowers users to decrease household food waste and make clever purchase decisions. Grape Inventory utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to create a seamless user experience. The team members met during their studies at the EIT Digital Master School in Helsinki two years ago. They came from different technology interests and therefore enrolled in different courses (Cloud Computing, Autonomous Systems, Human Computer Interaction etc.). Ferran notes that: The EIT Digital Master School diversity of courses helped us to form a team with complementary skills. Even before the Master School, I wanted to become an entrepreneur. Thanks to the Master School, I met likeminded people who were excited about joining forces on a common entrepreneurial journey. The EIT Digital Master School equips its students with entrepreneurial skills, helping them to become the new generation of tech and business leaders. Javier adds: The crucial factor to become interested in the startup world was the EIT Digital Master and Summer Schools\u2019 stimulating environment, the Startup Experience classes and the contagious effect of being surrounded by people (mentors, professors, entrepreneurs) with a strong business mindset. Kacper recalls that they first teamed up to participate at various hackathons across Europe. The team won the \u201cBest Financial Data Solution\u201d challenge at a Nordic Health Hackathon and was one of the top teams at HackYeah, a hackathon aimed at developing solutions which are applicable in the fight against the effects of COVID-19. The idea of building a digital inventory was born during these weekend competitions. Eventually, the EIT Digital Venture Program gave the team the chance to take the decisive step towards its MVP, thanks to its two months pre-acceleration program delivered by Krakow Technology Park and the support of experienced business development and sales mentors. As Maria puts it: With its structured goal and milestone set and its ambitious and challenging agenda, the EIT Digital Venture Program helped us to work on the needed partnerships with charities and broaden our network. The financial support was the right fit to our needs at this stage of development of our startup. We are now finalizing the testing of the solution and are getting ready to launch it in Q4 of 2020. Grape Inventory is looking to join forces with grocery stores, zero-waste advocates, charities and businesses who share a mission of fixing the broken food system.

PMC is the first company in the world to provide an economically viable and environmentally sound alternative for recycling contaminated steel scrap and turning it into raw material for the production of high-grade steel. Delfzijl has been chosen as a location after a careful selection process. To realise the factory, different research phases have been completed together with internationally known and leading organisations that are specialised in the field of asbestos inventory, metallurgy, waste collection and engineering. Different proven technologies are combined such as sub-atmospheric pressure units, a steel scrap sheer, induction furnaces and casting machines. This is part of the unique and patented PMC process. Moreover, the process has been investigated technologically and proven by the University of Aachen, a world-wide recognised institute in the field of the steel industry. EIT RawMaterials has supported PMC with Booster funding, and our team is looking forward to joining the opening ceremony in Delfzijl. The high-quality raw material for the steel industry Steel scrap contaminated with asbestos, or various hazardous components like mercury, PCB\u2019s or chrome VI can be found in all aspects of our society. Thanks to PMC\u2019s unique, circular process, this contaminated steel scrap can now be recycled to clean premium raw materials for steel plants. Moreover, PMC patented technology forms the heart of a truly circular process that solves a long term environmental problem and social hazard. With PMC\u2019s truly innovative technology, for the first time in history, it is now possible to convert hazardous steel waste in a clean premium raw material in an economically sound way. The end product of the unique and circular process of PMC is a clean, premium raw material for steel mills. The Purified Metal Blocks (PMB) are produced in a batch of 20 tons with known chemical composition and can be delivered to the customer per container. The PMB\u2019s have no dirt and a high density. For these reasons, the process of steel mills is much more efficient. Every kilogram of PMB\u2019s produced saves 1 kg of CO2 because steel is not produced by iron ore.", "eit517": "iLoF listed as one of the top 150 digital health start-ups worldwide by CB Insights Just as EIT Health prepares to announce the two challenge areas selected for this year\u2019s Wild Card programme, one of the last year\u2019s recipients has been included in a prestigious list recognised throughout the health industry. iLoF (Intelligent Lab on Fiber), a start-up formed by the 2019 Wild Card programme, have been listed in CB Insights\u2019 Digital Health 150, an annual ranking of the most promising digital health start-ups in the world.

The cooperation will support the region\u2019s efforts in achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Poland, as the main coal producer in the European Union, faces a huge challenge in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, 95 per cent (61.6 million tonnes) of coal production in Europe came from the country. EIT Climate-KIC and the Silesian Metropolis believe that for coal regions like Silesia, the challenge of the transition could be turned into an opportunity. EIT Climate-KIC laid the groundwork for regional transformation in 2019 through Rybnik360, a project that aims to change the industrial ecosystem of the city of Rybnik to meet the climate change challenge by jointly designing (together with the inhabitants and other actors operating in and around the city space) a vision of the city\u2019s future. Situated in the Silesian province, Rybnik, which is infamous for its high air pollution levels, is surrounded by more than ten active coal mines. The cooperation with the Silesian Metropolis is the next major step to accelerate the transition and support the entire region in achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The Silesian Metropolis brings together 41 municipalities and is home to 2.3 million residents and 240 000 businesses generating approximately eight per cent of Poland\u2019s GDP. The cooperation will support the member municipalities\u2019 initiatives to limit the impact of climate change. It will also support the creation of new jobs, the development of the regional infrastructure, the effectiveness of local administration, as well as the dialogue and cooperation with residents, local businesses and civil society.

In this blog I interviewed Mahima Kanwar Rathore, a graduating student from the MSc. Energy for Smart Cities programme. Mahima is currently working with the local innovation-organisation, Viable Cities, in Stockholm. Mahima found out about Viable Cities during her first year at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and ever since then she has been wanting to work there! For Mahima, it was really important to work with a company that resonates with the vision for \u2018innovation and research\u2019. Viable Cities has a perfect blend of research and innovation in a progressive environment that Mahima found very attractive. Their ongoing projects vary from theoretical studies to actual development of testbeds and platforms, in collaboration with other technology companies. Tell us a bit about your role at viable cities. I am the master thesis intern and I engage constantly with the Jarfalla Kommun (a local municipality in Sweden). I am performing feasibility study for a \u2018P2P (peer-to-peer) energy sharing project\u2019 in the Jarfalla municipality. I weigh the pros, cons, barriers and drivers to implement P2P energy sharing, similar to the project being implemented in the nearby Orebro municipality. Most of my analysis involved conducting interviews and studying the existing projects as a main source for data collection. How did EIT InnoEnergy Masters prepare you for this role? I am grateful to EIT InnoEnergy and my supervisor, Olga Kordas, Programme Coordinator for MSc Energy for Smart Cities. During the first semester, we had a whole course on Smart Cities and Climate Mitigation Strategies which was taught by Olga. During the classes there were many practical examples of the work done by Viable Cities that gave me a better understanding of where we are now and what problems we still have to deal with. With her help, I got the opportunity to work at Viable Cities. Furthermore, the EIT InnoEnergy Career Centre has been very helpful in terms of understanding the visa requirements and helping students out with finding companies for thesis and moving to new countries for internship. Has this been a fulfilling experience? I had 2 things in my mind that I wanted to achieve from my master thesis: Meaningful research work: Completely done! My thesis will be useful for Jarfalla municipality to make calculated decision on the implementation of P2P sharing project. So, I am happy that my work is not just relevant but has some meaning to it. Networking: Due to covid-19, I couldn\u2019t spend much time with the team at the office, but in the limited time we spent, there were many meaningful discussions which I really enjoyed. I felt engaged in the conversations. Apart from this, with all the interviews that I conducted during the study, I was able to develop some rapport with the interviewees and I am happy with that too. Any encouraging words for future students who want to take this path? Choose the thesis or internship that you love! If you don\u2019t have a choice of topic, choose the company you really aspire to work for. Think long term, something that you\u2019re sacrificing now should reap you a benefit later. It takes time to find the right company with the right topic and you just don\u2019t have to think about thesis only in the second year. If you are a non-EU student and have to travel to another country for thesis, it is definitely better to start early!

Read the interview with The Guardian here", "eit522": "Our idea was born after one of my co-founders and fellow student, Alba Forns, and I joined the Friday For Future march in Barcelona in September 2019. As we were marching through the streets there was a moment when I climbed up on a bench to look out over the crowd. Everyone can contribute to a better future In that moment I was overcome with hope but surprisingly, also with a deep aching sadness. I felt hope because I could see a real collective desire for change. There was hope in the faces of people young and old; hope that maybe their calls for a more sustainable future would be heard and acted upon. At the same time, I felt this deep sadness because I knew that by tomorrow everyone would have returned to their everyday lives, Pasieg de Gracia would have been cleaned and our emissions levels would still be the the same. I realised that what we need is a way to use our collective energy to make a concrete difference. I thought about \"How can everyone contribute to a better future?\" and after some time I realized that everyone across the whole spectrum has: a little spare change. When combined these little investments from our large movement could add up to a lot of money! Thus, the idea for Seeds was born. Crowdfunding for renewable energy Seeds is the first renewable energy Financial Technology (FinTech) app using crowdfunding to enable users to invest in projects with as little as their spare change. It connects the user\u2019s credit card, then when they make a purchase, the transaction is rounded up to the nearest euro and that spare change is automatically invest in a project of their choice. The app also shows the carbon offset equivalent of the investment so that users can go carbon neutral on a weekly basis. Seeds provides a way to align investments with environmental concerns. It also enables users to earn money by utilizing these painless micro-investments to build a savings while knowing where their money is going and the impact it\u2019s creating! Developing the idea during our studies As part of the EIT InnoEnergy Master in Renewable Energy programme we have had the opportunity to develop this idea over the course of the last year which has been a great runway to work through the complexities of executing it. As we are gaining momentum, we are receiving additional mentoring through not only from EIT InnoEnergy and the GC Index but also from ESADE\u2019s eWorks accelerator. Fortunately, after completing our studies together, our team has built the comradery necessary to rise to the challenge of founding a company. While our idea isn\u2019t specifically focused on engineering, we wouldn\u2019t be able to identify market gaps and execute this concept without a thorough understanding of the energy industry. After learning the complexities of analyzing the energy system; learning finance and banking isn\u2019t that challenging with a team of truly talented individuals. What the future holds As our team separates to our second-year universities, our plan is to use this as an opportunity to spread our vision, take the time to develop the app and establish the partnerships necessary to launch a pilot project. Our goal is to make this dream a reality and take Seeds on full-time post-graduation. We have a bold vision for a pan-European platform that creates a virtuous cycle of investment by the masses which can accelerate the energy transition while returning the profits to the people. By using crowdfunding, Seeds has the power to democratise and decentralise finance in a revolutionary way that is more representative of society.

The new venture will accelerate the production capacity of low-carbon batteries in southern Europe to meet growing demand for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Production in Verkor\u2019s first Gigafactory is scheduled to begin in 2023, with a capacity of 16 GWh of battery cells which will increase to 50 GWh in line with market dynamics. The facility will require an initial investment of \u20ac1.6bn and will create more than 2,000 direct jobs while supporting thousands more in its supply chain and ecosystem. The search for 200+ hectares of land is already underway. Verkor was founded in response to the growing gap between the expected demand for batteries and the committed and planned European supply. Indeed, the expected growth in demand this decade will require two to three Gigafactories in France alone. The European industrial ecosystem is therefore compelled to establish a sustainable and indigenous European battery supply chain, which in turn will reduce reliance on imports. France\u2019s affordable and low-carbon electricity, prominent automotive manufacturers, leading energy providers, and its demonstrated industrial prowess make it the ideal location for Gigafactories in southern Europe, a region which falls short of such projects when compared to northern and central Europe.

Building on EIT Health\u2019s commitment to Citizen & Patient Engagement, the inclusion of citizens and patients, and taking heed of their recommendations and experiences, was thus central to the hackathon. This provided an invaluable level of insight and expertise to the teams, as members were able to understand the outcomes that matter to their target audience, learn from lived experiences, and understand how working with patients\u2019 is essential for good intentions to become impactful and successful businesses. Keeping the patient in mind is crucial when solving such problems. Ultimately, they will be the end beneficiary of this solution. Patients have been through these health problems and experienced all their symptoms and consequences. If our end goal is patient health and quality of life, it is only logical to include the patients at as many points within the design cycle of the solution. I was glad to see that projects included patients not only in the research phase but also in the ideation, design, and prototype. Nour Maalouf, Medical Doctor, Participant of Team Kiora The Hackathon was held entirely on Discord, a tool originally intended for online gamers, but which offers many of the functions required for an online hackathon such as this. The multiple chat functions allow teams, most of whom have never met each other and live hundreds of miles apart from one another, to work together effectively towards a common goal. The Hackathon was a great experience and opportunity to promote patient involvement in health innovation'. Phil Collis (European Heart Network Patient Representative) Meet the winning team! Each team presented their initial idea to the external jury panel at the very start of the day, highlighting the key aspects of their project and outlining the challenges they would like to work on. At the end of the 8-hour sprint, the five teams then presented their ideas once again to the jury, this time focussing on the developments made throughout the day and reflecting on the new perspectives they gained through teamwork in such as short space of time. From prototype apps, to functioning websites and bootstrapped data analysis tools, the jury had a lot of results to assess. In the end the decision was unanimous: Team Canary Sentinel were declared the winners! Their project is based on creating an affordable, personalised early warning system to monitor for early signs of COVID-19 symptoms with the use of a phone camera. The winning team worked on three clearly defined work packages throughout the day: Data analysis and statistics related to the funding and data required for their AI. Bioengineering and privacy. Working and collaborating with healthcare systems. This detail orientated approach clearly paid off as the team\u2019s final pitch was strong enough to convince the Jury of their potential and win them a spot in the N3xtcoder personalised Product Lab. The hackathon allowed for inclusive co-creation of e-health solutions. It also gave the opportunity for designers, coders, and entrepreneurs to understand the experience, the needs and the expertise of patients and citizens before designing solutions. This experience could be a beginning of a 'new way of doing business'. The challenge lies in creating a culture of patient and citizen partnerships, establishing the leadership and organisational context required to foster engagement, and building bridges between the highly technological digital culture, the still largely academic medical knowledge and the experiential patient knowledge. Anne Schweighofer, Jury member, CEO of the Patient Conseil Going Forward The winning team: Canary Sentinel have already entered into discussions with N3xtcoder to design the perfect product Lab to take their idea forward. They will have access to all of N3xtcoders team of marketing, coding, and business development experts, and will be further supported by an additional EUR 3 000 from EIT Health. Already in June, Canary Sentinel met with a Data Security Expert Alistair, iOS Expert Marius, and Software Engineer Jennifer from the N3xtcoder team to discuss how best to advance the project. Over the course of a series of weekly sprints, the team will now work on developing a more advanced protoype.", "eit527": "EIT Food is delighted to announce that Zoetis, the world\u2019s leading animal health company, has joined EIT Food as a core partner.

Our close alignment in mission and commitment to collaborative, sustainable innovation points towards exciting and inspiring developments to improve animal health and welfare. -Andrew Carlin, Director of Strategic Programmes and Director of EIT Food\u2019s North-West Co-Location To learn more about Zoetis visit their website: www.zoetis.com", "eit528": "While the challenges of climate change and a global health crisis converge in cities, the economic conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic now present an unprecedented moment in modern urban sustainable development. Are cities ready, willing, and able to respond? Can their leaders and citizens embrace the kind of aggressive innovations needed for them to act on the climate emergency? With the right framing and context, transformative policy measures can deliver climate mitigation and resilience in cities. Achieving this will require a novel approach, one based on careful experimentation and testing on the ground. We need to innovate quickly to learn what we do not yet know how to do. We must experiment and test our best ideas, using a rigorous method for getting results in the time we have. This premise led EIT Climate-KIC and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM) to combine their efforts and convene a global taskforce to invent the policy innovations we need cities to test. -Thomas Osdoba, Director of Healthy, Clean Cities programme at EIT Climate-KIC. The taskforce met in early June and will be working throughout the next year. The initiative intends to use real-time testing by cities to shorten the deliberation cycle to develop insights quickly and enable the emergence of more refined or advanced policies. The taskforce includes 19 high-profile experts from a wide range of international climate and sustainable development-focused organisations. Creating and testing pathbreaking policy measures in the real world EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s experiences on the ground reveal cities generally have high-level policy goals for long-term decarbonisation of mobility and/or energy systems, usually by 2040 or 2050. These goals, consistent with the Paris Agreement, often lack the specific policy instruments required to achieve these targets. Even with continued calls for greater urgency in our efforts to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, little is in place \u2013 even among cities which lead on climate action \u2013 to achieve outcomes more quickly. The Policy Innovation Taskforce will move beyond reporting on \u2018best practices\u2019 in favour of moving towards an agile mode of policy invention and co-creation, systemically rethinking policymaking by cities. The inventions produced by the taskforce need to be tested in the real world and in real-time as quickly as possible. - Nikhil Chaudhary, Cities Advisor at EIT Climate-KIC. The Global Covenant of Mayors and EIT Climate-KIC will draw insights and strategic lessons from this experimentation to inform even better policy ideas. There will be tightly knit feedback loops of recommendations and learning between pilot cities and the taskforce within this process. The target cities and urban/climate policymakers willing to step up to this challenge are 15 cities EIT Climate-KIC is currently working with across Europe through its Healthy, Clean Cities programme. The 15 cities working with EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s Healthy, Clean Cities programme are the primary target of this policy innovation experimentation. These cities are taking the first step in building a global movement of cities working more urgently to achieve the same impact in this single decade, in keeping with recent calls from the United Nations to move more aggressively to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Once road-tested and refined within this group of cities, GCoM will lead the process of engaging mayors and city practitioners across their 10,000 signatories and 14 Regional Covenants. GCoM also plans to expand the reach of this initiative through a series of consultations through their innovation-focused programme, Innovate4Cities, and with representatives of 25 national governments affiliated with Mission Innovation. An array of policy challenges as a starting point to tackle complexity While the pandemic and climate emergency are daunting challenges for cities, innovative opportunities are opening that previously would have been unthinkable from a policy perspective. Under these circumstances, the initiative has identified a range of crucial policy areas relevant to cities globally, which include: Mobility systems and land-use integration Economic systems, climate budgeting and finance Citizen engagement and social sciences Climate governance, resilience and wellbeing Energy systems and buildings Biodiversity, water and natural ecosystems Public health and crisis management The seven areas listed above create a starting point and will continue to evolve as recommendations are developed and new challenges are uncovered. Moreover, the initiative will explore the interdependencies and interlinkages of policy issues, in service of advancing systems innovation in policymaking. Emerging conversations from the kick-off gathering The virtual meeting gathered multiple perspectives for considering the needed policy innovations. How to classify the overlapping policy areas and consider them holistically was one of the major focal points. One key takeaway was to strike the right balance between deep-dive \u2018technical\u2019 domains and embedding cross-cutting issues like resilience, governance, finance, citizen engagement and equity. The problem in my view is that climate action is often considered in isolation. Climate action is contingent on industrial policy, it is contingent on how we build homes and plan our communities and so on, so we must think about it holistically.\u201d \u2013 Sophie Howe, Future Generations Commissioner for Wales We need to think about the \u2018how\u2019 \u2013 how do we approach change. There will be a need for an alignment of leadership and vision in all domains that are affected: governments, citizens, companies, NGOs. All these actors will need to be included structurally in a governance model, one that is driven by a common ambition. This could avoid exclusion and provide a broad platform for change and space for interaction and shared opinions. \u2013 Mohamed Ridouani, Mayor of the City of Leuven Several members also stressed the need for urgency in framing innovative policy responses in a post-COVID-19 world. The speed and uncertainty of the current times have brought an additional emphasis on themes, such as systemic risks and resilience, climate-related co-benefits of economic recovery, demand for new governance models, and decision-making. In the coming months, the taskforce\u2019s work shall proceed through smaller sub-committees and will zero in on developing solutions for specific policy challenges. Moving ahead, the premise is that the first set of policy recommendations may not be perfect for all cities. But the act of experimentation, co-design and collective learning will lead everyone to better inform the next generation of policies. Watch this space.

The EIT Health Investor Network facilitates early-stage fundraising across Europe to help accelerate promising start-ups. The network connects qualified companies seeking funding with a pool of selected European investors. In recent months Investor Network companies have raised funding with some of our members such as TeiaCare \u20ac1.1m, Wefight \u20ac1.8m and InHeart \u20ac3.7m. For Tubulis, the financing round was co-led by BioMedPartners and High-Tech Gr\u00fcnderfonds (HTGF) with support from Seventure Partners, Coparion, Bayern Kapital, and OCCIDENT alongside significant contributions by high net worth individuals and the founders. Tubulis was spun out in 2019 from the Leibniz Research Institute in Berlin (FMP) and the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich with the aim of expanding the therapeutic potential of ADCs for cancer and other disease indications. Tubulis\u2019 objective is to use our dual platform approach to generate uniquely matched and disease-specific ADCs that combine selective antibodies with effective payloads. The funding committed by this experienced syndicate represents a validation of our technology and reflects the recent renaissance in ADC development in our industry. These proceeds will enable us to continue validating our platforms and to move our first two selected ADC candidates towards the clinic -Dominik Schumacher, CEO and Co-founder of Tubulis.", "eit530": "EIT InnoEnergy, the European innovation engine for sustainable energy, has announced a partnership with Vulcan Energy Resources Limited (Vulcan), a start-up lithium exploration company, to produce the World\u2019s first completely carbon neutral lithium in Germany. The partnership is part of Europe\u2019s strategic industry initiative, the European Battery Alliance, aimed at building an independent, sustainable, and resilient battery industry in Europe. Europe's largest lithium resource in Upper Rhine Valley Vulcan\u2019s \u201cZero Carbon Lithium\u201d project will be realised in the German part of the so-called Upper Rhine Rift, in the states of Baden-Wuertemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. The region contains Europe\u2019s largest lithium resource and one of the largest worldwide. Batteries are a key technology of our time. Driven particularly by the demand of the e-mobility sector, Europe\u2019s share of global battery cell production is forecast to reach almost 15% by 2024, overtaking the US and Asia excluding China. By using that momentum to accelerate the development of the European battery value chain, we are making our economy more resilient to future crises. The CO2-neutral development of our own lithium deposits is a crucial building block for a sustainable and strong European battery industry and will bring us significantly closer to meeting our 2030 climate goals. By further investing in Vulcan, and the other lithium mining projects, Europe could cover most of its anticipated lithium demand from regional resources. -Christian M\u00fcller, CEO of EIT InnoEnergy, Germany, Multi-dimensional support to bring project to fruition EIT InnoEnergy will be supporting Vulcan Energy Resources in bringing this strategic project to fruition. In addition to direct financial support in the six figure range, EIT InnoEnergy will be assisting Vulcan in raising further capital, helping to establish connections to companies in Europe\u2019s battery supply chain as well as relevant political actors, and assisting them in building their management team and selecting qualified employees through its vital growth phase. Horst Kreuter, co-founder of Vulcan Energy Resources, said: \u201cOur goal is to play an integral role in enabling a zero-carbon future by decarbonizing the currently high carbon production footprint of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. We have therefore carried out a very thorough global search for the perfect location \u2013 and found it. Not only does the Upper Rhine region contain one of the largest lithium reservoirs globally, it is also within a few hours reach to many of the World\u2019s leading auto manufacturers, and many other industrial players, all of whom have a hugely growing demand for emission-free lithium. We see a massive chance for the region to become one of the key centres of the European battery industry itself, which would result in the creation of thousands of secure and highly qualified jobs.\u201d Proprietary technology for carbon neutral lithium extraction Vulcan will pump hot lithium-rich brine up to the surface, then use the renewable electricity and heat to drive lithium extraction using its proprietary technique, with excess renewable energy as a saleable by-product that can be fed back into the grid. As a result, the carbon footprint of the production process could even be negative. The resulting lithium shall then be used in a number of ways, most notably in the production of lithium-ion batteries to meet the massive demand from the automotive and other sectors. Commercial operations are targeted to start to produce lithium hydroxide in time for the large increase in expected industry demand in Europe during the first half of the decade. Over time, production volumes are expected to massively increase. Europe is already the fastest growing lithium-ion battery production centre in the world, with zero local supply of lithium hydroxide.", "eit531": "\u201cBold leaders are needed to drive a collaborative approach that will push all of us to leave our comfort zone and open up a new world of sustainable possibility,\u201d said Head of Circular Economy Cliona Howie during an online side-event at this year\u2019s digital version of the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Co-organised by the Government of Slovenia and the European Economic and Social Committee, the webinar aimed to discuss how to make circularity work for a just transition to climate neutrality. The HLPF annual meeting is the core United Nations platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Usually hosted in New York City, it was held online this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cliona Howie presented examples on how EIT Climate-KIC is working to leverage collective knowledge and expertise to ensure that the post-COVID-19 recovery is aligned with climate and SDG commitments. ''What we are offering on the ground is system innovation as a service to help Europe deliver a transformative green recovery'' said Howie. Systemic change, she added, is \u201ca shift from \u2018singular interventions\u2019 \u2013 which might provide amazing solutions in a single place, at a single time, for a single thing \u2013 to something that is really addressing the complexity of the global climate challenge.\u201d \u201cAs we plan an economic recovery, it is critical that we look beyond the easier, carbon-intensive options. The answer lies in circular, systemic solutions that will transform our society in an unprecedented way,\u201d said Howie. Working \u201cwhere the challenge sits inside an ecosystem\u201d In practice, EIT Climate-KIC designs cross-cutting holistic programmes (so called Deep Demonstrations) based on the needs, demands, and contexts of a certain ecosystem. The aim of the \u201cCircular, Regenerative Economies Deep Demonstration\u201d is to help challenge owners \u2013 which can be public authorities at the national, regional or city scale, but also entire value chains \u2013 \u201cunderstand what a circular transition looks like, how they would implement it, how they would even start pulling it together, how they would meet objectives that really help them to design a resilient sustainable future, all while meeting very pressing climate targets,\u201d explained the expert. The approach aims to identify the scenarios, pathways and available options for system change consistent with a 1.5-degree future. It is already being tested in many places around the EU including in Slovenia, where nine ministries are working together with EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Raw Materials and the EU\u2019s Joint Research Centre on 17 inter-connected programmes across multiple levers of change from education to policy, consumer behaviour, innovation support and capacity building. \u201cSlovenia has been an incredibly exciting journey thus far and we\u2019re really looking to implementing on the ground very quickly,\u201d said Howie.

AquaInSilico Lda has been granted EUR 60 000 EIT RawMaterials Booster funding to develop further its software tools to optimise wastewater treatment. The grant from EIT RawMaterials Booster will allow AquaInSilico to build on its collaboration with a leading European environmental, water and waste management group to commercialise its software tools to remove phosphorus from wastewater in a more environmentally friendly and effective way than existing methods. The recovered phosphorus can then be sold for use in fertilisers. AquaInSilico Lda is a portfolio company of Frontier IP, a specialist in commercialising intellectual property. AquaInSilico\u2019s technology is attracting interest because several European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Austria, are introducing stricter regulations that require large treatment plans to recover at least 50% of the phosphorus for use as a biofertiliser. This is causing utility problems because current methods use expensive and environmentally unfriendly chemicals to bind the phosphorus or biological processes that, although cheaper and more sustainable, do not work more than 45% of the time properly. AquaInSilico\u2019s wastewater treatment software uses a mathematically-modelled biological approach to improve phosphorus removal, based on understanding and controlling the operating variables that result from biological and chemical processes. As a result, the process reduces the use of chemicals and energy and the risk of environmental harm from phosphorus leaching into waterways from wastewater sludge. AquaInSilico is a spin-out from Portugal\u2019s NOVA University, NOVA School of Science and Technology (\u201cFCT NOVA\u201d) and is the fourth spin-out resulting from Frontier IP\u2019s growing presence in Portugal. Broad applicability of a new software As the sophisticated algorithms the company is developing are based on a deep knowledge of biological and chemical processes and are able to understand and predict how they unfold in different conditions, they can detect possible problems, often before they can be diagnosed by humans. As a result, the technology has broad applicability, with the potential to allow companies, such as oil groups, brewers, pulp, paper, steel makers, food processing and waste recovery businesses and municipal wastewater treatment plants, to tune and adapt their treatment systems more effectively. It is expected to save them up to 25% of their operating costs. AquaInSilico\u2019s software also supports the improved recovery of other valuable and recyclable products in addition to phosphorus, such as ammonia, biogas, and fine chemicals that can be used in biofertilisers, bioplastics and biofuels. The company believes this could result in new sustainable technologies in future. AquaInSilico was established to develop and commercialise the research of Dr Jorge Santos, Dr Mariana Matos and Professor Maria Ascens\u00e3o Reis of FCT NOVA. This team had developed several research projects in environmental and industrial bioengineering in collaboration with several worldwide industry players. We are very happy for this EIT RawMaterials Booster grant, which offers us the opportunity to speed up our technology readiness level and reach the market with a solution that recovers critical raw materials from waste to new bio-based products. Dr Jorge Santos, Co-Founder at AquaInSilico", "eit535": "Two EIT Health-supported start-ups, one that uses light science to screen candidates for Alzeheimer\u2019s trials and another that bends light to assist in neurological rehabilitation, have both announced that they have received their next million in funding. EIT Health Wild Card winner, iLoF, said it secured USD 1 million in investment from a partnership of Microsoft\u2019s Venture Fund, M12, and the Mayfield Fund. Meanwhile, Restorative Neurotechnologies, which was accelerated through EIT Health Headstart support, announced that they would be receiving EUR 1 million from a group of four investors that includes CDP Venture Capital Sgr. iLoF: Non-invasive screening for clinical trials Following the team\u2019s entry into the EIT Health open innovation Wild Card programme in 2019, iLoF (Intelligent Lab on a Fibre) was formed and \u20ac2 million in investment in addition to a mentoring package was provided to develop the company and solution. Honing in on the repeated clinical trial failures in neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, the solution aims to improve the process of clinical trial screening and speed up drug discovery in diseases with little, or no, treatment options. In addition to the recent boost from M12 and Mayfield, iLof has attracted the attention of the biotech world, with its cofounders being named in the 2020 Forbes 30 under 30 Europe list in the science and healthcare category. Additionally, the team are finalists in the M12 Female Founders Competition. It is fantastic to see iLoF go from strength to strength following their formation as part of the EIT Health Wild Card programme. Wild Card was created to discover and develop highly talented individuals who can come together to form new companies that break ground in areas where solutions to challenges remain undiscovered. Effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are desperately needed yet continue to evade us \u2013 innovation in the research process to find new strategies in tackling such diseases will have significant impact, not to mention scientific value. We look forward to continuing working with iLoF and supporting them as they advance in their journey Jorge Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, Director of Innovation, EIT Health Challenges surrounding current clinical trial processes are significantly hindering the discovery of potential treatments in diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, including difficulties in recruiting and retaining participants. iLoF\u2019s solution uses biophotonics (the use of light-based technologies for the purpose of studying biological tissue, cells and cellular processes) and AI to develop non-invasive methods of screening patients for clinical trials, and aims to accelerate the drug discovery process and make it more economically viable. This investment will be crucial to our mission of accelerating personalised treatments for patients all around the world. Our platform technology is growing rapidly and is already being deployed with leading hospitals and biotechs around the globe, expediting the discovery and development of new therapeutics for neurogenerative diseases. By 2021, we aim to enrol a large-scale clinical trial as a precise, non-invasive pre-screening tool for Alzheimer\u2019s, bringing us one step closer to our goal of making the patient\u2019s journey much more humane and convenient, while drastically transforming the whole process into a more efficient and flexible experience for the industry Luis Valente, CEO of iLoF Restorative Neurotechnologies: Rehab with prismatic glasses Restorative Neurotechnologies, a start-up based in Italy, develops ground-breaking treatments for stroke survivors and other patients with neurological disorders. According to the World Health Organization, around 1 billion patients suffer from neurological disorders worldwide. This problem has an impact on the quality of life, health systems and income capacity of patients and their caregivers. Restorative Neurotechnologies addresses this challenge with a wearable device and accompanying software that allows cognitive stimulation through digital rehabilitation exercises. At the core of the solution is Mindlenses, a pair of special glasses equipped with prismatic lenses that deviate the visual field to the right or left. The research team found that the deviation induced by the prismatic lenses is detected by the brain, which puts in place a compensatory mechanism capable of stimulating the rehabilitation process. The Restorative Neurotechnologies team was granted EUR 40 000 and networking support through EIT Health\u2019s 2019 Headstart programme. Prof. Massimo Oliveri, head of the team, noted the importance of that support: \u201cAccess to a competition such as the acceleration programmes of EIT Health, specifically designed for biomedical businesses, allowed us to complete the development of our product.\u201d The team also closed a EUR 110 000 SocialFare seed funding round in 2019. Now, one of the new investors, CDP Venture Capital Sgr \u2013 National Innovation Fund, will provide further support for all phases of product development and scale-out. The fund, 70% owned by CDP Equity (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Group) and 30% by Invitalia, aims to support and promote Italian innovative start-ups in the Southern part of the country through the Southern Business Fund. We are amazed by the pace of the development of the team coming from Palermo. This is yet another great example of a start-up from more progressing regions that is highly skilled, motivated and successful Chiara Maiorino, EIT Health InnoStars Regional Manager for Italy Consorzio ARCA, the coordinators of the EIT Health Regional Innovation Scheme Hub in Italy, have been collaborating with Prof. Oliveri and his team for several years. 'We supported the group as a tutor for the preparation of their business plan, and supported them in participating in the EIT Health InnoStars Awards in 2017 and then in the selection process of the SocialFare Accelerator which, in 2018, led them to start a second spin-off, namely Restorative Technologies,' said Fiammetta Panto of Consorzio ARCA.", "eit536": "Supporting start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs during the COVID-19 crisis Over 170 innovators from 25 countries applied for the EIT RawMaterials Booster Call in response to the COVID-19 crisis.

An impressive number of high-quality applications were assessed as part of EIT Food\u2019s COVID-19 Rapid Response Call for Innovation, and we are very pleased with the final 13 that were chosen. They demonstrate the ingenuity and dedication of the agritech community in a time of great uncertainty and disruption, and we are as committed as ever before to supporting their resilience - as well as that of the wider European Food System. We look forward to the implementation of these urgently needed innovations to help the sector collectively respond to the pandemic and rebuild our economy sustainably Andy Zynga, CEO of EIT Food In August 2020, EIT Food will also announce the recipients of the COVID-19 Bridge Fund, which will help ventures adapt to the crisis and continue critical innovation activities whilst bridging the gap so they can secure follow-on funding. The aim is to provide timely financial support of between EUR 200 000 and EUR 500 000 to a select number of agricultural and food ventures that address one of EIT Food\u2019s key focus areas. By deploying a rapid response mechanism, all EIT Crisis Response activities will be completed by the end of 2020 to help Europe recover. These funding initiatives come on top of already-launched initiatives from across the whole EIT Food partner community to support the European food system through the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has included the launch of \u2018Robin Food\u2019, a soup brand in Belgium with EIT Food partners (and now a COVID-19 Rapid Response Call for Innovation recipient) that is using fresh surplus vegetables from farmers, and aims to distribute 20 000 litres to vulnerable families through food banks and social grocers. With learnings from the Robin Food program, similar initiatives are already being rolled out across other regions in Europe. In Spain for example, EIT Food has announced the \u2018 Los Salvacomidas\u2019 (The Food Savers) initiative to provide over 60,000 healthy lunch boxes to children in need affected by the COVID crisis. EIT Food is also helping to improve the knowledge of the public by launching a free online course that is exploring how agrifood supply chains are coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To move society toward a circular economy and reduce society\u2019s use of virgin raw materials, industry by-products (side streams) have to be treated as products as well. This has been the objective in the Min-Pet project (2016\u00ad\u20132019) where the use of a mineral side stream, Petrit-T, has been upscaled as a raw material for acoustic panels and cement. We have been successful in defining a method for scaling up the use of geopolymer Petrit-T as a raw material in acoustic panels. Currently, we are collaborating with a company developing a process for using Petrit-T in producing acoustic panels. Bj\u00f6rn Haase, Manager Non-metal Products at H\u00f6gan\u00e4s AB Bj\u00f6rn Haase is responsible for H\u00f6gan\u00e4s\u2019 work with side streams and has been occupied with developing and producing environmentally friendly geopolymer materials for nearly ten years. However, finding potential applications for side streams has not always been simple. Bj\u00f6rn is a pioneer in the field, and his insistent efforts and cooperation with other companies are one of the main reasons why H\u00f6gan\u00e4s manages to use so much of its side streams. When I visited the University of Oulu in Finland a handful years ago and heard what they were doing there I got the idea of using Petrit-T as a raw material for inorganic polymers. Bj\u00f6rn Haase In the Min-Pet project, the main focus has been to scale-up the use of the inorganic binder raw material to yield geopolymer-based materials as well as cement. Both the ceramic-like geopolymeric material and the cement has multiple uses in many applications including concrete elements, foamed concrete, thermal insulation material, and as a low-temperature ceramic. EIT RawMaterials and the partners involved have played a major role in supporting this development. It was difficult to gain support for the use of side streams ten years ago, but nowadays circular economy and industrial symbiosis are a frequent topic of conversation. We have been able to evaluate, compare and develop the geopolymer as a new raw material thanks to EIT RawMaterials. Bj\u00f6rn Haase H\u00f6gan\u00e4s uses 80 per cent of all side streams At the world\u2019s biggest metal powder manufacturer H\u00f6gan\u00e4s AB\u2019s production plants all over the world vast quantities of byproducts (side streams) are produced. The company tries to ensure that as much as possible of this material is used as a new raw material in its own production processes or by other industries. In 2019, approximately 80 per cent of H\u00f6gan\u00e4s\u2019 side streams were used. The company aims at increasing usage of side streams to 85 per cent by 2020 and 95 per cent by 2026. By successful commercialization of the Petrit-T foam geopolymer, up to 20 000 tonnes of side stream can be used in H\u00f6gan\u00e4s alone. Side streams from H\u00f6gan\u00e4s can replace materials that are otherwise blasted out of rock for use in roadbuilding, for example. H\u00f6gan\u00e4s is part of the circular economy in that we provide industries with raw materials from our side streams and largely use scrap as a raw material in our own production processes. The more side streams we can use in society, the less virgin material is needed. Bj\u00f6rn Haase Cooperation the key to success The Min-Pet project has brought together key players in the European raw materials sector; four research units (University of Oulu, KU-Leuven, VTT and ZAG), two companies specialized in the circular economy and waste valorization (Dansk jordstabilisering and Destamatic) and large industry (H\u00f6gan\u00e4s). The consortium covers the whole value chain from the producer to the end-users, complemented with research institutions. We are successful in pursuing technical development and projects that the entire steel industry can benefit from thanks to cooperation with companies in the steel industry and other industries. We also link together industries that do not normally come into contact with one another. Slag asphalt for the asphalt industry and water treatment with slag for the water treatment industry are just a couple of examples of successful projects of this kind. Bj\u00f6rn Haase Despite the simple manufacturing process of geopolymer materials, careful science and engineering is required in designing the reactions. 60 million tons of industrial side streams Alkali-activation for several waste streams has been commercialized in several countries worldwide highlighting the technical feasibility of the concept and the core technology. Being a platform technology, alkali-activation can be applied to a wide range of different markets starting from sustainable concrete, to railroad sleepers, and high-end fiber composites One challenge involves assessing which side stream materials are suitable for which customers. Extensive analysis work is required in this regard. We have a number of products from our side streams, but we have to come up with new options the whole time. This is why we carry out extensive sampling procedures in order to analyse and control the qualities of our material and work out the industries for which the material might be useful. We have to be innovative and constantly think along new lines. Bj\u00f6rn Haase The technology upscaled in the Min-Pet project can be used to valorise other similar industrial side streams as well, such as fly ashes and slags. There are roughly 60 million tons of inorganic industrial side streams that are landfilled in EU per annum, highlighting the need for these kind of upscaling projects. Bj\u00f6rn Haase As the concept of utilizing industrial side streams using alkali-activation will be applied to an ever-widening number of applications, for example, molding, extrusion and fiber reinforcing, it will enable ever-higher returns to the European raw material sector.", "eit539": "Breaking new ground in women\u2019s health and digital therapeutics. The EIT Health Wild Card Hackathon began on 1 July with a packed agenda for the 45 participants who came together online to find new solutions in women\u2019s health and digital therapeutics. Now in its third year, the EIT Health Wild Card programme builds game-changing life science companies to break new ground in health by challenging the status quo in areas of high unmet need. Beginning with two challenges set by EIT Health, the annual Wild Card programme invites talented innovators from across Europe to respond with their ideas. Successful applicants start their journey with a hackathon; putting them through their paces on everything from team formation, critical thinking, business model development and pitching. Finally, participants pitch their solution to a panel of industry leaders to secure a spot in the finals, at which point they pitch for EIT Health investment to incorporate their company and bring their solution to market. 'The Hackathon is a very exciting phase of the Wild Card programme \u2013 it\u2019s where we see highly talented individuals come together with complementary skill sets, where initial ideas are transformed into game-changing and viable business ventures, and where participants go from entrepreneur to CEO-in-waiting,' said Jorge Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, Director of Innovation, EIT Health. 'Beyond the excitement, we are also reminded that we are here with a serious purpose \u2013 we simply must do more to drive advancements in women\u2019s health and take advantage of the possibilities afforded to us by digital therapeutics. We look forward to discovering and developing the very best talent that can help us to improve the lives of patients and citizens in Europe.' The Wild Card challenges Women\u2019s Health: Women\u2019s health has historically been under-recognised, and understanding of women\u2019s health conditions and solutions to treat them have been slow. Women in Europe live, on average, 10 years in ill health with cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health conditions being the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Women are generally underrepresented in medical research, and are significantly more likely to have an adverse reaction to medication than men. Digital Therapeutics: Although a relatively new field of healthcare, digital therapeutics hold great promise in revolutionising current medical practice, particularly in therapeutic areas where traditional medicine has fallen short. With an ageing population in Europe and many healthcare systems under strain from the demand caused by aging and non-communicable diseases, new ways of treating and managing patients must be found. Defined as evidence-based therapeutic interventions to treat, manage or prevent a disease or condition using software programmes, digital therapeutics can be used independently, or combined with existing interventions to optimise patient care and improve outcomes. What\u2019s next for Wild Card The participants will be coached by 20 leading mentors from Europe and beyond, pitching their final solution on the 10th July to the judging panel. Selected teams will be incubated by EIT Health and awarded up to two million euros each of EIT Health investment at the end of October to develop their company and solution. Past winners include Abtrace and Smart4Diagnostics, who were named winners in 2018 and have since launched their products onto the market; and iLoF and PIPRA, who were winners in 2019 and continue to develop their products. EIT Health is in the process of finalising the challenges that will be posed to Europe\u2019s innovators as part of the 2021 Wild Card programme.

Care institutions are taking notice. The SARA robot, developed as part of the \"Social & Autonomous Robotic Health Assistant\" innovation activity of EIT Digital, led by Bright Cape, was one of the main attractions at the EIT Digital Conference in Brussels last year. SARA Robotics, the start-up created to commercialise it, has made many progresses since then. It has already signed up three Dutch care institutions as customers, Zorggroep Elde Maasduinen, tanteLouise and Het Laar and, with the COVID-19 pandemic shining a spotlight on the wellbeing of elderly guests of nursing homes and on the shortage of staff there, its services are in growing demand. As visitors were no longer allowed in those institutions, we had a lot of requests, from our customers but also from other facilities, asking if it was possible to use the robot to help clients have some form of communication with their friends and relatives. So, we built the option to video call via SARA and we also explored more options such as the uploading of pre-made videos or photos which can be viewed by residents at any time, even without an Internet connection Emmy Hendriks, Product Manager of SARA Robotics The start-up also set up a promotional campaign, \"SARA stays over\" (SARA blijft slapen), allowing care institutions to borrow the robots for free for one month, to get some support out of it and test its functionalities. 'We just wanted to do something good for the residents of those facilities and, at the same time, it was a nice opportunity for us to showcase our innovation and see if these care homes would be interested to pursue a longer collaboration,' Hendriks explained. As of June 2020, more than 100 Dutch institutions subscribed for the SARA stays over campaign, as can be seen at a glance on a map created by the startup and shared on social media. 'It's worth stressing that, while indeed the coronavirus pandemic contributed to raise the attention on the shortage of nursing staff in care homes and on the quality of life of their clients, the problem has already existed for quite a long time and it is not going away anytime soon,' SARA's product manager said. In ageing European societies, the number of elderly people as a percentage of the overall population is constantly increasing, while fewer and fewer people choose to become healthcare professionals. Care institutions and hospitals, therefore, are facing serious staffing shortages and heavy work pressure has proven to be related to poor quality of care and to incidents such as medication errors. The robotics assistants developed as a result of this EIT Digital innovation activity and commercialised by SARA Robotics provide a turnkey hardware and software solution for care institutions and hospitals to improve care recipients' quality of life and provide support to alleviate caregiver-staffing shortages. For instance, the SARA robot can support elderly people suffering from first-stage dementia to perform specific exercises designed to improve their mental and physical fitness and delay entering the second, more acute stage of the illness. The robot can also play games, support music therapy and perform repetitive tasks, such as reminding staff and clients of certain events and checking the client's wellbeing. For now, SARA Robotics aims at commercialising the product almost exclusively on the Dutch market. Starting next year, the startup will expand its reach by enabling different kinds of robot hardware systems to run the SARA software, and it will try to enter the European and the United States markets. 'Hopefully next year we will create another map of SARA's presence in care institutions, and we will pin all these pointers across the globe,' Hendriks said.", "eit542": "Stockholm Region pioneering health bond scheme to support people in preventing type 2 diabetes. A start-up launched through an EIT Health Innovation Project has signed a five-year agreement with the Stockholm Region to help people at risk of type 2 diabetes remain in good health, while leading a revolution in the way we think about paying for healthcare. Instead of asking healthcare to pay when people get sick, the health bond originally envisioned by the Health Integrator start-up provides pay-outs when people improve their health through preventative measures. This approach can ultimately reduce illness and the cost of healthcare. The Stockholm Region is now pioneering the new model in partnership with the Swedish bank SEB and the insurance company Skandia, who provide a unique financing instrument, and Health Integrator, who are responsible for the initiative and the development of the digital platform. EIT Health support launched the start-up A two-year EIT Health Innovation Project called the Health Movement was started in 2017. It involved EIT Health Partners RISE, Stockholm Region, Karolinska Institutet, IESE Business School, West Midlands Academic Health Science Network, Semmelweis University and City of Rotterdam, as well as commercial partners MSD and Apoteket. As part of the Innovation Project, the spinout company Health Integrator was launched, with the aim of strengthening the conditions for healthier individuals and preventing non-communicable diseases. Work began on an investment model to provide financial rewards for good health results, resulting in the model now launched. This system transformation would never have happened if we had not received support for our innovation project through EIT Health at an early stage. They dared to invest in something innovative that was based on future systems Fredrik S\u00f6der, CEO, Health Integrator How the system facilitates sustainable change Initially, up to 925 Stockholmers at risk of developing type 2 diabetes will be offered the use of Health Integrator\u2019s digital health platform and app for five years. With the support of a personal health coach and tests, participants can buy preventative health services and products through the Health Integrator platform. Each user gets a \u201cwallet\u201d loaded with money to shop for selected health services. They can also pay by credit card or use their employer\u2019s healthcare allowance. In the short term, this leads to better health, and in the longer term, changed lifestyle habits can prevent them from developing type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. The increasing burden of type 2 disease, for individuals and for society, can be prevented. \u201cWith Health Integrator, we want to give individuals the right conditions to succeed in changing their living habits in a sustainable way. With health tests, support of coaching conversations \u2013 together with a health pedagogue and a tailor-made \u2018basket of solutions\u2019, based on the individual\u2019s conditions and needs \u2013 the chances of success increase to consume health,\u201d said Health Integrator\u2019s Fredrik S\u00f6der. Unique financing model The project is financed through a SEK 30 million loan (Health Impact Bond) from Skandia, an insurance company. If a participant develops type 2 diabetes, Skandia covers part of the cost, but if the participant is found to have reduced the risk of diabetes, Skandia receives a return of up to 10% percent of the investment. One unique aspect of the solution is that the Stockholm Region does not incur any costs in the first few years. After five years, the region would pay around SEK 23-33 million, depending on outcomes. There will also be savings if people stay healthy and do not require expensive care. Stockholm Region expects to receive up to 100% return on investment. Proven effectiveness One reason why Stockholm Region has confidence in the Health Integrator is that it has been proven effective in a clinical study. \u201cFew apps have been scientifically evaluated, but the Health Integrator app has been tested in a randomised controlled study of just over 200 people,\u201d says Ylva Trolle Lagerros, Chief Physician at the Overweight Center in the Stockholm Region, a researcher at the Karolinska Institute and leader of the pilot study. \u201cAfter three months we were able to see statistically significant differences in health variables such as waist size and blood pressure between the group that used the Health Integrator app and the group that did not receive the app.\u201d EIT Health Partners \u2018driving development\u2019 It is fantastic to see how EIT Health\u2019s Partners, through Health Integrator, a project we have supported for several years, are now driving the development of health bonds. It is an exciting development that shows how social value can be created through disease prevention and provide significant cost savings for healthcare Erik Forsberg, Managing Director of EIT Health Scandinavia Last year, Health Integrator participated in EIT Health Headstart, an EIT Health Accelerator programme that assists start-ups with product and service verification. With Headstart support, Health Integrator was able to refine the packaging of its service and develop a digital health platform for consumers. In the long term, the solution can be made available in other regions and reach a wider group that is ready to pay for itself. \u201cIn a next step, we think that our service will be paid directly by the user or through the employer\u2019s health care allowance and insurance. By offering different arrangements and payment solutions, we can make it easier for users to consume health and thereby avoid healthcare consumption\u201d said Fredrik S\u00f6der.", "eit543": "Close to 30 participants in the first edition \u2013 call for next round starts in September The 2020 Gazelle Accelerator programme organized their 1st matchmaking event mid-June, with already 27 start-ups joining pitch training, intensive business coaching, and match-making events.

The debate on how to achieve ambitious climate targets is often dominated by a technocratic discourse centred around developing new technologies to \u201csolve-it-all.\u201d Only a small minority of resources and attention goes towards those who have to live with the new paradigm: Citizens. Therefore, their role in shaping their own future is limited. EIT Climate-KIC has been working on activating citizen participation in climate action for a decade with programmes like Climathon, Young Innovators and Pioneers into Practise. Drafting lessons from this experience, the organisation suggests embedding the European Climate Pact in wider systems transformation activities. EIT Climate-KIC is already working on a systems innovation approach where citizens and communities can act within larger and orchestrated transformations. Launched at the end of 2018, the Deep Demonstration projects have unveiled how critical new models of community and governance are to addressing the climate emergency. The European Climate Pact is a broad initiative launched by the European Commission as part of the European Green Deal. It aims to give everyone a voice and space to design new climate actions, share information, launch grassroots activities and showcase solutions that others can follow. In its contribution to the consultation on the future Pact, EIT Climate-KIC highlights the importance of including groups that are currently under-represented in the climate conversation, as well as empowering citizens and decision-makers to collaborate to build a more sustainable future. It also suggests that the European Climate Pact should address and support a systemic and portfolio-based approach, new models of transition governance and new financial mechanisms unlocking new sources of funding. READ THE POSITION PAPER", "eit547": "With the motto \u201cRethinking food systems for human and planetary health,\u201d the 2020 edition of the Global Landscapes Forum conference was held online. During the three days (3-5 June) of this global conference, almost 5,000 people from 185 countries attended one of its 60 sessions. Additionally, the live broadcast of the sessions received over 77,000 views and reached 50 million people on social media. The emergence of zoonotic diseases (infectious diseases transmitted between humans and other animals) like COVID-19 have links to deforestation, and food production and consumption, revealing a responsibility to transform our food and land systems to secure human and planetary well-being. This has instigated a global conversation on how to \u201cbuild back better\u201d as well as a call for a green recovery plan. The current health crisis acted as an important frame for the conference. Relevant to this frame, EIT Climate-KIC presented its strategy for European climate action, Transformation, in time. The strategy describes how EIT Climate-KIC plans to catalyse systemic change through innovation in areas of human activity that have a critical impact on greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilience: Land use, materials, cities and finance. Leveraging his expertise on landscapes, Daniel Zimmer moderated a panel on how strong alliances can achieve a sustainable future. The session\u2019s main insight was that human and environmental rights, trustful multi-stakeholder partnerships and taking strategic risks are key to scaling landscape programmes in the coming years. The full session may be viewed here. In her session, Pernille Martiny Modvig reminded the audience that Europe is in a state of climate emergency and that the EU Commission President Van der Leyen, as early as November 2019, called for a systemic response. She added: \u201cCOVID-19 has shown us we are capable of reacting quickly, comprehensively and systemically in response to the crisis as a society.\u201d She referred to the usefulness of the lessons learned from managing the health crisis, to address an \u201cemerging food crisis due to climate change and biodiversity loss.\u201d Understanding the speed of climate action so far has been insufficient, Martiny Modvig told the audience that, in order to act six times faster to reach zero-emissions in time, it\u2019s necessary to change the traditional approach to innovation towards a systemic one. Martiny Modvig described food systems as incredibly complex, saying you can\u2019t create lasting change by simply adjusting the pieces along the value chain. If we are to create fair and resilient change, we need to consider that farmers, retailers and consumers alike will be affected and this will have social, political, financial and cultural implications. Martiny Modvig\u2019s full sessions may be viewed here and here. Both Daniel Zimmer and Pernille Martiny Modvig are involved in EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstrations, Landscapes as Carbon Sinks and Resilient Food Systems & Diets respectively. These programmes act as demonstrators of the organisation\u2019s strategy, Transformation, in time, and were designed to meet the increasing demand for EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s role as an orchestrator of systems innovation. EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s systems innovation model uses a balanced portfolio of interventions\u2014across education, technological innovation, citizen engagement, policy, finance, etc.\u2014to catalyse fast decarbonisation and drive climate adaptation.

Why not centre consumers in the agrifood business, using their input to create new products? That was the idea of the EIT Food Consumer Engagement Lab organised with seniors in Extremadura (Spain), an experimental initiative based on the concept of \u201cDesign Thinking\u201d. Over two sessions, a group of 20 seniors met with a selection of stakeholders from the agrifood sector, including Inura (The University of Extremadura Institute of Agronomic Resources), food businesses Iberitos and Lider Aliment; Hinepa - Asociaci\u00f3n Internacional de Atenci\u00f3n a la Persona, and the innovation agency Brain CO. The encounter produced amazing results. Just a few short months later, the group created and brought to market two new, gluten-free products: a tuna and piquillo pepper p\u00e2t\u00e9 and a cream of ceps with truffle. As well as idea-sharing, the process of bringing forth the two new products involved a viability and market study, during which another six product ideas fell by the roadside. The two selected products are being brought to market by Iberitos, as producer, and Lider Aliment, as Spar retailer, and are currently available at eight supermarkets across Extremadura: in Badajoz, M\u00e9rida, Almendralejo, Castuera, Don Benito, Villanueva de la Serena and Zafra. Tuna with Peppers P\u00e2t\u00e9 and Cream of Ceps with Truffle As the creators explain, tuna and piquillo peppers is an unusual combination on the market, but not in Spanish homes. It is both tasty and healthy, with the advantage that it is \u201cmore practical than making it at home\u201d, allowing cooks to \u201ccut down on ingredients and food waste\u201d. The cream of ceps with truffle has been designed to pair with meat, as a \u201clittle treat\u201d for lovers of intense flavours. Both products are supplied in glass jars, which make it easier to check their preservation status and are also reusable, testimony to the growing environmental awareness among seniors. The products hit the shelves in late March, under the Iberitos brand and carrying the EIT Food label. Eduvigis Campos, one of the seniors who took part in the experience, described the sessions as \u201cvery interesting and enjoyable\u201d, adding that they provided an opportunity to share her cooking skills and food habits with others. It was also a \u201cbreak from routine\u201d, something that she described as \u201cvery important to keep the mind and the body active.\u201d The pilot experience took place simultaneously in Spain, Portugal, Poland and Lithuania.

With calls for a \u2018green recovery\u2019 from the COVID-19 pandemic rocketing up the agenda, the need for investment in energy efficient homes is becoming ever clearer. If the UK wants to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050, almost all of the country\u2019s 29 million homes need to be improved, meaning 1.8 homes need to be retrofitted every minute between now and 2050. Primarily funded by EIT Climate-KIC, Accelerator Cities supports towns and cities in developing their own home retrofit programmes; helps coordinate action between them\u2014including sharing best practices, lessons learned, evidence and resources; supports a coordinated approach in respect of links to financial institutions and funding opportunities; encourages greater partnership between industry and NGO groups on home retrofit; and helps to coordinate cities\u2019 engagement with central government on this topic. Boosting the rate of home retrofits will provide crucial support for health and well-being, accelerate the transition to net-zero and create jobs in all parts of the country. To help achieve this, UKGBC has brought together city and combined authority partners: Birmingham City Council, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, the Greater London Authority, Leeds City Council and the West Midlands Combined Authority. A range of other expert stakeholders are also on board including the Active Building Centre, Bioregional, Energy Saving Trust, Green Alliance, Otley Energy, Places in Common, RetrofitWorks and UK100. John Alker, Director of Policy & Places at UKGBC said: \u201cThere is a critical need to improve the nation\u2019s health, reduce carbon emissions and create long-lasting economic benefits. Home retrofit is a triple-win that supports all three goals. Although central Government still holds many of the keys to unlocking this, cities and local authorities are stepping up to play a crucial leadership role. Accelerator Cities is all about supporting and enabling greater coordination between local government on home retrofit. The project will help city and local authorities as they grapple with issues such as householder engagement, skills and finance\u2014helping to build an evidence base, learn lessons and share common approaches.\u201d Learn more", "eit559": "Last week, EIT Health submitted a contribution to the European Commission (EC) to inform ongoing discussions related to their Data Strategy and AI White Paper.

This is the largest private investment into direct air capture to date. The funding will help to drive forward the company\u2019s scale-up roadmap and expand its carbon dioxide removal capacities. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by over a third since the Industrial Revolution began. These emissions have already increased global temperatures by around 1\u00b0C since pre-industrial times. There are two ways of dealing with CO2 emissions today. The first one is not emitting them in the first place: We can do so by reducing our consumption, using current technologies more efficiently and shifting to low-carbon technologies. The other option, which comes in addition to the first one, is to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the air. We are very thankful for the long-term commitment of our investors, who shared our vision of a climate-positive world from the very beginning. This financing round will take Climeworks to the next level and help us make an ever-bigger contribution to reversing climate change. We aim to inspire one billion people to remove carbon dioxide from the air\u2014and this investment will contribute to achieve that goal Christoph Gebald, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Climeworks The technology Founded by engineers Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher, Climeworks is one of the global leaders in carbon dioxide removal. The company\u2019s patented technology captures CO2 directly from the air using clean energy. The air-captured carbon dioxide is then either returned to earth, stored safely and permanently away for millions of years, or it is upcycled into climate-friendly products such as carbon-neutral fuels and materials, fertiliser for greenhouses or bubbles in your fizzy drinks. The Climeworks direct air capture technology runs exclusively on clean energy, and the modular CO2 collectors can be stacked to build machines of any size. The successful financing round takes the Swiss company, which went through EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s Accelerator programme in 2012 and 2013, another step closer to achieving its vision of capturing one per cent of global CO2 emissions by 2025. This new round of funding brings the total sum invested in Climeworks since it was founded in 2009, to over CHF 120 million and will be used to expand Climeworks\u2019 carbon dioxide removal capacities, help to further scale and optimise the direct air capture technology and make it accessible to more stakeholders.", "eit561": "Eighty-nine start-ups from across Europe have been selected to take part in the annual EIT Health Headstart programme.

At bedtime, a person \u201cspoons\u201d with the device, which synchronises with the user\u2019s breathing and helps them achieve a steady rhythm, a technique that has been shown to encourage sleep. The device senses when a person wakes up and helps to regulate their breathing so that they fall back asleep again. Other sleep aids include sounds \u2013 the device can play white noise or tell bedtime stories \u2013 and control of temperature and light, to make sure the user does not oversleep. Users can change the settings with a smartphone-based app. The device has developed broad interest from the large group of people suffering from insomnia, and the start-up already has 4,500 customers. According to an announcement from Somnox, the investor HIP noted the value of sleep for strengthening our immune system, which is especially important during the current pandemic. EIT Health support Beginning in 2016, the year in which they launched their start-up, Somnox has been supported by several EIT Health Accelerator programmes, including: a 2016 Launch Lab, which allowed them to validate their product; the 2016 Business Plan Aggregator; Somnox won second place in the medtech category of this training and competition programme, which was the forerunner of the European Health Catapult; the 2018 Headstart grant programme. Somnox was also presented to the media through a 2017 EIT Health event for journalists held in Paris. Somnox was launched by a team at Delft University of Technology, an EIT Health Core Partner. Co-Founder Julian Jagtenberg said his effort to find a way to help his mother deal with insomnia led him to start a company that has proven successful.", "eit563": "EIT Climate-KIC, together with Edgeryders, ETH Zurich and IOTA, are orchestrating an initiative looking at innovative ways in which we can shift mindsets and behaviour to more long-term orientation. Under the Long-termism Deep Demonstration, we have dedicated an area of action to understanding how we can rethink notions of value. 2020 brought promises of a new decade of action, but it turned into a drastic respite from the pace of life. The world slowed down, and our way of life changed as a result of COVID-19. Health has become a priority and we are already seeing the effects of this pandemic affect our global and our local economy. Governments are now scrambling to balance lockdown with stimulus packages to curb the effects of the inevitable recession. We have rapidly changed the way we live, how we move, how we socialise and how we eat. What is emerging is a \u2018new normal\u2019\u2014a reevaluation of what society values. We might eventually need to \u201creassess the values that guide us in reorganising our society.\u201d Finding values in other forms We haven\u2019t built resilience in our system. Our current society is fed by short-term cycles of supply and demand, built on relatively young economic theories of Keynes, neoliberalism and growth paradigms. When the demand drops, our economy suffers. This fragility has only served to emphasise the importance of building a sustainable and resilient society\u2014one that can minimise the effects of covariate shocks, and also sustain its basic core after the shock has passed. Examples are already coming out of people finding value in other forms\u2014such as singing on balconies, acts of welfare such as helping with their shopping but also in the ultimate dilemmas of supporting life which have brought Italian doctors to tears. None of these could be measured in monetary costs and benefits. For years now, society has been mounting a reaction to achieve long-term safety in the face of climate upheaval. It\u2019s diverse and unevenly distributed. it grows at the edges of society: In ecovillages, local currencies, neo-municipality cities and so on. These experiments are so efficient they can survive in a short-term economy, while still taking care of the long-term Alberto Cottica \u2013 Edgeryders An essential need to rethink notions of value What\u2019s more, our investment in building resilience and sustainability into our system means that the benefits may not be realised now. Many of the investments needed for mitigating future impacts and shocks that climate change will bring, such as investments in infrastructure, energy and property, will require long-term orientation. Considering long-term impact is critical to unlocking resources today for climate action. Also we need an economic and financial system that can appropriately allocate the resources needed and unlock the financial flows for remedial and preventative climate action. So what is value? How is value attributed over time? And how do notions of value change over time? Money\u2014our basic currency for exchanging value\u2014has become the fundament for accumulation of wealth, which perpetuates cycles of short-term gain and returns. Value is the basis on which our current financial system has accumulated its wealth\u2014to release the needed capital to invest into climate action and sustainability, we must experiment with redefining notions of value by looking at new money paradigms and alternative value creation that can allow people to define, express and exchange what they value and therefore how we invest. Exploring ways to rethink notions of value Some examples of the positions we want to explore are looking at the role of the gift economy and inheritance, as well as how incentives can work over time. Our design partners are experimenting with or would like to experiment with ways to rethink notions of value: Edgeryders Edgeryders is working to extend the space of economic models that are conceivable and deployable. Conceivable: As Edgeryders puts it: \u201cIt is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism. But if we do not go beyond TINA (There Is No Alternative), we have to carry on business-as-usual. This will kill us all.\u201d Edgeryders therefore uses techniques from modelling, speculative fiction, economic history, anthropology and design to broaden the space of \u201cconceivable economies.\u201d Deployable: As argued above, there\u2019s already a \u201cmutant population\u201d of economic agents that operate in the current economy, while aspiring to a more long-termism one. Edgeryders learns from these agents, in order to come up with policies to thrive and grow further. ETH Zurich ETH Zurich supports mass experimentation in two directions: First, they enable independent incentive systems that allow and push for mass innovation for climate change mitigation. Such systems are bottom-up and democratic like regional currencies, and beyond that, allow entirely new incentive designs to cater to community needs for maintaining common-pool resources. Second, novel solutions like basic income, personal data markets, etc., are too urgently needed to leave to institutions to mull over for years. ETH Zurich\u2019s technology allows communities to experiment with these new schemes for real, today. These communities should not need to wait for permission by governments or banks to help themselves if they can. In the spirit of open source development, ETH Zurich wants competition in such projects and in the underlying financial systems powering them. IOTA The generation of value is rooted in networks of trust and shared definitions of value. Today\u2019s economy is characterised by globally distributed, centralised networks that work towards a unidimensional objective: Maximising shareholder value. Together with financialisation and increasing automation, this leads to externalities, inequalities and fragile societies. The opensource IOTA protocol aims to remove friction in the transaction of value and information between diverse actors by creating digital trust. Together with ETI Climate-KIC, the IOTA Foundation is exploring how convergent technologies such as the Internet of Things and Distributed Ledgers can empower people with a permission less infrastructure to engage in peer-to-peer economies to collaborate on creating value in their communities and in harmony with the natural systems they inhabit. Decentralised networks of trust and information will be the backbone of a long-term sustainable, resilient economy based on pluralistic notions of value. A systemic and innovative approach Clearly, if we want to radically change our financial systems, we still have a long way to go. Through our systematic and innovative approach within Deep Demonstration Long-termism, we look at a wide range of challenges and possible solutions. We give our community and other interested parties the space and resources to test and scale up these solutions. Examples of what we focus on with this Deep Demonstration are: Setting up an online platform as a marketplace for alternative financial systems Making financial systems more understandable and transparent Providing insight into the impact of the investments, including the impact on the climate Financial experimentation with trees as a new concept of value (intrinsic and aesthetic) and self-ownership Testing innovative ways of financing and valuing social goods such as land, buildings, air, water, trees, data, sewerage and roads While many humans insist democratic principles are best suited to govern collectives, the design of our money system is blatantly undemocratic. Instead of a mono-dimensional, monopolistic system of money, we need to consider multi-dimensional incentives to create more robust financial systems and we need decentralised communities rather than monopolies to create and distribute currencies. Above all, the new system needs sustainability to be baked into its core design by removing externalities as much as possible Marcus Dapp \u2013 ETHZ University Would you like to be part of this innovative community? We\u2019d like to get in touch with parties from Europe and beyond who want to innovate with us. Would you like to receive more information about the possibilities? Please email us About the Deep Demonstration Long-termism The Deep Demonstration Long-termism focuses on changing mindsets and devising ways to stimulate long-term thinking. Only this way will we achieve sustainable behaviour, and make impactful investments in sustainability possible. Using a proprietary methodology, we design various systematic interventions within entire ecosystems. It has been proven this methodology leads to actual climate, economic and social impact. Together with a consortium of expert partners, this Deep Demonstration focuses on five areas: Exploring new types of governance and rule setting to redesign institutional structures Empowering individuals in decision making through data transparency and capability building Harnessing the power of collective movements to democratise rulemaking Working with social and cultural narratives through exploring alternative concepts of time Redefining notions of value using frontier technological prototypes The focus of the work up until now has been designing for interventions that can incentivise behavioural and mindset change throughout society, deliberately widening the lens from the financial sector after a key realisation that such systemic impact can only be realised through a holistic and systemic approach within our social systems, as short-termism is essentially rooted in concepts of human identity, sensory capacity, language and power structures, and institutions.

EIT Health has launched a new framework for achieving Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) to improve patient outcomes and reduce waste of healthcare resources. Designed with insights from established pioneers in the field and laid out in a practical handbook, the framework describes key steps healthcare providers can take to fully realise the opportunity presented by VBHC. Unlike traditional volume-based healthcare provision, modelled on fees for-products or services, VBHC provides a methodology for measurable healthcare outcomes that make the biggest difference to patients, while driving cost efficiencies within health services. The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimate that around 30% of resources currently spent on healthcare are wasted on avoidable complications, unnecessary treatments or administrative inefficiencies. Tackling this waste head on, the publication from EIT Health aims to kick-start change towards measurable value, in order to support more sustainable models for healthcare. The new EIT Health publication \u201cImplementing Value-Based Health Care: Handbook for Pioneers\u201d, includes an \u201cImplementation Matrix\u201d with a clear and structured framework for healthcare providers to follow. The Matrix details five key steps to help healthcare providers activate and accelerate VBHC: 1) recording; 2) comparing; 3) rewarding; 4) improving; and 5) partnering. It outlines how to measure and maximise the outcomes that matter to patients, and addresses the main challenges, such as lack of standardised outcome data and resistance to change. Read the handbook Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health, explains the need for this work: \u201cIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in VBHC in the health community in Europe; however the focus has been on why it is the way forward, rather than how we effectively implement such a change. This is why we created this framework, to provide an in-depth guide on how health care managers and practitioners can orient efforts and resources towards necessary transformation. Currently, many of Europe\u2019s health care systems measure the wrong things, which can lead to inefficiencies in cost, time and resources, not to mention the impact on the patient. Metrics focus on volume rather than patient outcomes, and this is simply unsustainable for health care systems. At EIT Health, we are uniquely placed to connect successful pioneers in the field with those just starting out, and to share tools and best practices to help measure outcomes to drive this cultural shift within Europe\u2019s health care systems.\u201d Esteemed experts engaged by EIT Health Think Tank Development of this EIT Health handbook has been directed by Professor Gregory Katz of the University Paris School of Medicine and achieved in collaboration with esteemed experts from across leading European organisations. The new framework is based on several VBHC case studies from some of Europe\u2019s leading healthcare providers, including: Uppsala Academic Hospital, which reduced the number of unnecessary ambulance dispatches by 17%; Basel University Hospital, which improved the median time from stoke symptom to treatment onset by 14%; and NHS Wales, which identified that in 19% of cases, high-cost cataract surgery had no real impact on a patient\u2019s activity limitations in daily life. According to Professor Gregory Katz: \u201cToday in Europe, VBHC pioneers are choosing to take bold action to measure, compare and improve patient outcomes. This momentum is mainly building from the bottom up, through entrepreneurial initiatives. As care results vary tremendously between therapeutic approaches and medical teams, transparent outcome benchmarks enable the detection of medical innovations and the reduction of inappropriate care. There are good reasons to be impatient for improving health care through VBHC, but there are also reasons to be humble. VBHC is still in its infancy, and successful implementation takes time. Becoming a VBHC early adopter opens the opportunity to learn proactively and spearhead high-value care.\u201d The handbook was commissioned by EIT Health under its Think Tank thought leadership forum, which explores the most pressing topics for the health of Europe and its citizens. The EIT Health Think Tank brings healthcare leaders together, across disciplines and borders, to prepare the ground for life-changing innovation and identify the next opportunity for a transformation in how healthcare is delivered. The launch of the handbook marks the first in a series of activities being launched by EIT Health that are designed to support a step-change in the provision of healthcare and to integrate VBHC as the new norm across Europe.

All of us who have grandparents or elderly relatives have had some experience with pressure ulcers - a medical condition caused by long-term bed rest. In truth, it is a health problem that could be avoided, according to Mohammad Amini. And he does not just talk about it but leads a team that has invented a product to predict the risks. \u201cBoth my grandparents died while suffering from pressure ulcers,\u201d says Mohammad Amini, the Team Leader of SensoMatt. That was the point when he first started thinking about a solution. Since pressure ulcers affect not just the elderly, but also disabled people and other patients lying in hospitals, it is a common medical problem that needs treatment. \"My grandparents were old, but the pressure ulcer phenomena and the pain caused by the wounds made me think about why there is no reliable solution to alert and forecast,\" he says. Last year, Amini and his uncle started to develop their solution. It contains hardware and an AI-based structure for prediction. \"After I talked with a friend of mine about AI development, we started to produce our MVP [minimum viable product], and then enrolled in the EIT Digital Venture Program due to a friend\u2019s recommendation.\u201d From idea stage to market access and customer acquisition The scope of EIT Digital's Venture Program is nothing other than helping ideas like SensoMatt\u2019s reach markets and customers. The team had the first ideas and a basic prototype in 2019. Then, with the help of EIT Digital and its partners' experience, they found a way to grow. With their help, they are taking the invention to the areas of use: hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. SensoMatt is a multiplatform solution. It contains a thin smart sheet, that can be placed under any kind of mattress, and an AI-driven cloud system processing all earned data. The sensors in the sheet track the real-time pressure distribution. The AI-based algorithm analyses this data and pressure ulcers can be detected or predicted. During the EIT Digital Venture Program, Amini and his team developed a unique, affordable and reliable device that is suitable to use not just in hospitals but also in homecare. The company is in negotiations with Portuguese and Belgian medical centres. CHwapi, the Belgian medical centre, is one of the investors in SensoMatt, having provided \u20ac100,000. Even if the motivation behind the development process is a heart-breaking life event for Amini, many people could benefit from this device. SensoMatt helps protect against and predict a painful and dangerous medical condition in a way we have never seen before.", "eit573": "European fast-growing startups in digital technologies are invited to take part in the 2020 edition of the flagship competition to win international growth support.

Click here for more information and to apply for the 2020 edition. Being hospitalised with a serious illness is hard for everyone, but for a child it is even more shocking. Knowing the treatment plans in place and familiarising oneself with the medical world can help to reduce anxiety. To make this process easier, Serious Games for Health gamifies the learning and curing paths for children. Blood collection, chemotherapy, and physiotherapy are just some of the frightening medical procedures that can affect a child. Just as it does for adults, a serious illness makes them fearful and the lack of information can cause anxiety. Serious Games for Health intends to be a new strategy to enhance therapeutic adherence and health literacy. The focus is on decreasing hospitalisation rates by increasing physical activity and decreasing anxiety among people struggling with specific diseases Hern\u00e2ni Z\u00e3o Oliveira, founder of Serious Games for Health \u201cOur solution transforms the way we deal with sickness and treatment through engaging, interactive and easy-to-use methods,\u201d says Zao. The games he develops address topics like therapeutic adherence, fear of hospitalisation or specific treatments, and reducing anxiety related to illnesses. Additionally, there is a focus on education, as teaching patients about their medical conditions is crucial. Making treatment less intimidating Converting a treatment plan into a course of games makes the process more fun and less intimidating. The prototype was made for paediatric oncology, and after several tests and plenty of interviews with doctors, nurses and parents, the results are trustworthy. Patients recorded lowered anxiety levels in the examined children at a Portuguese hospital. They got new information from the game about their illness and it made them more comfortable during the treatments and medical tests. Based on these promising results, Zao is planning more as well as different games for several other medical issues. Since playing these games does not require any special equipment, just a smartphone or a tablet, they can be applied as part of the medical routine. Although the first use case was about treatment of an illness, the developer says that prevention is important too. Thus, one of the main applications is to provide education about different medical conditions. Targeting the healthcare gamification market With the help of EIT Digital\u2019s Venture Program, Zao finished the test period and recorded informative interviews, while building up connections with Portuguese medical institutes and universities. In the fast-growing healthcare gamification market, Serious Games targets serious and exercise game categories for therapeutic and educational purposes. The startup aims to reach patients, caregivers, hospitals, healthcare centres, and some health tech companies and large pharmaceutical companies. With a strong base built up by the first project, HOPE, and several rewards like Astellas Oncology C3 Prize or Portuguese National Participatory Budgeting, Serious Games looks more than promising, and shows great potential for investors.

More and more cities are declaring climate emergencies, many countries have incorporated climate targets into their policies, and public pressure on governments is mounting. To meet the scale and urgency of the climate emergency, business-as-usual in government won\u2019t suffice. The IPCC report, which sets out what we need to do to keep global warming under 1.5\u00b0C by the end of century, has made it clear that we no longer have the luxury of time\u2014change must happen now, across multiple sectors, and governments must adapt too. This climate challenge demands that we rethink the institutions, norms, beliefs and values that underpin our current governance structures and approach to policymaking. Rather than continuing to place our hopes in incremental improvements to the work done by governments and public authorities, we need to foster a rich culture of innovation and experimentation within government. And we need to work with communities to bring them along on the journey. To stand a chance of responding to climate change, policymaking must become innovative, inclusive, radical\u2014transformative. Deep change How can we make this happen? Over the past year, I\u2019ve been part of a team at EIT Climate-KIC, Europe\u2019s largest climate innovation agency, that has been addressing this question. Funded by the EU, EIT Climate-KIC is pioneering the fast action needed to keep climate change under 1.5\u00b0C. We believe that multiple systems need to change simultaneously if we are to achieve a just, climate resilient society founded on a net zero-carbon, circular economy, and we have set up testbeds to put this into practice. Our Deep Demonstrations are just that: Eight large-scale pan-European initiatives made up of a coordinated portfolio of projects designed to trigger systems change. These initiatives\u2014from Just Transformations to Resilient Regions and Long-termism\u2014follow our systems innovation methodology, in which we collaborate with design partners on ambitious systems-level challenges that are identified by \u201cchallenge owners\u201d such as city mayors, regional leaders, government ministers, citizen leaders and CEOs of major companies. While most of the Deep Demonstrations are in the early stages, the work we have done with Slovenia shows what we can accomplish. The Slovenian government has embraced the radical, holistic approach that underpins our Deep Demonstrations, and their parliament has passed a motion adopting our proposal to become a fully circular economy. This collaboration is a part of our overall vision for the Deep Demonstration model\u2014to trigger rapid decarbonisation and enhanced resilience across Europe. Policy and governance innovations are a crucial component of the Deep Demonstrations. Collaborating alongside cities, regions and national governments that are interested in experimenting with a variety of innovative policy and governance approaches, we are moving from ideation to implementation. In preparation for designing these experiments, we have actively sought those at the coalface of policy and governance innovation for the climate challenge. Over the last year, we spent time in conversation with a diverse group of practitioners, including a forward-looking UK city councillor, a young political activist working within a progressive US think tank, a leader from the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change, several European academics, a pioneer of regulatory sandboxes in a national regulator and a policy expert involved in citizens\u2019 assemblies. We wanted to find out how they define policy and governance innovation\u2014what is it, and what is it not? Are there barriers to success and, conversely, are there key characteristics of a transformative climate policy innovation? Several themes emerged from the interviews, and drawn together here they outline the features of a successful policy innovation initiative. Community needs\u2014driving transformative policy Every single person we interviewed told us that it is essential to centre the needs of the whole community (and not just the most politically engaged sections) when developing policy experiments. The negative effects of climate change will be greatest amongst the most vulnerable, and low-income populations, young people, immigrants (and others) in our communities may be overlooked during policy design. Interviewees spoke about the richness that comes from welcoming new opinions and collective intelligence to the process, and they emphasised how much governments can benefit from this cross-pollination. By starting from a place of \u201cdoing with\u201d the community, rather than \u201cdoing to\u201d them, real and lasting transformative changes\u2014with representation at the heart\u2014are possible. Innovative approaches that foreground how policy is made require us to meet people where they are, creating a space for discourse and engagement in the rigour of the design process. The end result is that the policy output will be capable of facing the complexities of real life. Our conversations really underscored that bringing the community along the journey as holistically as possible is directly proportional to the success or failure of an initiative, so it is crucially important. The community focus also links to how innovative policy must respond to concrete problems with an approach that is deeply in sync with the cultural, historical and sociological context of the area. What can be considered an \u201cinnovative\u201d or simply an effective policy will vary from place to place, so a rich understanding of this background is needed before you even begin designing policies. And although cities and regions do often take inspiration and learn from each other, adapting and spreading successful solutions, the solutions that stick are those that address a community\u2019s real challenges rather than just chasing a trend. Changing minds through storytelling In a time of increasing disillusionment with government, and facing a need for transformation on an unprecedented scale, it is incredibly important to bring the public along on the policy-making process and to give them reasons to be involved. Their input must serve a purpose and carry weight. New approaches to policy, if done well, can empower communities, giving citizens concrete experiences of catalysing change and demonstrating that policy can work for them and that their voices can make a difference. I was inspired by this article about the UK citizens\u2019 assembly on climate, as it shows how ordinary people\u2014many who weren\u2019t originally interested in climate change\u2014were drawn into the discussion, given tools to understand the science, and were then able to construct robust recommendations that will be fed back to government. Several interviewees pointed to narrative building and storytelling as a crucial component in fostering changes in behaviour and mindset, helping people to imagine what is possible. It\u2019s also a powerful way to work through the various barriers to successful policies. For example, it can be used to foster community interest and engagement, pulling in a rich variety of actors. It could also help to build political will. This is especially important for a complex, \u201cwicked\u201d problem like climate change, where people may feel completely powerless to create change. Sweden\u2019s Viable Cities program, which helps Swedish cities become carbon neutral by 2030, has even hired a chief storyteller to build a compelling narrative around the project and to connect people to the reality of climate change on an emotional level. According to chief storyteller Per Grankvist, \u201cto reach the program\u2019s mission, storytelling is believed to be a key to get people engaged enough to change their behaviour and norms.\u201d Co-design is central to the endeavour, with stories from citizens, public servants and other stakeholders layering to create a comprehensive framework for understanding the various perspectives, needs and concerns from the groups, thus creating a foundation to engage people further. The barriers we need to overcome One central learning that emerged through the course of our explorations was that, if we are to create a space for policy innovation and experimentation to flourish, it is vital to innovate around governance processes and structures themselves. While it might be possible to experiment with new policies within a traditional bureaucratic and political structure, chances are it will be a struggle. The Vancouver EcoDensity program, launched in 2006, is an example of this. It aimed to increase density in low/medium dense urban areas along transport corridors in order to reduce urban sprawl and make the area more liveable, green and efficient, but the program\u2019s traditional governance model and inability to respond to extensive public concerns seriously impeded the success of its original vision. So there is an exciting piece of work to be done around building new skills and mindsets in the public sector, fostering cross-governmental collaboration, new ways of including citizens and stakeholders in policy design processes, and new policy co-development, experimentation and implementation mechanisms. Looking at current governance set-ups, our interviewees highlighted the following problems: Siloed working and lack of collaboration between government departments, discouraging a systemic approach The tendency to focus on optimising current policy, rather than tackling underlying problems Focus on short-term benefits, often due to political cycles and the government\u2019s mandate for the use of public resources. The latter also leads to risk aversion Technocratic approaches to policy-making, ignoring systemic problems and solutions, and lacking expertise on behavioural solutions Potential aversion to innovative techniques due to disruption of current norms. For example, citizens\u2019 assemblies or other radical community engagement approaches may be perceived as impinging on the rights and duties of elected officials, who have taken on a responsibility to carry out public will and can have concerns about undermining this role Public sector innovation has of course been widely discussed in recent years, and Apolitical has some great pieces that delve into actions and solutions. I also enjoyed the ideas in this article about building internal cultures within government departments to foster innovative thinking and comfort with experimentation. It isn\u2019t an easy thing to solve for, but as Steven Stone, chief of UN Environment\u2019s Resources & Markets Branch, points out, openness and curiosity can be such a powerful driver of change. Talk to peers and colleagues\u2014find out if others are curious about working differently and start to build a community to champion the change you want to see. The effects of climate change cut across specialisations and sectors, and bringing people with varied backgrounds and expertise together can surface surprising new ideas to test. EIT Climate-KIC would really love to hear about your experiences from the innovative policy and governance space, especially if you\u2019ve been addressing the climate challenge. We invite you to join us on our Deep Demonstration journey\u2014do get in touch if your organisation would be interested in collaborating!

The funding will be used to scale TWAICE software and power internationalisation efforts to contribute to the availability of sustainable mobility and energy solutions. Get the best of the EIT\u2019s news once each month Top battery analytics software In just under two years, TWAICE has grown from a university research project into the top battery analytics software, attracting a diverse and global customer base, and investments. Cherry Ventures, UVC Partners and Speedinvest already invested EUR 3.2 million as part of an earlier seed round. We are very happy to have Creandum, an internationally recognised investor, onboard now. They share our vision of an analytics platform for e-mobility and renewable energies. Michael Baumann, Managing Director and Co-Founder of TWAICE TWAICE\u2019s software creates a unique 'digital twin' of battery systems. It can be used to make precise analyses and predictions about the \u2018health\u2019 of each energy storage device. By using field data in combination with physical and data-driven battery models, TWAICE closes the loop between product development and application. But, even more so, the software also allows for new opportunities such as predictive maintenance and warranty extension. Operational failures can be detected\u2014and prevented\u2014in real time. TWAICE' success The trend towards more comprehensive electrical strategies by major mobility and energy players is driving TWAICE\u2019s success. Due to increasing pollution regulation, manufacturers have put greater emphasis on developing electric, emissions-free vehicles and, as a result, efficient batteries. The increasing popularity of lithium-ion batteries on the energy market is also accelerating the Munich-based company. Stationary storage units for example are used to avoid increased grid fees or to stabilise the grid. However, due to their cost and complexity, batteries are especially challenging regarding significant test scopes during development, a lack of transparency about their condition, and remaining lifetime during operation. The market is rewarding us for our mission to build the leading global team for battery analysis. Dr. Stephan Rohr, Managing Director and Co-Founder of TWAICE In recent years, the company has established itself as the market leader for battery analytics and has won leading customers from the automotive industry to truck manufacturers and power tool suppliers. The combination of in-depth battery knowledge, a scalable cloud platform, and machine learning is unique. With rapidly rising electrification in the mobility and energy sector, the battery market is at an inflection point. TWAICE predictive analytics solution unlocks a tremendous amount of value along the full battery lifecycle. We were impressed by the deep battery expertise of the team, the sophistication of their analytics platform and rapidly growing customer demand. We\u2019re thrilled to support the team along their journey to further scale and expand to new markets. Peter Specht, Principal at Creandum The customer portfolio of TWAICE mainly consists of two sectors: energy and mobility. Energy companies use the software primarily for stationary energy storage systems. In the mobility sector, TWAICE enables manufacturers and fleet operators to improve both the development and use of lithium-ion batteries as well as to extend the batteries\u2019 service life. The TWAICE software provides customers with more precise information about the processes taking place in the batteries during use. This way, operators of electric vehicle fleets, for example, can reduce their operating costs through predictive maintenance and achieve an increase in battery life of up to 25 per cent.", "eit580": "Unanimously elected by the EIT Governing Board as its next Chairperson, Gioia Ghezzi will succeed Dirk Jan van den Berg when his mandate ends on 30 June 2020.

However, it\u2019s not so easy to find meaningful training opportunities, with the possibility of hands-on experiences of the multiple activities taking place in an operating mine. Open education and research at Pyh\u00e4salmi mine The EIT RawMaterials-supported MINETRAIN project was launched in 2018 to evaluate the potential of the shortly-closing Pyh\u00e4salmi mine in Finland as an educational and training underground facility, and thus, prolong the utility of the existing modern mine site by introducing new business opportunities. One of the major objectives of the project is to produce and test practical training programmes for mining professionals at the Pyh\u00e4salmi mine. Pyh\u00e4salmi facilities enable training in all disciplines related to the overall mine value chain with the opportunity to test both skills and equipment in an authentic environment. Hence, the project has potential in providing education for sustainable management of any phase of mining operations. In summer 2019, MINETRAIN launched its first pilot course with 45 professionals from all over the globe joining an online course. Fourteen people were then selected for one-week practical training at the Pyh\u00e4salmi mine site in August 2019. The course was developed to cover topics across the whole lifecycle of a mine. The course received the highest possible evaluations from the professional learners. Professionals emphasised the significance that the practical onsite training had for them. MINETRAIN gave meaning to the theory and improved the understanding of the bigger picture of mining at the various phases of the mine life. It was a great experience to learn different ways of doing mining and know more about the latest technology related to the care of the environment. At the same time thinking of networking, it was really helpful to meet miners from all around the world. The next MINETRAIN course will focus on new mining technology and will be held in summer 2020. After an online module, professionals will be able to use the latest equipment at Sandvik test mine in Tampere, Finland. MINETRAIN is a three-year project funded by EIT RawMaterials. The coordinator of the project is Oulu Mining School/the University of Oulu and TU Freiberg and partners are Pyh\u00e4salmi Mine, Outotec, Sandvik, Normet and Schneider Electric.

There is a complex value chain here, starting with the exploration, mining, processing and production of raw materials, all the way through to their being sold to consumers. There are human and automated processes, developed and developing countries, and a variety of tolerances working together here in the face of a whole host of ethical, environmental and social considerations. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials The decision-makers within industrial enterprises are obliged to verify the origins of the raw materials used for their products far more stringently. These days, the issue of sustainability can have a major influence on people\u2019s decisions to buy products. Governments and communities are setting legal parameters. NGOs are taking a critical look at the countries of origin and at the supply chain as a whole. The modern-day consumer gives consideration to product origins and environmental aspects not only when it comes to food, but also increasingly with regard to clothing, electrical goods and the entire area of mobility. This is prompting companies to take a stance and to review their ethical, environmental and sustainable footprint. Get the best of the EIT\u2019s news once each month Standards which are not standard In the past, this was left to the individual market players to address themselves \u2013 each and every exploration or mining company, every mineral processor, every shipping company, every manufacturer or service provider had to monitor their own internal or external standards. And they had to do so in a range of areas such as corruption, environmental impacts, labour conditions, child labour, social issues and corporate governance. The result which has evolved over time is an inefficient, inconsistent and fragmented landscape of raw material certification standards in which sustainability is defined differently from country to country, from mineral to mineral and from organisation to organisation. This hampers transparency within the supply chain and the verifiability of the parameters at a time when sustainability is evolving from being a cost factor to being an investment that is crucial to success. This was the starting point for the CERA innovation project. CERA: the guarantee of origin for raw materials In terms of tonnage, around three quarters of all imports to the European Union are raw materials, the majority of which come from developing countries. We in Europe and in Germany therefore bear a particular responsibility for the conditions under which raw materials are mined. It\u2019s all about observing standards, verifying the legality of mining and safeguarding investments, and about operational reliability and environmental impacts. A first step was taken in this regard with the adoption of the EU Regulation on conflict resources. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials According to Dr Klossek, a great deal more will be achieved with CERA. He added that it will be possible for the origins of raw materials to be unequivocally proven with the aid of a standardised analytical and comprehensive certification system which guarantees the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the exploration, mining, processing, trading and production of all mineral raw materials. Guarantees based on audit processes which can be scrutinised externally and covering the entire value chain \u2013 much like \u201cwell to wheel\u201d considerations for the environmental footprints of fuels, we need a 'mine to product' consideration of raw materials. The Certification of raw materials (CERA) Innovate, incubate, accelerate EIT RawMaterials is co-financing the development of the CERA standard and is supporting the introduction of the network to the mining community and to all other raw material-related sectors. It is also assuming three important roles. As an innovator, we are actively supporting technological developments that will help us achieve our goals, such as \u201cfingerprinting\u201d based on the analysis of trace elements and the use of blockchain software to verifiably track trade and transport routes. As an incubator, we are ensuring that such technologies make it to market maturity. We promote young companies, offer networking between researchers and businesses, and see to it that innovations are embraced sooner. Because it is a lot easier for us as a large network to achieve what an individual company, university or research institution is perhaps not able to. Dr Andreas Klossek, Managing Director of EIT RawMaterials DMT as an initiator and the CERA partners One of the CERA partners is one of its initiators DMT, which has close to 300 years of experience in the area of raw materials. Another is T\u00dcV NORD CERT, which has great expertise regarding the existing certification and auditing systems. In turn, these two companies collaborate with the mining university Montanuniversit\u00e4t Leoben in Austria, the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands and the independent non-profit research centre RISE SICS in Sweden, as well as with companies such as LTU Business AB, likewise based in Sweden. The partners on the Advisory Board such as Fairphone and Volkswagen AG are, of course, just as important, as they ultimately represent the customer side of raw materials trading.", "eit583": "Report investigates how to unlock the potential of AI in healthcare A new report from EIT Health and McKinsey & Company exposes an urgent need to attract, educate and train a generation of data-literate healthcare professionals, and to up-skill the current workforce in order to fully realise the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 'Transforming healthcare with AI: The impact on the workforce and organisations', a Europe-wide report published on 03 March 2020 explores the impact of AI on healthcare practitioners, as well as the implications and obstacles for scaling AI in healthcare organisations and systems. The report includes a survey of 175 people on the frontline of healthcare delivery, and interviews with 62 decision-makers, and is complemented by macroeconomic analyses from the work of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). Subscribe now to the EIT\u2019s monthly newsletter Along with exploring the effect AI will have on the future of European healthcare and its workforce, the report highlights the need to define new organisational models and skillsets that healthcare professionals will need to support the adoption and scaling of AI. It also outlines the new types of talent that the healthcare sector will need to attract. The report finds that basic digital skills, biomedical and data science, data analysis, and the fundamentals of genomics will be critical, if AI and machine learning is to penetrate healthcare services. These subjects are rarely taught alongside traditional clinical sciences systematically. And so, through no fault of their own, today\u2019s healthcare workforce is simply not yet equipped for the adoption of AI. Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, Director of Innovation at EIT Health Download the EIT's AI report A need for change The incentives for healthcare systems to embrace these changes are clear. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that by 2030 the world will be short of 9.9 million doctors, nurses and midwives, which adds further urgency to address the challenge of already overburdened health systems. Supporting the widespread adoption and scaling of AI could help alleviate resource capacity shortfalls both now and in the future, for example, by streamlining or even eliminating administrative tasks, which can occupy anything between 20 and 80 percent of a healthcare professional\u2019s time, according to the WHO. Being at the forefront of healthcare innovation in Europe, we are seeing an increasing number of tangible, impactful and exciting AI solutions created. However, we must couple the generation of new technology that can relieve some of the pressure on healthcare services, with the ability for it to be integrated into care delivery. Now is the time for us to address the gaps, so that Europe does not fall behind in the application of AI. Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, Director of Innovation at EIT Health Besides upskilling, better involvement of healthcare professionals in the early stages of AI development was also identified in the report as a key need. Of the healthcare stakeholders interviewed for the report, 44% said they had never been involved in the development or deployment of an AI solution. AI has enormous potential to improve productivity and efficiency in health systems and make them more sustainable \u2013 but more importantly, it has the potential to deliver better health outcomes for patients. It can do so in many ways, from enabling more preventive care, to allowing healthcare practitioners to spend more time on direct patient care. This joint report provides guidance for decision-makers to define their level of aspiration on AI and develop and implement the right approach for their organisation or health system. Dr. Angela Spatharou, Partner at McKinsey & Company Decision-makers interviewed for the report emphasised the need to develop scaling up training and suggested that national health systems should work together with healthcare professionals, academia and industry in order to support healthcare providers, in particular those who are not large enough to deliver such programmes alone. They also emphasised the importance of ensuring AI is ethical, transparent and trustworthy. This new report provides a unique view on the state-of-play and prospects of AI for healthcare in Europe, covering areas including: strengthening data quality, governance, security and interoperability, implementing a robust change management strategy, addressing issues around regulation, policy-making and liability, redefining funding and reimbursement models and criteria for investment, and designing how disciplines can work better together to improve quality.

Gatling is the creator of a hugely successful open-source load testing solution - also available in a proprietary Enterprise version - that has been downloaded more than 5 000 000 times in 120 countries so far. Peak load conditions, taking place when multiple users are accessing a website application concurrently, can be a nightmare for IT departments: crashes and slowdowns in these situations, are far too common and even a limited 2-hour crash can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost revenues. Typically, such issues are linked to a new product release, breaking news or a sales opening which causes a significant and sudden increase in traffic. A resilient and scalable system, in these circumstances, can make all the difference between failure and success. Some successful companies have measured the exact impact of performances on their business: Amazon estimates that only 100 ms latency equals -1% in sales, whereas the BBC saw a 10% decrease in users because of a 1-second latency. Gatling\u2019s load-test-as-code approach and its interoperability make it possible to perform load tests very early in the development lifecycle and to automate them. Moreover, Gatling promotes a collaborative approach of load testing within organizations, involving all their departments, from IT to Marketing. Today, everyone talks about scalability. But you can\u2019t scale your business if your app is not scalable. Don\u2019t let your app become a victim of its own success: test it! Paul-Henri Pillet, Gatling co-founder and CEO Gatling brought major changes in the load testing industry since it was created in mid-2015. Today, it has customers on 5 continents and doubles its revenues each year. 'Gatling has an impressive proposition: a superior technology bundled with a disruptive approach. They are enabling developers to test as they code, making it suddenly possible to fit with Agile and Continuous Delivery models which are so critical for those websites and apps facing massive numbers of visitors such as e-retail, media and banks,' said EIT Digital\u2019s business developer Gilles Allain. The scaleup\u2019s R&D efforts target the latest trends in the tech world, including HTTP/2 support, load tests for Internet of Things, integrations with most of the cloud providers of the market (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack-based providers), integrations with Kubernetes and with most of the developers\u2019 tools (source repositories, build tools, continuous integration solutions). 'We have become the reference solution for load testing, thanks to our investments in R&D over the years.

Collected data were used to develop cost-effective water treatment and metals recovery methods. The upcoming months will bring new challenges, as the first pilot campaign on Ni & Co recovery is on its way. Enhancing eco-efficient use of natural resources The need for raw materials, especially Rare Earth Elements (REE), is increasing rapidly in the EU and globally. At the same time, the amount of extractive waste is increasing drastically together with concerns related to the environmental effects of mining. The mining industry can achieve more eco-efficient and selective raw material production by enhancing the utilisation of side streams and mine waste. Subscribe now to the EIT's monthly newsletter Innovation project Morecovery aims to enhance the eco-efficient and sustainable use of natural resources creating a modular recovery process service package for hydrometallurgy and water treatment. The project will demonstrate that the modular pilot plant with selective metal recovery processes will work on a larger scale at target sites. Also, the organic adsorbents will be tested for efficient applications in semi-passive drainage water treatment and REE and base metal recovery. After this project, the water treatment pilot plant will be upscaled and proved to work in larger-scale process and adsorbent testing at hydrometallurgical process sites, widening significantly the current business opportunities. Organic adsorbents, e.g. biochars will be proved to be efficient in large scale hydrometallurgical processes and mine waste drainage treatment, becoming a useful part of the side stream utilisation and circular economy. The metal recovery processes at target sites will be enhanced in critical raw materials recovery. The modular recovery process service package including lab-scale services and a mobile pilot plant will be a powerful tool in developing utilisation and cleaning of mining side streams.

In the Digital Cities focus area, one of the key targets is increasing the feeling of safety and security of citizens. A pilot which was conducted in Helsinki at the end of last year has shown how this can be achieved. HexaLight, an IoT based lighting system designed to create an illuminated path for better navigation and wayfinding, was tested in the Hyv\u00e4ntoivonpuisto park of the J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari neighbourhood in November 2019, the darkest time of the year in Helsinki. Subscribe now to the EIT newsletter The system was developed in the context of the Get Home Safely innovation activity, led by Technical University Berlin\u2019s CyPhyLab and including Forum Virium Helsinki, Aalto University, Fraunhofer HHI, Telecom Italy and Fluxedo as project partners. With HexaLight, the lights act as navigation devices which brighten or change colour as the pedestrian approach them: this increases the feeling of safety in dark areas, which generally people perceive as potentially more dangerous. The knee-high lights are also designed to be cosy and visually appealing, making the district more atmospheric and improving the overall pleasantness of the area. The project has been piloted in Helsinki, Berlin and Matera. The Hyv\u00e4ntoivonpuisto location in Helsinki was selected based on responses to a survey and workshop conducted among the district\u2019s residents in the spring. The lights were meant to be networked and personalised at the same time: during the test period, in fact, residents were able to download the Sk\u00fdra mobile application to their phones to change the colour of the park lights to fit their preferences. The results were positive. The lights delighted and created a sense of security. Heidi Heinonen, Project Manager at Forum Virium In addition to making people feel safer, the system could be leveraged by other stakeholders. Through the system, facility operators and security agencies, for instance, could gain in-depth insights of movement patterns in specific areas, especially in the evenings and at night.

Subscribe now to the EIT's monthly newsletter Flooding and water scarcity in Europe will increase in the coming decades if the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change are not met. Several studies, including a Joint Research Centre study released in 2018, have looked at the impact of the changing climate, land use and water usage on Europe\u2019s water resources. It is known that Southern European countries \u2013 particularly Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Turkey \u2013 are projected to face increased water shortages. Significant reductions in groundwater recharge are estimated for Spain, Portugal and Greece, with negative impacts on the environment and water availability for irrigation. Increasing droughts will lead to water scarcity and reduced hydropower potential in the Mediterranean region. This is likely to have a knock-on effect in agriculture, energy, transport and food security. With global freshwater consumption on the increase, European economies are being asked to tackle water scarcity by boosting resilient infrastructure, moving towards more circular economics and by enabling multi-stakeholders governance, as these will determine the competitiveness of the European water industry. Therefore, water plays a central role in how societies mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. A holistic approach considering water, the biosphere and the anthroposphere is required to provide sustainable agricultural and economic systems that will allow EIT Community to decelerate climate change, protect us from extreme weather events, and adapt to the unavoidable at the same time. In 2020, the Knowledge and Innovation Communities will be establishing a group of experts on water scarcity in Southern Europe, delivering focused entrepreneur challenge labs for start-ups and organising the EIT Water Academy for water scarcity challenge education. The Knowledge and Innovation Communities will also be running the EIT workshops with public bodies and other stakeholders across different regions and communication activities to reach out to citizens and interested stakeholders, engaging in external events and with the media to raise awareness about water scarcity for citizens. In the upcoming weeks, EIT Community will be looking for experts including not only researchers but also policy-makers, representatives of NGOs, wider civil society organisations and private industry in who can provide valuable contributions to the multi-stakeholders perspective that we need to tackle these societal challenges. A call for experts will be launched soon \u2013 stay tuned! EIT Regional Innovation Scheme Although EIT Community shares one continent, European countries are divided because of disparities in innovation performance. This has resulted in the classification of European countries in two main groups\u2014innovation leaders and strong innovators versus moderate and modest innovators. One reason for lower innovation performance is weak linkages among the key players\u2014businesses and research institutions and academia, as well as between the private and public sectors, including a systematic approach towards innovation. As a response to this challenge, the EIT RIS was introduced. The EIT RIS is designed for EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries in Europe who are modest and moderate innovators, and where Innovation Communities have few or no partners. Strategically, the Scheme is an additional offer to these countries to facilitate their engagement with the EIT Innovation Communities. The Scheme\u2019s aim is to facilitate the access to services and programmes offered by the EIT Innovation Communities. Each Innovation Community cooperates with local innovators \u2013 individuals such as students, researchers, entrepreneurs, and organisations such as SMEs, universities, research labs, regions, NGOs and cities.

What advice would you give to the undecided applicants who are looking for acceleration but are not sure which programme to choose? Those start-ups which are evaluating whether they should join an accelerator, and if so, which one to join, should ask themselves these questions: Is my product or service ready for commercialization? Do I have enough bandwidth in my team to productively participate in the programme? Who are the mentors in the accelerator programme? Do they represent the expertise and industry knowledge I need to actually advance my products? What are my specific customer acquisition goals in the next four months, and how can the Reactor help me achieve them faster? How can companies as GE Healthcare accelerate the CEE region together with the support of EIT Health? What does cooperation with EIT Health mean for you? The representatives from the partner Universities, GE Healthcare\u2019s organisational department and its Research and Development teams, independent experts and business coaches provide teams with holistic advice.

It is evident that EIT Community needs to reconsider how people produce, distribute, value and consume food. In particular, innovations in technology are forecasted to play an important role in transforming the food system and achieving global food security for future generations. Supporting entrepreneurs to develop transformative solutions for the food sector The EIT Food Seedbed programme supports technology and business-savvy agri-food entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and early-stage startups who are looking to validate their minimum viable product and test their assumptions through a unique customer journey discovery programme. Sign up now to the EIT newsletter Now open for 2020 applications, EIT Food Seedbed Programme is designed to address a number of key food system challenges that are urgently facing the global population by supporting state-of-the-art agri-food technologies across the entire food chain, from farm to fork. These technologies should have the potential to create productive, nutritious, safe, sustainable and transparent food systems which contribute towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and teams should have a minimum viable product that is demonstrable to customers. We\u2019re particularly interested in the strength and experience of teams that apply, what their motivations are and how prepared they are to be an entrepreneur. A diversity of kinds of people is always a strength, as is complementary skills and a history of working together successfully. On a practical level, applicants should not have received more than EUR 50 000 investment in relation to the development of their idea. The most promising areas for food system transformation As described, in order to achieve global food security for future generations, innovations in technology will play an important role in creating more trusted, sustainable, safe and profitable food systems and businesses. In particular, extensive data-enabled technologies are becoming more accessible and affordable - driving a revolution in how the food system operates, connecting stakeholders in the food chain and consumers in new and innovative ways to make the food chain more efficient and productive, reduce resource use and waste and open the door to new food chain collaborations and partnerships. Although not an exhaustive list, EIT Community encourages applications that fall within one of the following areas: Ag-tech including Animal Health & Livestock, Soil & Crop Tech, Crop Protection & Nutrition, Water Tech Smart Farming including Precision Agriculture and Indoor Agriculture Robotics & Automation Farm Management Software/ Sensing/IoT Biotechnology Innovative Food Technologies including alternative/novel ingredients, Sustainable Alternatives, Waste Technologies Sustainable Packaging Personalised nutrition and consumer engagement Big Data & Predictive Analytics The Seedbed team is especially excited by the solutions and rising levels of investment around food waste, as well as IoT and AI solutions for the agri-food sector - for instance, in solutions for smart farming. And on a broader note, it will be great to see how the diversity and inclusion initiatives that EIT Food is supporting in entrepreneurship are translated across the portfolio of programmes into stronger teams and groundbreaking innovations.

Yes 2. No 3. I\u2019m not sure Have you chosen your answer? Read the post to help you decide. Why do we trust farmers the most in the food industry? For most of us it is important that EIT Community can trust the food that people eat. EIT Community wants to know that the food is healthy, is produced sustainably and is safe for the consumption. However, a recent FoodThink study has found that almost half of consumers who frequently buy food for their households do not trust the food industry to do the right thing, and nearly a quarter actively distrust it. Sign up now to the EIT newsletter However, the food industry is made up of many key players, so who are they whom consumers trust? EIT Food\u2019s TrustTracker recently asked 11 000 consumers across 13 European countries to rate their levels of trust in farmers, food manufacturers, retailers and authorities. They found that: Farmers were voted the most trusted players in the food industry because they listen to the public and are somewhat open and honest Food manufacturers and authorities are less trusted because the perception is that they do not always listen to consumers and are not open nor honest about food production Food retailers and food manufacturers need to be more transparent and overall farmers and food manufacturers are doing a good job As such, it is evident that consumers have different levels of trust for different actors within the food industry. While the industry has a long way to go to overcome low consumer trust, projects like the EIT Food TrustTracker are giving consumers a voice to express their views and concerns. EIT Food TrustTracker Strengths and weaknesses of food system: consumers have their say When buying food many people consider different things. For example, many of us think about how healthy the product is, how much it costs, where it was produced, and how fresh it is, among many other factors. EIT Food asked consumers across Europe whether they trust the food industry to meet their needs. Watch the video to hear what they had to say: Many consumers explained why they do not trust the food industry. For example, one consumer suggested that 'selling is the only thing the food industry is interested in', while another explained how their need for affordable and high-quality food is not being met. However, others suggested that the food industry is meeting their needs. One consumer believed that 'we receive high-quality food', while another felt that food producers are making 'a bit more effort to be transparent about ingredients'. Alternative Proteins: should we be worried or excited? Buying food that is healthy and sustainable is important to many of us and there are signs that the food industry is listening to what consumers want. For example, more people are demanding plant-based proteins that are believed to be healthier and more environmentally friendly than animal-based proteins. EIT Food asked consumers what they thought about the future of protein, as alternative proteins and even insects start to emerge on the supermarket shelves. Watch the video to hear what they had to say: Many consumers believe the food industry is starting to offer alternatives to animal-based proteins which are both healthy and sustainable. For example, one consumer explained, 'I\u2019ve tried so-called vegan burgers, some of them are really tasty', while another commented, 'if insects are available in supermarkets\u2026then I would definitely buy them'. However, not all consumers were convinced. For example, one suggested that insect-based and plant-based proteins did not sound appetising while another consumer admitted that 'insects scare me a little'. While it appears that many consumers are cautious about eating alternative proteins, the industry is listening to the consumers who do want to see more plant-based and insect-based options on offer, suggesting they are considering the health and environmental implications of what they produce. Food industry isn\u2019t perfect Despite efforts to deliver healthier and more sustainable food to consumers, the industry still needs to adapt. For example, the EIT Food TrustTracker found that there is a lack of transparency and openness from the industry which causes high levels of consumer distrust. Consumers want to know more about where their food comes from and what is in it. For example, many want to be able to trace their food back to its source and have a clearer understanding of the ingredients included. Some believe that a more digitalised food production process would ensure a more open and transparent journey for food, from fark to fork. EIT Food asked consumers whether they believed a digitalised food system would help them make more informed food choices. For many, they believed an increased digitalised food industry where people could see the journey of their food from farm to fork would be useful when determining what foods to buy. Do you agree? How can I influence the food industry so that it delivers healthy and sustainable food? As consumers, EIT Community can shape the future of the food industry. EIT Community can do this by:", "eit594": "Autonomous monitoring and control system for Mining Plants First AMICOS meeting was hosted in Italy by Fondazione Bruno Kessler The raw materials industrial sector is increasingly implementing innovative techniques to improve productivity from existing assets and infrastructure leveraging on continuous innovations in sensor technology, machine connectivity, robotics and Artificial Intelligence. However, the potential of digital transformation needs to be translated into the successful implementation of these new technologies in the raw materials industry. AMICOS project supports digital transformation of raw materials sector On 11 February 2020, the kickoff meeting of the EIT RawMaterials-supported project AMICOS was held in Trento, Italy, at the premises of the research centre Fondazione Bruno Kessler, leader of the project. AMICOS (Autonomous monitoring and control system for Mining Plants) is a new project awarded almost EUR 2.5 million over three years by EIT RawMaterials. The main project\u2019s objective is to support the digital transformation of the raw materials industry with an innovative asset management solution that will increase the market adoption of digital technology in mines. Subscribe now to the EIT newsletter AMICOS end-to-end solution is composed of three main concepts: innovative physical devices deployed and used in the field, which are able to collect sensitive information regarding the usual operations in mines a set of software tools able to integrate heterogeneous source of data a list of smart services able to provide extended benefits to the mining ecosystem, that will be defined from the end-users needs (mine entities in the project consortium) and validated in real use cases. Focus on tailings dams monitoring Digital mines use technologies developed by the so-called Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) for more efficient, sustainable and safer operations. Most of these innovative and emerging technologies are included in AMICOS. The project's main objective is to offer an end-to-end solution that enhances the monitoring of mining operations. Special focus is placed on improving tailings dams and pipeline monitoring, as well as on the predictive maintenance of mining equipment, such as conveyor belts. We are going to be working with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, drones, autonomous ground and aerial vehicles, advanced data analytics, and decision-making tools based on Artificial Intelligence, to name a few. The use of these advanced technologies will mean key benefits for the mining operators: improve workforce safety, reduce maintenance and monitoring costs, and create more sustainable mines. We are tackling the issues raised by the mining industry itself. Denis Guilhot, Senior EU Project Manager at Worldsensing Direct involvement of mining groups as project partners AMICOS is built upon a strong team of experts that includes research organisations, technology providers and mining companies. In AMICOS the direct involvement of mining groups, like ArcelorMittal, Atlantic Copper and KGHM, as project partners ensure the relevance of the project outputs. Nowadays mining groups are very ambitious with their technological aspirations to manage risk in operations. We are very excited about this new EIT RawMaterials project and look forward to contributing to sustainable mining and environment protection with our technology.

Greater access to knowledge has empowered consumers and led to a shift towards more accessible, safe, sustainable and healthy food. Engaging people in this transformation and in food innovation is essential in order to accelerate the process, make it more efficient, and above all, appeal more to people. Research on food As a result of the work developed over the past years, AZTI has shifted its research on consumer trends to a specific focal point: food. The trends that are changing and going to change food innovation are presented here. How do they affect our everyday lives?

A different way to fly Stricter regulations are also being introduced for aviation in response to the climate crisis. The sector already accounts for two per cent of global emissions. With the number of flights expected to double in the next 20 years\u2014 to 8.2 billion air travellers\u2014the emissions of the travel industry alone will exceed the annual global carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. While public awareness is increasing, most people don\u2019t realise how egregious flying actually is. Emissions from a single flight can dwarf the carbon savings from other lifestyle changes, such as going vegan. A return flight from Amsterdam to Santiago in Chile, for example, emits 3 800 kg CO2\u2014equivalent to the amount of CO2 saved by eating a vegetarian diet for eight years. Addressing carbon emissions The industry is moving to limit the damage. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for example, finalised an agreement in 2016 to address carbon emissions by implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the scheme, international passenger and cargo flight emissions would have to be offset, using forestry and other carbon-reducing measures. It will take effect in 2021 and will become obligatory in 2027. This scheme was hailed by some parties as ambitious, but the target\u2014a 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 2005 levels\u2014is still not in line with the 1.5 degree limit. It fails to propose a tax on kerosene or carbon and allows governments to continue heavily subsidising flights. That all keeps flights artificially cheap, encouraging people to fly. Political change is needed to encourage people to fly less and to shift to alternative modes of transport. It's only once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Bold technological innovation Along with these reforms, EIT Community also needs bold, technological innovation to get off fossil jet fuel. EIT Climate-KIC has invested in a number of exponential technologies, such as electric helicopter taxi Volocopter and five-seater electric jet Lilium, which are paving the way towards the aviation industry\u2019s dream: Electric flight. It will be a while before full-sized commercial aircraft go electric. Battery technology is not yet advanced enough to power planes for the distances they cover and weight they carry. Fuel is still 40 to 50 times more power-dense. With the average plane 100 times heavier than a mid-sized car, batteries need to become much more compact and more powerful per kilogram. However, there are already some promising experiments, with the first commercial electric flight flown by Harbour Air in December 2019. Alternative fuels As EIT Community innovates its way to electric flight, alternative fuels can help to cut emissions. EIT Climate-KIC has supported SkyNRG\u2014a pioneer in sustainable aviation fuel\u2014in developing a supply chain for a fuel made from waste oils, including used chip fat. SkyNRG are developing a factory in Groningen to supply KLM and German multinational SHV Energy that will be Europe\u2019s first facility to produce and supply sustainable fuel and bio propane. The fuel will lead to an 85 per cent reduction in lifecycle emissions and will also reduce nitrous oxide and fine particulate matter. Although there is a similar amount of CO2 emitted during the flight, as the fuel is a chemically identical hydrocarbon, using waste oil and residues that would otherwise be destined for landfill eliminates the emissions from drilling, transporting, processing and refining fossil fuels. The ideal would be using CO2, water, and renewable electricity to create hydrogen, because it\u2019s zero-emission and the waste product is water. But that technology is not yet ready to be scaled up Maarten van Dijk, SkyNRG\u2019s managing director Supplying sustainable biofuels Creating and supplying sustainable biofuels, such as the one SkyNRG has developed from waste oils, takes 8-10 years from the lab stage to production and hundreds of millions of euros. But van Dijk is not deterred by detractors who say alternative fuel development is too slow, or that it distracts attention and investment from electric flight.", "eit597": "Evaluating the impact of citizen initiatives The development of an assessment model and certification scheme evaluates the impact of citizen initiatives that have positive influence on the quality of life of people and the environment, and ultimately the certification of sustainable neighbourhoods in Spain. #FeliZiudad project The design criteria for the citizen initiatives evaluation is based on a catalogue of questions to be answered by the applicants.

Through life changing innovations, the EIT Community is taking part in tackling this challenge. Discover two of our EIT Award winners and how they are fighting cancer. Laura Soucek - Peptomyc The protein Myc is found in most human cancers and plays a significant role in the growth of new tumours. It is difficult to attack with drugs due to its location in the nuclei of the cells and its role in the division of healthy cells. Peptomyc relies on peptides, another fundamental component of the cell, to create therapeutics able to fight these Myc proteins. Peptomyc's peptide-based solution is a new treatment option for cancer options. The treatment is non-toxic, does not cause resistance, improves life-expectancy among patients, and can be used in combination with standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In 2018, Laura Soucek won the first EIT Public Award. Peptomyc has received support through three different EIT Health programmes. The company had access to a vast network of support, which provided the company with funding and helped their innovation advance into clinical testing. Martin Steinberg - Stockholm3 The Stockholm3 test is a blood test that increases the detection of aggressive cancers by 20% and, at the same time, reduces the number of unnecessary biopsies by 50% compared to current clinical practice. Stockholm3 also identifies men with aggressive prostate cancer with low PSA values, which is crucial for early detection. By reducing unnecessary biopsies and treatment by more than 50% and mortality by up to 20%, Stockholm3 has a significant positive effect on society by reducing individual harm from over-diagnosis, mortality and overall healthcare costs. EIT Health has played a key role in accelerating the development and implementation of Stockholm3.

The preliminary results of the innovation project were presented with the pilot prototypes performance installed in the Atlantic Copper factory to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of a new process. The results were presented in a workshop held on 7 February 2019 in Huelva, Spain. Enabling optimal use of raw materials The aim of RED_SCOPE is to asses the technical and economic feasibility of a new process to maximise wastewater recovery of a copper smelter. The project led by Atlantic Copper will enable optimal use of raw materials within Europe and will contribute to the European Commission\u2019s current strategy on the Circular Economy. As part of the RED_SCOPE innovation project, a near zero liquid discharge (NZLD) pilot plant was designed, installed and operated to assess the feasibility of recovering most of the aqueous effluents generated in the Metallurgical Complex of Atlantic Copper. The recovered water, of adequate quality to be used as process water, can be sent back to the factory, reducing the consumption of fresh water and, therefore, the Water Footprint. In addition, as a consequence of the recovery of clean process water, a dry residue in the form of saline crystals is generated, which is currently under evaluation. SUEZ has developed the design of the water resources optimisation project. The project began in 2017 with pre-feasibility studies and laboratory tests followed by the design of the pilot plant carried out in 2018. Furthermore, different technologies were installed along with the pilot tests carried out for five months. By 2019, the implementation study and the final validation of the project were planned. Moreover, the IVL team worked on the characterisation and study of the possible recovery of the waste generated in the new process. Subscribe to the EIT newsletter and keep in touch with the latest news Socioeconomic and environmental impact The RED_SCOPE innovation project demonstrates an improved, integrated NZLD process for treating the wastewater stream, which reduces by 99% the water in the current discharge and reduces the freshwater consumption. As a consequence of this BAT implementation for wastewater treatment, the process would be environmentally sustainable. The RED_SCOPE process is a key asset for the raw materials sector due to: Recycling water to reduce consumption: There is a concern about water scarcity problems and over-exploited aquifers in the EU; Boosting raw material supplies in the EU: Copper demand is expected to continue growing as a consequence of emerging technologies; Adapting to future EU regulations: Copper smelters should be prepared to guarantee compliance with future requirements. Benefits of implementing the new RED_SCOPE process: Sustainable circular economy: Through this new process, 99% of water is reused, thus saving energy and reducing environmental impact. The remaining solids or salts could be potentially recycled. Saving energy by minimising brine generation: This system achieves a more sustainable treatment of copper due to the reduction in brine generation. The smaller amount of brine obtained, the less energy is used to treat it. Boosting sustainability: RED_SCOPE team has achieved a more sustainable copper production to secure the sector\u2019s future.

Andrea Conti, Senior Business Developer at EIT Digital Accelerator CoRehab", "eit606": "'A Deep Demonstration of a Circular, Regenerative and Low-Carbon Economy in Slovenia'. The initiative is one of eight Deep Demonstrations launched by EIT Climate-KIC, which together offer a test bed environment for the ambitious, '1.5-consistent systems transitions' called for by IPCC reports, activists, national and European policy. Here is the full interview with Kirsten Dunlop, CEO EIT Climate-KIC. Climate activists are on the streets, calling for systemic change. Is anyone taking this seriously? Do we even know how to do it? There are people taking it seriously and the world is definitely not starting from scratch. At the end of 2019, for example, I was invited to present a vision of innovation and systemic change to the parliament of Slovenia. It marked a milestone in our 18-month engagement with the country, which has involved close cooperation with seven Slovenian Government Ministries, EIT RawMaterials and the Joint Research Centre. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC That day, the Slovenian parliament passed a motion to adopt an EIT Climate-KIC-led proposal called 'A Deep Demonstration of a Circular, Regenerative and Low-Carbon Economy in Slovenia.' The proposal commits the country to becoming a fully circular economy. That means essentially no new virgin materials. Why did Slovenia choose to move in this direction? Moving away from traditional linear economic business models and transitioning to closed-loop systems has been defined by the Government of Slovenia as one of the country\u2019s strategic development priorities and an important building block of the carbon-neutral, prosperous and smart future. Business-as-usual isn\u2019t delivering the pace and scale of change needed. Through this proposal and on-the-ground Deep Demonstration, the country is embracing an unprecedented cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary approach, which seeks to marry different disciplines and work across boundaries, silos and departments. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Its overall goal is to position Slovenia as a European leader in harnessing the transformative power of circularity to decarbonise its economy and transform communities while promoting wellbeing and prosperity for all Slovenes for decades to come. It\u2019s a great example of a country embracing the benefits and opportunities of radical, structural transformation for a 1.5 degree world. Really groundbreaking. Averting catastrophic global temperature rise will require deep and holistic transformations in every country. For example, a recent report by Material Economics calculated that circular approaches could help to reduce CO2 emissions from materials production in the EU by almost 56 per cent by 2050. This sounds like a radical policy proposal. How did you arrive there and how does Slovenia intend to implement this ambition? In many ways, the process that led up to that moment in parliament (when our proposal for a Deep Demonstration of a Circular, Regenerative and Low-Carbon Economy in Slovenia was adopted) is the design phase of \u2018doing systemic change. Over 18 months, EIT Climate-KIC engaged challenge owners in Slovenia (government ministries and sector leaders), to articulate an ambitious intent for transformational change, and to build demand for a systemic approach. We worked with them to identify constraints and opportunities, frame the problem space, and map relevant systems. And then there is the painstaking work among challenge owners to connect funding and programmes across ministries, and so forth. Get all the EIT's news once per month: subscribe to the EIT newsletter Implementing the change (i.e. building and managing the portfolio of projects and programmes, and learning from it) comes next. Slovenia\u2019s plan here centres around driving circularity in five main areas: Forestry; Built environment; Manufacturing; Food; Mobility. The programme of work is focused on three pillars for National Circular Economy Transition, working together to decarbonise Slovenia\u2019s socio-economic system through circular economy principles: Smart and circular communities; Circular green development; Circular policy design & science. A dedicated vehicle called the Slovenian Center for Smart and Circular Transition will serve as the beating heart and physical centre of the entire Deep Demonstration, bringing together the different stakeholders and opening up activities to the wider public. EIT Climate-KIC will provide orchestration services in Slovenia, and help to design a broad-based portfolio of interventions that combine budgets and programmes across old siloes\u2014covering various combinations of technology, policy, education, entrepreneurship, regulation, social innovation, citizen engagement and financial innovation. We will connect this project into our wider community of innovation actors and initiatives across Europe. You can read more about the detailed working plan in this article by Cliona Howie, EIT Climate-KIC\u2019s Head of Circular Economy. Are all the answers to achieving a 1.5 degree world really already out there? No, because many of the solutions we need are not simple technological substitutions or single-point interventions. While we may be able to make 1.5 work on a spreadsheet, we don\u2019t know yet how to make change spread on the ground. On top of this, the context and conditions for achieving 1.5 will continue to change. Uncertainty is the new normal. There is every reason to feel bewildered by the complexity, uncertainty and urgency of the challenge we face. The big question is\u2014do we have the right frameworks in place, for rapid testing and learning about what does work, and for rapid scaling, in a context of uncertainty? Deep Demonstrations of whole systems change are one of these frameworks. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC So we need a new model of innovation to catalyse the changes needed? Definitely. We need to get communities, organisations and national economies onto a 1.5C footing, quickly. Learning how to achieve this is the real innovation of our time. For example, if we want to achieve climate impact, traditional models of funding and politics need to change. In this respect, Slovenia is embarking on an incredibly bold experiment, connecting ministries and funding to break down siloes, and to capitalise on the benefits of circularity. In addition to creating frameworks for collaborative investment, innovation and learning, we also need to broaden the scope of innovation to include finance, regulation, education, governance as well as non-unusual innovation suspects, like the creative arts, community and social movements. Dr Kirsten Dunlop, CEO, EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstrations (i.e. advancing innovation across these multiple fronts at the same time in a joined-up, holistic way) can help us identify combinations of actions and investments that lead to pace and scale. So, yes, we need a new model of innovation to catalyse systemic change. The innovation we really need right now is systems innovation. How will the Slovenian people be included in this transition? Slovenia recognises the need to treat all people as stakeholders in this change. There is a big focus on communities, well-being and long-term prosperity. The government\u2019s approach will activate: Local communities, civil servants, students and younger generations, teachers and other change agents, researchers and academics, non-governmental and non-profit organisations, Chambers of Commerce and Industry, associations and other representations of interest, Strategic Research and Innovation Partnerships (SRIPs), start-ups, SMEs and companies, as well as economic clusters. Can you illustrate the difference between a silo approach and a systems innovation approach? \u201cConsider carbon-free mobility in cities. A huge amount of technical work has been done already to develop alternatives to the combustion engine. Every day, we get better at building electric cars or hydrogen buses. But we\u2019re less good at reducing demand for individual car ownership or driving a switch to zero-emissions buses. A holistic approach forces us to answer a list of other questions as well, like how to create more cycle lanes, increase video conferencing, source local ingredients, build pedestrianism into a city\u2019s health strategy, and so on. In Slovenia, systemic innovation will tackle material production and waste flows across the key economic systems and value chains mentioned above. It will also use training, education and capacity-building to create change agents, to foster life-long learning and to disseminate insights and good practices as widely as possible, and it will use innovative policy initiatives and experiments to ensure enabling conditions. Slovenia is clearly on board. What other governments or organisations are embracing a systems innovation approach? We are running seven other Deep Demonstrations, eight in total, covering: Cities, food, landscapes as carbon sinks, circular regenerative economies, just transitions in coal and heavy industry regions, maritime hubs, long-termism and resilience. Over 30 different locations are involved across Europe. Our long-term goal is for the Deep Demonstration model to help trigger rapid decarbonisation and strengthened resilience across Europe. Many of our current project partners come from EU member states eligible for EIT\u2019s Regional Innovation Scheme. To accelerate impact in these areas, we are integrating our approach with EU Instruments on smart specialisation, on national climate and energy plans, and on coal regions in transition. In Silesia, Poland, for example, we are working on coal transitions, while in Cyprus we\u2019re working with the government on the decarbonisation of shipping. How will you know if systems innovation is creating genuine impact? Our impacts framework includes an evaluation and learning capability that draws on structured sense-making and frequent calibration of our overall portfolio of projects. It\u2019s our desire that decision-makers have actionable intelligence and knowledge at their finger tips. Beyond EIT Climate-KIC and our partners, we also want others to follow our journey and benefit from our learnings. To that end, we are committed to reporting transparently on our Deep Demonstration programme as it unfolds. Finally, there are a sea of climate initiatives out there. How confident are you that your systems innovation initiatives will cut through?", "eit607": "EIT Health-supported start-up Surge-on Medical continues to seek investments after surpassing its initial goal.

BeePlanet Factory is the most recent Spanish start-up to be accepted into EIT InnoEnergy\u2019s Highway programme. Second life for batteries In 2030, the International Energy Agency forecasts 125 million electric vehicles on the road. Each battery will have an average life of 10 years, then they will need to find a second life; that is where BeePlanet comes in. BeePlanet is committed to the circular economy, they have already closed agreements with Nissan, and are currently reusing batteries from Nissan Leaf models. The start-up provides energy storage solutions by developing the proper application for each battery following its initial use in a passenger vehicle. Although the batteries are no longer perfectly suited to the requirements of a motor vehicle, this need not relegate them to the scrap heap. Instead, they can be put to such alternative uses as large-scale energy storage to optimise the grid, small-scale energy storage for self-consumption in public and private buildings and alternative vehicles with lower performance specifications, such as forklifts, golf carts, bicycles, etc. The start-up is focused on spreading the word about the endless possibilities of reusing EV batteries to not only make the EV business case more profitable, but to reduce the cost of energy storage at domestic and commercial installations.

AI system effective in diagnosing prostate cancer On 08 December 2019, the Lancet Oncology published the results of a study demonstrating the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) system in diagnosing prostate cancer in tissue samples. The system was developed by the team behind Stockholm3 and OncoWatch, two projects supported by EIT Health. Find out more about Stockholm3 The study, involving the same team and led by Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, showed that the AI system had considerable accuracy in determining whether a sample contained cancer, and in estimating the length of the cancer tumour in the biopsy. Furthermore, the AI system was comparable with 23 international, leading uropathologists in determining the Gleason score, the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer. Our AI tool has the potential to reduce the workload of uropathologists, allowing them to focus on the most difficult cases and at the same time act as a safety net to improve quality. It also has the potential to speed up diagnostics and reduce costs for healthcare services. Martin Eklund, Associate Professor at Karolinska Institutet EIT Health support The Karolinksa team launched the blood-based prostate cancer diagnostic test called Stockholm3 in 2017. Stockholm3 doubles the number of aggressive cancers that are identified, whilst also reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies by 50% compared to current clinical practice with PSA. Stockholm3 is currently used in clinical practice in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. EIT Health has played a key role in accelerating the development and implementation of Stockholm3 and the new AI system, OncoWatch through network and financial support. As part of the development of OncoWatch, the AI system will be validated in 2020 in a nine-country multicentre study to assess its performance across different labs and in a wider range of digital pathology scanners. A first CE-marked product is expected to launch by the end of the year. There is a high demand for improved tools in prostate cancer diagnostics and we have proven that we can take new innovative tests to the market. The Stockholm3 test was used in more than 20,000 men in the Nordics alone in 2019, and I believe that our new AI system, OncoWatch, will also have strong uptake Martin Steinberg, Project leader for EIT Health-backed OncoWatch Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in Europe, with approximately 450 000 new cases each year. Early diagnosis and treatment of aggressive prostate cancer is crucial to survival. Prostate cancer blights the lives of a large number of men in Europe each year, and despite the advent of new and innovative diagnostics and treatments, we still see too many men die from the condition. Prostate cancer is often treatable with early diagnosis and effective treatment, and AI represents a large opportunity to complement existing medical expertise within the diagnostic process. Jan-Philipp Beck, CEO of EIT Health 'The results of the study demonstrate the exciting developments that are happening in the field of AI, and how the technology can be applied to medical practice to improve the lives of patients and citizens in Europe.

Real-time monitoring of ground displacements EIT RawMaterials supported start-up, SpacEarth Technology, has developed Mines-In-Time (MIT), an automatic solution for real-time monitoring of ground displacements, applied to mining operation and allowing to increase workers\u2019 safety as well as mining assets integrity. The system is designed to monitor rock mass during mining operations, and is integrated in a traffic-light Decision Support System (DSS) to avoid risks and cost related to mines collapse. The solution was validated in relevant environment on the micro-seismicity data recorded at Garpenberg mine (Boliden Group, Sweden), the world\u2019s most productive and automated underground zinc mine (1 250 m depth). Mines-In-Time solution addresses the following: Control ground deformations and stress alteration of the rock mass during mining operations; Improve safety in mining operations; Enable Real-Time autonomous decision-making systems. Mines-In-Time is based on four dimensions Local Earthquake Tomography (4D LET) methodology and is able to analyse both natural and induced micro-seismicity due to mining operations. This technique is a unparalleled upgrade of the traditional ambient noise analysis and time-lapse 3D LET, since the addition of the fourth dimension (time) allows a real-time monitoring of ground deformation related to the stress variation and provides an instant alert in case of risky conditions, using data provided by the existing networks of seismographs already installed in most of the mining sites (no extra hardware to be installed). For this reason, MIT is the only Decision Support System and early warning systems for mining able to dynamically forecast rock deformations and provide an alert in case of critical conditions. Mining companies and service providers will benefit from the MIT outstanding advantages: Reduction of health and safety risks of personnel involved in underground works and reduction of economic losses due to collapses and failures Improvement of planning and scheduling of mining and maintenance operations, saving costs of inspections, analysis and monitoring, estimated in the order of 30% with respect to the current practices Better solutions through research SpacEarth Technology, a spin-off of the Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), founded in 2014 and supported by the EIT RawMaterials Booster to develop applications for the mining industry.

It liberates more ores and consumes less energy. Less energy consumption The mill is a prototype of a new ultra-fine grinding mill for the liberation of high-value particles met in platinum-group metals containing ores, copper ores or other polymetallic ores with fine dissemination of mineral phases. This mill consumes 20-30% less energy compared to similar established mills and increases ore liberation with at least 20% less locked ore at same particle size. Professor Urs Peuker at Technische Universit\u00e4t Bergakademie Freiberg and leader of the RoStar project The RoStar prototype has proven to increase the operation period with 50% before maintenance is needed. Additionally, the maintenance itself is 50% faster compared to similarly established mills, due to an optimised rotor-stator geometry and improved wear resistance through a modular construction of the mill housing. The RoStar mill offers an answer to the forthcoming challenges already seen in fine milling trends. Tangible applications are opened in re-grinding-flotation circuits, tailings re-processing as well as in enabling access to future deposits containing valuable or critical materials. Professor Peuker The mill will be a vertical fine grinding mill, where gravity forces enable a higher filling level than in horizontal mills and a hydraulic pressure on the grinding beads. The new improved design of the Mills Rotor/Stator system was launched into the market in the year 2018. Deliverables of the RoStar innovation project will be a containerised pilot plant, a fine milling process with very low energy consumption.

Read the interview with the EIT Health Supervisory Board Member Ursula Redeker. Ursula Redeker is Spokeswoman for the Management of Roche Diagnostics GmbH. She is also a member of the EIT Health Supervisory Board, a member of the Board of Trustees of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region and shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board of ABB AG. How can we improve healthcare and reduce its cost at the same time? It sounds as ambitious as 'squaring the circle', but if we look closely, we can see that it is in fact possible to provide better health at lower cost. EIT Community has a fairly segmented approach to the provision of healthcare today. As patients, EIT Community sees doctors, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and many other healthcare professionals helping us to maintain or regain good health. They must plan together, treat patients together, and talk to one another, a dynamic that often needs to be continued in the long term, particularly for chronic diseases. This becomes a challenge when processes, regulation and mindset are not all focused on integration of care. The growth in medical knowledge necessitates increased specialisation, which is valuable but results in fragmentation that requires a challenging level of governing infrastructure and reimbursement principles. Integrating healthcare to provide seamless end-to-end care will reduce costs by optimising interfaces, reducing redundancies and avoiding communication breaks and information gaps. It will improve outcomes by making information easily available and providing constant feedback loops for all involved in care. It will enable truly personalised care. And it will help to shift the focus from treating disease to maintaining health, thereby promising both better healthcare and reduced costs. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member Some of the main challenges that I believe EIT Community must address in order to develop, nurture and scale integrated care models across Europe include: Data: Enabling and facilitating data sharing across all stakeholders in healthcare is essential to ensure best outcomes for patients and increase operational efficiency. Beyond this, new technologies, such as smart wearables, offer additional opportunities to capture relevant data, very often strongly owned and driven by the patient. Reimbursement: We currently pay for health services based on the individual test, treatment or medicine provided to the patient. This doesn't necessarily focus on the impact achieved for individual patients or patient groups. In order for true reform to work, we need to think about moving towards a reimbursement model that focuses on outcomes \u2013 and puts the same emphasis on maintaining health as we put on regaining health. Policy: We see many healthcare professionals and healthcare provider groups optimising their processes and measures to improve outcomes for patients. Doing this requires optimisation along the whole care process from a patient or population perspective. Tackling all of these challenges is, of course, no small task. While EIT Community may still be some years away from total reform, EIT Community is seeing pilots testing integrated healthcare on a regional level or focused on a disease. Innovative integrated care system One example is the 'Gesundes Kinzigtal' model (GK) in Germany, where healthcare within a local community has been organised as an innovative integrated care system. The GK model focuses on three key principles: better population health, improved experience of care, and reduced per-capita costs. The results of the GK model clearly demonstrated that patient satisfaction and population health can be improved while decreasing the overuse of health services and medicines. In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation project iPDM-GO is improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform. Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation project iPDM-GO is improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform that integrates diagnostic results with relevant medication and personal information \u2013 to help patients and their doctors achieve better short- and long-term outcomes. Controlling blood glucose levels is a highly complex process and a major task for patients. Although monitoring and treatment are readily available, staying within the required blood-sugar range remains a challenge. Providing individual feedback loops and continuous information for patients and doctors can help avoid long-term complications and associated pain and cost. Addressing epilepsy by innovating seizure detection Another EIT Health project, called SeizeIT, is addressing epilepsy by innovating seizure detection. Currently, seizures are being reported with a patient diary, or are measured during hospital stays. This provides a lot of room for seizures to be underreported, but accuracy is relevant to establishing optimal care. By providing a discreet device that patients can wear at home, SeizeIT is working towards a reality where all seizures can be detected. This will improve patient lives and help medical professionals understand more about the condition, and improve treatments available. The variety of healthcare systems across Europe share some common challenges. Integrated healthcare is one of those. EIT Health offers an opportunity to explore pilots and innovative approaches to achieve this vision. Let\u2019s use these opportunities to create improvements that provide the best value for citizens and patients.

EIT InnoEnergy has announced its EUR 5.8 million investment into Northvolt\u2019s 'Revolt' programme. The programme, which will implement the latest discoveries in efficient materials recovery methods, will see the construction of a pilot battery recycling plant, followed by a full-scale version at Northvolt\u2019s site in Skellefte\u00e5 in 2022. The EIT InnoEnergy investment supports Northvolt\u2019s target of using 50% recycled materials in all its new battery cells by 2030. Boosting circular economy initiatives The announcement comes just two days after the European Green Deal highlighted the importance of circular economy initiatives to 'mainstream' sustainability throughout European policy. This is a landmark investment and one that has a mission critical role to play in addressing climate issues. Europe\u2019s energy transition relies on creating a local, competitive and sustainable battery value supply chain that can support the electrification of the transport, power and industrial sectors. As battery volumes are expected to increase drastically, it will be doubly important that, as an industry, we do everything we can to reduce their manufacturing footprint. Diego Pavia, CEO at EIT InnoEnergy 'As such, greener battery technologies are a cornerstone of a sustainable future, and we are actively seeking to invest in technologies that can unlock economic and environmental benefits. Better technologies mean we can manufacture much more with less, using recycled raw materials and less energy', added Diego. The aim of using 50% recycled materials by 2030 will be achieved through a gradual build-up in capacity. The pilot plant will process 100 tons a year, while the full-scale unit initially will look to recycle 25 000 tons of battery cells a year. At present, much of Europe\u2019s recyclable battery materials are thought to be exported abroad for reuse in countries such as China and Korea. Long-term support and collaboration We are very pleased to have the continued support of EIT InnoEnergy as we take this next step in developing our blueprint for sustainable battery manufacturing. Our partnership with EIT InnoEnergy has been vital in getting us to where we are today; not only has it provided investments, it has opened doors for us across Europe. Peter Carlsson, CEO Northvolt Northvolt\u2019s programme builds on two years of research where, in conjunction with researchers at Chalmers University, Sweden, it has optimised the process design for hydrometallurgical treatment. The process allows for more efficient recovery of valuable metals including lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt. This latest investment brings EIT InnoEnergy\u2019s total capital contributions to Northvolt to EUR 9.3 million, following an earlier investment of EUR 3.5 million three years ago. Both investments help EIT InnoEnergy unlock the estimated EUR 250 billion annual European battery market, identified by the European Battery Alliance. Northvolt is just one of several battery supply chain start-ups EIT InnoEnergy supports, and it has resources to support more. Earlier this autumn, EIT InnoEnergy issued its first ever global call for start-ups across the entire sustainability value chain. Following strong growth within the storage market, EIT InnoEnergy expects this call to attract a significant number of new storage innovations.

Sometimes, it does so on the street, but more often, it happens when the owner is recharging the lithium ion battery. A mismatched charger won't always turn off automatically when the battery's fully charged, and keeps heating up. Or, the highly flammable electrolyte inside the battery's cells leaks out of its casing and ignites, setting off a chain reaction. \"These bikes when they fail, they fail like a blowtorch,\" said Dan Flynn, the chief fire marshal at the New York Fire Department. \"We've seen incidents where people have described them as explosive \u2014 incidents where they actually have so much power, they're actually blowing walls down in between rooms and apartments.\" A fire in Brooklyn in April was traced to a faulty e-bike or e-scooter battery that ignited and gutted two houses. And these fires are getting more frequent. As of Friday, the FDNY investigated 174 battery fires, putting 2022 on track to double the number of fires that occurred last year (104) and quadruple the number from 2020 (44). So far this year, six people have died in e-bike-related fires and 93 people were injured, up from four deaths and 79 injuries last year. In early August, a 27-year-old Venezuelan immigrant, identified as Rafael Elias Lopez-Centeno, died after his lithium ion battery caught fire and ripped through the Bronx apartment where he was staying. Carmen Tiburcio, a neighbor, said Lopez's aunt told her he had tried to escape through the front door, but the bike was in the way. Instead, he took refuge in the bathroom, where he tried to fill up the bathtub with water to protect himself from the flames. But the smoke got to him, she said. \"He didn't make it,\" Tiburcio said. \"His lungs were very bad.\" Another danger to delivery work Many, if not most, of the fires in New York involve e-bike batteries owned by restaurant delivery workers, who work long shifts, traveling dozens of miles a day. \"The bikes tend to get beat up, subjected to the elements,\" Flynn said. \"They're not really made for our streets.\" The longer the batteries are used, the more time it takes to fully recharge them, and it can take up to 8 hours. That in turn makes it harder for owners to keep on eye on their batteries the whole time they are plugged in, which is key for safety. Enlarge this image toggle caption FDNY FDNY In addition, new batteries are costly, and the temptation to opt for a less-expensive refurbished battery for much less money is great \u2014 especially for couriers who make an average of $12.21 an hour after expenses, according to a survey by Los Deliveristas Union, an advocacy and membership organization. Several e-bike owners interviewed by NPR in New York City said they were aware of the risks batteries posed, and took measures to reduce them. \"A lot of guys have four, five, six bikes in their apartment and they swap out chargers for different bikes when it doesn't belong to that bike,\" said Rafael Cardanales, who lives on the Lower East Side. \"You can't just use any charger, you know.\" Musfiqur Rahman said that when he first got into the delivery business, he bought two new Arrow brand batteries \u2014 for $550 each. He did it specifically to avoid fires. \"As far as I know, this brand never get involved in this kind of incident,\" the 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant said. The FDNY says most batteries are so destroyed by fire when they inspect them that they can make no conclusions about which brand is safer than another. The FDNY has begun posting videos on social media warning about the dangers of recharging lithium ion batteries. Living in close quarters E-bike related fires have occurred elsewhere, such as London, San Francisco, Michigan and South Florida. But nowhere does concern for them appear to be as high as in New York, perhaps because of the prevalence of apartment living \u2014 and also the prevalence of ordering take-out. While restaurants sometimes store bikes overnight for employees, fewer people are now working for particular restaurants and many more for themselves, using apps like Door Dash or Uber Eats to connect with customers. And these couriers often don't have any other place to store and recharge their e-bikes except in their apartments. That, in turn, creates a fire hazard not just for the workers, but also for their neighbors. This summer, the New York City Housing Authority proposed banning e-bikes and batteries from its 2,600 buildings. But the proposal created an uproar, and officials have not gone through with it. Enlarge this image toggle caption Matthew Schuerman/NPR Matthew Schuerman/NPR City councilmembers have proposed their own solutions. One bill, for instance, would ban the sale of used batteries within city limits. Another would require all batteries to be sold to be approved by a national testing service, such as Underwriters Laboratories. Mayor Eric Adams recently announced he would direct $1 million to create hubs for delivery workers with charging stations and other amenities \u2014 though they would likely be used during the day and not provide overnight charging. Councilmember Gale Brewer, who sponsored the legislation that would outlaw the sale of used batteries, says she recognizes that new batteries could be prohibitively expensive to delivery workers. \"They do, you know, God's work, so to speak, because New Yorkers like to have food delivered,\" she said. \"So now the question is how do they get the new batteries that are not going to cause fires?\"", "other news sites1": "Building new solar capacity in Europe could be 10 times cheaper than continuing to operate gas-fired power plants in the long-term, according to a new study by Norway-based research company Rystad Energy. Europe has seen skyrocketing gas prices since the drop in Russian gas exports, with spot prices on the Netherlands-based Title Transfer Facility (TTF) rising to an average \u20ac134 ($135.15)/MWh so far this year. Rystad forecasts prices will stabilize at around \u20ac31 per MWh by 2030, which puts the LCOE of existing gas-fired plants closer to \u20ac150 per MWh. \u201cThis is still three times more than the LCOE of new solar PV facilities. For gas-fired plants to continue being competitive, gas prices would need to fall closer to \u20ac17 per MWh and carbon prices would need to fall to \u20ac10 per tonne, which is currently unthinkable,\u201d the company said in a statement. Popular content \u201cGas will continue to play an important role in the European energy mix for some time to come, but unless something fundamental shifts, then simple economics, as well as climate concerns, will tip the balance in favor of renewables,\u201d said Carlos Torres Diaz, head of power at Rystad Energy. If gas funds were invested in renewables instead, Europe could replace gas with solar and onshore wind power generation by 2028, when total capacity would reach 333 GW, Rystad forecasts. This estimate assumes a weighted average capital cost for the technologies of \u20ac1.3 per watt, as well as a two-year pre-development phase.", "other news sites2": "This window film (held in fingers at top left) keeps rooms bright and cool by allowing visible light to pass in while reflecting invisible infrared and ultraviolet sunlight and radiating heat into outer space. Credit: Adapted from ACS Energy Letters 2022, DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01969 As climate change intensifies summer heat, demand is growing for technologies to cool buildings. Now, researchers report in ACS Energy Letters that they have used advanced computing technology and artificial intelligence to design a transparent window coating that could lower the temperature inside buildings, without expending a single watt of energy. Studies have estimated that cooling accounts for about 15% of global energy consumption. That demand could be lowered with a window coating that could block the sun's ultraviolet and near-infrared light\u2014the parts of the solar spectrum that typically pass through glass to heat an enclosed room. Energy use could be reduced even further if the coating radiates heat from the window's surface at a wavelength that passes through the atmosphere into outer space. However, it's difficult to design materials that can meet these criteria simultaneously and can also transmit visible light, meaning they don't interfere with the view. Eungkyu Lee, Tengfei Luo and colleagues set out to design a \"transparent radiative cooler\" (TRC) that could do just that. The team constructed computer models of TRCs consisting of alternating thin layers of common materials like silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide or titanium dioxide on a glass base, topped with a film of polydimethylsiloxane. They optimized the type, order and combination of layers using an iterative approach guided by machine learning and quantum computing, which stores data using subatomic particles. This computing method carries out optimization faster and better than conventional computers because it can efficiently test all possible combinations in a fraction of a second. This produced a coating design that, when fabricated, beat the performance of conventionally designed TRCs in addition to one of the best commercial heat-reduction glasses on the market. In hot, dry cities, the researchers say, the optimized TRC could potentially reduce cooling energy consumption by 31% compared with conventional windows. They note their findings could be applied to other applications, since TRCs could also be used on car and truck windows. In addition, the group's quantum computing-enabled optimization technique could be used to design other types of composite materials.

(AP) \u2014 Even though battery costs are rising, auto companies are rolling out more affordable electric vehicles that should widen their appeal to a larger group of buyers. The latest came Thursday from General Motors, a Chevrolet Equinox small SUV with a starting price somewhere around $30,000 and a range-per-charge of 250 miles (400 kilometers). You can get range of 300 miles (500 kilometers) if you pay more. GM won\u2019t release the exact price of the Equinox EV until closer to the date it goes on sale, about this time next year. But the SUV is at the low end of Edmunds.com\u2019s list of prices for electric vehicles sold in the U.S., where the average cost of an EV is around $65,000. Hitting a price around $30,000 and a range per charge close to 300 miles is key to getting mainstream buyers to switch away from gasoline vehicles, industry analysts say. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of at that sweet spot,\u201d said Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com. \u201cYou\u2019re basically at the price point that everyone is clamoring for.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT Auto industry analysts say that if the Equinox makes efficient use of interior space with plenty of cargo and passenger room, and if it is styled similar to current gas-powered small SUVs, it should be a hit in the most popular segment of the U.S. auto market. About 20% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. are compact SUVs. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect vehicle for a lot of different users, whether it\u2019s a small family, maybe an empty nester,\u201d said Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, a Detroit-area consulting firm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got space to haul things, but it\u2019s easy to drive.\u201d A $30,000 EV that checks all of the boxes is just a little above the price of a comparable small gas-powered SUV. The Toyota RAV4, the top seller in the segment and the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that isn\u2019t a pickup, starts at just over $28,000. Until the last few years, electric vehicles were either expensive and aimed at affluent luxury buyers, or cheaper but with limited travel ranges. For example, a base version of Tesla\u2019s Model 3, the lowest-price model from the top-selling EV brand in the U.S., starts at more than $48,000. A larger Tesla Model X SUV starts at over $120,000. ADVERTISEMENT The only EVs with starting prices under $30,000 (including shipping) now are versions of the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt. Both are smaller than a typical gas-powered compact SUV. The Mini Cooper Electric, Mazda MX30 and Hyundai Kona Electric are in the $30,000s, according to Edmunds. Kia\u2019s Niro EV, Hyundai\u2019s Ioniq 5, Ford\u2019s F-150 Lightning pickup, the Volkswagen ID.4, Kia EV6, Toyota b24x, Ford\u2019s Mustang Mach E, Audi\u2019s Q4 e-tron, the Subaru Solterra, Polestar 2, and Tesla Model 3 all have starting prices in the $40,000s. GM may find it difficult to keep the Equinox price around $30,000, largely because minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and nickel that are key components of batteries have been rising fast. There\u2019s a finite number of mines and increasing demand as nearly all automakers introduce new EVs. ADVERTISEMENT Drury says that even if GM is able to keep the Equinox starting price around $30,000, demand likely will be high enough so the company builds mainly higher-priced versions. And some dealers have been marking up EVs beyond the automaker\u2019s sticker price due to high demand. In the first half of the year, U.S. EV sales rose 68% from the same period a year ago, to nearly 313,000. Some EVs could get a whole lot cheaper in the U.S., too, with federal tax credits starting next year of up to $7,500 that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act . But meeting federal requirements may be difficult. The vehicles and batteries have to be assembled in North America, and the new law phases in requirements that battery minerals and parts have to come from the continent. Most minerals such as lithium, a key battery ingredient, are now imported from China and other countries. The Equinox checks the North American assembly box. It will be made in Mexico. The company won\u2019t say where the battery will be made, but GM has announced three joint-venture battery factories in the U.S., including one that\u2019s operating already in Warren, Ohio. ADVERTISEMENT From there, GM is working on meeting the other criteria for getting the tax credit. \u201cWe\u2019re really working through the rules and the regulations right now,\u201d said Steve Majoros, vice president of marketing for Chevrolet. \u201cWe think it\u2019s all lining up nicely, but more details to come on that.\u201d Majoros hinted that it may take a couple of years to meet all the government\u2019s requirements to get the full credit as GM takes more control of its supply chain for EV parts. The Equinox EV, Majoros said, is longer, wider and a bit shorter than the gas versions of the same vehicle. GM used new interior packaging methods to create comparable passenger and cargo space to the gas Equinox, he said. The relatively small price difference between the two should get many customers to consider EV over gas, he said. \u201cIt does a lot of things right,\u201d Majoros said. \u201cSo when it does that, the (sales) volume follows.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will overtake Tesla as the nation\u2019s largest seller of EVs by the middle of this decade. The Equinox EV is a step toward that. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be one of the products that\u2019s really going to help that mainstream adoption really take off in the marketplace,\u201d Majoros said.", "other news sites4": "How can Europe manage to secure abundant and cheaper electricity? One of the most ambitious projects in the planning is the interconnection of Europe with Egypt via Greece. An undersea cable that will carry 3,000 MW RES electricity and connect northern Egypt directly to Attica in Greece. The project has been undertaken by the Copelouzos Group, whose management met last week with the Egyptian leadership to speed up the procedures \"By bringing 3,000 MW of clean energy to Europe, via Greece, we are helping Europe wean itself off Russia's fossil fuels and natural gas. Also, the green energy we will transport will be much cheaper than today's energy prices. You understand that this will help both Greek and European consumers\", said Ioannis Karydas, CEO of Renewables, Copelouzos Group. The so-called \"GREGY interconnection\u201d is a 3.5 billion euro project that has been categorized as a Project of Common Interest (PCI) by the European Union. It will carry clean electricity produced in Egypt (or other African countries) through solar or wind parks. \"Approximately one third (of the electricity that will come from Egypt) will be consumed in Greece, and mainly in Greek industries, another third will be exported to neighboring European countries and one third will be used in Greece, for the production of green hydrogen. The majority of this hydrogen will also be exported to neighboring European countries\", added Ioannis Karydas. Egypt has completed interconnections with Libya, Sudan and Saudi Arabia and aspires to become a major energy hub for SE Europe too. The \"GREGY interconnection\u201d is expected to be operational in 7 to 8 years.", "other news sites5": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 A breakthrough in electric vehicle battery design has enabled a 10-minute charge time for a typical EV battery. The record-breaking combination of a shorter charge time and more energy acquired for longer travel range was announced today (Oct. 12) in the journal Nature. \u201cThe need for smaller, faster-charging batteries is greater than ever,\u201d said Chao-Yang Wang, the William E. Diefenderfer Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Penn State and lead author on the study. \u201cThere are simply not enough batteries and critical raw materials, especially those produced domestically, to meet anticipated demand.\u201d In August, California\u2019s Air Resources Board passed an extensive plan to restrict and ultimately ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars within the state. By 2035, the largest auto market in the United States will effectively retire the internal combustion engine. If new car sales are going to shift to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), Wang explained, they\u2019ll need to overcome two major drawbacks: they are too slow to recharge and too large to be efficient and affordable. Instead of taking a few minutes at the gas pump, depending on the battery, some EVs can take all day to recharge. \u201cOur fast-charging technology works for most energy-dense batteries and will open a new possibility to downsize electric vehicle batteries from 150 to 50 kWh without causing drivers to feel range anxiety,\u201d said Wang, whose lab partnered with State College-based startup EC Power to develop the technology. \u201cThe smaller, faster-charging batteries will dramatically cut down battery cost and usage of critical raw materials such as cobalt, graphite and lithium, enabling mass adoption of affordable electric cars.\u201d The technology relies on internal thermal modulation, an active method of temperature control to demand the best performance possible from the battery, Wang explained. Batteries operate most efficiently when they are hot, but not too hot. Keeping batteries consistently at just the right temperature has been major challenge for battery engineers. Historically, they have relied on external, bulky heating and cooling systems to regulate battery temperature, which respond slowly and waste a lot of energy, Wang said. Wang and his team decided to instead regulate the temperature from inside the battery. The researchers developed a new battery structure that adds an ultrathin nickel foil as the fourth component besides anode, electrolyte and cathode. Acting as a stimulus, the nickel foil self-regulates the battery\u2019s temperature and reactivity which allows for 10-minute fast charging on just about any EV battery, Wang explained. \u201cTrue fast-charging batteries would have immediate impact,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cSince there are not enough raw minerals for every internal combustion engine car to be replaced by a 150 kWh-equipped EV, fast charging is imperative for EVs to go mainstream.\u201d The study\u2019s partner, EC Power, is working to manufacture and commercialize the fast-charging battery for an affordable and sustainable future of vehicle electrification, Wang said. The other coauthors on the study are Teng Liu, Xiao-Guang Yang, Shanhai Ge and Yongjun Leng of Penn State and Nathaniel Stanley, Eric Rountree and Brian McCarthy of EC Power. The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force and the William E. Diefenderfer Endowment.", "other news sites6": "Researchers at the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with colleagues in Austria, report that tetrataenite, a \u201ccosmic magnet\u201d that takes millions of years to develop naturally in meteorites, can potentially be used instead of rare earth materials in magnets. Previously, attempts to make tetrataenite in the laboratory have depended on extreme and impractical methods, but the researchers say they have found a way to bypass those prior techniques by using phosphorus. In a research paper published in the journal Advanced Science, they suggest there is a possibility to produce tetrataenite artificially and at scale without any specialized treatment or expensive techniques. \u201cRare earth\u201d is a misleading term that is sort of an inside joke among organic chemistry aficionados. It refers to a group of elements on the periodic table. \u201cNoble gases\u201d is another term that has little meaning except to organic chemists. In truth, \u201crare earth\u201d elements aren\u2019t all that rare in the grand scheme of things, but extracting them and purifying them is a challenge. Rare Earth Materials And Permanent Magnets The real reason why this news is important is that rare earth materials are critical to making the permanent magnets that are an essential component of the electric motors that the transition to an emissions free economy depends upon. The sticking point is that China, with it predilection for dominating so many of the manufacturing processes for making electric vehicles, solar panels, and other critical technologies needed to address an overheating planet, controls over 80% of the world market for rare earth elements. We know the danger of allowing tyrants in Saudi Arabia and Russia to control our access to fossil fuels. That experience suggests letting China be the gatekeeper for the new technologies we need to transfer away from relying on fossil fuels may be similarly fraught with danger in the future. Professor Lindsay Greer of the materials science and metallurgy department at Cambridge University tells Innovation News Network, \u201cRare earth deposits exist elsewhere, but the mining operations are highly disruptive, as you have to extract a huge amount of material to get a small volume of rare earths. Between the environmental impacts and the heavy reliance on China, there\u2019s been an urgent search for alternative materials that do not require rare earths.\u201d One of the most promising alternatives for permanent magnets is tetrataenite, an iron-nickel alloy with an ordered atomic structure. The material forms over millions of years as a meteorite slowly cools. This offers the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, resulting in a material with magnetic properties similar to those of rare earth magnets. In the 1960s, tetrataenite was artificially formed by blasting iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, which allowed the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking. However, this technique is unsuitable for mass production. \u201cSince then, scientists have been fascinated with getting that ordered structure, but it\u2019s always felt like something that was very far away,\u201d Greer says. Over the years, many scientists have attempted to make tetrataenite on an industrial scale, but the results have been disappointing. Now Greer and his colleagues from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and the Montanuniversit\u00e4t in Leoben, have found a potential alternative that avoids these extreme methods. Taking A Closer Look The team studied the mechanical properties of iron-nickel alloys containing small amounts of phosphorus, which is present in meteorites. Inside these materials were a pattern of phases that indicated the expected tree-like growth structure called dendrites. \u201cFor most people, it would have ended there: nothing interesting to see in the dendrites, but when I looked closer, I saw an interesting diffraction pattern indicating an ordered atomic structure,\u201d said first author Dr Yurii Ivanov, who completed the work while at Cambridge and is now based at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa. Initially, the diffraction pattern of tetrataenite looks like the structure expected for iron-nickel alloys, namely a disordered crystal not of interest as a high-performance magnet. But when Ivanov looked closer, he identified the tetrataenite. According to the team, phosphorus allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years. They were able to accelerate tetrataenite formation by between 11 and 15 orders of magnitude by mixing iron, nickel, and phosphorus in the right quantities. This meant the material was able to form over a few seconds in a simple casting. \u201cWhat was so astonishing was that no special treatment was needed. We just melted the alloy, poured it into a mold, and we had tetrataenite,\u201d says Greer. \u201cThe previous view in the field was that you couldn\u2019t get tetrataenite unless you did something extreme, because otherwise, you\u2019d have to wait millions of years for it to form. This result represents a total change in how we think about this material.\u201d Although the research is promising, more work is needed to decide whether it will be suitable for high performance magnets. The team is hoping to collaborate with major magnet manufacturers to determine this. The Takeaway Why do we write about topics that are not yet out of the laboratory stage? Because the breakthroughs happening in labs around the world today will be critical to the transition away from burning fossil fuels as the basis of the global economy and human existence. New types of batteries that are lighter, more powerful, faster charging, less expensive, and kinder to the environment are being researched in hundreds of laboratories all around the world as you read this. We don\u2019t know where the breakthroughs will occur but we know they will come, just as those first crude internal combustion gasoline and diesel engines became the ultra-sophisticated machines that power hundreds of millions of vehicles today. There are electric motors that do not rely on permanent magnets, but in general they are more costly than permanent magnet motors. If there is a way to duplicate their performance with inexpensive materials that are readily available to all manufacturers without one country dominating the supply chain, that is good news for us all. The odds are, by 2030 electric cars will have taken a quantum leap forward as more and more new innovations become commercially available. We can\u2019t wait!

Chinese researchers at Southwest Jiaotong University in Chengdu, Sichuan province, performed road tests last week for modified passenger cars that use magnets to float 35 millimeters above a conductor rail, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. The researchers outfitted the sedans with powerful magnets on the vehicle floors, allowing them to levitate over a conductor rail nearly five miles in length. Eight cars in total were tested, with one test reaching speeds of roughly 143 miles per hour, according to the report. A video posted to Twitter by a Chinese journalist shows the vehicles floating \u2014 albeit bumpily \u2014 along the track: Xinhua says the tests were run by government transportation authorities to study safety measures for high-speed driving. But Deng Zigang, one of the university professors who developed the vehicles, told the state news agency that using magnetic levitation for passenger vehicles has the potential to reduce energy usage and increase the vehicles' range. That could be useful for the electric vehicle industry's issues with \"range anxiety,\" or when consumers fear they won't be able to complete a trip in an electric vehicle without running out of power.", "other news sites8": "In its Q2 2022 PV Supplier Market Intelligence Program Report (SMIP), solar and storage supply technical advisory Clean Energy Associates (CEA) said polysilicon production capacity may reach 295 GW by the end of 2022, and 536 GW year\u2019s end 2023. CEA said it expects this production capacity to far exceed solar installations next year. While this may suggest supply problems could begin to be alleviated, CEA said module capacity expansions are slowing. Many manufacturers are instead expanding cell production capacity, catering to the trend of n-type TOPCon and HJT manufacturing. Ingot capacity grew almost 30 GW this quarter, most of which can be attributed to two facilities bringing 23 GW online. Wafer capacity decreased slightly, said CEA, primarily due to a major provider retiring its multi-crystalline wafer capacity. The 17 suppliers covered in the report boosted cell capacity by 22% in Q2 2022, bringing 47 GW of capacity online, reaching a total of 262 GW. Module production reached 324 GW in Q2. CEA forecasts this may expand 20% by the end of the year, reaching 400 GW. Only seven suppliers covered by the CEA report are fully vertically integrated from ingot to module production, with most others operating at the cell and module link in the supply chain. \u201cWith growing merchant wafer options, there is little need for most suppliers to expand upstream,\u201d said CEA. The report said suppliers are working to optimize wafer sizes after the industry standardized 210 mm (G12) and 182 mm (M10) module dimensions. The \u201c182 mm Plus\u201d (182P) has increased wafer heights to further reduce \u201cwhite space\u201d caused by intercell gaps to achieve up to 5 W of additional output, said CEA. The \u201c210 mm Reduced\u201d (210R) reduced wafer widths for niche rooftop applications at the expense of power output. CEA said it expects new module sizes for the residential solar market to be introduced. Many analysts have predicted China will break 100 GW of installations this year. CEA expects slightly lower installations in China during 2022 due to high module prices impacting utility-scale projects. It said many investment decisions have been deferred as projects could not meet their internal rate of return thresholds. Most of the polysilicon supply chain originates in China. Outside of China, production capacities are 11 GW of ingot, 42 GW of cell, and 50 GW of module capacity. By end of 2023, these capacities are expected to expand to 23 GW, 73 GW, and 74 GW, respectively. \u201cPolicy uncertainties continue to defer expansion plans of suppliers as they remain cautious due to lingering policy uncertainty in the United States surrounding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and anticircumvention investigation,\u201d said CEA in the report.", "other news sites9": "While you may notice more electric vehicles on the road today than ever before, the technology is now making its way to miners, the companies extracting the critical minerals needed to build EVs, ensure adequate global food supply, etc. A new contract to supply battery electric vehicles to the Jansen potash project (potentially the world\u2019s largest potash mine) expects to slash carbon emissions in half compared to its peers. What if we could apply this technology to miners in the EV industry, creating a full circle sustainable supply chain? BHP\u2019s Jansen potash project is expected to be the largest of its kind, with initial capacity forecasts of 4.3 to 4.5 Mtpa. Potash is often found in fertilizer and is a rich source of potassium, a mineral essential for our health. Since potassium is not produced by the body naturally, it must be consumed through food. Potash is the most commonly used potassium fertilizer, but over 70% is based on conventional underground mining that uses heavy-duty equipment to extract it. Although underground mining can release half the CO2 emissions of open-pit mining, the company is taking it further by introducing several battery electric vehicles. Normet Canada, the mining company behind the project, was awarded a new contract to use battery electric vehicles at the Jansen potash project, including 10 underground EV loaders and one electric tethered loader. With these heavy-duty electric vehicles, BHP says the Jansen project is forecast to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% compared to the Saskatchewan potash mine. The electric vehicle deliveries are expected to begin in March 2023 and run through 2024, which will work perfectly as the miners aim to start production in 2026. Like potassium is critical for humans, electric vehicles also require certain minerals such as lithium and nickel. These miners are looking for ways to build on the momentum electric vehicles are establishing in reducing carbon emissions, completing a complete sustainability supply chain. Several companies are now working to make this a reality. Normet electric mining equipment (Source: Normet) Miners using electric vehicles can complete the sustainability supply chain Almost every automaker has set its intentions to scale production of its electric vehicles to meet the growing demand for zero-emission cars while setting carbon reduction targets. For example, GM is going all-electric by 2035, Ford looks to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026, and Volkswagen plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2035, while North America follows. Tesla, only selling electric cars, continues breaking records with 343,000 EVs delivered in Q3 on its way to producing 20 million annually. However, getting to these numbers will require mining. A few companies have already begun working to build a sustainable EV supply chain. Snow Lake Lithium outlined its plans in February to develop the world\u2019s first all-electric lithium mine, one of the most critical minerals used to build EV batteries. The mining company\u2019s CEO said at the time if you are going to mine for these resources that will be used to protect the environment, then obtaining them must also be done in a sustainable matter. The company is working with Meglab, an electrical equipment provider and mining solutions company, to make the dream a reality. There are operations around the world working to reduce emissions in the mining sector. In July 2021, Opibus (now ROAM) converted a Toyota Land Cruiser fitted with an electric powertrain to use a mining vehicle. Miners using electric vehicles can significantly reduce the heat and carbon exposure they typically experience with diesel-powered equipment. Furthermore, EV mining technology can cost less as it requires less ventilation and cooling. The point is, as the auto industry transitions to electric vehicles, companies are figuring out ways to build on the momentum EVs are establishing in reducing emissions. If miners get on board, it will come full circle, creating a complete sustainable EV supply chain.", "other news sites10": "A research group led by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has proposed a new approach to utilize connective heat transfer for solar module cooling in large-scale solar power plants. Their modeling considers factors such as row spacing, panel height, and tilt angle. It also uses a length scale input to characterize the space through which air moves around or through the solar modules. In the standard models, by contrast, the length often used is a ratio of module dimensions, which ignores PV plant configuration. \u201cThe convective heat transfer curve was generated through computational flow simulations and wind tunnel experiments that allowed for convective heat transfer to be described for a lacunarity length scale value that describes the spacing of the entire PV array through a single length unit,\u201d the scientists said, claiming that using the lacunarity length scale leads to 1.5% more accurate power production. Their techno-economic analysis considered 1 MW south-facing PV systems located in Phoenix, Arizona, with a fixed tilt angle of 30 degrees over different row spacings, or ground coverage ratio (GCR). The annual land lease cost was assumed at $0.054/m2. The row spacing of the PV plants was varied from two to 11 meters, corresponding to GCR values of 0.73 to 0.08. \u201cIncreasing spacing could enable more varieties of crops and more types of agricultural equipment to be utilized in agrivoltaic systems,\u201d said Jordan Macknick, who leads a different NREL research project focused on agrivoltaics. \u201cThat could potentially make these spaced-out solar systems more cost-effective and compatible with larger-scale agriculture.\u201d Popular content Through the modeling, the group ascertained that the optimal levelized cost of energy (LCOE) point was $0.29/kWh, with row spacing varying between 4.83 and 7.34 meters.

The group found that the greatest LCOE improvements were registered in climates with low average annual ambient temperatures and moderate to high average annual wind speeds across the US. They presented the modeling in the study \u201cTechnoeconomic Analysis of Changing PV Array Convective Cooling Through Changing Array Spacing,\u201d recently published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.

Devices watch the frequency and adjust their power output according to the frequency's changes. Credit: NREL During a power outage or after a disaster, it is hard to beat the simplicity of a diesel generator. Just supply fuel and start it up\u2014so easy, anyone could do it. Renewable microgrids, on the other hand, are not so simple, with their suite of controls, software, and asset coordination. But the beauty of renewables is that fuel is free and already available on-site, even in remote disaster areas. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has now published a description of the improvised controls that saved NREL during its own outage, which could make microgrids easy and low cost where they are needed most. The publication, titled \"Unleashing the Frequency: Multi-Megawatt Demonstration of 100% Renewable Power Systems with Decentralized Communication-less Control Scheme,\" describes a microgrid approach that sidesteps the central controller\u2014an expensive and complicated component\u2014and its reliance on communications, instead using native controls of battery, solar, and wind systems. \"NREL's approach makes it possible to assemble devices into a microgrid without arduous configuration, relying on just renewable energy and amateur electrical experience\u2014perfect for recoveries in a pinch,\" said Przemyslaw Koralewicz, NREL engineer and co-developer of the communication-less method. A low-cost recovery resource When NREL experienced a surprise power outage, the laboratory had few options for recovery: No microgrid controller and no preconfigured setup. Just a large battery, solar panels, and wind turbines. Other campuses\u2014or districts, neighborhoods, and homes\u2014could find themselves in similar circumstances, and during an outage is no time to be fumbling with complicated configurations. Like NREL, communities can now implement a resilient microgrid off the cuff, using controls that exist on essentially any energy resource. While microgrids are an apparent answer for recovery and resilience, the costs of a controller present a barrier to communities. In 2019, NREL found that microgrid controllers have a mean cost of $155,000/megawatt, potentially putting resilient microgrids out of reach for vulnerable areas. Besides costs, controllers introduce a tangle of communications and system settings, often opaque, proprietary, and designed to suit particular scenarios. These features can be useful for minimizing energy use and costs, but recoveries often call for a quick-and-ready option. NREL's method prioritizes fail-safe startup, foregoing elaborate programs and communications in favor of exceedingly basic controls, while still allowing more advanced designs to be built on top. Developers of the communication-less microgrid method observe the NREL Flatirons Campus' battery energy storage systems. Credit: Dennis Schroeder, NREL How does it work? NREL's scheme is decentralized\u2014the devices do not exchange data or issue commands (i.e., they are \"communication-less\"). Instead, devices self-regulate using system frequency as the common language. In short, a battery or other power source forms the grid by supplying power at a set frequency. Other generators like solar panels and wind turbines follow the grid by watching frequency and changing their power accordingly. The method is nothing too new\u2014so-called \"droop\" controls are familiar in standard fossil fuel generators\u2014which is part of the appeal. The NREL researchers showed that the method works with 100% renewable energy, can be scaled, and is feasible with most any energy device. What is innovative is that NREL's method frees the grid frequency from a tight 60 hertz (Hz). Unbound by mechanical rotation, the microgrid frequency can take a wider range. In fact, that range is precisely how the devices coordinate without communicating: As frequency rises past 60 Hz, generators reduce power. At even higher frequencies, the generators reduce their power further, rebalancing the frequency around 60 Hz. The system self-stabilizes, never overcharging the batteries or underserving the loads. If this sounds more difficult than a diesel generator, it might be. It still requires some device programming and parameter setting, which are detailed in the report. \"NREL's method is the very first step in a design that could become the standard for fail-safe microgrids,\" Koralewicz said. \"Our communication-less method could be natively configured in future devices or possibly certified for easy access by operators. With standardized adoption, microgrids of any type\u2014military bases, hospital backups, even networked districts\u2014could count on an unfailing foundation to their day-to-day operations.\" The frontier of renewable energy systems At the frontier of power systems, engineers are addressing the technical matters of operating the grid with mostly renewables. Outstanding questions relate to inverters, which are the power electronic devices that interface renewable energy to the grid, and particularly, how inverters can form the grid in ways that fossil-based resources traditionally have. The UNIFI consortium is taking on the inverter challenge with the combined effort of dozens of research institutions, led by NREL. NREL's communication-less method is one example of a grid-forming strategy, the sort that will be needed as systems push toward higher levels of renewables. In proposing the method, NREL is breaking ground into some of the trickier topics that confront UNIFI and power systems everywhere, such as how to handle grid protection and which controls should be essential on grid-forming devices. The authors approach these questions in the report, offering one direction that future energy systems can take on the path to decarbonization.", "techcrunch13": "Ford said Wednesday it has reached a deal with DTE Energy to power its electricity supply in Michigan with clean energy, a step toward its goal to become carbon neutral by 2050. The automaker\u2019s deal with DTE, Michigan\u2019s largest producer of renewable energy, will add 650 megawatts of new solar energy capacity in the state by 2025, allowing the carmaker to assemble each vehicle it makes there with renewable energy. Ford called the deal the largest-ever renewable energy purchase from a utility in the U.S. The arrangement will help Ford decarbonize its operations and meet its sustainability goals, including a target to power all of its global facilities with renewable energy by 2035. Ford said the purchase will help it cut its carbon dioxide emissions by up to 600,000 tons. Overall, Ford\u2019s arrangement with DTE will increase Michigan\u2019s solar capacity by 70%, according to the automaker.

A team from various universities and institutes in the Netherlands made the breakthrough with a tandem solar cell that compliments traditional silicon-based cells \u2013 which have an energy conversion efficiency of around 22 per cent \u2013 with the widely-acclaimed properties of perovskite. The researchers said that achieving greater than 30 per cent efficiency with the four-terminal tandem device marked \u201ca big step in accelerating the energy transition\u201d and would improve energy security by reducing fossil fuel dependency. \u201cThis type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93 per cent of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device,\u201d said Dr Mehrdad Najafi from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). \u201cThis performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.\u201d Perovskite has been hailed for its potential to transform an array of industries, ranging from ultra-high-speed communications to renewable energy production. The researchers behind the latest solar cell record now hope to commercialise the technology to achieve a widespread roll-out. \u201cNow we know the ingredients and are able to control the layers that are needed to reach over 30 per cent efficiency,\u201d said Professor Gianluca Coletti, program manager of Tandem PV. \u201cOnce combined with the scalability expertise and knowledge gathered in the past years to bring material and processes to a large area, we can focus with our industrial partners to bring this technology efficiencies beyond 30 per cent into mass production.\u201d The results were presented at the World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion (WCPEC-8) in Milan.", "other news sites15": "This week, the US Department of Energy's Berkeley Lab released its annual analysis of solar energy in the US. It found that nearly half the generating capacity was installed in the US during 2021 and is poised to dominate future installs. That's in part because costs have dropped by more than 75 percent since 2010; it's now often cheaper to build and operate a solar plant than it is to simply buy fuel for an existing natural gas plant. The analysis was performed before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains many incentives and tax breaks that should expand solar's advantages in the coming years. Solar, by the numbers In terms of large, utility-scale solar installs, the US added over 12.5 gigawatts of new capacity last year, bringing the total installed capacity to over 50 gigawatts. Texas led the way, with about a third of the total capacity added (3.9 GW) going online in the Lone Star State. Combined with residential and other distributed solar installations, solar alone accounted for 45 percent of the new generating capacity added to the grid last year. Advertisement That growth showed up in figures on how much energy solar supplies. Five states now receive more than 15 percent of their electricity from solar power, including Massachusetts and Vermont, with California receiving 25 percent of its electricity from the Sun. Solar's expansion has largely been driven by falling costs. The DOE estimates that the price of building a solar plant has been dropping by an average of about 10 percent a year, leading to a fall of over 75 percent since 2010. That has left prices averaging about $1.35 for each watt of capacity in 2021. Large-scale plants benefit the most, with projects over 50 megawatts costing about 20 percent less than those under 20 MW. The drop in prices is causing some somewhat odd trends, driven by the fact that it's becoming increasingly economical to install large facilities in states that don't get as much sun, like Maine, Michigan, and Wisconsin. As a result, the past several years have seen the average incoming energy at newly constructed facilities (measured as daily kilowatt-hours per square meter) drop by about 20 percent. That has helped cause a large spread in what's called the capacity factor, which is calculated by dividing the amount of energy produced at a facility by the maximum energy it could have generated if it produced 24 hours a day. The median capacity factor of solar plants in the US was 24 percent, but outliers were as low as 9 percent and as high as 35 percent. As prices continue to fall, this spread may become more pronounced, with more plants at the low end of the range.", "other news sites16": "Siemens Gamesa\u2019s 14-222 DD offshore wind turbine prototype has, according to the Spanish-German wind giant today, set a world record for the most power output by a single wind turbine in a 24-hour period: 359 megawatt-hours.

The 100, 422 dwt bulker, owned by Japanese shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), was delivered on October 7, 2022. The vessel is the first of its kind and it heralds a new era in modern shipping as wind propulsion marks its return as a sustainable power source. Related Article Posted: 4 months ago World\u2019s 1st ship equipped with \u2018Wind Challenger\u2019 delivered Posted: 4 months ago Shofu Maru is fitted with the so-called Wind Challenger system, a telescoping hard sail that harnesses wind power to propel the vessel. The system converts wind energy directly to a propulsive force. The installation of the sail on merchant ships has the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption, which in turn reduces GHG emissions by about 5-8%. The sail can be shortened and extended (55 meters in length) adapting automatically to the wind conditions on board as it can rotate 360 degrees. The vessel was greeted in the Port of Newcastle by a delegation of port officials and diplomatic dignitaries, including Consul-General of Japan in Sydney Tokuda Shuichi, Deputy Secretary of Safety, Environment and Regulation at Transport for NSW Tara McCarthy and MOL Managing Executive Officer for East/South East Asia and Oceania Nobuo Shiotsu.

In independent tests, they seem legit. Distributed energy generation stands to play a growing part in the world's energy markets. Most of this currently comes in the form of rooftop solar, but in certain areas, wind could definitely play a bigger part. Not every spot is appropriate for a bladed wind turbine, though, and in this regard, University of Houston spinoff Aeromine Technologies has designed a very different, very tidy form of rooftop wind energy capture that looks like it could be a real game-changer. As with traditional wind turbines, size is key. So while Aeromine's wind energy boxes take up a relatively small footprint on your roof, they're still pretty bulky. The wings themselves are maybe 10 feet (3 m) high, at a rough guess, and looking at the latest imagery they're now sitting on top of boxes that might add another 6 ft (1.8 m) or more to their height \u2013 so they're no shrinking violets. On the other hand, they don't create the noise, or the constantly moving visual distraction of a regular, bladed turbine, so they may prove to be less unwelcome in populated areas. They work differently too \u2013 kind of like a set of race-car spoiler wings sandwiched together facing each other, with a round pole in between them. Angled into the wind, these stationary wings generate a low pressure vacuum in the center of the device, which sucks air through perforations either in the wings themselves or in the round pole, which also aids in accelerating the ambient airflow over the wings. (rendered image) the design places a couple of racecar spolier-like wings in a sandwich orientation, to create a low-pressure vacuum that sucks air through from below. The turbine is thus kept out of harm's way Aeromine So where's the turbine? Depending on the installation, it can either be at the bottom of that central pole, surrounded by a duct, or in more compact designs that sit right down on the roof instead of up on top of a box, the fan can be down in the roof of the building itself, in a pipe connecting either to that central pole or to hollow chambers in the perforated wings. Either way, the wings create a low-pressure zone, air is sucked through a tube to fill that low-pressure zone, and Aeromine places a relatively small, cheap internal propeller (perhaps 36 inches/91 cm in diameter) in that tube to run a generator. It's very quiet, very safe and very cheap to build; you don't need any fancy materials like carbon fiber, there's nothing special about the fan itself, and the whole thing comes apart for transport and a relatively simple construction process on site. Aeromine hasn't yet nominated a standard capacity for its devices in their latest iteration \u2013 indeed, we had to go digging to find much information at all about the device. But in a solution presented to the AFWERX Reimagining Energy challenge in January 2021, these units were each rated for 5 kW \u2013 pretty close to the output of a typical 21-panel, household rooftop solar system. Multiple units can of course be run along the leading edge of a building, spaced around 15 ft (4.6 m) apart, and each unit in this (now outdated) AFWERX challenge promised to generate around 14.3 MWh annually. Just for perspective, my 6.5-kW home rooftop solar system makes somewhere around 9 MWh a year. Aeromine Wind-Harvesting Unit, installed as a pilot trial on top of BASF's manufacturing facilities in Wyandotte, Michigan. We expect the large box at the bottom will disappear in commercial applications, with the air intake and turbine running below the roof line Aeromine The potential here is pretty clear; solar and wind work well in a complementary fashion. Solar's only generating during the sunniest hours, wind can be 24 hours but is totally dependent on conditions. The small rooftop footprint of an Aeromine system makes it possible to cover the rest of the roof in solar panels, then get some on-site battery storage happening and run a decent-sized business more or less off the grid. So what are the downsides? Well, these things need to be installed in spots where the wind direction is pretty constant, because they don't angle themselves to catch a breeze \u2013 and they probably never will, since they're designed to be such a cost-conscious machine. Their height might make them a visual or civic planning issue in some areas, and what's more, they'll cast shadows, which will block the sun from reaching rooftop PV panels unless the building is oriented such that the sun comes from one side and the wind from the other. So there's certainly going to be a limited number of places where they'll work optimally in a hybrid system. But that's about it at first glance. They're certainly cheaper, hardier, safer and less intrusive than windmill-style designs, and they offer a highly-accessible way to introduce reliable wind energy into a distributed power system. (Rendered image) Many Aeromine units can be run together, with proper spacing, and there's plenty of rooftop left for solar panels to run a hybrid system Aeromine Before getting too excited about any strange new wind energy tech, it's always worth revisiting Mike Barnard's excellent checklist to weed out dodgy wind power claims. Written in 2013, it's as relevant as ever today as more and more money flows into clean energy tech. Aeromine fares well against the Barnard test. With the University of Houston behind it, it has also submitted its gear to the gold-standard Sandia National Laboratories for testing \u2013 indeed Sandia has been involved directly in the development. It claims to harvest no more than 1/3 to 1/2 of the Betz limit of potential wind energy. A technical performance analysis prepared in partnership with Sandia, using wind tunnels at Texas Tech University, states that \"by sweeping a large area of wind with a reliable design, AeroMINEs overcome the challenges that have plagued other distributed wind solutions and have hindered distributed wind from playing a significant role in energy markets.\" The report also notes a boost in energy extraction, coupled with some aerodynamic instability, when the airflow reaches the device from higher angles of attack. Aeromine motionless wind unit Aeromine says that BASF is testing the system at its manufacturing plant in Wyandotte, Michigan \u2013 although it doesn't say how many units have been installed, or of what capacity. Hunting through the satellite overlays in Google Maps, it seems that the pilot test unit in the video above is situated right here, judging by the unique markings on the roof \u2013 but the satellite image isn't recent enough to show the wind power system, so we can't figure out much more. We expect this extra-tall unit sitting on a box is simply a temporary prototype designed to be super-easy to add and remove, where the final product will sit flush against the roof and have its piping and turbine installed under the surface. We wish Aeromine would be more forthcoming in its marketing. Either way, despite the limited information the company is willing to release at this point, this looks like it could be an impressive step forward for distributed rooftop wind energy. We hope Aeromine proves capable of scaling this tech up and making a serious contribution in the race to zero carbon. Check out a short video from Sandia below.

The Beyond Zero Emissions report argues that the vast bulk of Australia\u2019s emissions reduction task can be met by a combination of six technologies, all available today: solar PV, wind, batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps and electrolysers. BZE says the \u201cambitious but achievable\u201d plan relies on ramping up the rollout rates of these technologies over the coming five years, in some cases quite significantly, and would be supported by targeted \u201ccarbon drawdown initiatives.\u201d The fast-tracking of the rollout of these technologies required to hit the 81% emissions reduction mark would include a doubling of the current rate of deployment of solar panels, and EV uptake boosted to 14 times its current levels. The uptake of heat pumps for water heating and air conditioning would need to be increased by 37 times, the report says, in line with calls from electrification and energy efficiency advocates to ho hard at a household level to cut emissions. Two appliances per household \u201cThis plan sets the ambition, establishes the job potential and demonstrates the opportunity of acting without delay for industry and manufacturing, business and households,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn the next five years, we need to install clean technology in our homes, vehicles and industries at a rate of about two units or appliances per household,\u201d it adds. \u201cWe cannot afford to wait for new research and inventions, and we don\u2019t need to.\u201d Across households and businesses this looks something like, 10 million-plus units of hot water and air conditioning heat pumps, 2.9 million units of building efficiency technologies, 7,000 units of industrial-scale tech, such as heat pumps and electrolysers, and 3.8 million units of transport \u2013 mostly electric vehicles and chargers. On renewables and storage, which BZE says will be the foundation of success for its emissions \u201celimination\u201d plan, the reports calls for the installation of about 6,000 wind turbines and 66 million solar panels over the coming five years.

However, you may notice a significant difference this year as emission-free electric school buses roll out across the United States. One of the nation\u2019s leading school bus manufacturers, Thomas Built Buses, just achieved a major milestone with help from its Virginia-based dealer Sonny Merryman \u2014 Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley electric school buses have now driven more than 500,000 miles. Electric school buses are designed for a cleaner, sustainable future. Not only do they produce zero emissions, but they are also more efficient, can cost less to maintain, and have abilities their gas-powered counterparts lack. 450,000 yellow school buses across the United States travel over 4.3 billion miles each year, according to information from the US Department of Transportations National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). More importantly, toxic emissions from traditional school buses can harm students, bus drivers, and the communities they drive in. Although the EPA has introduced stricter standards, it\u2019s not enough as many school buses still emit harmful diesel exhaust. With federal funding more accessible than ever for electric school buses, making the transition makes sense. As of June 2022, 38 states had adopted electric school buses thanks to several initiatives such as the $5 billion Clean School Bus program. Meanwhile, states like Virginia are taking the initiative to provide funding and accelerate the transition. For example, in 2019, Virginia\u2019s Governor Ralph Northam and Dominion Energy announced an initiative to provide 13,000 electric school buses by the end of 2030. Through programs like these, Virginia has grown to become the country\u2019s second-largest electric bus fleet, currently operating 64 Thomas Built electric school buses. In a significant milestone, the electric school buses have now traveled over 500,000 miles, with more buses expected to be delivered as the school year progresses. Growth of electric school buses in Virginia Source: Sonny Merryman Thomas Built Buses achieves 500,000 electric miles in Virginia The first electric school bus to roll out in the state of Virginia was Thomas Built Buses\u2019 Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley in November 2020. One C2 Jouley electric bus can transport 81 students with up to 138 miles of range and a 226 kWh standard battery capacity. Virginia now has 64 electric buses in total. The first 50 were purchased and deployed through the Dominion Energy program, and the remaining 14 were bought using funds from the American Power electric school bus program. The 500,000 miles driven include several different terrains (city, rural, and hills) and distances from less than 20 miles to more than 90 miles. Although the electric buses have primarily been used for regular school routes, a few have made their way to field trips, band competitions, and more. By using electric buses for these trips, 447.7 short tons of greenhouse gases were avoided, according to the AFLEET tool. Through the experience so far, Thomas Built Buses dealer Sonny Merryman and its customers have learned a few critical takeaways that can help others deploy electric buses safely and efficiently: Properly train drivers and technicians for a smooth transition. Consider assigning a partner or team to help with the deployment. Perhaps, most importantly, the electric buses have withstood various operational tests, and drivers who have switched to the electric Jouley school buses have loved them so far, according to the school bus dealer. Electrek\u2019s Take First things first, congratulations to Thomas Built Buses and Sonny Merryman on the huge milestone. Electric school buses protect students and communities from harmful emissions while saving school districts money on fuel and maintenance in the long run. At the same time, I think there is a major takeaway from this case study. State funding works, and electric buses are the future. Virginia is proving it. California has proved it.

Oz Minerals aims to reach 100 per cent renewable power at the remote mine \u2013 located in Western Australia near the borders with South Australia and the Northern Territory \u2013 and will start off by providing more than 80 per cent of its power needs from what will be the world\u2019s biggest renewable energy micro-grid. Modelling done so far indicates an optimal mix of around 60MW of solar and 90MW of wind, along with a sizeable battery \u2013 although the specifications of the battery have yet to be finalised. Oz Minerals believes this configuration will allow the mine and its processing plant to run on \u201cdiesel off\u201d or \u201crenewables only\u201d for extended periods. The size of the battery will likely be decided by the extent to which the company can tailor the operators of the mine and processing plant to when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining, and how much of excess output can afford to be spilled. See this story for more information on that: Mopping up spilled energy: Mining giant looks to take next step to 100% renewables Largest renewable micro grid in world All this will make it one of the largest operations in the world running on wind and solar only, and its \u201cgame changing\u201d operations will be highly informative for the operators of Australia\u2019s national grid which intend to follow the same path over the next decade. The recognition that wind and solar can play such a significant role even \u2013 or perhaps especially \u2013 in such a remote location has been one of the decisive factors helping OZ Minerals commit to one of the world\u2019s lowest cost and lowest emission operations. The cost is important, and so are the emissions, given the Oz Minerals intends to \u201cride the global electrification wave\u201d and target the surging demand for nickel and copper for electric vehicles, along with the boom in wind, solar and storage in the grid. The cost of powering such plants with diesel \u2013 or gas via a new pipeline \u2013 would have been prohibitive. And by focusing on renewables and solar, Oz Minerals has absolute clarity on its electricity costs for the life of the mine. The West Musgrave transport fleet will initially be powered by fossil fuels, but the company intends to switch to electrify the haul truck fleet at the first opportunity, likely to be the first engine change-out. It hopes to increase the penetration of renewables to reach net zero scope 1 emissions well before 2038, and expects technology advancements will help it make the leap from 80 per cent to full renewables, most likely in the areas of storage. Low cost and low emissions Oz Minerals has actually been looking at the renewables options for West Musgrave for many years \u2013 we first wrote about it in 2018 \u2013 because it knew then that powering the mine with fossil fuels wasn\u2019t a viable option. It has long recognised that at such a remote location a big share of renewables was the key to helping it deliver one of the world\u2019s lower cost and lowest emissions copper and nickel mining projects. The fact that it will supply a low emissions supply of nickel and copper will be important for the electric vehicle markets that it intends to tap into, because EV makes also want to ensure their supply chains are low carbon too. Oz Minerals is currently seeking bids from vendors before finalising the best mix of wind, solar, battery and diesel, and will then sign a long term power purchase agreement with an option to buy the energy component outright at a later date.

The complex cooling technique, which has been developed to help certain electrical systems in space maintain proper temperatures, can deliver almost five times the current of other electric vehicle chargers currently on the market, NASA said in a blog post. Higher electrical currents generate more heat, meaning the more current flowing, the higher likelihood of components overheating. NASA's complex heat transfer system, known as \"subcooled flow boiling,\" can cool cables carrying high charges, potentially allowing for a faster flow of electricity without the risk of components overheating, according to the blog post. In the blog, NASA said the system had been developed to help deliver \"nuclear fission power systems for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond; vapor compression heat pumps to support Lunar and Martian habitats; and systems to provide thermal control and advanced life support onboard spacecraft.\" Current charging time for EVs range from less than 20 minutes at some public fast charging stations to days or hours when using at-home chargers. NASA claims the new heat transfer system could reduce the charging time at charging stations to just five minutes. NASA said in a blog post: \"Application of this new technology resulted in unprecedented reduction of the time required to charge a vehicle and may remove one of the key barriers to worldwide adoption of electric vehicles.\" The US government has been ramping up investment in electric car charging to meet its target of installing 500,000 electric-car chargers across the country by 2030.

(AP Photo/Jens Meyer, file) BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Germany wants to massively expand the country\u2019s charging network for electric cars, spending 6.3 billion euros ($6.17 billion) over the next three years as it expects more and more drivers to turn away from combustion cars to more climate-friendly vehicles. The country\u2019s transportation minister on Wednesday presented a \u201cmaster plan\u201d for improving the charging infrastructure that had been passed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019 cabinet earlier in the day. \u201cWe are not just any automotive location, but a leading one in the world. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to us that what we\u2019re preparing succeeds well,\u201d Volker Wissing told reporters in Berlin. \u201cWe need a forward-looking expansion of the nationwide charging infrastructure that meets demand and is user-friendly.\u201d The share of electric vehicles in Germany grew 24.8% year-on-year to a total share of 14.6% of all newly registered automobiles, according to figures released by the country\u2019s Federal Office for Motor Vehicles. ADVERTISEMENT There are around 70,000 charging points in the country but only 11,000 of those are fast-chargers, the ministry said. That is not enough to sufficiently fulfill the current needs, and it will be even less so as the number of electric cars grows quickly. There is also a big difference in availability of charging points between big cities and rural areas, where it is even harder to find charging stations. The German government\u2019s goal is to have 1 million publicly accessible charging points in the country by 2030. In order to boost the number of charging points, the federal government will, among other initiatives provide real estate, especially along highways, where new charging stations can be built. Private owners of electric cars will be offered subsidized plans to install solar energy panels at their homes to charge their cars overnight. Electric charging is also supposed to get more user-friendly with new digital offers showing drivers where they can charge their cars on the road or being able to check online how much the different charging points demand, the minister said. Another issue the government wants to tackle is getting the country\u2019s electric grid ready for the increased demand as more people turn to electric cars. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWe are expecting an exponential increase in registered vehicles with battery electric drive in the next few years and must prepare accordingly,\u201d the minister said. Switching Germans from combustion-engine automobiles to electric cars plays a key role in achieving the government\u2019s climate targets set for the transport sector. The transformation to electric cars has also been boosted by a mix of regulatory pressure, tax breaks, improving battery range, and a wider range of vehicles to purchase. Europe in general is leading the push into battery-powered cars as electric vehicles enter the mainstream and has promised to phase out internal combustion cars by 2035. But availability of charging points is a problem not just in Germany but almost everywhere across the continent.

As an example, recently one HJT company conducted an online pitching and according to them almost 800 people joined that call,\u201d it added. So far this year, the output of polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules has already beaten the achievements of the Chinese PV industry in 2021 by some 50%. \u201cBy June, module shipments of the TOP 10 manufacturer crossed the 100 GW and by the end of September may have reached 140-150 GW (2021: 133 GW),\u201d said the AECEA. \u201cJust five of these top 10 have set shipment targets of between 183-205 GW.\u201d Furthermore, the AECEA revealed that the country\u2019s polysilicon capacity should grow from around 530,000 MT at the end of 2021 to up to 1.2 million MT in 2022, jumping to 2.5 million MT in 2023, and up to 4 million MT in 2024. \u201cIn the near term, the overall industrial landscape won\u2019t fundamentally change.

NASA's technology could be a game-changer for the EV industry, eliminating one of its main obstacles to adoption \u2013 that five-minute charge would put charging EVs on a par with the time it takes to fill the tank of a petrol-powered car. The answer to five-minute charging could be found in the \"Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE)\", a project NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences Division is sponsoring Purdue University to develop and focuses on coolants in the charging cable between the EV's inlet and the battery. Also: The 5 best electric cars: Plus, the cheapest EV available Purdue researchers demonstrated a technique called \"sub-cooled flow boiling\" that improves the effectiveness of heat transfer, which could help EVs on Earth but is primarily intended for the International Space Station. Unfortunately, owners of Tesla and other EVs shouldn't count on having a five-minute full charge any time soon because it requires capacities, measured in amperes or amps, far exceeding what's available today. However, when that is available, NASA's technology could provide temperature controls that those charging systems would require. As NASA explains, a five-minute charge requires a charging system that provides a current at 1,400 amps. But, as Purdue points out, Tesla's V3 Supercharger \u2013 which is the apex of today's EV chargers \u2013 doesn't exceed 600 amps. Purdue's prototype last year demonstrated 2,400 amps. Hence the eventual need for a cooling system beyond today's capabilities that can handle 1,400 amps. Using NASA's FBCE, Purdue researchers, led by Dr. Issam Mudawar, pumped non-electrically conducting liquid coolant through a charging cable to capture heat from the current-carrying conductor. \"Subcooled flow boiling allows Mudawar's team to deliver 4.6 times the current of the fastest available electric vehicle chargers on the market today by removing up to 24.22 kilowatts of heat,\" NASA explains. \"Application of this new technology resulted in unprecedented reduction of the time required to charge a vehicle and may remove one of the key barriers to worldwide adoption of electric vehicles,\" it said. Faster charging times ought to drive higher adoption of EVs, which are part of the world's answer to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. A recent report from the International Energy Agency said sales of EVs reached 6.6 million in 2021, up from 120,000 in 2012, and accounted for 9% of all vehicle sales. Chinese consumers bought 3.3 million new EVs, many of which were two- and three-wheelers, while Europeans bought 2.3 million EVs, and US consumers bought 630,000. Still, in the US, EV sales doubled their share in 2021 year-on-year to 4.5%. China was also rolling out charging faster than most regions.

He has lived in southwest Florida for nearly 19 years, had experienced Hurricanes Charley in 2004 and Irma in 2017 and saw what stronger storms could do to the coast. Grande told CNN he wanted to find a new home where developers prioritized climate resiliency in a state that is increasingly vulnerable to record-breaking storm surge, catastrophic wind and historic rainfall. What he found was Babcock Ranch \u2014 only 12 miles northeast of Fort Myers, yet seemingly light years away. Babcock Ranch calls itself \u201cAmerica\u2019s first solar-powered town.\u201d Its nearby solar array \u2014 made up of 700,000 individual panels \u2014 generates more electricity than the 2,000-home neighborhood uses, in a state where most electricity is generated by burning natural gas, a planet-warming fossil fuel. The streets in this meticulously planned neighborhood were designed to flood so houses don\u2019t. Native landscaping along roads helps control storm water. Power and internet lines are buried to avoid wind damage. This is all in addition to being built to Florida\u2019s robust building codes. Some residents, like Grande, installed more solar panels on their roofs and added battery systems as an extra layer of protection from power outages. Many drive electric vehicles, taking full advantage of solar energy in the Sunshine State. Climate resiliency was built into the fabric of the town with stronger storms in mind. So when Hurricane Ian came barreling toward southwest Florida this week, it was a true test for the community. The storm obliterated the nearby Fort Myers and Naples areas with record-breaking surge and winds over 100 mph. It knocked out power to more than 2.6 million customers in the state, including 90% of Charlotte County. But the lights stayed on in Babcock Ranch. \u201cIt certainly exceeded our expectations of a major hurricane,\u201d Grande, 58, told CNN. A damaged building is seen in Babcock Ranch after Hurricane Ian. Courtesy Nancy Chorpenning An uprooted tree in Babcock Ranch after Hurricane Ian. Courtesy Nancy Chorpenning Sign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Greener newsletter. The storm uprooted trees and tore shingles from roofs, but other than that Grande said there is no major damage. Its residents say Babcock Ranch is proof that an eco-conscious and solar-powered town can withstand the wrath of a near-Category 5 storm. \u201cWe have proof of the case now because [the hurricane] came right over us,\u201d Nancy Chorpenning, a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident, told CNN. \u201cWe have water, electricity, internet \u2014 and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.\u201d Grande said Hurricane Ian came through southwest Florida \u201clike a freight train.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t afraid that he would lose everything in a storm, like he was when he lived in Fort Myers. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very blessed and fortunate to not be experiencing what they\u2019re experiencing now in Sanibel Island and Fort Myers Beach,\u201d Grande said. \u201cIn the times that we\u2019re living in right now with climate change, the beach is not the place to live or have a business.\u201d Solar success Syd Kitson, a former professional football player for the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, is the mastermind behind Babcock Ranch. Kitson envisioned it to be an eco-conscious and innovative neighborhood that is safe and resilient from storms like Ian. The ranch broke ground in 2015 with the construction of the solar array \u2014 which was built and is run by Florida Power and Light \u2014 and its first residents moved into the town in 2018. Since then, the array has doubled in size and thousands of people have made Babcock their home. Around 700,000 solar panels power Babcock Ranch. Dennis Axer/Alamy \u201cIt\u2019s a great case study to show that it can be done right, if you build in the right place and do it the right way,\u201d said Lisa Hall, a spokesperson for Kitson, who also lives in Babcock Ranch. \u201cThroughout all this, there\u2019s just so many people saying, \u2018it worked, that this was the vision, this is the reason we moved here,\u2019\u201d Hall told CNN. Perhaps the highest endorsement for the city is that it is now a refuge for some of Ian\u2019s hardest-hit victims. The state opened Babcock Neighborhood School as an official shelter, even though it didn\u2019t have the mandated generator. The solar array kept the lights on. Some of Chorpenning\u2019s friends who live on Sanibel Island \u2014 which is now cut off from the mainland after Ian\u2019s devastating storm surge severed the causeway \u2014 came to shelter at a friend\u2019s house at Babcock Ranch. It will be a while before they can go back, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be renting a place over here for a while, while they figure out what\u2019s going to happen out there,\u201d she said. \u201cI joked that we may be the only people in southwest Florida whose property value just increased.\u201d Even Kitson chose to ride out the storm in Babcock to see how the community would fare in the hurricane. Kitson declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview; Hall said he is focused on helping neighboring communities rebuild. \u201cHe was there during the storm; he said, \u2018where else would I be?\u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cWe built it to be resilient and as much as you plan and think you\u2019ve done the right thing, you don\u2019t know until you put it to the test.\u201d Babcock Ranch has sold more than 2,000 homes, according to the neighborhood's website. Dennis Stephenson/Alamy As utilities scramble to restore power across the state, Babcock residents say September storms showed that America\u2019s energy infrastructure is not well-equipped to handle worsening extreme weather events. Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid when it made landfall there on September 18. Now, Ian has left millions of people in the dark in Florida. Babcock residents say their neighborhood is a model for urban development in a climate change-ravaged future. \u201cIt\u2019s not what it was 20 or 25 years ago; the storms are getting bigger and bigger, and it\u2019s no surprise, because the warnings have all been there,\u201d Grande said. \u201cI think Babcock Ranch\u2019s future has gotten even brighter.\u201d", "techcrunch28": "Poland can do some cool stuff.

The Biden administration is making the grants available as part of a wider effort to accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles and reduce air pollution near schools and communities. Vice President Kamala Harris and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan announced the grant awards Wednesday in Seattle. The new, mostly electric school buses will reduce greenhouse gas emissions , save money and better protect children\u2019s health, they said. As many as 25 million children ride yellow buses each school day, and they will have a healthier future with a cleaner fleet, Harris said. \u201cWe are witnessing around our country and around the world the effects of extreme climate,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re announcing today is a step forward in our nation\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gases, to invest in our economy ... to invest in building the skills of America\u2019s workforce. All with the goal of not only saving our children, but for them, saving our planet.\u2033 ADVERTISEMENT Only about 1% of the nation\u2019s 480,000 school buses were electric as of last year, but the push to abandon traditional diesel buses has gained momentum in recent years.

The clean bus program \u201cis accelerating our nation\u2019s transition to electric and low-emission school buses while ensuring a brighter, healthier future for our children,\u201d Regan said. The EPA initially made $500 million available for clean buses in May but increased that to $965 million last month, responding to what officials called overwhelming demand for electric buses. An additional $1 billion is set to be awarded in the budget year that began Oct. 1. The EPA said it received about 2,000 applications requesting nearly $4 billion for more than 12,000 buses, mostly electric. Some 389 applications worth $913 million were accepted to support purchase of 2,463 buses, 95% of which will be electric, the EPA said. The remaining buses will run on compressed natural gas or propane. ADVERTISEMENT School districts identified as priority areas serving low-income, rural or tribal students make up 99% of the projects that were selected, the White House said. More applications are under review, and the EPA plans to select more winners to reach the full $965 million in coming weeks. Districts set to receive money range from Wrangell, Alaska, to Anniston, Alabama, and Teton County, Wyoming, to Wirt County, West Virginia. Besides the District of Columbia, big cities that won grants for clean school buses include New York, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Los Angeles. White House adviser Mitch Landrieu said he expects many buses to be delivered by the start of the next school year, with the remainder likely to be in service by the end of 2023.

And while this very concept mitigates risk and effort in manufacturing, it also reduces the margin that can still be achieved with such a highly complex product. Therefore, I asked several competitors and found out that the currently achievable margins in the worst case (like EVGA) are still 5%, and up to 10% for the do-it-yourself manufacturers, who can manage an own production. This is not less than in 2021 or 2020, only this year merchandise sales have dropped significantly due to orders staying away and a change in demand. However, that one produces at a loss because of NVIDIA\u2019s money-grubbing claws, as EVGA colports, is considered by many to be an urban legend. These are rather homemade problems with faulty designs and a RMA rate that was beyond good and evil. I don\u2019t want to quote myself again, but the disaster with Amazon\u2019s New World and the scorched circuit boards was expensive, really expensive. To attach this to every card as a loss is definitely too short-sighted. Let\u2019s say they made 10x profit than normal business last year, if you are the boss, will you quit now or waste another 10 years just to make the same profit amount last year? (Competitor) The business of brands is actually like the good old stock market business, because you should sell at the peak and best take what is still to be taken. If you have to buy almost all services at a high price, there is not much left in the graphics card business. A large manufacturer (not EVGA) easily produces around 200,000 graphics cards per week, which puts the 5 to 10 percent in a different light. In the system gastronomy, business also only works via sheer mass, which is no different with graphics cards. However, EVGA lacks exactly this mass (which can also be seen as a buffer), which can cushion smaller outliers. If you ask the competitors why they haven\u2019t copied EVGA\u2019s warranty, upgrade and exchange model as well, you actually only see grinning faces or shaking heads. Statements such as \u201ceconomic suicide by default\u201d are still the most polite thing to say. I wrote that the cards have become more and more complex and that the risk of failure has increased dramatically as a result. Therefore, the RMA processes do not become more favorable, on the contrary. Goodwill and generosity, as EVGA has made its trademark, must also be afforded and what was manageable 10 years ago can end in collapse any day today. House of cards and all. Here, EVGA simply lacks the critical mass to easily pull off something like this financially. Being the US market leader is all well and good, but how big is the DIY market there? If it were profitable, we would have done it long ago (Competitor) Peripherals and power supplies are much easier to keep track of and now offer much higher margins of up to 30 percent. Power supplies are just the new thermal paste and the run is still properly fueled by ATX 3.0. Speaking of power supplies, I remember how EVGA at the time (this was back in the Kepler days) made the sampling of graphics cards dependent on a positive review of the newly introduced power supplies. Back then, I was still writing for Tom\u2019s Hardware and very stubbornly resisted the \u201creward for award\u201d system. At that time, however, the \u201cJust buy it!\u201d philosophy did not yet exist there and one was still allowed to do such things as a reviewer. As a result, I was then excluded from sampling for a few years. By the way, I\u2019m still alive, which shows once again that you don\u2019t have to go along with something like that if you don\u2019t want to. I also don\u2019t want to repeat how EVGA products later failed my tests and the engineering used my findings (pad mod, area increase on the cooling frame, RAM monitoring in the ICX design), but the PR kicked nasty in my direction. I never asked for money for my support, but would probably have been happy to receive a thank you now and then. By the way, this is exactly where you notice the difference between a US company like EVGA and a German medium-sized company. EVGA is extremely profit-oriented, and when things don\u2019t go so well, they just part with a division. By the way, this is not reprehensible, but the explanations should then also be more honest. The Green Light Program as a buzzkill And what does NVIDIA have to do with it now? Yes, even the competitors are properly pissed off that they still don\u2019t know NVIDIA\u2019s prices and don\u2019t know at which dumping or scalper rate Master Jensen will beat his new Ada into the market as a playmate (depending). That\u2019s why you won\u2019t see so many completely new designs, and what I had already called \u201cPlayground\u201d in the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti will mostly be continued. This is then economic prudence and not even stupid. EVGA could have thought of that as well. However, you also have to know that NVIDIA strives for total control and also mercilessly enforces these policies. There isn\u2019t much room left for technical gimmicks \u00e1 la EVGA\u2019s special models and both sides have clashed hard not only once. EVGA always explores how far you can go and NVIDIA then intervenes to correct the situation. I have already explained this in detail in the article linked above and I don\u2019t want to repeat myself. However, it is also a fact that NVIDIA only provides replacements if you follow \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s rules\u201d. You can approve of this or not, but it leads (at least in theory) to more durable products. Things like EVGA\u2019s Kingpin models break those rules, but that\u2019s where they\u2019ve found a clever loophole because it\u2019s effectively declared a mod. Galax does the same with the HoF series. Various overclockers give their face for it (for good money) and it is not a consumer product. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t get a real HoF including unlimited OC tool as a normal customer, but only the \u201croadworthy\u201d version under the same name. The rest is then expensive cannon fodder for the LN2 artillery. Such marketing escapades also cost money, of course, even if they can boost the company\u2019s image. The good Kingpin must now look for another place in the money rainforest, but the choice is rather manageable there. I didn\u2019t really want to go that far, but once you\u2019re in such a nice writing flow, the shore you\u2019re aiming for gets further and further away. In order to come to some kind of conclusion at the end, I\u2019ll make it simple for myself, because I can perhaps also question some things differently: It is certainly not a loss for me (and many others), because it became apparent that the model practiced for years would no longer have been financially viable in this way. And before one admits this publicly and meekly, one looks for the last big performance and says goodbye to the shocked audience with a big bang. I only hope that all previous customers will still be dealt with gallantly and treated fairly. Then it will surely work out with the power supplies, housings and other stuff. After all, I haven\u2019t heard from any other small Jensen exclusive customers that they now have to throw in the towel for the reasons I mentioned. But they can probably calculate better and also produce themselves. It is a pity about a colorful facet on the graphics card market, which I will also miss, but the customer will get over it.", "techcrunch35": "Oil and gas didn\u2019t benefit from investor largesse in recent years \u2014 but renewables did With the climate-and-energy-focused Inflation Reduction Act expected to be signed by President Joe Biden this week, The Wall Street Journal asked Dealogic to analyze the amount of money being loaned to \u201cgreen\u201d companies and to oil and gas companies. Investors, WSJ concludes, aren\u2019t ready to give up on fossil fuels. But the data suggests that they\u2019re starting to pull back already. Fossil fuel financing has been more or less steady since 2015, when the WSJ/Dealogic data series begins. For oil and gas companies, that should be a worrying trend given overall low rates and the amount of money that\u2019s been sloshing around the market the past few years. Investment-grade bond issuance surged in 2020 before dropping to still-elevated levels in 2021. Yet fossil fuel investment didn\u2019t follow the trend, dipping slightly instead of rising along with the market. Bonds and loans for renewable projects and companies did the opposite, ticking steadily upward from 2015 on. In 2021, they more than doubled the previous year, matching the amount invested in fossil fuels for the first time. This year, renewable companies remain neck-and-neck with oil and gas companies.", "techcrunch36": "Form Energy closed a $450 million Series E fundraising round yesterday to continue its work turning iron into rust. The round was led by TPG Rise Climate and joined by new investors GIC and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Existing investors ArcelorMittal, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Capricorn Investment Group, Coatue, Energy Impact Partners, The Engine, NGP ETP, Temasek, Prelude Ventures and VamosVentures provided follow-on capital. Such large rounds are becoming commonplace in the battery industry as startups transition from research and development to manufacturing and commercialization. Form is one of many battery tech companies that have popped up over the past decade, though it\u2019s taking a different tack from many others. Where most companies are focusing on lithium ion-related chemistries, the startup has been pursuing iron-air batteries. That means its cells don\u2019t rely on expensive and supply-constrained minerals like lithium, cobalt or nickel. Form will start commercial production in late 2024, and it\u2019s aiming to eventually produce its battery packs for less than $20 per kWh. If the company can hit its target, it would hasten the shift toward renewable power. Already, solar and wind are price-competitive with fossil fuel plants, and in some cases they\u2019re cheaper than running existing natural gas-fired plants. Adding inexpensive storage to contain cheap power would make renewables competitive in more locations. Form already has a contract with Great River Energy in Minnesota to install a 150-MWh battery, and it\u2019s working with Southern Company to explore a similar pilot in Georgia. It\u2019s one of a growing number of battery companies that are ignoring EVs in favor of other markets that are key to the energy transition. Form\u2019s batteries are heavy and large, but also inexpensive and long-lasting, all qualities that are ideal for storing excess renewable energy.", "other news sites37": "Renewables met all of the rise in global electricity demand in the first half of 2022, preventing any growth in coal and gas generation, according to a new report published by London-based energy think tank Ember. The rise in wind and solar generation met over 75% of the demand growth in the first half of 2022, while hydro met the remainder, preventing a possible 4% increase in fossil-fuel generation and avoiding $40 billion in fuel costs and 230 Mt CO2 in emissions. Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior analyst at Ember, said: Wind and solar are proving themselves during the energy crisis. The first step to ending the grip of expensive and polluting fossil fuels is to build enough clean power to meet the world\u2019s growing appetite for electricity. The report analyzes electricity data from 75 countries representing 90% of global electricity demand. It compares the first six months of 2022 to the first half of 2021 to show how the electricity transition has progressed. The report finds that global electricity demand grew by 389 terawatt hours (TWh) in the first half of 2022. Renewables \u2013 wind, solar, and hydro \u2013 increased by 416 TWh, slightly exceeding the rise in electricity demand. Wind and solar alone rose by 300 TWh, which was equal to 77% of the rise in global electricity demand. In China, the rise in wind and solar generation alone met 92% of its electricity demand rise. In the United States it was 81%, and in India it was 23%. Rise in fossil-fuel generation unchanged As a result of the growth in renewables, fossil-fuel generation was almost unchanged (+5 TWh, +0.1%). Coal fell by 36 TWh (-1%) and gas by 1 TWh (-0.05%). This offset a slight rise in other fossil fuels (mainly oil) of 42 TWh. Consequently, global CO2 power sector emissions were unchanged in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year, despite the rise in electricity demand. Coal in the EU rose 15% only to cover a temporary shortfall in nuclear and hydro generation. Coal in India rose 10% because of a sharp rebound in electricity demand from lows early last year when the pandemic struck hardest. Globally, these rises were offset by coal-power falls of 3% in China and 7% in the United States. The growth in wind and solar prevented a 4% rise in fossil fuel electricity generation worldwide. In China, the growth in wind and solar enabled fossil fuel power to fall by 3%. Without this growth, fossil fuels would have risen by 1%. In India, fossil fuel power rose by 9%, but it would have been 12% without growth in wind and solar. In the United States, it slowed down the rise in fossil fuel power from 7% to just 1%. In the EU, fossil fuel power rose by 6%, but it would have been 16% without growth in wind and solar. Despite the halt in fossil-fuel generation in the first half of 2022, coal and gas generation increased in July and August. It leaves open the possibility that power sector emissions in 2022 may yet rise, following last year\u2019s all-time high. Further, a new report from San Francisco-based NGO Global Energy Monitor found that approximately 89.6 gigawatts (GW) of gas plants in development globally, totaling 5,070 million metric tons of CO2e lifetime emissions if built, are coal-to-gas conversions or replacements. These conversions are proceeding despite data showing that gas projects are increasingly uncompetitive with renewables and are just as bad, if not worse, for the environment than coal. Wiatros-Motyka said: We can\u2019t be sure if we\u2019ve reached peak coal and gas in the power sector. Global power sector emissions are still pushing all-time highs when they need to be falling very quickly. And the same fossil fuels pushing us into a climate crisis are also causing the global energy crisis.

Breaking the 30% barrier is therefore a big step in accelerating the energy transition and improving energy security by reducing the dependency on fossil fuels. The best of both worlds Tandem devices can reach higher efficiencies than single junction solar cells because of a better utilization of the solar spectrum. The currently emerging tandems combine commercial silicon technology for the bottom device with perovskite technology: the latter featuring highly efficient conversion of ultraviolet and visible light and excellent transparency to near infrared light. In four-terminal (4T) tandem devices the top and bottom cells operate independently of each other which makes it possible to apply different bottom cells in this kind of devices. Commercial PERC technology as well as premium technologies like heterojunction or TOPCon or thin-film technology such as CIGS can be implemented in a 4T tandem device with hardly any modifications to the solar cells. Furthermore, the four-terminal architecture makes it straight forward to implement bifacial tandems to further boost the energy yield. Researchers from the Netherlands and Belgium have successfully improved the efficiency of the semi-transparent perovskite cells up to 19.7% with an area of 3x3 mm2 as certified by ESTI (Italy). \u201cThis type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93% of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device. This performance was achieved by optimizing all layers of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using advanced optical and electrical simulations as a guide for the experimental work in the lab.\u201d says Dr Mehrdad Najafi of TNO. \u201cThe silicon device is a 20x20-mm2 wide, heterojunction solar cell featuring optimized surface passivation, transparent conductive oxides and Cu-plated front contacts for state-of-the-art carrier extraction\u201d says Yifeng Zhao, PhD student at TU Delft, whose results have been recently peer-reviewed. The silicon device optically stacked under the perovskite contributes with 10.4% efficiency points to the total solar energy conversion. Combined, 30.1% is the conversion efficiency of this non-area matched 4T tandem devices operating independently.

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese in Canberra to ink a new green energy deal between the two countries. Albanese said the pact showed a \"collective resolve\" to slash greenhouse gas emissions through an ambitious energy project. He name-checked clean energy start-up Sun Cable, which wants to build a high-voltage transmission line capable of shifting huge volumes of solar power from the deserts of northern Australia to tropical Singapore.

With obligatory scope 3 (lifetime) emissions disclosure set to be introduced in 2023, asset managers with exposure to carbon intensive carmakers face a \u2018ticking carbon bomb\u2019, says T&E. In 2023, the EU will introduce a requirement that financial institutions disclose their scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions)[1]. The new requirement will hit asset managers with exposure to carmakers hard. Unlike manufacturers of furniture or mobile phones, the vast majority (98%) of a car company\u2019s emissions come under scope 3 \u2013 primarily the use of the cars [2]. But, as T&E\u2019s analysis shows, carmakers\u2019 already high scope 3 emissions are likely far larger than officially reported. Luca Bonaccorsi, director of sustainable finance at T&E, said: \u201cFor green investing to be effective, we need accurate data. Carmakers are trying to pull the wool over investors eyes by underreporting the lifetime emissions of their cars. This makes a mockery of carmakers\u2019 green claims.\u201d Carmakers base their total reported emissions on a number of factors such as the average size of the vehicles, where the cars are driven and the lifespan of vehicles. Carmakers on the whole have used selective data to reach a lower figure. Toyota, for example, bases the lifetime average emissions of its vehicles on a scarcely believable 100,000 kilometres. This makes car companies, from an investment perspective, almost as carbon intensive as the oil industry. At today\u2019s prices, \u20ac1 million invested in an average of oil giants Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell finances around 5,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The same amount finances more than 4,500 tCO2e in the car sector[3]. In some cases the carbon intensity of carmakers is significantly higher: nearly 10,000 tonnes if invested in Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and 7,000 tonnes for Honda according to carmakers\u2019 reporting [4]. Luca Bonaccorsi added: \u201cAccording to official disclosures, a euro invested in a car company finances virtually the same amount of carbon as a euro in an oil company. This should be a wake up call for the financial industry. Asset managers wanting to avoid a ticking carbon bomb will have to start ditching carmakers that continue to sell polluting cars.\u201d By the end of 2022, Morningstar, a US-based financial firm, estimates that some 50% of all new financial products sold will be environmental, social and governance (ESG) based. However, ESG ratings fail to capture the companies\u2019 true climate impact. Despite CO2 emissions being the most important environmental indicators, they represent less than 1% of the ESG rating for S&P and MSCI, two of the world\u2019s leading ESG indexes. T&E calls on the EU to regulate and harmonise the methodology for ESG ratings to ensure consistent and transparent reporting of data. ENDS Notes to editor [1] Car companies\u2019 true carbon intensity will be revealed in 2023 thanks to mandatory Scope 3 disclosure (both in the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive). [2] Greenhouse gas emissions are categorised into three groups (Scopes) by the most widely-used international accounting tool, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company\u2019s value chain. [3] This is based on the official scope 3 disclosures of carmakers and oil companies, not T&E\u2019s estimates. Oil companies are likely also significantly underreporting their scope 3 emissions. However, we have no evidence to believe that the under-reporting is higher in any specific sector. On the contrary, in another analysis, evidence suggests the error must be rather homogeneous across sectors and is somewhat filtered out by the use of ratios. [4] The chart does not compare companies\u2019 total emissions but the amount of emissions equivalent to a specific financial investment. This ratio is influenced by the appetite of the market for a specific company, so the higher the evaluation of the company, the lower the carbon intensity ratio. A company\u2019s evaluation is affected by a large number of variables.", "other news sites41": "Companies that produce technologies to remove or reduce carbon emissions are \u201cpoised for strong continued growth,\u201d reaching an expected value of $1.4 trillion by 2027, according to new market research. The research report, recently released by the financial data firm PitchBook, predicts that the sector will be worth $905 billion by the end of this year. That makes the global climate tech sector relatively small \u2014 collectively worth less than electric vehicle maker Tesla. But PitchBook predicts that the emerging sector will enjoy an 8.8 percent growth rate over the next five years, \u201cthanks to increasing global focus on aggressive emissions targets and consumer interest in emissions reduction.\u201d That rate could also increase if there were \u201cdramatic regulatory change or technological innovation\u201d during that time, the report for investors said. Advertisement The sector PitchBook analyzed is a broad one. It includes startups that capture or trade carbon dioxide, industrial and building firms with products that are less emissions-intensive than conventional ones, and land management companies that use or produce monitoring tools or low-emissions fertilizers. The most valuable group of companies in the space are ones working to reduce planet-warming emissions during construction and over the lifetimes of buildings. They are currently worth almost $459 billion and are expected to increase in value to $650 billion over the next five years, according to the report. That segment includes incumbents like building materials producers Holcim Group and HeidelbergCement, as well as startups like green construction firm Veev and energy efficiency company Resideo Technologies. The segment PitchBook calls \u201cgreen industry\u201d is focused on decarbonizing industrial production of chemicals and raw materials. It\u2019s valued at more than $400 billion, according to the report. Notable firms include lithium battery recycler Redwood Materials and the mining company Lilac Solutions. PitchBook expects green industry to be the most valuable climate tech segment by 2027, with an estimated value of $657 billion. For those projections to play out, however, emissions pricing legislation like the European Union\u2019s carbon border adjustment mechanism \u201cwill be critical to ensure that those providing green chemicals and materials are not at a disadvantage against foreign high-emissions products,\u201d the report said. The value of low-carbon land management companies is expected to reach $30 billion this year, increasing to $49.5 billion in five years. The segment includes major monitoring firms like Honeywell and the alternative fertilizer company Pivot Bio. Venture capital investment in land management firms has recently slowed, the report noted. But the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August, included more than $20 billion to support climate-smart agriculture practices and $5 billion in grants for fire-resilient forests, urban tree planting and forest conservation. The smallest but fastest-growing segment of the sector is made up of carbon technology firms like the direct air capture pioneer Climeworks and the carbon trading platform Xpansiv. They\u2019re now valued at around $9 billion and estimated to be worth $20.9 billion by 2027. The carbon tech sector will also get a boost from Biden\u2019s new climate law, the report said. The value of carbon captured in the United States has increased from $50 per ton to $85 for CO2 removed from smokestacks. For direct air capture projects, which suck CO2 from the atmosphere, the price they earn per ton of carbon has jumped 250 percent, to $180. But it\u2019s not all smooth sailing for carbon capture and trading firms. \u201cThe core risk facing the carbon tech space is in the potential for the value of carbon to shift dramatically due to changes in policy and regulation,\u201d PitchBook said. \u201cThe product of carbon tech (removing or reducing carbon) does not directly provide value \u2014 outside of some value as a feedstock for carbon utilization \u2014 and fiscal value from carbon tech activities is heavily driven by the value that legislative incentives and schemes place on carbon.\u201d Despite that risk, investors continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential for carbon capture firms. There were 11 venture capital deals in the second quarter of 2022, raising $882.2 million for Climeworks, Carbon Clean and other firms, according to PitchBook. \u201cThis far surpasses any prior quarter, with the total invested over the previous four quarters totaling only $432.1 million,\u201d the research firm said in another investor report published last week.", "other news sites42": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A team from \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne in Switzerland made the breakthrough using specially designed photosensitizer dye molecules that when combined are capable of harvesting light from across the entire visible light spectrum. The transparent properties of DSCs make them suitable for use in windows, greenhouses and glass facades, the researchers said, as well as in the screens of portable electronic devices. They are also flexible, relatively low-cost and can be made using conventional roll-printing techniques. Theoretically, the price/performance ratio is also good enough to allow them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation. The first commercial applications are already being realised, with dye-sensitized solar windows installed in the SwissTech Convention Center, however their capacity for generating electricity has so far been restricted by their lack of efficiency compared to traditional solar cells. The latest development pushes the power conversion efficiency to between 28.4-30.2 per cent, while still maintaining long-term operational stability over 500 hours of testing. \u201cOur findings pave the way for facile access to high performance DSCs and offer promising prospects for applications as power supply and battery replacement for low-power electronic devices that use ambient light as their energy source,\u201d wrote the authors of a study detailing the technology.

Credit: Steve Zylius / UCI Researchers at the University of California, Irvine and four national laboratories have devised a way to make lithium-ion battery cathodes without using cobalt, a mineral plagued by price volatility and geopolitical complications. In a paper published today in Nature, the scientists describe how they overcame thermal and chemical-mechanical instabilities of cathodes composed substantially of nickel\u2014a common substitute for cobalt\u2014by mixing in several other metallic elements. \"Through a technique we refer to as 'high-entropy doping,' we were able to successfully fabricate a cobalt-free layered cathode with extremely high heat tolerance and stability over repeated charge and discharge cycles,\" said corresponding author Huolin Xin, UCI professor of physics & astronomy. \"This achievement resolves long-standing safety and stability concerns around high-nickel battery materials, paving the way for broad-based commercial applications.\" Cobalt is one of the most significant supply chain risks threatening widespread adoption of electric cars, trucks and other electronic devices requiring batteries, according to the paper's authors. The mineral, which is chemically suited for the purpose of stabilizing lithium-ion battery cathodes, is mined almost exclusively in the Democratic Republic of Congo under abusive and inhumane conditions. \"Electric vehicle manufacturers are eager to curtail the use of cobalt in their battery packs not only for cost reduction but to counter the child labor practices used to mine the mineral,\" Xin said. \"Research has also shown that cobalt can lead to oxygen release at high voltage, causing damage to lithium-ion batteries. All of this points to a need for alternatives.\" However, nickel-based cathodes come with their own problems, such as poor heat tolerance, which can lead to oxidization of battery materials, thermal runaway and even explosion. Although high-nickel cathodes accommodate larger capacities, volume strain from repeated expansion and contraction can result in poor stability and safety concerns. The researchers sought to address these issues through compositionally complex high-entropy doping using HE-LMNO, an amalgamation of transition metals magnesium, titanium, manganese, molybdenum and niobium in the structure's interior, with a subset of these minerals used on its surface and interface with other battery materials. Xin and his colleagues employed an array of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and 3D nanotomography instruments to determine that their zero-cobalt cathode exhibited an unprecedented volumetric change of zero during repeated use. The highly stable structure is capable of withstanding more than 1,000 cycles and high temperatures, which makes it comparable to cathodes with much lower nickel content. For some of these research tools, Xin collaborated with researchers at the National Synchrotron Light Source II, located at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. As a DOE Office of Science user facility, NSLS-II offered the team access to three of its 28 scientific instruments\u2014called beamlines\u2014to study the internal structure of the new cathode. \"The combination of the different methods at NSLS II beamlines enabled the discovery of a trapping effect of oxygen vacancies and defects inside the material, which effectively prevents the crack formation in the HE-LMNO secondary particle, making this structure extremely stable during cycling,\" said co-author Mingyuan Ge, a scientist at NSLS-II. Added Xin: \"Using these advanced tools, we were able to observe the dramatically increased thermal stability and zero-volumetric-change characteristics of the cathode, and we've been able to demonstrate extraordinarily improved capacity retention and cycle life. This research could set the stage for the development of an energy-dense alternative to existing batteries.\" He said the work represents a step toward achieving the dual goal of spurring the proliferation of clean transportation and energy storage while addressing environmental justice issues around the extraction of minerals used in batteries.

A paper published Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters finds that it\u2019s raining harder in most of the United States. The study, written by researchers at Northwestern University, tied the results to climate change and to warmer air\u2019s ability to hold more water. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. ArrowRight Record rain is hitting drought-stricken areas. That\u2019s not good news. The findings echo the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics, as well as the evidence from decades of research, and highlight the real-time effect that humans are having on the weather and climate. The research offers confirmation of what atmospheric scientists have been warning of for years: a warmer world is, on balance, a wetter world. And as global temperatures continue to rise, an uptick in precipitation extremes is expected. Climate change is causing heavier rains What the study finds is consistent with a basic tenet of atmospheric physics: For every degree Fahrenheit that air temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold 4 percent more water; this is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Where storm clouds develop and the atmosphere is sufficiently moist, it means a warmer climate will support more intense rainfall. Advertisement The study reports \u201cconsistent shifts from lower to higher daily precipitation intensities, particularly in the central and eastern United States.\u201d The authors compared rainfall over two periods \u2014 1951 to 1980 and 1991 to 2020 \u2014 to see how patterns evolved. \u201cWhen it\u2019s raining, it\u2019s raining more,\u201d said Ryan Harp, the author lead author on the study, in an interview. \u201cBut what we also did was \u2026 we were able to verify some of the expectations we had based on modeling studies.\u201d In other words, most similar studies to date had centered on projections made by forward-running computer models fed with historical data. This is among the first that, on a nationwide level, examine observed daily rainfall trends. \u201cI think during that process we were a little surprised that this paper hasn\u2019t been written before,\u201d said Daniel Horton, a study co-author and a professor at Northwestern University, in an interview. \u201cWe know that precipitation should be increasing \u2026 but we just wanted to do a very straightforward paper that says, \u2018Yep, we\u2019re seeing it.\u2019 \u201d Advertisement Harp said the fact that reality matched simulations lends credence to climate models. \u201cPeople should in general be trusting in climate models,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to improve them to the best of our abilities.\u201d Not necessarily more rain overall, and not everywhere In the study, the authors examined daily data from more than 1,700 weather stations distributed in the Lower 48. Each had to have a continuous record dating back to at least 1951 to be included in the study. In the eastern United States, the researchers observed a 4.5 to 5.7 percent increase in average daily rainfall on days when it rained. That does not say there are more days with rain, or more rain overall. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily give us the whole story,\u201d Harp said. \u201cThere may be places where precipitation intensity is increasing but frequency is decreasing. We might not know if there\u2019s an overall increase or decrease. That\u2019s one thing that we\u2019re working on.\u201d Greg Carbin, the head of forecast operations at the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center, who was not involved in this research, appreciated that the study touched on the \u201cparadox of potentially fewer precipitation days with higher-intensity precipitation occurring on those days.\u201d Carbin has noted a trend of more rain falling on fewer days in his analysis of recent precipitation. Advertisement \u201cOverall, the area covered by the count of 1-inch rainfall days was lower than in recent years across large parts of the central and eastern U.S.,\u201d Carbin wrote in an email. \u201cIn fact, moderate to severe drought has plagued areas of the Northeast, and extreme to exceptional drought is now expanding across part of the central U.S. Nonetheless, we have had extreme rainfall events occur in St. Louis, Dallas, eastern Kentucky, and, most recently, with Hurricane Ian in Florida.\u201d Despite strong trends in the central and eastern United States, the authors noted that there were a few places where rainfall did not appear to be growing more intense. The paper does detail \u201cmixed signals in the western U.S.,\u201d but for reasons the authors are still trying to identify. \u201cThat [trend] didn\u2019t hold true for the western U.S.,\u201d said Harp, especially in the Pacific Northwest. He explained that changes in the overall placement of weather systems are \u201csuppressing\u201d any tendency for heavier precipitation in the West. A slight change in the location at which high and low pressure systems are anchored can have an enormous bearing on steering currents, and subsequently on how much precipitation falls in a given location. Changing precipitation trends poses societal challenges With the planet continuing to warm, a continued increase in rainfall intensity can be expected. That spells concern over whether existing infrastructure can handle the downpours of the future. Advertisement Communities may need to turn to simulated precipitation events of the future to guide building decisions, Horton said. The past summer was a testament to the extent to which climate-supercharged downpours can wreak havoc on major metropolitan areas. During a five-week span in July and August, five 1,000-year rain events \u2014 or extremely heavy rainfall episodes that have a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any given year \u2014 occurred across the nation. \u201cRecent years have seen some remarkable high-end precipitation events,\u201d Carbin said.

It\u2019s also quietly demolishing the retrograde approach to \u201cfemcare\u201d product design that not only peddles stale and sexist stereotypes, but also can harm women\u2019s bodies. Those perfumed sanitary pads stinking out the supermarket shelf? Whomever came up with that idea has obviously never experienced thrush or bacterial vaginosis nor spoken to a health professional who could have told them vaginal infections can be triggered by perfumed products.

The Index Ventures-backed startup is shaking up a tired category by selling the flip-side: thoughtfully designed products for period care that do no harm and take aim at actual problems women have, starting with dysmenorrhea (otherwise known as menstrual cramps). The overarching strand is building community to help women better understand what\u2019s going on with their bodies and reinforce shifting product expectations in the process.

The country listed border control, oil spill detection and ship detection and tracking among the practical uses for the satellites. The UAE aims to launch the first satellite in three years, with the entire satellite program to last around six years. It did not specify the total amount it plans to invest in the constellation. The 3 billion AED ($820 million) National Space Fund, announced Monday, is the latest signal that the country is looking to the space sector to help diversify its oil-dependent economy. As of 2020, oil exports made up nearly 30% of total gross domestic product. However, the UAE\u2019s Ministry of Economy counts space among its \u201cpromising economic sectors,\u201d and its space program has undertaken a number of major programs in the past five years. The UAE established an astronaut program in 2017; one of its two astronauts will fly to the International Space Station in 2023 as part of a long-duration mission with Axiom Space.

The San Mateo-based company works with fintech and vertical SaaS companies and offers banking, payments, cards and cryptocurrency products via easy-to-integrate APIs. We last profiled the company in 2020, before its name change, and after it had picked up both a $5.7 million seed and a $12 million Series A. Arjun Thyagarajan, co-founder and CEO at Solid, told TechCrunch that the company spent the last 18 months working with early customers on product-market fit. Traditional fintech infrastructure was not built for the modern company, he explained, and that results in companies needing dozens of point solutions and often spending millions in upfront and ongoing maintenance costs, all before launching an actual product. Instead, by utilizing APIs and a few lines of code, customers can embed fintech products and get them up-and-running quickly. \u201cCustomers aren\u2019t looking for UI/UX, but really for DI/DX, that developer interface with a powerful dashboard that is self-service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understood what they were looking for \u2014 that demand for modern infrastructure. They work with banks, but those often don\u2019t have tools for launching the fintech experience or the building blocks to make it easy to put together.\u201d It was also during that time that they decided to rebrand as they solidified their business-to-business focus. The new Solid name also resonated more with customers, Thyagarajan added. Over the past year, Solid grew 10x in revenue, doubled its customers to 100 and became profitable. Year to date, the company processed $2 billion in transactions. After being in sort of a stealth mode during the past 18 months, Thyagarajan said the company was now on a journey to get to 100 customers. To do that, he and co-founder Raghav Lal thought it was time to go after new funding. They started the process in May and closed the Series B at the end of July. \u201cWe saw early signs of product market fit, so our thought process was to do the Series B when we were ready for hypergrowth, and now we have cash in the bank,\u201d Thyagarajan said. \u201cWe are going after the mid-market, so we had to go back and fine-tune our product as we figured out what businesses need. The key was to build our technology from the ground up to own the complete experience so we could give customers what they want.\u201d FTV Capital led the new investment and was joined by existing investor Headline. To date, Solid has raised $80.7 million. Thyagarajan didn\u2019t disclose a specific valuation with the new round, but did reveal it was 5x over Solid\u2019s Series A valuation. The capital infusion will help accelerate Solid\u2019s entrance into some new verticals like travel, logistics, construction, healthcare, education and the gig economy. The company is looking at where money is moving and identified 40 to 50 different verticals where there is an impedance in how money moves, but they want to benefit their customers. The company is also focusing on mid-market and larger companies, which is another reason why Thyagarajan said the investment was important. \u201cWe are talking to Fortune 1000 companies and they feel more comfortable working with companies with a strong balance sheet,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of work has been under the radar, so we are getting the brand out and showcasing we are the \u2018AWS of fintech,\u2019 a one-stop shop.

Every year, it gets about an inch smaller as the tectonic plates that the Americas sit on are pushed westward. Now, thanks to calculations by a supercomputer, scientists say that a new \u201csupercontinent\u201d will eventually emerge due to this process: Amasia. The current world map, with its recognizable pattern of continents and oceans, is just one snapshot of our planet in time. Earth has tried on all kinds of continental configurations over its 4.5-billion-year lifespan, including periods where almost all of Earth\u2019s land consolidates into one giant supercontinent. Advertisement We currently live in the broken remains of the supercontinent Pangaea, which formed 335 million years ago and disintegrated during the rise of the dinosaurs. The existence of even older supercontinents, such as Rodinia and Columbia (Nuna), suggest that Earth is locked into a \u201csupercontinent cycle\u201d that sees the formation and destruction of these immense landmasses on a rough timeline of 600 million years. The cycle raises the question of what kind of new supercontinent might emerge millions of years from now, prompting scientists to propose future landmasses with names like Novopangaea, Aurica, and Amasia. To shed light on this mystery, researchers led by Chuan Huang, a geophysicist at Curtin University in Australia, simulated the future of Earth with a supercomputer. The results suggest that a new supercontinent, Amasia, will form when the Pacific Ocean shrinks into nothingness some 200 million years from now, causing North America to slam into Asia, according to a recent study published in National Science Review. The future emergence of Amasia, a portmanteau of America and Asia, has been discussed by scientists for more than a decade, but there is debate over whether this supercontinent would form \u201cinside in,\u201d a process known as introversion, or \u201coutside in,\u201d which is called extroversion. Introversion involves the closure of younger post-Pangaea oceans, such as the Indian or Atlantic, whereas extroversion indicates the closure of the Pacific Ocean, which is the oldest ocean on Earth and is shrinking at a rate of about one inch per year. Advertisement \u201cEarth's known supercontinents are believed to have formed in vastly different ways, with two endmembers being introversion and extroversion,\u201d said Huang and his colleagues in the study. \u201cThe former involves the closure of the internal oceans formed during the break-up of the previous supercontinent, whereas the latter involves the closure of the previous external superocean.\u201d \u201cWith our modelling results, we speculate if the next supercontinent will likely assemble through the closure of the Pacific Ocean,\u201d which would be extroversion, \u201cor the Indo-Atlantic oceans,\u201d which would be introversion, the team added. As Huang and his colleagues ran their supercomputer simulations, they noticed the strength of the lithosphere, the stiff top layer of Earth that encompasses the crust and surface, is an overlooked variable in the emergence of the next supercontinent. The oceanic lithosphere has been weakening over time as a result of Earth\u2019s slow cooling, a shift that clearly predicts the rise of Amasia from extroversion, or the closure of the Pacific Ocean. Sign up for Motherboard\u2019s daily newsletter for a regular dose of our original reporting, plus behind-the-scenes content about our biggest stories. \u201cOur results show that the yield strength of the oceanic lithosphere plays a critical role in determining the assembly path of a supercontinent,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cWe found that high oceanic lithospheric strength leads to introversion assembly, whereas lower strength leads to extroversion assembly.\u201d \u201cThis predicts that the next supercontinent Amasia could only be assembled through the closure of the Pacific Ocean,\u201d the team concluded. In this way, the new study offers a glimpse of our planet some 200 to 300 million years from now, when an enormous landmass could unite over the ashes of the long-lived Pacific Ocean. It\u2019s a reminder that humanity has existed for a mere split-second in geological time, and that our planet in the deep past and far future may as well be an alien world. \"Earth as we know it will be drastically different when Amasia forms,\u201d said Zheng-Xiang Li, a professor at Curtin\u2019s Earth Dynamics Research Group who co-authored the study, in a statement. \u201cThe sea level is expected to be lower, and the vast interior of the supercontinent will be very arid with high daily temperature ranges.\"", "other news sites50": "Panama will be home to the world's first community of floating SeaPods, with the inaugural pod now in the water at Linton Bay Marina in Colon.

Perched three metres above sea level on the Caribbean coast of Panama, the futuristic units are designed to accommodate two people and are on sale now, with prices ranging from $295,000 to $1.5 million. By December, the first overnight guests will be able to bed down in the pods, and 100 fully-owned units will be ready for full-time residents by summer next year. A second batch of more than 1,000 of the pods will go into production next year. Designed by Dutch architect Koen Olthuis, the futuristic SeaPods are geared toward climate-conscious travellers who want to live on the water, but don\u2019t want to give up the luxuries of modern living. Futuristic living on the water from $295,000 Master bedrooms come with epic views over the ocean. Photo: Ocean Builders With minimalist decor, curved walls and an ultra-sleek design, the SeaPod flagship model looks like something from The Jetsons. It is spread over 77 square metres of space that's split across three levels. There's a master bedroom with epic views, a living room and kitchen, a bathroom and an outdoor patio. Wraparound panoramic windows give residents 360-degree unobstructed ocean views. Wooden teak flooring, colour-changing lights and wireless charging stations are available in each SeaPod, which also comes with automated black-out blinds and sliding panel windows. Entirely customisable, there's the option to add climbing walls, greenhouses, skylights, hot tubs and patio gardens. Cutting-edge technology is at the heart of Panama's newest waterfront destination, with each pod using software to control lighting, internal air temperature, water pressure and more. Guests wear a smart ring that can be used to control technology settings, as well as being used to unlock doors, open windows and turn on music and mood lighting. Wireless charging stations are built into several of the pod's surfaces so that chargers and wires for phones become a thing of the past. Daily drone delivery and new marine habitats Daily essentials such as groceries and medicine are flown in by drones that have been designed to easily withstand open ocean conditions. Self-driving boats remove rubbish, compost and recycling and, when they're not on duty, work to clean up the surrounding ocean waters by expelling trash to help mitigate human impact on the ocean even beyond the community.

Spherics was a smaller startup playing in a similar space to larger ones, which include Normative, Plan A, Klimametrix.global, Persefoni and Planetly.com (other carbon accounting players, like Watershed and Climatiq, operate more like consultants). Sage previously stated it plans to support SMEs to get to net zero, and this acquisition appears to be part of their strategy. Spherics automates the process of calculating emissions by ingesting data from a company\u2019s accounting software and matching transactions to gauge an estimate of their carbon footprint. It can also apply carbon emission factors to procurement categories (such as delivery, accommodation, electricity and travel). \u201cWe know that SMBs care about the impact they have on the environment, and our research shows that they want to work with suppliers and partners that can help them understand and address it,\u201d said Amaya Souarez, EVP Cloud Operations, Sage, in a statement. \u201cBy combining Spherics\u2019 innovative software with Sage\u2019s digital network, we are connecting businesses with their customer and supplier emissions data, enabling easy and collaborative climate action across value chains which helps to reduce carbon.\u201d George Sandilands, CEO and co-founder of Spherics, added: \u201cOur vision and mission align very much with Sage\u2019s core values, and we are excited to embark on this new journey to help SMBs knock down barriers to a more sustainable future.

Both unlinked events re-emphasize the importance of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks and why regulators enforce strict policies that financial institutions need to be held accountable to while operating across the continent and globally. For the many startups whose services help keep the operations of financial institutions such as banks and fintechs in check, this period highlights their relevance more than ever. In the latest development, Youverify, a Lagos and San Francisco\u2013based identity verification company helping African banks and startups automate KYC and other compliance procedures, is announcing that it has secured a $1 million seed round extension. The startup raised a $1.5 million round in 2020, bringing its total seed raise to $2.5 million. Africa-focused VCs Orange Ventures and LoftyInc Capital, the two investors who co-led its initial seed round, also led the extension. Additional investment came from Octerra Capital, Plug & Play Venture, Syntax Ventures, HTTP Investors, Afer Group and Fronesyz Capital. The proliferation of financial services in Africa is beginning to attract more scrutiny from regulators. According to reports, transactions worth $116 billion will be made through digital payment channels this year, requiring stringent measures to prevent identity theft and fraud. Therefore, the rise in focus on maintaining transparency in financial regulations and improving strategies for KYC and AML by implementing regulatory technologies has become a significant growth factor for the market. And as regtech demand globally increases, so will Africa\u2019s, with reports saying it will reach about $1.2 billion in the next five years. Youverify came into Africa\u2019s regtech scene when founder and CEO Gbenga Odegbami founded the company in 2018. Launched in the Nigerian market, Youverify first provided API for address and identity verification to several financial institutions. Now it has added more KYC products and expanded into new markets such as Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda. \u201cThe way our customers see us is that we help them automate their KYC and compliance issues,\u201d said Odegbami on a call with TechCrunch. In addition to verifying identities beyond Nigeria\u2019s bank verification number (BVN) and addresses, Odegbami says Youverify layers KYC and compliance products such as transaction monitoring. He further explained that these offerings cater to issues some fintech platforms have faced recently: alleged AML issues in the case of Flutterwave in Kenya and Ping Express in the U.S. and fraud in the case of Union54\u2019s chargebacks. In the latter, Youverify claims it could\u2019ve prevented large-scale chargeback fraud by identifying the pattern of transactions to flag fraud, blocking the virtual cards and tying them back to fraudsters committing the multiple fake chargebacks. \u201cThey [Union54] grew faster than they could put in place the proper transaction monitoring and fraud detection systems that will identify transactions happening from their customers,\u201d the CEO said of the chargeback situation Union54 has dealt with over the past couple of months. \u201cA system like ours will be able to identify previous and new patterns in such a way that we would\u2019ve been able to help such the company.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until last year that Youverify started dealing with fintechs. Initially, most of its customers were governmental bodies, big corporations like Bolt and banks. Nearly two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s commercial banks, such as Standard Chartered, Standard Bank and Fidelity Bank, use the platform\u2019s identity verification and KYC products, Youverify said. However, in a bid to serve more clients, the company launched its proprietary technology, the Youverify OS (YVOS), which provides a single platform for automating due diligence and combines risk and compliance management with its core identity verification platform to deliver these fintechs an enterprise-grade compliance solution. With its other product, vFORM, a low and no-code tool, businesses can create a custom process for onboarding new customers using a drag-and-drop builder. As a result of diversifying its clientele and demand for its KYC products, Odegbami said Youverify\u2019s customer base increased by 300% to serve more than 400 banks and high-growth startups. In the last 24 months, Youverify\u2019s application processes have grown by more than 1,000% to more than 5 million applications that have helped its clients hire talent, sell financial products, and remotely onboard ride-hailing drivers. The company\u2019s YouID digital identity platform added more than 500,000 users, with 600 service providers on its marketplace waitlist across the continent. Odegbami said the Lagos-based identity verification company crossed an ARR of over $1 million last year. Youverify isn\u2019t the only identity verification company in Africa. Similar providers include Smile Identity and YC-backed companies IdentityPass and Dojah. Without mincing words, Odegbami said his company is a \u201cmarket leader\u201d because it came into the market much earlier and possesses more experience, and provides more data sets than the others. Over the next 18 months, Youverify plans to grow its footprint to cover 30 countries, especially in the southern, eastern and francophone parts of Africa, where Odegbami says the company will be recruiting aggressively. It also intends to increase the number of IDs it can verify, from 400 million to 2 billion, and develop new automated compliance products for the gaming, travel, healthcare and telecommunications industries.", "techcrunch53": "Felix Williams is the founder and managing director of Lagomaj Capital.

While younger than the typical investor, Williams believes his youth affords him the ability to offer a fresh perspective on tech and problems that startups are trying to solve. TechCrunch sat down with Williams to learn more about how he got into venture capital, and his plans for the future. When did you first become interested in venture capital? How did you break into it? While growing up, I had no idea what venture capital was. The concept made sense; who wouldn\u2019t want to be invested in \u2018Google\u2019 in the early days, but the idea of an industry that did precisely that was foreign to me until about 16 years old. At the time, there was a fund in St. Louis, iSelect Fund, that was growing rapidly and needed some help doing Excel/database work. I\u2019d have to say that performing that grunt work was the best thing that has happened to me in my professional life. In a few weeks, I was engulfed in the venture and startup worlds. Reading about activity in the ecosystem became my dopamine hit, and I was hooked. I felt like the luckiest teenager in the world, having gotten the opportunity to watch some of the best and brightest people I had ever seen try and solve the problems we are afflicted with, the problems we see on the news every day. The notion of work that I felt in my previous job at a national tutoring chain fell away and was replaced with a sense of purpose. When did you start your venture firm? What challenges did you face? Did you find it difficult to be taken seriously because of your age at the time? How old were you exactly? Lagomaj was born a week or two before my 19th birthday. At the time, our path forward wasn\u2019t always clear. For example, I was mistaken for an intern in multiple meetings and generally not taken too seriously at networking or industry events. It wasn\u2019t unusual for founders to take calls mid-pitch or check their messages when it was my turn to ask questions. I learned quickly that the best way to go about working was to build a rapport with someone via email or phone before a face-to-face meeting. Referrals and testimonials went a long way in establishing credibility with people outside my growing network, but that network is what kept me going. I was inspired by the people in my life. There is something very special about working with individuals who devote their lives to working on huge problems. Passion drives the best innovators that we\u2019ve ever known, and there were times where founders and I were able to share a common passion, and those deals have turned out to be some of my favorite ones to have been involved with. As we\u2019ve started building a more robust reputation, my age has become less of an obstacle and more of an advantage as some of my viewpoints are often different from the typical GP. What is your firm\u2019s investment thesis? How much have you raised? What are some of your portfolio companies? While we don\u2019t disclose how much we\u2019ve deployed or how much has been committed to the fund, I can say that we have done more than 45 deals with check sizes ranging anywhere from a few hundred thousand to $5 million, most of the time landing somewhere in the middle. In 2021, we invested more than we did in 2017-2020 combined. We currently have a presence in St. Louis, Austin and Southern California, and spend time looking nationally for primarily B2B deals involving early-stage companies. Our fund is especially keen on aligning incentives with the entrepreneurs we work with through a multi-decade investing horizon, participation through multiple rounds, and our willingness to do deals outside of a normal-priced round. For example, we completed a cutting-edge research and development facility with one of our portfolio companies that is seeking to transform how we produce and think about food. That deal is quite different from what most VC funds will take on, but we believed it to be critical to the advancement of a better food system, and we pursued it. Unlike some other funds, we do not consider ourselves an Impact or ESG fund. Our mission is to find passionate people doing extraordinary things for the world we live in, and when you do that, you output ESG gains. I am proud to say that most companies in the portfolio are working towards at least one UN sustainable development goal. An early win we had was with Agrible and its sale to Nutrien. (That $63 million sale took place in 2018.) Other companies in our portfolio include Benson Hill, Gosite and GigaIO. Why did you open an office in Austin? We think that Austin complements our presence in St. Louis well. Both cities have a growing tech scene that is not yet saturated with VC firms, and each has different focuses at the core of their startup ecosystems. In St. Louis, we see an exceptionally robust hard science market, especially bioscience, while in Austin, the focus and growth that we have seen has been more software-centric. Austin too, has many macro trends going for it, such as its desirability for young professionals, a culture that facilitates growth and a considerably strong talent pool. The city has been tremendously welcoming, and we are grateful to be part of its story. What are your long-term goals/plans? Over the next few years, our top priority is to build an engine that can invest at scale using data and software to augment the human decision-making process. Although we\u2019ve been operating for a few years now, I am not shy in telling people we are still in the development stages. Our processes and thesis will continue to evolve as we bring in new team members with much more experience than I have. We\u2019re building capabilities on both the ventures and support sides for post-investment portfolio company guidance. In the next two years, like many of our portfolio companies, we plan to forgo profitability and invest heavily in the infrastructure that will position us well in the decades to come. Every day, we refine our offering to investors and portfolio companies. Every day, we will continue that process to ensure that when we go out for our next big fundraising round down the road, we will be poised to do well. It is our opinion that venture as it stands now won\u2019t last forever, and we want to be positioned well for when that paradigm shift starts to manifest itself. Although 2022 has certainly been interesting as allocators re-evaluate their portfolios, our conviction in particular technology and trends has never been higher. We\u2019re ecstatic about continuing to invest in companies and partnerships at the confluence of innovation and market adoption.", "techcrunch54": "Technology built with defense in mind is getting some significant and serious traction at the moment, spurred by world events, advances in technology and a growing appetite from end users to invest in more innovative ways to protect themselves. In the latest development, Shield AI \u2014 which makes software and hardware for drones and other autonomous aircraft used by military and other government organizations \u2014 has raised $165 million in funding, $90 million in Series E equity and $75 million in debt. The funding is coming in at a $2.3 billion valuation, Shield AI said. The company has been on a strong pace on that front: It follows on from a $210 million-$300 million Series D about 10 months ago that valued the company at $1.25 billion. (It never confirmed the final amount, which was also a mix of equity and debt.) Doug Philippone at Snowpoint Ventures led the round, with Riot Ventures, Disruptive (a returning backer; it led Shield AI\u2019s Series D) and Homebrew (it led Shield AI\u2019s seed round). The company\u2019s other investors include Point72 Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Breyer Capital and SVB Capital. Philippone is an interesting person to lead on this latest round: In addition to being an investor, he is also Palantir\u2019s global defense lead, a job he\u2019s been in for the last 14 years. This is important not least because Palantir arguably was one of the key companies to change the game for how startups, spurred by the tech boom out of Silicon Valley, both engaged and started to win defense contracts and raised huge sums from VCs to fuel that growth. Another influential startup changing the conversation around funding defense tech is Anduril, which as we reported just the other week, is raising up to $1.2 billion (potentially more) at a $7 billion valuation. That round, we have heard, is basically now closed. Shield AI is based out of San Diego, which you could say is a little like the Silicon Valley of the defense industry. It\u2019s the home port of the U.S. Pacific fleet, and according to stats gathered by the city\u2019s chamber of commerce, outside of Fairfax County, Virginia (where the Pentagon is based) greater San Diego gets more defense spending than any other place in the U.S. Shield is based there among a dozens of other major and smaller defense contractors. And if you don\u2019t follow the defense industry, but have at least seen or heard of Top Gun or its recently released blockbuster sequel, you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s a major center specifically for aerospace development. Shield AI targets a very specific customer base that is focused around the U.S. military and its allies, but even so it speaks about what it does in terms that bring its purpose and function into context for more ordinary people. \u201cChina\u2019s military is Netflix; the U.S. military is Blockbuster. China is Amazon; the U.S. is Barnes & Noble. China is Tesla; the U.S. is General Motors,\u201d writes Brandon Tseng, the president of the company who co-founded it with his brother Ryan (who is the CEO). Brandon is also a former Navy SEAL so he speaks with some authority in making these sorts of analogies. And on the company\u2019s home page, it describes Hivemind, its AI-based autonomous software platform, as what else? \u201cA Top Gun for every aircraft.\u201d As with a lot of other companies (maybe every company) in autonomous transportation, be it in the air or on the ground, Shield AI has a mix of software and hardware that is already usable, and then products that are still in development. Some will be used in purely autonomous systems and some in tandem with humans. In the case of Shield AI, the company says that Hivemind and its Nova drone (or small-unmanned aircraft system, sUAS, in more formal terminology) have been in use since 2018. Ryan Tseng tells us that the specifics of exactly where and how are classified, as are most of the company\u2019s other activities, but they are part of the U.S. Department of Defense Program of Record. It\u2019s also working on a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft called V-BAT that will be soon equipped with Hivemind. The software is being integrated into other aircraft, too, such as the F-16 fighter jet pictured above, where it will act as a co-pilot alongside a human, with the aim for it to be used also across F-22s, F-18s and other models. In the meantime, Tseng said in an interview that its V-BAT craft also have been operational since 2018 around the globe. \u201cThe DoD and international militaries are acquiring V-BAT at a rapid rate so we\u2019re ramping production as quickly as possible,\u201d he said \u2014 one reason for this funding. V-BAT beat out 13 competitors to win a major Navy Program of Record, he added. Its selling point is its ability to withstand challenging conditions. \u201cThe unique design and controls allow it to take off and land in high winds, on crowded flight decks, aboard moving vessels with landing zones as small as 12\u2019 x 12\u2019.\u201d The bigger strategy is to build a \u201cswarming\u201d capability for its devices \u2014 essentially to use a number of them in concert as a way of evading jamming technologies from adversaries. This, Tseng said, is on track for coming to market by the end of 2023 (although since a lot of what they do is classified, they may not actually make anything public until it\u2019s already being used). Taking both Anduril\u2019s recent landmark round and this latest round for Shield AI, we\u2019re in a moment right now where VCs \u2014 working themselves in a challenging financial climate \u2014 have changed their tune when it comes to backing companies in the defense space, which includes not just companies like these building military technology, but also those working in cybersecurity and other kinds of technology that helps with resilience. This could include, interestingly, alternative energy tech and of course products that can be used by more than just governments but enterprises as well. \u201cThe fundraising climate has never been more favorable for defense technology companies,\u201d Tseng told TechCrunch. \u201cSupporting defense was taboo in many circles. We were rejected by many early investors because defense was considered too controversial. Today, there is growing recognition that investment in defense contributes to security, stability and peace, all of which are foundational to a flourishing society.\u201d As noted by others who are investing in this space right now, or building for it, there has indeed been a noticeable shift in how people view companies like Shield AI and what they are trying to develop. That is still a challenge, though, which might be one reason why a company like Shield goes through the work of putting out messaging to people who may never actually be customers to still take in what they are trying to do. \u201cMany people don\u2019t realize the scope of conflict in the world \u2014 before Ukraine, 84 million people were displaced by violence and persecution, up from 39 million in 2011,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many opportunities to contribute to technologies that meaningfully address humanity\u2019s great challenges \u2014 or that create the general conditions for human achievement. When you work on AI pilots for defense \u2014 you are working on the most important and disruptive defense technology of the next thirty years \u2014 and are empowering our country and allies to advance security, stability and peace.\u201d That is bolstered also by the fact that adversaries are also hot on the heels building their own similar systems. China is aiming for military parity by 2027 in the Pacific, Tseng pointed out, meaning they aim to exceed the U.S. by 2028. And he added that there have been reports that it is already benchmarking their prototypes against Shield AI\u2019s pilot. Tseng also may be biased but has a very different idea of why autonomous matters more in this context. \u201cWaymo engineers get to build minivans that plod through the suburbs at 25 mph, we get to work autonomous fighter jets that fly 1,000+ mph, dodge missiles and find threats,\u201d he said. All this is spelling not just an opportunity in the business sense, but a wider one, too, for those backing Shield AI. \u201cInvestors are flocking to quality. This round is a reflection of Shield AI\u2019s success in creating great products, building a business with strong fundamentals and dominant technological leadership \u2014 with an AI pilot proven to be the world\u2019s best in numerous military evaluations,\u201d said Philippone in a statement. \u201cWe love that they are leveraging an AI and software backbone across a variety of aircraft to deliver truly game-changing value to our warfighters. The work they are doing today is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d", "techcrunch55": "Systemiq Capital, a backer of early-stage climate tech startups, says it has secured $70 million to kick off its second fund. The London-based VC aims to raise as much as $130 million more; that would mark quite a step up for the firm, which says it has funneled $30 million into 19 startups since 2018. As far as putting that money to use, Systemiq says it is out to fund founders who are focused on making large industries and cities \u201cmore efficient and sustainable.\u201d In practice, it\u2019ll fund key areas like regenerative land use, oceans, transportation and the circular economy. Systemiq\u2019s past deals include climate data company Jupiter, shipping data firm Nautilus Labs (whose co-founder later launched Bedrock) and ESG-focused investing startup OpenInvest. Last year, OpenInvest sold to J.P. Morgan, the world\u2019s top funder of fossil fuels. Systemiq was co-founded by McKinsey veterans Jeremy Oppenheim and Martin Stuchtey. The consulting giant, which pulls in an estimated $10 billion a year in revenue, also has a lengthy history of work with many of the world\u2019s top polluters. Systemiq partner and former Goldman executive Irena Spazzapan will steer the second fund, along with Oppenheim and former Unilever CEO Paul Polman, the firm said.", "techcrunch56": "Wildfires have become an ever-increasing threat as houses are built closer together and the growing impacts of climate change wreak havoc on natural landscapes. Entrepreneurs, in response, have started to develop tech meant to minimize the scale and damage of these natural disasters. Convective Capital is a new VC firm looking to back them. Bill Clerico, the former co-founder and CEO of fintech WePay, launched the firm this year and has since raised $35 million for a first fund to back early-stage startups creating tech that can help detect and contain wildfires. The fund plans to invest in roughly 15 companies by writing seven-figure checks. While some of these startups could fall under the umbrella of climate tech, Clerico said focusing on wildfire solutions fits more into the climate resilience category. He thinks the distinction makes it a more straightforward investment opportunity because increasing wildfires are already a problem today as opposed to climate tech meant to prevent or minimize future problems. The thesis turned out to be a polarizing one to pitch as some investors understood the need immediately while others thought focusing on wildfire could prove to be too niche. \u201cIt made fundraising easier in that there were people who had witnessed the economic opportunity first hand, and understood the impacts of fire there,\u201d Clerico said. \u201cOr they had experienced it personally in various ways\u2026or folks didn\u2019t.\u201d Clerico left WePay after a decade to pursue angel investing and become a volunteer fire fighter. While spending time at his home in Mendocino, California, he saw the impacts of the growing wildfire crisis as one of the natural disasters closed down the road to his house and he found himself struggling to get home insurance. \u201cJust watching wildfires become the really big crisis that it is, and having a real vested interest in the outdoors, led me down this path,\u201d Clerico said. \u201cI started thinking about how technology could be a solution.\u201d Clerico had made about 50 angel investments and admitted he was bored at the thought of hearing another fintech pitch. He started backing fire tech companies and began to specialize in the category. He decided to raise a fund so he could invest in the sector at scale. He estimated that there are currently 200 startups focused on this area, claiming that Convective Capital has probably talked to all of them. These startups are tackling different areas of the wildfire crisis ranging from Pano, a startup that uses camera systems and AI to help emergency response teams detect fires earlier, to Rain Industries, a company that creates autonomous drones to help put out fires. \u201cWhat was missing though is that community coming together and acknowledging that fire tech is thing,\u201d Clerico said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist as a category like fintech exists. Part of what we want to do as a firm is bring awareness to that category and really just help these founders get to know each other.\u201d Maxwell Brodie, the co-founder and CEO of Rain Industries, told TechCrunch that while most likely everyone in California has been impacted by wildfires, it\u2019s nice to see that someone like Clerico is actually trying to do something about it. He hopes that his involvement can help draw more builders and investors into the category. \u201cAll larger pools of resources [and capital] seek out where new emerging growth is going to come from,\u201d Brodie said. \u201cWhat [Clerico] is doing with Convective Capital is proving that there is a new emerging area of growth and everyone should be paying attention to that, especially late-stage investors.\u201d While Clerico doesn\u2019t believe that any sectors can really be recession proof, he thinks firetech is an area that isn\u2019t really tied to broader market conditions. And while many of the companies he backs aren\u2019t preventing the wildfires from starting, he hopes they can help mitigate some of the damage. \u201cTo leverage the power of startups to have a positive impact is a really inspiring challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the reasons why myself and my partners have gone after this.\u201d", "techcrunch57": "This past year has seen a wholesale shift in how the market feels about fintech. A year ago, nearly every investor had a fintech thesis, companies were racing to go public and investors at nearly every stage of the market were fighting to jam money into the hands of founders. That\u2019s not true any longer. The collapse in valuations on the public market has been extreme. A significant number of the biggest fintech companies to go public in the last couple of years are now worth less than the money they\u2019d raised. And that drop in confidence has now permeated to all stages of the market. Understandably, many early founders are unprepared to contemplate that the valuation of their idea \u2014 which will likely take about a decade to come to fruition \u2014 is now worth 75% less than it would have been six months ago. But the long-term outlook of the sector remains unchanged for most investors and founders. The good news is, we\u2019re still seeing deals getting done. The founders who are succeeding in this environment have adapted to the new reality quickly. Money tends to attract money, so find ways to get the ball rolling. Here are four strategies that the best early-stage fintech founders are now employing to fundraise: Recognize that bid/ask spreads are going to be wide It\u2019s not you; it\u2019s the market. The best founders recognize that the goal is to close a round, not to maximize the price or minimize dilution. Minimizing dilution is good but not at the cost of losing a deal. Plan for a long fundraise While quick deals with proven founders and exceptional teams still happen, the average fundraising round, including diligence and paperwork, can now take up to four to five months. The days of the Notion-doc-over-a-weekend are firmly in the past.", "other news sites58": "Airbus and Boeing have competed neck and neck for five decades in one of the world\u2019s great commercial rivalries. But, as the contest resumes in earnest in the wake of the pandemic, the old order has changed. Airbus now has a wide lead in the single-aisle market \u2014 the hottest area of aviation \u2014 leaving Boeing to grapple with how to bridge the gap. The European company has grabbed new orders and market share with its popular A320 family of narrow-body jets, which predominantly serve shorter-haul destinations, to which travel has rebounded faster, compared with long-haul flights. Latest figures to the end of June show that Airbus had close to 17,000 orders of its A320 and A220 aircraft, and has so far delivered just over 10,600. The A320 is now the bestselling aircraft ever, overtaking US-based Boeing\u2019s 737 jet. Recent fleet data from aviation consultancy Cirium showed Airbus\u2019s A320 family with a \u201cfirm order backlog\u201d market share of 59 per cent compared with Boeing\u2019s 737 family of jets. The bestseller within the A320 family is its largest model, the A321neo, which is also offered with extra fuel tanks in long-range and extra-long range variants. Some airlines \u2014 such as America\u2019s JetBlue \u2014 now use these for long-haul flights that were traditionally flown by more expensive wide-body jets. Airbus\u2019s market share is only likely to grow as the group moves ahead with aggressive plans to lift output of the jets to 75 a month by 2025, despite industry-wide concerns about constraints in the supply chain. Production had reached a record 60 a month in 2019 before dropping to 40 a month when Covid hit. Some analysts have questioned when Boeing will be able to regain some of that lost market share, as the company has continued to deal with fallout from the grounding of its 737 Max 8 after two fatal crashes within five months. Production problems have prevented customer deliveries of Boeing\u2019s wide-body 787 aircraft \u00a9 Richard Ellis/Alamy Global regulators have since cleared the jet to fly again after Boeing implemented software and design changes and the plane is notching up new orders. Another challenge looming, however, is the recertification of the shorter 737 Max 7 and longer 737 Max 10 variants. Boeing is racing to complete those processes before the end of the year to avoid having to develop a new flight deck under rules introduced by US Congress following the Max crashes. I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but he\u2019s not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle Boeing has also suffered production issues that have prevented customer deliveries of its wide-body 787 aircraft. In addition, development of its 777X aircraft has been delayed, while problems on a number of big defence contracts have only added to the challenges. Union representatives, meanwhile, have criticised the company\u2019s decision to move its global headquarters from Chicago to Washington, DC \u2014 seen as taking it further away from its spiritual home, the commercial aircraft factories of Seattle, and adding to persistent questions over the quality of its engineering. Repeated delays on the commercial side have frustrated some of Boeing\u2019s largest customers, including Ryanair. The low-cost carrier\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, has said sweeping changes are needed to Boeing\u2019s senior management led by chief executive Dave Calhoun. In a recent interview, O\u2019Leary told the Financial Times that the US aviation group has \u201clost huge market share and existing customers are being lost to Airbus, which is why I don\u2019t understand why they sit there and do nothing\u201d. \u201cI have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun . . . but he\u2019s not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle,\u201d he said. But others, including Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr, have continued to back the US company. Boeing has insisted that things have changed since the Max accidents. It is also ramping up the hiring of engineers as it works with the US aviation regulator to certify its upcoming 777X aircraft. Boeing\u2019s chief executive Dave Calhoun has sought to resist discussion on market share \u00a9 Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg However, in a further blow, Boeing last month lost out to Airbus on a $37bn order from China\u2019s three big state airlines. They chose 290 A320neo jets \u2014 the biggest order by Chinese airlines since the start of the pandemic. The country is a crucial market for both Airbus and Boeing and the orders come at a time of rising political tensions between the US and China. Calhoun has previously cited uncertainty over orders from China as one of the three main risks facing the company, along with securely boosting production of the Max and resolving issues around the 787. China was the first country to ground the Max and, although its aviation regulator last year approved its return to service, Chinese carriers have not started flying the plane commercially again. The multibillion-dollar question facing Boeing, therefore, is how to recover its lead against Airbus, at the same time as China\u2019s first self-developed aircraft \u2014 Comac\u2019s narrow-body C919 \u2014 is finally nearing completion. Boeing abandoned a plan for a new midsize aeroplane \u2014 a twin-aisle aircraft that would have sat between the 737 Max and the larger 787 \u2014 and it remains unclear what its next step will be. Its balance sheet also remains constrained, with some $45bn of net debt. $45bn Net debt on Boeing balance sheet The company needs to \u201claunch an answer to the A321neo,\u201d says Kevin Michaels, managing director of Michigan-based AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cCan they afford it? I think they can. Their balance sheet isn\u2019t great but you\u2019ve got to invest in your core business to stay around in the long run.\u201d \u201cThe other problem they face is knowing what to do \u2014 if you do press the button, how do you do that plane? The world is about to change massively but no one yet knows what that technology will be and you could end up spending $20bn on something that will be immediately obsolete,\u201d says Nick Cunningham, analyst at research firm Agency Partners in London, who believes the company needs to raise equity to fund a new programme. But Calhoun has recently played down any concerns about the company\u2019s market share position vis-\u00e0-vis Airbus. \u201cAt this moment in time, it\u2019s less important,\u201d he told an investor conference in June. Boeing, he added, had to concentrate on getting planes back in the air. \u201cWe have to stay focused on doing that incredibly well. One aeroplane at a time. If I jump to a market share discussion immediately and say, \u2018Let\u2019s get above 50 and let\u2019s do it next year\u2019, what happens? The whole system gets crammed down in every way.\u201d He also indicated at the same conference that the company might not launch anything new for at least another couple of years. He does not believe that the performance improvement to justify an all new aircraft currently exists. Boeing, he said, was sure it had the ability to compete. \u201cI\u2019m confident, my sales team is confident,\u201d said Calhoun. \u201cOur customers express confidence to me, so why would I rush? No good reason.\u201d Additional reporting by Philip Georgiadis ", "techcrunch59": "There\u2019s been a lot of hand-wringing over whether the world will get its act together enough to prevent catastrophic warming. There\u2019s certainly a case to be made there \u2014 we\u2019ve spent the last several decades kicking the can down the road at every opportunity. Well, here we are again, with the can again before us and the end of the road fast approaching. Lucky for me, I tend to be an optimist. I still think we\u2019re in for a world of pain, and we\u2019ll probably have to rely on some exotic technologies like fusion power and direct air capture to pull ourselves back from the brink. But in my opinion, when the chips are down, humanity tends to pull through. If we use computing and software as a guide, we should expect to see a nearly fivefold increase in the capital committed in the next 30 years. That is why I think many of the gloom-and-doom scenarios regarding climate tech investments tend to be overly bearish. Take the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) forecasts, which for years habitually underestimated the growth of solar power. The agency has since added better models to its toolkit, but it and others still make predictions that go on to be proven overly pessimistic. In reality, renewable energy and other climate tech is likely to follow an adoption curve that\u2019s similar to other industries. It might even follow an accelerated version given how broad and deep the impacts and benefits of climate tech are likely to be \u2014 and the very real prospect of Armageddon if we do nothing. To see how climate tech stands to outperform today\u2019s forecasts, you only have to look as far back as 1970, when the computing revolution was beginning. Exponential trends The overarching trend of investment in the computing and telecommunications space over 50 years has been exponential. But that simplistic analysis papers over the significant growth that happened in the early years. It also fails to pick up on key technological advances that sparked wider adoption.", "techcrunch60": "The collapse of Three Arrow Capital and the counterparties wrapped in the crypto hedge fund\u2019s troubles have drawn questions about the soundness of the heady digital asset investment space. For the industry\u2019s survivors, watching their rivals fall to pieces overnight has been an alarming experience. To understand where the industry might be going after the market turmoil, we spoke with John Ge, chief executive officer at Matrixport, a Singapore-based digital asset manager with over $10 billion in assets under management and custody. Ge was formerly the head of investment and financing as well as a founding partner at Bitmain, the world\u2019s biggest maker of Bitcoin mining machines. Together with Bitmain\u2019s co-founder and former CEO Jihan Wu, Ge co-founded Matrixport in 2018. Three Arrow Capital, known as 3AC in the crypto community, was one of the world\u2019s largest crypto hedge funds before its fall from grace. Its success was predicated on a risky strategy: it borrowed aggressively from crypto lenders and in turn invested that money in other crypto projects. When cryptocurrency prices began to plummet earlier this year, the firm, as well as other similar outfits that bet on rising crypto prices, failed to repay their creditors and plunged into liquidation. The crypto market is down by $1.8 trillion since its peak in November, led by the slide in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The recent market crash is \u201cinevitable\u201d, Ge says in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThe core issue is that we saw players whose business model is like a black box. They borrow money from investors without giving transparency over how the money will be used.\u201d The other problem is that these crypto managers are acting both as the player and referee, Ge contends. \u201cMany of them are providing both asset management and proprietary trading. An asset manager should not be doing proprietary trading, and if it does, it needs to follow stringent leverage requirements.\u201d \u201cEven the most conservative investment strategy has risks and may result in losses, but the principle is to be transparent with your customers, not fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading,\u201d the founder says. Matrixport, which serves individuals as well as over 500 institutions across Asia, Europe and North America, was exposed to 3AC and has lodged a claim alongside other creditors. But Ge assures that the firm\u2019s exposure is \u201crelatively small\u201d when compared to the exposure other industry players faced and is considered \u201cminor\u201d when compared relative to Matrixport\u2019s equity. As to how to restore investor confidence in the crypto sphere, Ge believes regulators are on the right track to bring more oversight over consumer-facing crypto products and protection for retail investors, as is the case in Singapore. But it\u2019s \u201cunrealistic\u201d to have regulators design risk control models for institution-focused asset managers. \u201cThe pace of regulations tends to fall behind that of industry development.\u201d Ge thinks investors have \u201clost a certain level of confidence\u201d in the crypto market and the industry will take time to recover. On the other hand, he thinks competition has waned for survivors like Matrixport because \u201cmany of the other players are gone.\u201d Matrixport told Bloomberg last year that it planned to go public in three to five years and Ge said that plan \u201chasn\u2019t changed.\u201d It\u2019s too early to say which market the company is floating its shares but the U.S. is a \u201clikely\u201d option given investors there are more \u201cwelcoming of crypto innovation.\u201d", "techcrunch61": "Ironclad, a startup that makes it easier for legal teams to manage their contracts workflow, today announced that it has raised a $50 million Series C round led by Y Combinator Continuity, with participation from Emergence Capital, as well as existing investors including Accel and Sequoia Capital. This round brings Ironclad\u2019s total funding to $83 million, according to Crunchbase. In addition to the new funding, Ironclad, which was part of Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2015 class, also today announced the launch of its Workflow Designer. This tool allows teams to easily create their own custom workflows based on their individual business processes and timelines. Setting up those workflows looks be a pretty straightforward process. After tagging the existing contract, teams can then set up their processes based on what\u2019s in a specific document. If a contract is over a specific value, for example, they can add a payment clause, or set up an approval process based on that value. Workflow Designer complements the service\u2019s existing tools for managing the contract life cycle and collaborating on legal documents. The company says it will use the new funding to expand into new geographies and expand its product. \u201cThis round and our continued momentum highlights how big the opportunity is to streamline contracting for every type of company in the world,\u201d said Jason Boehmig, co-founder and CEO of Ironclad. \u201cOur newest investors bring a depth of later-stage company experience and a vision for what cloud companies will look like in the future. Our new funding will fuel continued product innovations, like our new Workflow Designer, which is accelerating contracting time by 85% for our customers.\u201d", "other news sites62": "The report also finds that a raft of new policies in countries like the US, Japan, Korea and the EU will likely see clean energy investments of around $2 trillion by 2030, a rise of more than 50% from today.", "techcrunch63": "As well as the traditional carbon offset resellers and exchanges such as Climate Partner or Climate Impact X, the tech space has also produced a few, including Patch (U.S.-based, raised $26.5 million) and Lune (U.K.-based, raised $4 million). Now, Ceezer, a B2B marketplace for carbon credits, has closed a \u20ac4.2 million round, led by Carbon Removal Partners with participation of impact-VC Norrsken VC and with existing investor Picus Capital. Ceezer\u2019s pitch is that companies have to deal with a lot of complexity when considering how they address carbon removal and reduction associated with their businesses. While they can buy offsetting credits, the market remains pretty \u2018wild-west\u201d, and has multiple competing standards running in parallel. For instance, the price range of $5 to $500 per ton is clearly all over the place, and sometimes carbon offset resellers make buyers pay high prices for low-quality carbon credits, pulling in extra revenues from a very opaque market. The startup\u2019s offering is for corporates to integrate both carbon removal and avoidance credits in one package. It does this by mining the offsetting market for lots of data points, enabling carbon offset sellers to reach buyers without having to use these middle-men resellers. The startup claims that sellers no longer waste time and money on bespoke contracts with corporates but instead use Ceezer\u2019s legal framework for all transactions. Simultaneously, buyers can access credits at a primary market level, maximizing the effect of the dollars they spend on carbon offsets. Ceezer says it now has more than 50 corporate customers and has 200,000 tons of carbon credits to sell across a variety of categories, and will use the funds to expand its impact and sourcing team, the idea being to make carbon removal technologies more accessible to corporate buyers, plus widen the product offering for credit sellers and buyers.", "techcrunch64": "Across the political, social and economic stage, women\u2019s issues are finally receiving heightened attention and priority. There are more women than ever seeking political office; funding for female-founded startups is reaching record levels (even if they still have a long way to go to reach gender parity); a sizable cohort of female-founded and led companies have achieved billion-dollar unicorn valuations; and several women-led companies, including PagerDuty, The RealReal, and Eventbrite, have entered the public markets with successful IPOs. What\u2019s driving so much positive change? Clearly, broadened awareness of gender and power issues, largely due to #MeToo, as well as an increase in the number of female investors, thanks to groups like All Raise, are all contributing catalysts. In addition, women now outnumber men in college, a majority of American moms are in the workforce, and in 40 percent of households those women are the breadwinners. But it\u2019s more than that; I believe that there\u2019s a profound generational shift afloat, and that this first wave of female-led unicorns is just the tip of the NASDAQ iceberg. Unlike previous generations who may have either looked at self-investment as self-indulgence or who simply didn\u2019t have the resources or technology available to make supplementary investments in themselves, today\u2019s badass millennial women are unapologetic about their desire to invest in their own success and well-being. Determined to succeed without compromising their values or physical and mental wellness, these uber-empowered millennial women are making viable a new generation of startups to help them realize their dreams and feel comfortable in their skin. I refer to this economic wave as She-conomy 2.0. For decades now there have been tech companies, which I refer to as She-conomy 1.0 , catering to traditional and homogeneous identities of women primarily as shoppers and caregivers. In contrast, these new modern She-conomy 2.0 brands address latent, historically unmet, often un-discussed and under-served needs that speak to the multitude of other facets of our identities. These companies have less to do with what women buy and more to do with their willingness to invest in themselves \u2014 in their careers and in their physical and emotional health and well-being. They are seeking and are willing to pay for products and services that help them advance their careers, feel comfortable about their bodies, and provide the physical and emotional support they\u2019re seeking. Women are taking control of their careers and supporting each other. More than two decades ago, when I had my first child, I joined a mom\u2019s group at Stanford Hospital. We were all working moms trying to juggle career and motherhood. It was a truly challenging time for each of us. The group provided such helpful support that we met every Monday evening for five years until our kids were in kindergarten. Why Mondays? Because Mondays are especially hard for working parents, marking yet another week in search of balance. We realized that meeting on Monday evenings provided us with the support we needed to make it through the work week. Perhaps even more critically, it gave us something about Mondays to look forward to. There\u2019s something incredibly empowering about experiencing a major transition like a new job or new parenthood as part of a cohort. Sheryl Sandberg famously sought to institutionalize this kind of support for working women with her non-profit Lean In. It has dramatically raised awareness around working women\u2019s struggles. However, individual Lean In group leaders are usually volunteers running these sessions on the side while working and shouldering life\u2019s endless list of other responsibilities. Now a new generation of organizations is offering this support \u2014 for a fee. As for-profit organizations, they\u2019re doing so in a scalable, consistent and reliable way. Women don\u2019t have to worry about whether the organizer will be able to carve out time to orchestrate a meeting because doing so is the organizer\u2019s job. Chief, Declare, The Assembly * , The Wing and The Riveter are all examples of companies that are growing and thriving because they\u2019re offering valuable space, support and services that women are willing to pay for. Most of these organizations initially targeted millennials, but women of all generations are benefiting and participating. Women are changing the narrative around previously taboo topics and promoting inclusiveness and acceptance of oneself. It wasn\u2019t long ago that mannequins, much like cover models, only came in one size. Now mainstream brands not only sell broader offerings; they increasingly showcase them in magazines, catalogs, stores and the runway. For example, Nike\u2019s flagship store in London featured both plus-sized mannequins and para-sport mannequins for people with physical and intellectual abilities, and Rhianna\u2019s new inclusive lingerie line regularly presents both plus-size and pregnant models. Millennials (like all of us) don\u2019t want to feel shamed; they want to feel empowered and beautiful. Instead of settling for frumpy, ill-fitting clothing or outdated product design, millennials are using their social media megaphones to tell the market what they want. Traditional companies like Victoria\u2019s Secret have moved at a molasses-like pace to evolve from treating women as objects of fantasy to celebrating their right to feel great about themselves. Their antiquated practices have created the opportunity for new startups to create brands centered on body positivity. Some companies are filling largely underserved market needs by catering exclusively to larger and specialty sizes, and others are addressing previously taboo topics like body hair, which also contribute strongly to feelings around body positivity. Eloquii offers extended clothing sizes, Ruby Ribbon * and Third Love provide a wide sizing range of under garments and bras, and Fur addresses body hair and grooming. Women are dedicating more attention to their own health and relationships. Self-help books have been around for ages, but tech is paving the way for a new generation of services to provide guidance and support that are more convenient and targeted. At the same time, women are increasingly willing to discuss health issues that were previously taboo, like menstruation, menopause and perimenopause, fertility, and depression. Advancements in technology are making health-related self-care more accessible from the convenience of our wristbands and phones. Meanwhile, people are spending a disproportionate amount of their wealth on health, making the entire healthcare industry ripe for disruption. All of these factors are making femtech big business. Countless new companies are helping women take more active control of their sexual health, including birth control and STI testing (Pill Club and Nurx), period tracking (Flo Health), fertility and egg freezing (Kind Body and Carrot Fertility), menopause (Rory, Genneve), postpartum depression and miscarriage (Maven) and even our relationships (Relish* and Bumble). In addition, no shortage of femtech companies are addressing period care, such as Lola, Cora, The Flex Company, Thinx, and Sustain Natural. These companies are only viable because so many women \u2014 beginning with millennials but expanding out to the rest of us \u2014 are now willing and able to invest in themselves. United across a shared mission of female empowerment and inclusivity, She-onomy 2.0 is making it more realistic than ever to empower us to advance our careers, feel good about ourselves and stay healthy. Hats off to the badass millennial women leading this charge; we\u2019re all better off professionally, emotionally and even physically thanks to you! *Denotes portfolio company for Trinity Ventures", "techcrunch65": "Luminar, the Florida-based lidar company that went public via SPAC in 2020, has formed a close alliance with an auto behemoth in China. It\u2019s making a strategic investment of an undisclosed amount in Ecarx, an auto tech startup co-founded by Eric Li, founder of China\u2019s largest private automaker Geely, Ecarx said on Thursday. The funding will be part of the pair\u2019s wider collaboration on automotive-grade technologies, which aims to \u201cenable advanced safety and automated driving capabilities in the production of consumer vehicles and commercial trucks,\u201d a plan that Luminar unveiled in May. Luminar\u2019s sensing technology can potentially reach millions of vehicles through the Geely/Ecarx auto empire. Ecarx is building a comprehensive platform for the future of cars, focusing on the likes of auto chips and smart vehicles. Its customers include, unsurprisingly, Geely-owned brands like Lotus and Volvo. Shen Ziyu, Ecarx\u2019s other co-founder and a former General Motors executive, told Reuters in March 2021 that the company had already supplied 2.5 million vehicles. The lidar industry in China is enjoying a boom as the country\u2019s electric car makers \u2014 which themselves have benefited from government support for renewable energy \u2014 woo picky consumers with advanced driving technology, in-car entertainment and other novel auto features. Luminar\u2019s tie-up with Ecarx will be critical in helping it confront domestic lidar players, from BYD-backed RoboSense and Bosch-backed Hesai to Temasek-funded Innovusion and Livox, which sprang out of DJI. \u201cThe collaboration will help Luminar to accelerate deployment of its industry-leading long-range lidar and software in the [Chinese] market and beyond through Ecar\u2019s deep connection with Geely and the Geely ecosystem, comprising some of the world\u2019s most reputable automotive brands,\u201d Luminar said in May. The same month, the American lidar maker said it had brought on Jackie Chen, a Harman veteran, to head its China business. Ecarx\u2019s empire is ever expanding. On Thursday, the company announced another funding boost along with the Luminar partnership. Siengine, an automotive system on chip maker it co-founded with Arm China, has completed a Series A funding round of nearly 1 billion yuan or $15 million. Sequoia Capital China led the round, with Bosch\u2019s China venture capital arm Boyuan Capital and others participating. Earlier this month, Li and Shen bought Chinese smartphone maker Meizu, once a Xiaomi archrival, to work toward a future of \u201cmulti-device, scenario-agnostic, and immersive\u201d digital experience, which will no doubt include system integration between vehicles and handsets. In May, Ecarx announced plans to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm in a $3.8 billion deal.", "techcrunch66": "Energize Ventures, an early and growth-stage venture fund, has announced the closing of its second fund with total capital commitments of $330 million. Fund II will be used to help scale and commercialize software across renewable energy, mobility, cybersecurity, battery storage, critical infrastructure and climate resiliency. The fund, which is worth exactly double what Energize raised for its first fund, is backed by anchor investors such as Invenergy, CDPQ, SE Ventures, GE Renewable Energy and Hannon Armstrong. Credit Suisse, Xcel Energy, American Electric Power and Equinor Ventures also participated. \u201cSince we first launched Energize five years ago, we have seen the energy and industrial sectors undergo a massive digital transformation,\u201d said John Tough, managing partner of Energize Ventures, in a statement. \u201cThe transition towards a more renewable and sustainable future is outpacing all expectations, and market participants are digitizing operations to address this new, emerging scale.\u201d To date, Energize has deployed capital from Fund II into three investments, including Munich-based predictive battery analytics software TWAICE, Columbus, Ohio-based IoT device company Finite State and New York-based critical infrastructure safety AI company Urbint, according to the firm. Fund II is targeting 15 or more early-stage digital-first startups that are raising Series A, B or C rounds in the energy and sustainable industry sectors. Typically, Energize Ventures invests around $10 million to $20 million and prefers to lead the round. The firm\u2019s first round invested in 14 software-based companies, including the now-public EV charging solution Volta, cloud manufacturing startup Fast Radius and solar software company Aurora Solar. \u201cEnergize exclusively invests in digital solutions,\u201d according to the company. \u201cThat means no hardware, no moonshots that require untold amounts of capex to get off the ground \u2014 just technologies at the software layer at commercialization. Part of that comes from the firm\u2019s investment strategy; the team leans on its LPs (including well-known corporates such as GE and Schneider) to identify the challenges facing the sectors today, and then finds solutions that overcome those barriers to decarbonization.\u201d", "techcrunch67": "This startup hopes to get us to net zero via its platform to construct wooden buildings One of the stunning facts that\u2019s emerged over the last few years \u2014 especially as VCs and startups have turned their attention toward the climate crisis \u2014 is that our cities produce an enormous amount of CO 2 : In fact, buildings are responsible for around 40% of global CO 2 emissions. But of course, the problem is that cities are unlikely to stop building, and growiing. Some estimates say that if global urban growth continues at its current pace, then we\u2019d build a New York City every month for the next 40 years. So if we could reduce this amount or transition, this growth to \u201cnet zero\u201d (or better), we\u2019d would do to a lot alleviate the impending, and disastrous, affects of climate change. This is why we are seeing so many new climate funds appear, which are concentrating on the built environment. A large part of this problem is that concrete and steel are just not sustainable materials, unlike (say) timber. Now, \u201c011h\u201c, based out of Barcelona, thinks it might have the answer. Currently, the building processes that use manual labor and usustainalble materials don\u2019t pass muster, so if you can standardize and digitize the building process to make it repeatable and scalable (says 011h) while shifting sustainable materials \u2014 like mass timber \u2014 you can allow architects, builders, developers and investors to make net-zero buildings faster, cheaper and more sustainable. It all sounds lovely in theory, but in fact 011h says it has already completed such a project with Renta Corporaci\u00f3n, a publicly traded developer, where the \u201cembodied carbon\u201d of the building was reduced by more than 90% compared to conventional methods, while construction timelines were reduced by 35%. This has led to three more major projects being commissioned. No doubt partly as a result of this, 011h has now raised a significant \u20ac25 million in Series A funding. The funding round was led by Redalpine, accompanied by Seaya Andromeda and Breega, with the participation of Aldea Ventures, among others. Previous investors also joined the round, including Giuseppe Zocco, Foundamental and A/O Proptech, which accelerates 011h\u2019s ambition to create a sustainably built world. The funding will be used to further develop 011h\u2019s platform, building system and team, initially focusing on Spain, then internationally. Lucas Carn\u00e9, co-founder and co-CEO of 011h, said the impact of reducing the carbon footprint of building can\u2019t be iunderestimated: \u201cIf the embodied carbon of every building were reduced by more than 90%, this would reduce 10% of annual global CO 2 emissions, this is equivalent to three gigatonnes of CO 2 every year. In real terms, this is almost 2x more carbon than completely transitioning from petrol to electric vehicles; and is equivalent to eliminating 1 billion domestic gas boilers,\u201d he told me. Harald Nieder, general partner of Redalpine, added in a statement: \u201cAt Redalpine, we believe that there are massive opportunities around sustainability. In fact, the opportunities are such that we are not looking for marginal improvements of the status quo. We are looking for teams that are aiming to have a real impact, worthy of the global challenges we are facing. Construction is both one of the most unsustainable industries and one of the least digital and the 011h vision is exactly what we were looking to support.\u201d", "techcrunch68": "Rob Leclerc has the kind of pedigree that investors tend to like: He has a master\u2019s degree in computer science from the University of Calgary and a Ph.D. in computational biology from Yale. In fact, 10 years ago, what he really wanted to do with his degrees was to find and fund agriculture-related projects that tackle climate change. But a decade ago, \u201cagtech\u201d wasn\u2019t yet a category, and that was problematic when it came to pitching investors on the concept of an investment fund that Leclerc would run with partner Michael Dean, with whom Leclerc had previously operated an agribusiness in West Africa for several years. At the time, \u201cthere were a handful of businesses\u201d relating to agtech that investors were aware of, Leclerc said. Think Climate Corp and Impossible Foods and the smart machinery company Blue River. But Climate Corp hadn\u2019t yet sold to Monsanto for $1 billion. Impossible Foods wasn\u2019t valued in the billions of dollars, as it is today. And Blue River was still years away from its $305 million sale to John Deere. \u201cThe overarching problem was narrative,\u201d Leclerc said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t care about it.\u201d He and Dean might have just given up; instead, they started a San Francisco-based content company called AgFunder News. \u201cWe thought if we could get people excited about food and [agriculture], maybe we\u2019d be in a position to [raise a fund later],\u201d Leclerc said. It was a smart bet. Fast forward and after posting more than 4,000 articles to the site and garnering 90,000 subscribers to the site\u2019s weekly newsletter, Leclerc said AgFunder\u2019s investment team \u2013 which now features four partners \u2013 just closed on $60 million in capital commitments for a new fund that they expect will reach $100 million over the next couple of months if things go their way. It\u2019s a huge step up from previous funds that Leclerc and company began raising several years ago \u2013 beginning with their newsletter readers. \u201cWe first raised a $2.5 million friends-and-family fund,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then five months later, we needed more money, so we raised $2 million, then six months later, we raised $5 million.\u201d And so on. It wasn\u2019t the most conventional way to raise money, but AgFunder had this \u201cmassive subscriber base\u201d to which it could talk directly about its fundraising efforts, Leclerc said, \u201cand the belief that we know what we\u2019re doing and can spot companies started a lot of conversations that we wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise. It became a structural advantage.\u201d The strategy isn\u2019t unprecedented. Leclerc said he was partly inspired by Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch, who built a brand around entrepreneurship, then used the strength of that brand to launch an investing career. Meanwhile, Arrington was preceded in his path by investor Jason Calacanis, who earlier founded a media company, and more recent examples are beginning to emerge routinely. Among them: Londoner Harry Stebbings used his \u201cTwenty Minute VC\u201d podcast as a springboard into the venture world last year, and Nik Milanovi\u0107, the author of a two-year-old newsletter called \u201cThis Week in Fintech,\u201d in January launched an investing syndicate called the Fintech Fund. Still, newsletter subscribers \u2013 no matter how deep their pockets \u2013 don\u2019t invest tens of millions of dollars in a team without seeing some results first. And AgFunder (which has since broadened its LP base) already has some about which to brag. Among the 60 companies to so far receive a check from AgFunder was the autonomous tractor startup Bear Flag Robotics, which sold to John Deere last year for $250 million; Root AI, a startup that was developing a harvesting robot for indoor farms and was acquired by AppHarvest for $60 million last year; and Greenlight Biosciences, a biotech company focused on RNA research that went public last month by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. If you\u2019re curious about how much the firm owned in each of these companies, keep guessing. AgFunder \u2013 which tends to write checks of $500,000 as a starting point but also just wrote a check for $3 million \u2013 doesn\u2019t think about ownership targets or look to own a specific percentage in a company, Leclerc said. While his team has used special purpose vehicles to maintain their pro rata in several companies, including a still-private molecular coffee company called Atomo Coffee, he said he doesn\u2019t \u201cget hung up on ownership. For me, the question is, \u2018Does this investment return the fund or a multiple of the fund?\u2019 If you get hung up on ownership, you can miss opportunities.\u201d As for criteria, AgFunder looks broadly across the food and \u201cag value chain,\u201d Leclerc said. It also invests broadly geographically, with bets in India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia, among other places. It\u2019s lot of ground to cover, so the outfit relies heavily on its head of engineering and the in-house system he has devised to crawl sites and databases for signals that it then distills down to \u201c50 to 100 companies each week\u201d that could be of interest. (One apparent gem it uncovered was Retailo out of Pakistan, a B2B marketplace that connects bodegas with the goods and services they might need, and which recently closed on $36 million in Series A funding. AgFunder has now backed it across two rounds.) Yet AgFunder has other sources of deal flow, too, and one of these is, yes, that newsletter readership. Indeed, asked about how it found that coffee company Atomo \u2014 which says its product produces 93% fewer carbon emissions than conventional cold brew coffee \u2014 Leclerc said the tip came from a limited partner who\u2019d signed on as an investor after first becoming a regular reader. \u201cAn LP who\u2019d followed us for a long time on AgFunder News wrote us, saying, \u2018You probably see a lot of things; this company you should check out.\u2019 So we did,\u201d Leclerc said.", "techcrunch69": "Zero Systems launched seven years ago with an idea to bring automation to professional services like law firms. They wanted to focus on speeding up manual tasks, rather than moving large volumes of information, to help lawyers work more efficiently. They came up with an AI-driven system that can identify work product on a lawyer\u2019s work systems like their inbox or messaging apps, classify it according to client and project and then move the different kinds of information into adjacent systems such as a document management system or a time management system. The idea was to eliminate a lot of the dreary manual tasks that are part of every lawyer\u2019s day. \u201cWe focused on the high value processes where a cognitive component was required to mimic the decision making process of a human user,\u201d company co-founder and CEO Alex Babin explained. For lawyers, that starts with governance and properly filing content as it relates to the client and project they\u2019re working on, and moving it into a document management system or client management system automatically. Next, it looks at time management and tracking the lawyer\u2019s time in an automated way and finally it includes a security component to help keep all of that information secure. The system largely targets unstructured data like documents, emails, messages, files and so forth where they live on a laptop, smartphone or other device with the goal of organizing information automatically. It\u2019s worth noting that the solution is installed in the customers\u2019 facilities, rather than in the cloud, says Gevorg Karapetyan, the startup\u2019s CTO and co-founder. This is partly for security reasons and to meet the requirements of their customers, but also because the data gets processed at the point of ingestion on the edge device the professional is using. \u201cSo basically, we bring machine learning and data processing to where the data is, not the other way around. We don\u2019t see that as a limitation, but as a feature in our use case,\u201d he said. Over time, they realized the solution would also work for financial services and consulting professionals, who used similar types of systems that would work well with the classification system they had created. The company launched the product two and a half years ago. It is making headway with the AmLaw 100, the largest law firms in the United States, with 11 customers online using the product and another 10 piloting it. They went from around 25 employees at the beginning of last year to almost 80 by the end of the year, more than tripling head count. Babin says that as they build the company and add people, they are focused on building a diverse company, not only because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but because clients expect it. He says part of that is looking outside of tech for people with skills which might be applicable to their mission. \u201cWe bring in people from other industries who want to go into tech, and give them an opportunity to learn a job, which I believe is very, very important. So that\u2019s how we address things because there\u2019s so much we can learn from different cultures, different different backgrounds,\u201d he said. As Zero has gained traction, it required more capital, and today announced a $12 million Series A to help keep building out the platform. Today\u2019s round was led by Streamlined Ventures with participation from 468 Capital, AltaIR Capital, PBJ Capital, Gutbrain Ventures, s16vc, AiSprouts VC, Paul Grewal and others.", "techcrunch70": "Ukrainians have often pioneered market-leading companies and built products that positively impact society, especially in the fintech sector. Despite the hurdles of war, the Ukrainian fintech community is working to create better infrastructure and regulation for the country, which can attract valuable companies and institutional investors from different backgrounds. It\u2019s a valuable market I\u2019m sure many investors think the country\u2019s IT sector is a risky investment right now. But it\u2019s still business as usual at fintech companies here. They have proven their resilience even in wartime conditions, and impressively, 90% of Ukrainian tech startups are still hiring. This March, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a bill to establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the country. While the bill doesn\u2019t let you use digital assets as a form of payment, it seeks to create proper conditions to establish a strong cryptocurrency market.

The Ukrainian IT sector is still growing In the first five months of 2022, Ukraine\u2019s IT sector generated roughly $3.2 billion from exports \u2014 27% more than the same period in 2021, and accounting for almost half of the country\u2019s total volume of export services. One of the main goals of the Ukrainian government is to increase the IT sector\u2019s share of the country\u2019s GDP from the current 4% to 10% by 2024. The government\u2019s backing and the strong growth together make for a strong signal of how the IT sector is ripe for investments. Global finance and tech firms are supporting Ukraine Earlier this month, the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation presented Digital4Freedom \u2014 a global initiative that is the primary source of charitable donations for tech companies to support Ukraine. Digital4Freedom is part of the global UNITED24 effort and allows anyone across the globe to make monetary contributions to the restoration of the country\u2019s economy. The program consists of nine projects presented to 40 companies, of which the vast majority have agreed to help with monetary contributions or technology solutions. Amazon, for example, will reportedly provide over $100 million in cloud hosting services for Ukrainian state registers and is planning to develop solutions for deploying artificial intelligence in courts. Crypto exchange Binance will become an official partner of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine to offer educational projects in the IT, web3 and finance fields. Meta, with the support of the Ministry of Digital Transformation, recently launched a $1.5 million assistance program for the recovery of the Ukrainian economy, helping small- and medium-sized businesses with a specialized training centre. Startups are an integral part of the Ukrainian economy Ukrainian businesses expect a reduction in the production of goods and services due to the war. What\u2019s more, company executives predict the next 12 months will bring inflation and devaluation of the hryvnia. Ukrainian tech startups are dedicating their efforts to elevating the industry to new heights. They are set to become the foundational pillars for a new layer of technology companies that will add significant value to the economy. Fintech is growing fast despite setbacks This year, Ukrainian lawmakers introduced the Law of Ukraine on Payment Services (LPS), which will provide a better regulatory environment for the fintech sector, including for payment services. Additionally, the Ukrainian Association of Fintech and Innovation Companies (UAFIC) became the first non-EU member to join the European Digital Finance Association (EDFA). Both organizations are collaborating to strengthen the fintech landscape in Ukraine. I believe Ukraine\u2019s resilience in the face of Russian aggression, and the tremendous growth of the fintech landscape despite the crisis has proven that investors should not hesitate to invest in the fast-growing industry. Despite the difficult situation in the country, the industry continues to develop. While attending numerous conferences and fintech events, I meet investors from all over the world interested in companies from Ukraine. All this tells us that the prospects for fintech in Ukraine look good, and that now is an excellent time to invest in it.", "other news sites71": "Climate change is shrinking the difference between the daily high temperature and the daily low in many parts of the world, according to a new study. Climate change is shrinking the difference between the daily high temperature and the daily low in many parts of the world. The gap between the two, known as the diurnal temperature range (DTR), has a significant effect on growing seasons, crop yields, residential energy consumption and human health issues related to heat stress. Why and where the DTR shrinks with climate change has proved something of a mystery. Researchers who are part of a new international study that examined the DTR at the end of the 21st century believe they have found the answer: an increase in clouds, which blocks incoming shortwave radiation from the Sun during the day. This means that while both the daily maximum temperature and the daily minimum are expected to continue to increase with climate change, the daily maximum temperature will increase at a slower rate. The end result is that the DTR will continue to shrink in many parts of the world, but that the changes will vary depending on a variety of local conditions, researchers said. The study, published in the journal AGU Geophysical Research Letters, is the first to use high-resolution computer modelling to delve into the issue of the Earth\u2019s shrinking DTR, particularly how it is related to cloud cover. \u201cClouds are one of the big uncertainties in terms of climate projections,\u201d said co-author Dev Niyogi, a professor at The University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences. \u201cWhen we do this with a very high spatial resolution modelling framework, it allows us to explicitly simulate clouds.\u201d Lead author Doan Quang Van, an assistant professor at the University of Tsukuba Center for Computational Sciences in Japan, said this is vital for understanding the future of the DTR: \u201cClouds play a vital role in the diurnal temperature variation by modulating solar radiative processes, which consequently affect the heat exchange at the land surface.\u201d Using supercomputers at the University of Tsukuba's Centre for Computational Sciences, the team was able to model the complicated interplay of land-surface processes on climate change. These include changes in land use (such as deforestation), soil moisture, precipitation, cloud cover and other factors that can affect the temperature in a local region. By creating a model with a finer resolution grid \u2013 2km/sq grids rather than the 100km grids used in most climate models \u2013 the researchers were able to more closely analyse the impacts of climate change. The team focused on two areas: the Kanto region of Japan and the Malaysian peninsula. Using the 10-year period from 2005-2014 as a baseline, the researchers then ran different climate scenarios to project what will happen to the DTR in the two regions at the end of the century. They found that the temperature gap closes by about 0.5\u00b0C in the temperate Kanto region and 0.25\u00b0C in the more tropical Malaysian peninsula. Researchers attribute these changes in large part to increased daytime cloud coverage that would be expected to develop under these climate conditions. The researchers said the study can help scientists improve current global climate models and aid in understanding how the shrinking DTR will affect society and the environment as the climate continues to warm. \u201cIt is very important to know how DTR will change in the future because it modulates human, animal and plant metabolisms,\u201d said Quang Van. \u201cIt also modulates the local atmospheric circulation such as the land-sea breeze.\u201d The research paper \u2013 'Causes for Asymmetric Warming of Sub-Diurnal Temperature Responding to Global Warming' \u2013 has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The research was funded by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Nasa Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science, and the US Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture.

See More \u2192 Continuing Silicon Valley\u2019s long and storied history of misreading dystopian satires as instruction manuals, a startup has created a tech product that makes call center workers' voices sound white. The startup, called Sanas and founded by three former Stanford students, was first reported on by Joshua Bote for SFGate on Monday. On Sanas' website, you can \u201chear the magic\u201d: a simulated conversation between a call center worker with an Indian accent that can be modified with a slider that applies Sanas\u2019s accent translation. After Sanas is applied, the voice sounds more like a text-to-voice reader than another human being, but it does sound typically American and white. Advertisement In a demonstration for Motherboard, company President Massih Sarimand and COO Sharath Keysheva Narayana called an employee in India who talked about his background and work. Then the Sanasa filter was applied. It removed the employee\u2019s accent and created a passable white and American-sounding voice, albeit a bit robotic. Sanas describes its approach as \"accent matching,\" and advertises on its website that it can \"improve understanding by 31% and customer satisfaction by 21%.\" Apparently, the software can offer multiple accents at the touch of a button\u2014although its demo only features an Indian accent being turned into typically white and American\u2014and the company frames its technology as \"empowering\" workers. According to materials offered by the company to SFGate, the company claims to have garnered about $132 million worth of funding thus far. Ironically, given its focus on empowerment, Sanas' software to turn call center workers' voices into white American voices mirrors the plot of Boots Riley's 2018 dystopian satire Sorry to Bother You. In the film, the ability to put on a \"white\" voice on the phone allows the film's Black protagonist to rise up in the company, but introduces tension in the workplace that undercuts a union drive and eventually pits him against his former co-workers. In an interview with Motherboard, Sarim and Narayana sketched out their business strategy and explained why call centers were their first choice as clients. Advertisement \"Call centers have a very specific speech pattern. You don't have people laughing, crying, singing\u2014those nuances of speech are not there so it is easier to build it. The next use case is on enterprise communications. As we started going live with enterprise call centers, they said 'Hey we have teams in Asia, we have teams in Africa,'\" Naryana told Motherboard. \"We want to leverage a tool like this so that we can give them a choice and we want everybody to be heard. We want to build a very inclusive work culture and we think this could be an extremely great product and technology to actually bring people closer.\" Call centers are heavily surveilled workplaces\u2014dominated by \u201cemployee monitoring\u201d which some are eager to argue is somehow beneficial for the workers. These workers suffer the brunt of a customer\u2019s anger when something goes wrong but lack the autonomy to go beyond a script or narrow guidelines laid out by management. Viewed as disposable, closely surveilled, experiencing little if any autonomy, and forced to deal with angry or racist customers, call center workers typically burn out in a few months\u2014when they don\u2019t, their mental health suffers. The core question here, then, is what deploying Sanas will actually do to working conditions for call center workers. Advertisement It\u2019s not hard to imagine scenarios where the introduction of Sanas results in companies demanding more of their workers because they now have \u201caccent matching\" that is supposed to increase their performance with customers\u2014a typical outcome when workplaces with minimal autonomy implement performance-boosting software. Narayana said increased performance would be a side-effect of Sanas' software, but it mainly has the potential to improve every aspect of this industry: call center labor conditions, the mental health of these workers, and the experience of customers on the phone. \"I don't care about metrics, I think about mental health, employee satisfaction, retention, and overall employee happiness. All of those metrics are checked out for me,\" Narayana told Motherboard. \"I strongly believe once you keep your employees happy, all the business metrics will get better. So that's a secondary result of what we're trying to achieve. But the primary result for me is actually improving the lives of all these agents.\" Sanas\u2019s product doesn\u2019t address the structural issues with call center work nor racism from callers, which its product implicitly side steps. Sanas acknowledges the potential for misuse of its software and says nobody will be \"forced\" to use it because workers themselves activate it with a button\u2014however, this doesn't acknowledge the possibility of being forced to use it by default due to performance quotas. Sanas also says it has a \"code of ethics\" with three values: individual choice (it's activated by the worker), personal control (effectively the same point), and flexibility (Sanas offers multiple accents). The desire to communicate clearly and seamlessly with one another is understandable\u2014as Sarim and Narayana reiterated to Motherboard multiple times, and as the website says, 80 percent of this company\u2019s workers were immigrants. Sarim and Narayana have both worked call center jobs where they dealt with racism. The two insist this informs their end goal: not to simply have an accent translation engine that turns anything into white, American English (\u201cmany-to-one\u201d) but one day to develop a translator for any accent to any accent (\u201cmany-to-many\u201d).", "techcrunch73": "As rumors rumbled that the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike rates once more \u2014 and when it followed through earlier this week \u2014 another round of layoffs hit the tech sector. Stripe, Opendoor, Chime, Zillow, Cerebral, Brex, and of course Twitter, among others, have already cut or are about to eliminate thousands of jobs. That\u2019s bad news for employees today, but it might be good news for the climate in the near future. Before we get too far, let me say up front that getting laid off is terrible and not something I wish to happen to anyone. Not knowing where your paychecks will come from or what benefits you\u2019ll receive is difficult in the best of times, and it\u2019s far worse when economic signs are mixed or major life changes are looming. I am not at all trying to minimize what people go through when they\u2019ve been laid off. It\u2019s happened to me, and it sucks. But layoffs also offer a chance at a new beginning.

Five years from now, PitchBook expects the climate tech market to be worth $1.4 trillion, a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%. All those companies are in desperate need of talent. Nearly every early-stage founder in the climate tech space I\u2019ve spoken with in recent months went out of their way to mention that they\u2019re hiring.

The country has historically been capital-starved, but recent investments from the government and foreign investors have significantly increased access to early-stage venture capital funding. Now, certain industries are emerging as potential areas where New Zealand can win in the tech space. Deep tech, medtech/biotech, climate tech, and crypto and blockchain are all areas that investors say they\u2019re either actively investing in or watching for signs of scale. Note: All monetary amounts are listed in New Zealand dollars unless otherwise stipulated. Deep tech New Zealand has the right mix of deep tech-focused capital and resources, strong engineering schools and major success stories that are helping create technologically sophisticated, globally scalable startups. During the first half of this year, total investment in New Zealand\u2019s early-stage sector increased 78% from the first half of 2020, 42% of which went directly to deep tech startups, according to PwC. Much of that funding came from New Zealand Growth Capital Partners (NZGCP), a government entity established to create a vibrant early-stage environment in New Zealand, via its Elevate fund of funds program that provides capital to New Zealand VCs investing in Series A and B rounds. Last October, Elevate allocated $20 million to a fund managed by deep tech VC firm Pacific Channel. More recently, Elevate committed $17 million to Nuance Connected Capital\u2019s fund focused on deep tech innovations, as well as $45 million to GD1\u2019s Fund 3, which focuses on deep tech as well as connected hardware, enterprise software and health tech. New Zealanders make really good founders. \u2026 There\u2019s something about just growing up on a farm or, you know, playing beer float out in the lakes and rivers; New Zealand is just really resourceful. Blockchain NZ Chair Bryan Ventura Then there are groups, like Outset Ventures, formerly LevelTwo, that are geared toward helping seed and pre-seed deep tech startups get going. Outset is home to New Zealand\u2019s only two deep tech unicorns, Rocket Lab and LanzaTech, both of which have spun out numerous other deep tech companies. Outset continues to be a resource for seed-stage startups that need not only money, but also connections to larger companies and access to workshops and labs. Just last year, Outset and Icehouse Ventures, a VC firm, partnered to raise a $12 million fund, which launched this April, for early-stage science and engineering startups. Imche Fourie, CEO of Outset, said the company has already made 17 investments from that fund.* Notable deep tech companies out of New Zealand include Foundry Lab, a startup that creates metal castings quickly and cheaply with a microwave; Soul Machines, a platform that creates lifelike digital avatars that animate autonomously, responding to interactions and interpreting facial expressions, with personalities that evolve over time; and Dennisson Technologies, a wearables company that\u2019s developing soft exosuits that incorporate 4D material technology to actively assist people with limited mobility due to physical or neurological disability. The most Kiwi of deep tech startups, however, is Halter \u2014 a company that spun out of Rocket Lab and produces solar-powered smart cow collars that allow farmers to remotely shift and virtually fence and monitor cows in order to optimize pasture time. Founder Craig Piggott grew up on a dairy farm watching his parents struggle with the relentless work. After studying engineering at Auckland University of Technology and working at Rocket Lab, Piggott combined his experience to come up with a somewhat wacky and ambitious hardware and software play. Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck, who backed Halter, told TechCrunch he thinks it will be a globally scalable billion-dollar company. The epitome of New Zealand\u2019s deep tech scene is its over $1.75 billion space industry. Rocket Lab, which is now a U.S.-owned company after a SPAC merger, put New Zealand on the map as a place with minimal air traffic, clear skies and favorable aerospace regulations. As a result, companies are forming that can either send payloads into space or provide services to existing space companies. Outset-backed Zenno Astronautics, for example, is developing a fuel-free satellite propulsion system that uses magnets powered by solar panels. Dawn Aerospace is working toward a remotely piloted aircraft that could take off like a normal airplane, drop a satellite payload and be back home in 15 minutes. And Astrix Autonautics, a startup founded by three Auckland University students, is being trialed by Rocket Lab to see if they can more than double the power-to-weight ratios of solar arrays used today.", "other news sites75": "Attendees at a permafrost conference in Dawson City, Yukon, inspect a creek bank in the Klondike where ice-rich terrain has been washed away by placer mining. Climate change threatens to unlock the carbon in sediments such as this.Julien Schroder Richard Littlemore is a Vancouver-based journalist, consultant, speechwriter, and co-author of Climate Cover-up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming. The Klondike capital of Dawson City is one of the best places in Canada to contemplate the catastrophic consequences of thawing permafrost. Or, if you\u2019d rather, it might be a place to ignore the implications entirely, and with confidence that you are not alone in doing so. It depends on how closely you want to look \u2013 or how desperately you want to look away. Most of Dawson \u2013 like 30 per cent to 50 per cent of Canada \u2013 is underlain by permafrost, which scientists define as ground that has remained frozen, winter and summer, for at least two years. The notion may seem chilly, even forbidding, in the south, but many northerners call permafrost \u201cour concrete.\u201d They use it as a base for roads and bridges, as the foundation for homes, churches and businesses. In the words of Steve Kokelj, a Carleton University geographer and one of the deans of the Canadian permafrost community, it\u2019s \u201cthe glue that holds the northern landscape together.\u201d But if the promising prefix \u201cperma-\u201d suggests that this essential base is going to remain frozen forever, you might be disappointed. Thanks to climate warming, which a recent study by the Finnish Meteorological Institute showed is advancing in the North at up to seven times the global average, permafrost is thawing at an accelerating rate. Which means that stuff is starting to break. The Northwest Territories Association of Communities said in 2017 that its annual bill for permafrost-related repairs was already $51-million \u2013 a big additional tax for a small population (44,800). And it\u2019s going to get worse. A January study in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment predicted that permafrost-related damage will affect 30 per cent to 50 per cent of all northern infrastructure by 2050. That\u2019s obviously bad news for everyone who lives in one of the houses that is riding a permafrost thaw slump into the sea. But there is an even greater threat that hangs over us all. According to Sue Natali from the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., there is currently between 1.4 trillion and 1.6 trillion metric tonnes of carbon trapped in northern circumpolar permafrost, the remains of plants and animals that, over many thousands of years, died and slipped below the surface, where they have remained frozen ever since. For scale, that\u2019s roughly twice as much carbon as is currently contained in the world\u2019s atmosphere, three times as much as in all the forests on Earth. And when the permafrost thaws and micro-organisms start chowing down on all that suddenly available carboniferous material, those microbes wind up breathing out the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2) or the even more powerful methane. Next comes the truly dangerous turn, the self-reinforcing feedback that could become an irreversible global tipping point. The warming atmosphere hastens the thaw of the permafrost, which belches up more greenhouse gases, which further accelerates the warming \u2013 and so on into the crisis-ridden future. The short- to medium-term impact of this \u201cpermafrost carbon feedback\u201d loop remains speculative and controversial but by one estimate, based on calculations from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s 2019 Arctic report card, Canadian permafrost could be emitting greenhouse gases by 2050 at a rate equal to all of the country\u2019s current human output. If we were including those GHG emissions in our national totals (we\u2019re not), that would mean we would have to double our emission reductions and/or carbon-capture efforts to reach the federal government\u2019s widely heralded target of net zero by 2050. It hardly bears considering. In the slightly longer term, an overview paper published this month in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources reported that by the end of the century, even middling forecasts show that northern permafrost will be emitting carbon at a rate higher than the current output of any country other than China. A drone's-eye view of the Yukon wilderness. Much of the land in this area lies on permafrost hundreds of thousands of years old that was never scoured by glaciers.Julien Schroder Which brings us back to Dawson, where in late August the foremost permafrost experts in the country gathered with an unprecedented contingent of First Nations delegates for the North Yukon Permafrost Conference. It is, again, a fitting venue. The fabled home of the Klondike Gold Rush, Dawson transformed in the late 1890s from a Dene community of a few hundred to a bacchanalian metropolis of up to 30,000 miners, revellers and hangers-on before crashing back down to its current permanent population of fewer than 2,000. Honouring that history, the town presents as something of a theme park \u2013 though, because it is curated by Parks Canada as a National Historic Site, it looks more quaint than Disneyfied. By municipal decree, all the downtown building fronts must remain \u201cin conformity with the architectural and landscape \u2026 style common in Dawson during and immediately following the \u2018Gold Rush.\u2019\u201d At a distance, the effect is pretty convincing. The landscape part is easy \u2013 1890s-style dirt roads and rickety wooden boardwalks where the sidewalks might be. This is also robustly practical. The heaving permafrost and winter temperatures that frequently dip below -40 would quickly turn pavement or sidewalk concrete to rubble. The buildings appear similarly authentic, as long as you don\u2019t peek behind the facades to see the ones that are, in fact, corrugated-metal Quonset huts with false fronts. If you were to lift the skirts of the actual buildings, you also would find that nearly all of them are sitting on \u201ccribbing,\u201d beams and posts that can be shimmed and adjusted year after year to remain level, despite the permafrost decline. You don\u2019t have to wander far from the main streets to see drunken, slewing (and ultimately dangerous) structures that have not been kept up. \u201cMost of us are used to relevelling our buildings quite a bit,\u201d says Dawson Mayor Bill Kendrick. It\u2019s more difficult, though \u2013 and even more expensive \u2013 to manage some of the other infrastructure, he says, offering the example of the sewer and water lines that snapped a few years ago, thanks to a four-foot, permafrost-driven \u201cdeflection\u201d along Sixth Avenue. These historic buildings in Dawson, shown in the mid-2000s, are smushing together as the permafrost thaws.Chris Beacom Some of Dawson's more picturesque buildings, as seen at 2018's Canada Day parade.Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press So people in Dawson are hypersensitized to the local effects of permafrost \u2013 the geohazard. But many seem to actively ignore the implications of permafrost carbon feedback. Far from trying to protect the permafrost, to keep excess carbon in the ground, many dozens of placer mines are working tirelessly to destroy the permafrost layer, to get access to the gold that still lurks in Klondike gravel. The miners, usually in operations of four to six people, set up in creek beds and spray water at the banks, blowing off any surface flora and the layers of permafrost ice, soils and fossilized material to get to the good stuff. Then they sluice out the gold, thereafter covering the landscape with washed-gravel tailings that, from the plane coming in from Whitehorse, look like castings from Dune-sized sandworms. According to the Yukon government manager of surficial geology, Jeff Bond, there are roughly 150 placer mining operations in the Dawson region, generating 90 per cent of the 80,000 ounces of gold that come out of the Yukon every year. At current gold prices, about $2,200 an ounce, that\u2019s roughly $160-million worth of income, an estimated 87 per cent of which stays in the local economy. As Mayor Kendrick says, \u201cWhen COVID devastated tourism, mining helped us weather the storm.\u201d Here, then, is an analogy for the whole climate-change dilemma: what you know versus what you don\u2019t want to know. As in southern Canada, where governments set emission-reduction targets and then invest in oil sands pipelines or promote oil and gas developments, there is always the tension between an uncertain threat tomorrow and a reliable income today. Against that tension, the Dawson permafrost conference was set up as a multifaceted act of reconciliation. First, of course, was the challenge of engaging and reconciling with the Indigenous people on whom the climate effects are having the most immediate and, often, devastating impact. Carleton University\u2019s Chris Burn, another giant in the Canadian permafrost panoply, describes First Nations people in the North as \u201cthe last group who are not removed from the environment.\u201d He says, \u201cThey realize that they are facing an existential problem, not just an interesting intellectual exercise.\u201d Dr. Burn is also beloved in these parts as an academic who came to the Yukon to research permafrost in 1982 and has been coming back almost every summer since. Unlike too many academic researchers, who fly in with thousands of dollars of equipment and head straight into the field, neither tapping the locals for their insights nor sharing any knowledge gained in the process, Dr. Burn recognized early that \u201cthe observations of the people who actually live here are always more interesting than those I can make myself.\u201d As if to drive home the point, 40 years later, he still gets ribbed for the unlikely riverbank location of his first camp. So, in preparing for this conference, Dr. Burn and others from the Canadian Permafrost Association (CPA) invited First Nations to participate as co-organizers. Three First Nations accepted: the Tr\u02bcond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch\u02bcin, the Vuntut Gwichen, and the Na-cho Nyak Dun. The outcome, according to current CPA president Kumari Karunaratne, was \u201camazing.\u201d Knowing that a third of the people in the room would be First Nations elders, the scientists accepted a challenge to avoid jargon-filled, insider presentations. \u201cThey\u2019re not dumbing it down,\u201d Dr. Karunaratne said, \u201cbut they\u2019re breaking it down enough to be understood.\u201d And in the multidisciplinary world of permafrost science, that turned out to be a boon for other scientists, as well. Participants at the Dawson permafrost conference listen to scientist Antoni Lewkowicz and Peggy Kormandy, a Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch'in elder, describe the Moosehide Slide north of town.Julien Schroder That signals the second point of reconciliation \u2013 the drawing together of the permafrost science community and, especially, the co-ordination of permafrost research. Like other dangerous climate forcings, the permafrost threat is so dispersed that no single jurisdiction can claim or exercise responsibility. Scientists, distributed among many institutions \u2013 and many countries \u2013 tend to work in isolation and, in Canada certainly, funding agencies prioritize short-term capital-intensive research projects, resisting long-term or operating grants. As a result, the Canadian permafrost research community has been relying on what University of Montreal geographer Oliver Sonnentag calls \u201ca coalition of the willing,\u201d in which \u201cco-ordination is not funded and every person, every project is disconnected.\u201d Thanks to at least three initiatives, however, that may be about to change. The first is being led by Carleton University geographer Stephan Gruber, who is the principal investigator for the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Permafrost Partnership Network (NSERC PermafrostNet), which unites researchers from 11 universities, and partners with government agencies, industry, and Indigenous communities to monitor, predict and adapt to permafrost thaw and its consequences. Dr. Natali and the Woodwell Center are driving an even larger research and co-ordination project called Permafrost Pathways, which is building a comprehensive international monitoring network to improve tracking and modelling of Arctic permafrost and carbon fluxes \u2013 i.e., how much carbon is being emitted from permafrost as opposed to that which is being absorbed as new plant material dies and is frozen in the annual cycle. Dr. Natali and company are working to partner with local leaders and to provide local and national policy makers with the data they need to fill gaps in monitoring and modelling permafrost thaw. As mentioned above, permafrost emissions are not currently included in national carbon budgets, which means that emission-reduction targets negotiated at the 2015 Paris climate conference could be way off the mark as the world seeks to keep global warming from exceeding catastrophic levels. The bad news in the Permafrost Pathways project comes in the sudden and unfortunate departure of Russia from international permafrost science collaboration, thanks to the diplomatic break driven by the Ukraine war. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s permafrost lies within Russian borders, so permafrost researchers in the rest of the world are eager to restore the flow of scientific information. In the meantime, there may be a greater opportunity to focus on Canadian monitoring and the Woodwell team has now engaged Dr. Sonnentag, who will be taking a leave from his University of Montreal teaching duties, beginning Jan. 1, to serve as a liaison to the Canadian research community. The Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University is launching a third co-ordination project, called the Permafrost Carbon Feedback Intervention Roadmap, again seeking to expand the conversation and reduce the scientific uncertainties that some policy makers use as a rationale to delay action. Even without working through the next stage of monitoring and analysis, however, Dr. Natali bridles at the continuing policy delay. She says, \u201cUncertainty is just a range of possibilities. It shouldn\u2019t frustrate action.\u201d She also points out that we already understand the range of consequences and says that we should be making decisions based on the high end of the range, precisely because the possible consequences are so huge. (Dr. Gruber calls permafrost carbon feedback \u201ca trillion-dollar question for coastal cities.\u201d) Dr. Natali concludes that, in the long run, \u201cThe science will give us the numbers. For decisions, we need the wisdom to come together as human communities.\u201d Jimmy Johnny, a Na-Cho Nyak Dun elder, speaks at the Dawson conference.Julien Schroder One of the most popular sources of wisdom in Dawson was a Na-Cho Nyak Dun elder named Jimmy Johnny, a presenter in a panel discussion on climate-change adaptation. Mr. Johnny is a short, wiry and quietly mirthful character who has spent his life as a horse wrangler, having gotten his first job as a guide-outfitter in 1958. And he dresses the part: cowboy boots, hat, leather vest and blue jeans that stay up out of pure stubbornness, there being too little flesh on Mr. Johnny\u2019s bones to stop them from falling down. He told a story of a recent hunting trip in which a pack horse named Big Blue fell into a huge permafrost sinkhole: \u201cRight before my eyes, he disappeared.\u201d Tapping the strength of all hands and a couple of other horses, Mr. Johnny worked to pull Big Blue out, but the sloppy hole was too constricted and the horse too panicked. Facing a terrible decision, Mr. Johnny walked to a high point and phoned the horse\u2019s owner \u2013 for permission, or maybe for his blessing. But the owner just said, \u201cJimmy, you\u2019re the trail boss. You do what you have to do.\u201d Mr. Johnny walked back to his own horse and, to the consternation of the southern hunters in the party, he pulled a .30-30 rifle from his saddle. \u201cAnd then I walked around behind the horse, so he didn\u2019t have to see.\u201d But Big Blue was neither inattentive nor new to the world of hunters. When Mr. Johnny cocked the rifle \u2013 \u201cclick, click\u201d \u2013 the horse bounded upward, not clear of the hole, but far enough that they were able to wrestle him the rest of the way. The moderator for the adaptation panel was a Na-Cho Nyak Dun adviser named John Meikle, who noted that there is now ample evidence of the risks we all face from climate change, and the urgency of the call to action, concluding, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to take a lesson from Big Blue and imagine Jimmy Johnny standing behind you with a .30-30.\u201d It\u2019s a rough metaphor, but the head-nodding and mirthless laughter that greeted Mr. Meikle\u2019s comment suggest that, in this room, at least, there is wary consensus about the looming implications of climate change generally and permafrost specifically: Even if we\u2019re not yet capable of jumping out of the hole, it might be time to stop digging.

The weather dictates what grows where and when, but as the Earth warms beneath a wool blanket of excess carbon, agriculture is especially vulnerable in ways you might not expect. Record-setting heat and droughts fry grasses that farmers depend on to feed cattle, warmer temperatures are a boon for pests and fungi that harm crops, smoke from wildfires taint harvests, and extreme weather and rising seas make it more difficult to move everything (including food) around. The threats to food security and livelihoods go on and on. Undoubtedly, this has some deal-makers in tech salivating. As startups look for ways to adapt the global food system to the chaos of today, we reached out to seven agtech investors to get a better understanding of how the climate crisis has informed their strategies to date. \u201cClimate challenges are not new to anybody operating in the broader food and agriculture space, so our approach is to invest in solutions that can help mitigate and adapt to climate change,\u201d Yield Lab partner Camila Petignat told TechCrunch. Themes the firm looks at \u201cinclude soil and water conservation, improved use of crop inputs, the shift from chemical to biological crop protection solutions and reduction of food waste,\u201d Petignat said. \u201cWe could argue,\u201d Petignat added, \u201cthat the increased awareness of carbon markets in recent years has triggered new opportunities at the intersection of agtech and fintech, a space that we are interested in.\u201d \u201cIndia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change,\u201d Omnivore managing partner Jinesh Shah told TechCrunch. \u201cAgriculture represents 20% of India\u2019s GHG emissions, but the sector is also incredibly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which may begin to threaten Indian food security in the coming decade.\u201d he said. Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, per the EPA. Shah added that the firm\u2019s strategy is to \u201cinvest in startups that align with one or more of our four key pillars \u2014 increasing smallholder profitability, enhancing smallholder resilience, improving agricultural sustainability and catalyzing climate action.\u201d The investor went on to state that agtech in India must \u201cevolve beyond digital technologies (farmer platforms and B2B marketplaces), and we look to agrifood life sciences for long-term solutions to climate change.\u201d Read the full survey to learn where investors are looking to invest, what\u2019s on their minds right now, the best way to pitch and contact them, and understand which emerging technologies have captured their attention.", "techcrunch78": "We\u2019ve all seen the headlines: Fintech is struggling. Since last year, valuations are down 70%-80%, deal activity is down 67% and layoffs have plagued many former industry favorites. But fintech is resilient. Innovation continues to drive new developments in lending, payments, crypto and, in particular, infrastructure, showing that the industry still has lots of room for growth. And even though investment activity decreased this year, it still remains well above where it was in 2019 and 2020. Infrastructure providers have a unique opportunity to be a bright spot amidst all the doom and gloom. Over the years, infrastructure has enabled fintech companies and non-financial services companies alike to seamlessly integrate financial products into their platforms. However, as the market grew crowded, infrastructure providers have started competing over who can develop the least expensive product and sign the most fintech companies. The infrastructure market is overlooking a pivotal opportunity to build additional product capabilities that address pain points arising from the struggles of fintech. Infrastructure providers can help connect fintech companies with incumbent banks so that they can both reap the benefits of the interest rate environment. Infrastructure providers must reprioritize and find a way to grow their capabilities for their current customers instead of just signing new ones. To do this, they\u2019ll have to take a closer look at the problems those customers deal with on a daily basis. What does a fintech company do when it\u2019s under a fraud attack? What does a new compliance order in the U.K. mean for their business? How do they retain customers who are terrified by news of skyrocketing interest rates and inflation? These are the questions the leaders of the fintech industry face daily, and infrastructure providers need to understand how they can help answer them. Identifying and addressing pain points The influx of prodigious amounts of cash in the financial infrastructure sector has crowded the space with newcomers. Addressing specific fintech pain points is not only a way to help the fintech industry out; it\u2019s also a way for infrastructure providers to differentiate themselves and show that they provide real value. International coverage The draw of additional customers and revenue streams has caused fintech companies to explore international waters. In an increasingly globalized world, international coverage is no longer optional. Infrastructure providers must meet their customers\u2019 appetite for global growth by ensuring that their platform is available in countries outside the U.S. They also need to ensure their platform helps fintech companies stay compliant with rapidly changing global regulations \u2014 more on that below.

Last night, climate legislation was back on the table, and the odds of it passing had gone up considerably. While not as large, in terms of dollars, as President Joe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 still stands as one of the most significant pieces of climate legislation proposed in the U.S. It would put $369 billion toward clean energy, electric vehicles and a range of other climate programs. Senate Democrats say that the bill could cut emissions by 40% (most likely below 2005 levels, a benchmark the Biden administration has used in the past). That\u2019s not enough to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the globally agreed upon level that would limit most catastrophic outcomes, but it\u2019s close.

This isn't something that might happen,\" he says. \"The problem is, sea level is rising at an accelerating rate now because of ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica. So for now what is just a high tide - a rare high tide.. is going to become a frequent high tide,\" he says. So what does that mean for us? According to Dr. Wanelss's research, by the year 2060, nearly 60% of Miami-Dade county will be underwater. \"Now since the ice melt started we're up to a rate of almost two feet per century,\" he says. Scientists say greenhouse gases like methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are the root of the problem. \"Carbon dioxide, that's the main one. It's the one that every time you burn oil, gas, coal, wood.. you're taking carbon that was stored in the earth and you're converting it to CO2.

In all, Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, handles about $60 billion worth of budget for the Air Force \u2014 a mandate that includes spending money on the new tech initiatives the Air Force deems important. Historically, the Department of Defense hasn\u2019t been the greatest at working with startups \u2014 and many tech companies have been loath to work with the DoD. However, since much of modern civilian infrastructure is based on global positioning systems and other satellite technologies that fall under the Defense Department\u2019s purview, those views on cooperation are changing on both sides. \u201cSpace isn\u2019t a quiet domain of communication and navigation and exploration anymore,\u201d Roper told the audience at TechCrunch\u2019s latest Sessions event, TC Sessions: Space 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly becoming a hostile place\u2026 So we\u2019re gearing up a new kind of competition on the military side that could extend to space and that\u2019s creating a lot of new space programs.\u201d Roper emphasized that the interest from the Air Force and the government more broadly extends well beyond offensive capabilities and military priorities. As space becomes an economic opportunity, Roper sees the Air Force as an engine for driving technology development forward in ways that have commercial benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s a great, great time for innovation in new technologies that could help the military, but we want to do more than just help the military. That\u2019s the old thinking in the Pentagon. That\u2019s all that would help us win the Cold War in the 20th Century, but it\u2019s not going to help us in the 21st, where technology is globalized and accelerating,\u201d Roper said. \u201cWe want to find ways where our military mission and our funding can help accelerate commercial markets too, so it\u2019s competing on a much bigger stage. But we think it\u2019s where we need to aspire to be, so that we\u2019re playing the right catalyst role in this nation and with our partners around the world,\u201d Roper said. There are several programs that startups can tap to get those federal dollars. Two of the easiest points of entry are through the AFWERX and its recently announced SpaceWERX arm focused entirely on space technology. \u201cThese look like any tech company,\u201d Roper told the audience at the TechCrunch event. \u201cThey\u2019re outside our fence lines. They\u2019re easy to walk into\u2026 Now you don\u2019t have to know the mission, we will help you find the mission and the customer \u2014 the warfighter associated with it. It\u2019s a great model because it keeps the company focused on what they know best, which is their tech.\u201d Over the last three years, Roper estimated that the AFWERX program had brought 2,300 companies into the Air Force and Space Force programs, and most of them had never worked with the military before, he said. Within AFWERX there are three programs that particularly relate to integrating startups into the procurement process, Roper said. One is the Spark program, which pairs military with private industry; one is the AFVentures program, which is designed to finance new innovations coming from private industry; and finally there\u2019s the Prime program, which helps commercialize and certify technologies. Roper pointed to the recent certification the Air Force gave to Joby Aviation for its flying cars. \u201cSo there\u2019s a new military market that will hopefully generate a new commercial market,\u201d Roper said. In 2021, the Prime program will expand to space technologies, according to Roper. As the demand for new tech grows, there\u2019s no shortage of innovations Roper would like to see from private industry. From new autonomous innovations that could help co-pilot spacecraft to technology for refueling and in-space maneuverability, and reusable equipment from boosters to other components that can bring costs down. Roper also acknowledged that the Pentagon has a long way to go to \u201chack the acquisition system\u201d when it comes to dual-use technologies. Entrepreneurs have pointed out that one of the biggest obstacles to the growth of the commercial space industry has been the inability of the U.S. government to open up the technology for use by private industry. Roper hopes to change that. \u201cWe want to use our military dollars, our mission, and potentially our certifications to help get you there without changing your core product,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you succeed as a commercial success, then we succeed as well, because now we\u2019ve got a great tech partner, that hopefully we can continue to come to to solve problems in future. The thing that we\u2019ll want to understand early on is how our military market and all those benefits I just mentioned, how can they help you get to commercial success? And what is it that we not need to do to pull you off that trajectory?\u201d Contracts with AFWERX are fixed-price and progress as companies hit certain milestones on the product roadmap. These orders increase incrementally as the technology proves itself, so a contract could start with the delivery of a prototype, then experimental usage, then a commercial contract, then broad adoption. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking to do is see if you can move the ball forward on your technology, and if you do, then we do another contract. We step you up our process,\u201d Roper said. Roper sees the project as nothing less than the evolution of the aerospace and defense industry. \u201cWe have a lot of amazing companies today that helped build stealth bombers and space planes and all sorts of awesome stuff. They\u2019re defense companies and we still need them,\u201d Roper said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping to help build in this century is a set of new companies that are just tech companies. They\u2019re not defense, purely, and they\u2019re not commercial purely.

(PSE Healthy Energy via AP) Gas stoves in California homes are leaking cancer-causing benzene, researchers found in a new study published on Thursday, though they say more research is needed to understand how many homes have leaks. In the study, published in Environmental Science and Technology on Thursday, researchers also estimated that over 4 tons of benzene per year are being leaked into the atmosphere from outdoor pipes that deliver the gas to buildings around California \u2014 the equivalent to the benzene emissions from nearly 60,000 vehicles. And those emissions are unaccounted for by the state. The researchers collected samples of gas from 159 homes in different regions of California and measured to see what types of gases were being emitted into homes when stoves were off. They found that all of the samples they tested had hazardous air pollutants, like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), all of which can have adverse health effects in humans with chronic exposure or acute exposure in larger amounts. ADVERTISEMENT Of most concern to the researchers was benzene, a known carcinogen that can lead to leukemia and other cancers and blood disorders, according to the National Cancer Institute . The finding could have major implications for indoor and outdoor air quality in California, which has the second highest level of residential natural gas use in the United States. \u201cWhat our science shows is that people in California are exposed to potentially hazardous levels of benzene from the gas that is piped into their homes,\u201d said Drew Michanowicz, a study co-author and senior scientist at PSE Healthy Energy, an energy research and policy institute. \u201cWe hope that policymakers will consider this data when they are making policy to ensure current and future policies are health-protective in light of this new research.\u201d Homes in the Greater Los Angeles, the North San Fernando Valley, and the San Clarita Valley areas had the highest benzene in gas levels. Leaks from stoves in these regions could emit enough benzene to significantly exceed the limit determined to be safe by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessment. This finding in particular didn\u2019t surprise residents and health care workers in the region who spoke to The Associated Press about the study. That\u2019s because many of them experienced the largest-known natural gas leak in the nation in Aliso Canyon in 2015. ADVERTISEMENT Back then, 100,000 tons of methane and other gases, including benzene , leaked from a failed well operated by Southern California Gas Co. It took nearly four months to get the leak under control and resulted in headaches, nausea and nose bleeds. Dr. Jeffrey Nordella was a physician at an urgent care in the region during this time and remembers being puzzled by the variety of symptoms patients were experiencing. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much to offer them,\u201d except to help them try to detox from the exposures, he said. That was an acute exposure of a large amount of benzene, which is different from chronic exposure to smaller amounts, but \u201cremember what the World Health Organization said : there\u2019s no safe level of benzene,\u201d he said.

Since then, scientists in the U.K. have been working with Milne to pinpoint the molecules that give Parkinson\u2019s its distinct olfactory signature. They have now zeroed in on a set of molecules specific to the disease\u2014and created a simple skin-swab-based test to detect them. Milne, a 72-year-old retired nurse from Perth, has hereditary hyperosmia, a condition that gives her hypersensitivity to smell. She discovered that she could smell Parkinson\u2019s after noticing her husband, Les, was emitting a new, musky odor. When he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s many years later, she linked this change in scent to the disease. Les died in 2015. In 2012 Milne met University of Edinburgh neuroscientist Tilo Kunath at an event organized by the research and support charity Parkinson\u2019s UK. Though skeptical at first, Kunath and his colleagues put Milne\u2019s claims to the test. They had her smell 12 T-shirts, six from people with Parkinson\u2019s and six from nonaffected individuals. She correctly identified the disease in all six cases\u2014and the one T-shirt from a healthy person she categorized as having Parkinson\u2019s belonged to someone who was diagnosed with the disease less than a year later. Kunath, along with University of Manchester chemist Perdita Barran and their colleagues, subsequently used mass spectrometry to examine sebum (an oily substance found on the surface of the skin) from people diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s. They found molecular changes suggesting alterations in the metabolism of fatty molecules known as lipids. In Barran\u2019s latest study, published in the American Chemical Society journal JACS Au, she and her colleagues developed a simple skin-swab-based test to detect Parkinson\u2019s molecular signature. By comparing sebum samples from 79 people with and 71 people without the illness, the team zeroed in on a set of large lipids. These compounds could be spotted in a matter of minutes using a special type of mass spectrometry in which technicians use a piece of paper to rapidly transfer substances from a swab to an analyzer. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very promising set of biomarkers,\u201d says Blaine Roberts, a biochemist at Emory University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the work. He adds that one of the big open questions is how exacting this test can be. The authors of the new study reported the detailed chemical profile of the unique Parkinson\u2019s signature, but they did not include an assessment of accuracy. According to Barran, as yet unpublished data suggest that their test may be more than 90 percent accurate in determining whether a person has Parkinson\u2019s. Tiago Outeiro, a neuroscientist at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, who was not involved with the research, says the sebum-based swab test is novel. He adds that one clear advantage it has over other methods\u2014such as blood tests\u2014that probe for Parkinson\u2019s biomarkers is the ease of sample collection. Outeiro wonders whether people with diseases that share symptoms and pathologies with Parkinson\u2019s, including multiple system atrophy, also have similar chemical markers. The researchers are now working with local hospitals to ascertain whether their sebum-based test can also be conducted in clinical laboratories\u2014a key step toward determining whether it would work as a diagnostic tool. Ultimately, Barran says, the researchers hope to use the test to help secure a faster diagnosis for individuals with suspected Parkinson\u2019s who have been referred to neurologists by a general practitioner. Thousands of such people are currently waiting to see neurologists in the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, for instance, and it will take an estimated two years to clear that list, Barran says. The new tool could let those patients mail in skin swabs to be analyzed in a hospital lab, pinpointing those who need help most urgently. Barran\u2019s research team is approaching people on the waiting list to see if they are willing to take part in a trial of this triage process. Barran and her colleagues are also collaborating with researchers at Harvard University to determine whether sebum-based biomarkers are detectable in people who have unexplained constipation, a reduced sense of smell or other possible early signs of Parkinson\u2019s but have not yet received a diagnosis. Milne has also inspired other scientists to search for biomarkers based on the disease\u2019s olfactory signature. Last year investigators in China published a paper describing an electronic nose\u2014an artificial-intelligence-based sensor modeled after the olfactory system\u2014that sniffs out a set of nonlipid molecules present in the sebum of patients with Parkinson\u2019s. Other groups in China, the U.K. and elsewhere have been training dogs to sniff out the disease. And Parkinson\u2019s may not be the only disease Milne has a nose for. She has also reported noticing unique smells in people with Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer and tuberculosis, and she is working with scientists to see whether specific olfactory signatures of those diseases can be identified. Milne says she hopes this research will ultimately benefit patients with these conditions. \u201cMy husband suffered from [Parkinson\u2019s] for 21 years after his diagnosis, but he had it many years before that,\u201d Milne told Scientific American in 2015. \u201cI would like to see that people don\u2019t suffer the way he suffered.\u201d", "other news sites88": "Questions remain about how to interpret MCED test results. Only some blood tests can pinpoint which organ the cancer is actually in. Lab tests must be run on potentially cancerous tissue to confirm a diagnosis, but you can\u2019t biopsy someone\u2019s entire body. False positives remain an issue for the entire field of cancer screening, which, by design, involves sifting through mounds of healthy tests to find cancer. Galleri\u2014the MCED furthest along the path to widespread use\u2014incorrectly flagged 57 healthy blood samples as cancerous in the aforementioned study. There\u2019s also a risk of jumping the gun\u2014some cancers never become invasive or life-threatening, but early detection could prompt harsh treatment like chemotherapy. Some data suggests that less worrisome cancers actually show up in the bloodstream less, which could minimize that problem. The NIC trial will help determine how blood test results for cancer should be interpreted, and it should provide a standard approach to launching cancer screening studies as companies flood the field with new tests. \u201cI don't think most companies tend to want to compare their tests head to head,\u201d says Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of cancer prevention at Harvard. \u201cIt's expensive and difficult. So somebody else, a neutral party like the NCI, needs to.\u201d Rebbeck thinks the blood tests the new trial will vet will prove most helpful in the cases of pancreatic, liver, and ovarian cancer, which kill often and have no other form of screening. Still, longer trials are needed to confirm whether the time bought by these blood tests saves lives. But Rebbeck is optimistic about the Cancer Moonshot\u2019s ultimate goal: \u201cIt seems very realistic to me to think that we could reduce death by half,\u201d he says.", "other news sites89": "Artificial-intelligence tools are helping to scientists to come up with proteins that are shaped unlike anything in nature.Credit: Ian C Haydon/UW Institute for Protein Design In June, South Korean regulators authorized the first-ever medicine, a COVID-19 vaccine, to be made from a novel protein designed by humans. The vaccine is based on a spherical protein \u2018nanoparticle\u2019 that was created by researchers nearly a decade ago, through a labour-intensive trial-and error-process1. Now, thanks to gargantuan advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a team led by David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, reports in Science2,3 that it can design such molecules in seconds instead of months. \u2018The entire protein universe\u2019: AI predicts shape of nearly every known protein Such efforts are a part of a scientific sea change, as AI tools such as DeepMind\u2019s protein-structure-prediction software AlphaFold are embraced by life scientists. In July, DeepMind revealed that the latest version of AlphaFold had predicted structures for every protein known to science. And recent months have seen an explosive growth in AI tools \u2014 some based on AlphaFold \u2014 that can quickly dream up completely new proteins. Previously, this had been a painstaking pursuit with high failure rates. \u201cSince AlphaFold, there\u2019s been a shift in the way we work with protein design,\u201d says Noelia Ferruz, a computational biologist at the University of Girona, Spain. \u201cWe are witnessing very exciting times.\u201d Most efforts are focused on tools that can help to make original proteins, shaped unlike anything in nature, without much focus on what these molecules can do. But researchers \u2014 and a growing number of companies that are applying AI to protein design \u2014 would like to design proteins that can do useful things, from cleaning up toxic waste to treating diseases. Among the companies that are working towards this goal are DeepMind in London and Meta (formerly Facebook) in Menlo Park, California. \u201cThe methods are already really powerful. They\u2019re going to get more powerful,\u201d says Baker. \u201cThe question is what problems are you going to solve with them.\u201d From scratch Baker\u2019s laboratory has spent the past three decades making new proteins. Software called Rosetta, which his lab started developing in the 1990s, splits the process into steps. Initially, researchers conceived a shape for a novel protein \u2014 often by cobbling together bits of other proteins \u2014 and the software deduced a sequence of amino acids that corresponded to this shape. But these \u2018first draft\u2019 proteins rarely folded into the desired shape when made in the lab, and instead ended up stuck in different confirmations. So another step was needed to tweak the protein sequence such that it folded only into a single desired structure. This step, which involved simulating all the ways in which different sequences might fold, was computationally expensive, says Sergey Ovchinnikov, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who used to work in Baker\u2019s lab. \u201cYou would literally have, like, 10,000 computers running for weeks doing this.\u201d What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution By tweaking AlphaFold and other AI programmes, that time-consuming step has become instantaneous, says Ovchinnikov. In one approach developed by Baker\u2019s team, called hallucination, researchers feed random amino-acid sequences into a structure-prediction network; this alters the structure so that it becomes ever-more protein-like, as judged by the network\u2019s predictions. In a 2021 paper, Baker\u2019s team created more than 100 small, \u2018hallucinated\u2019 proteins in the lab and found signs that about one-fifth resembled the predicted shape4. AlphaFold, and a similar tool developed by Baker\u2019s lab called RoseTTAFold, were trained to predict the structure of individual protein chains. But researchers soon discovered that such networks could also model assemblies of multiple interacting proteins. On this basis, Baker and his team were confident they could hallucinate proteins that would self-assemble into nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes; these would be made up of numerous copies of a single protein and would be similar to those on which the COVID-19 vaccine is based.

But when they instructed microorganisms to make their creations in the labs, none of the 150 designs worked. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fold at all: they were just gunk at the bottom of the test tube,\u201d says Baker. Around the same time, another researcher in the lab, machine-learning scientist Justas Dauparas, was developing a deep-learning tool to address what is known as the inverse folding problem \u2014 determining a protein sequence that corresponds to a given protein\u2019s overall shape3. The network, called ProteinMPNN, can act as a \u2018spellcheck\u2019 for designer proteins created using AlphaFold and other tools, says Ovchinnikov, by tweaking sequences while maintaining the molecules\u2019 overall shape. When Baker and his team applied this second network to their hallucinated protein nanoparticles, it had much greater success making the molecules experimentally. The researchers checked 30 of their new proteins using cryo-electron microscopy and other experimental techniques, and 27 of them matched the AI-led designs2. The team\u2019s creations included giant rings with complex symmetries, unlike anything found in nature. In theory, the approach could be used to design nanoparticles corresponding to almost any symmetric shape, says Lukas Milles, a biophysicist who co-led the effort. \u201cIt is electrifying to see what these networks can do.\u201d Deep-learning revolution Deep-learning tools such as proteinMPNN have been a game changer in protein design, says Arne Elofsson, a computational biologist at Stockholm University. \u201cYou draw your protein, push a button, and you get something that one in ten times works.\u201d Even higher success rates can be achieved by combining multiple neural networks to tackle different parts of the design process, as Baker\u2019s team did in designing the nanoparticles. \u201cNow we have full control over the shape of the protein,\u201d says Ovchinnikov. Baker\u2019s isn\u2019t the only lab applying AI to protein design. In a review paper posted to the bioRxiv this month, Ferruz and her colleagues counted more than 40 AI protein-design tools that have been developed in recent years, using various approaches5 (see \u2018How to design a protein\u2019). Many of these tools, including proteinMPNN, tackle the inverse folding problem: they specify a sequence that corresponds to a particular structure, often using approaches borrowed from image-recognition tools. Some others are based on an architecture similar to that of language neural networks such as GPT-3, which produces human-like text; but, instead, the tools are capable of producing novel protein sequences. \u201cThese networks are able to \u2018speak\u2019 proteins,\u201d says Ferruz, who has co-developed one such network6. With so many protein-design tools available, it\u2019s not always clear how best to compare them, says Chloe Hsu, a machine-learning researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who developed an inverse folding network with researchers from Meta7. Four examples of protein \u2018hallucination\u2019. In each case, AlphaFold is presented with a random amino-acid sequence, predicts the structure, and changes the sequence until the software confidently predicts that it will fold into a protein with a well-defined 3D shape. Colours show prediction confidence (from red for very low confidence, through yellow and light blue to dark blue for very high confidence). Initial frames have been slowed down for clarity. Credit: Sergey Ovchinnikov Many teams gauge their network\u2019s ability to accurately determine the sequence of an existing protein from its structure. But this doesn\u2019t apply for all methods, and it\u2019s not clear how this metric, known as recovery rate, applies to the design of novel proteins, say scientists. Ferruz would like to see a protein-design competition, analogous to the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, in which AlphaFold first demonstrated its superiority over other networks. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream. Something like CASP would really move the field forward,\u201d she says. To the wet lab Baker and his colleagues are adamant that making a novel protein in the lab is the ultimate test of their methods. Their initial failure to make hallucinated protein assemblies shows this. \u201cAlphaFold thought they were fantastic proteins, but they clearly didn\u2019t work in the wet lab,\u201d says Basile Wicky, a biophysicist in Baker\u2019s lab who co-led the effort, along with Baker, Milles and UW biochemist Alexis Courbet. But not all scientists developing AI tools for protein design have easy access to experimental set-ups, notes Jinbo Xu, a computational biologist at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago in Illinois. Finding a lab to collaborate with can take time, so Xu is establishing his own wet lab to put his team\u2019s creations to the test. Experiments will also be essential when it comes to designing proteins with specific tasks in mind, says Baker. In July, his team described a pair of AI methods that allow researchers to embed a specific sequence or structure in a novel protein8. They used these approaches to design enzymes that catalyse particular reactions; proteins capable of binding to other molecules; and a protein that could be used in a vaccine against a respiratory virus that is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations. Last year, DeepMind launched a spin-off company called Isomorphic Labs in London that intends to apply AI tools such as AlphaFold to drug discovery. DeepMind\u2019s chief executive, Demis Hassabis, says that he sees protein design as an obvious and promising application for deep-learning technology, and for AlphaFold in particular. \u201cWe\u2019re working quite a lot in the protein design space. It\u2019s pretty early days.\u201d", "other news sites90": "Despite being the wealthiest nation on the face of the planet, the United States chronically runs short of transplantable organs . Kidneys are far and away the most sought-after organ for transplantation , followed by livers. While the liver is the only human organ known capable of regenerating itself, if you damage yours badly enough for long enough \u2014 as some 30 million Americans have \u2014 then the only treatment is a transplant. Assuming you can even acquire one for doctors to stick in you. Every year demand for replacement livers outstrips supply by a scope of tens of thousands. \u201cOnly one-third of those on the liver transplant waiting list will be transplanted, and the demand for livers is projected to increase 23 percent in the next 20 years,\u201d a multidisciplinary team of researchers observed in 2016\u2019s Liver-Regenerative Transplantation: Regrow and Reset . \u201cExacerbating the organ shortage problem, the donor pool is expected to shrink further because of the obesity epidemic. Liver steatosis [aka fatty liver disease ] is increasingly common in donors and is a significant risk factor in liver transplantation.\u201d To address this critical shortage, the study authors note that doctors have explored a variety of cutting-edge regimens, from cell repopulation and tissue engineering, nanoparticles to genomics, mechanical aids to porcine-derived xenotransplantation, all with varying degrees of success. Cellular repopulation has been used for years, a process that injects healthy liver cells into the patient\u2019s damaged organ through a portal vein where they adhere themselves to the existing cellular scaffolding and grow into new, functional liver tissue.

Extracellular Vesicle-based therapies, on the other hand, leverage the body\u2019s intracellular communications pathways to deliver drugs with, \u201chigh bioavailability, exceptional biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity,\u201d according to 2020\u2019s Extracellular Vesicle-Based Therapeutics: Preclinical and Clinical Investigations . \u201cThey provide a means for intercellular communication and the transmission of bioactive compounds to targeted tissues, cells, and organs\u201d including \u201cfibroblasts, neuronal cells, macrophages, and even cancer cells.\u201d EVs are the postal letters that cells send one another. They come in a variety of sizes from 30 to 1000 nm and have exterior membranes studded with multiple adhesive proteins that grant them entry into any number of different types of cells. Exploiting the biological equivalent to a janitor\u2019s key ring, researchers have begun tucking therapeutic nanoparticles into EVs and using them to discreetly inject treatments into the targeted cells. However, these treatments are still in the experimental stages and are most effective against acute liver failure and inborn metabolic diseases rather than end-stage liver failure. Mayo Clinic Mechanical aids, the hepatocytic equivalent to a dialysis machine, like the Mayo Spheroid Reservoir Bioartificial Liver (SRBAL, above) are ideal for treating cases of acute liver failure, able to take over the entirety of the patient\u2019s liver function externally and immediately. However, such procedures are both expensive and temporary. The SRBAL can only support a patient for up to two weeks, making it more suitable for keeping someone alive until a donor can be located rather than as a permanent, pacemaker-like solution. The bioprinting and implantation of replacement livers has also shown promise, though they too are still in early development and largely not near ready for widespread adoption. Interspecies transplantation using genetically-engineered pig organs are a bit closer to clinical use , with surgeons successfully transplanting a porcine heart into a human patient for the first time this past January (though he died of complications two months later). Pig kidneys and livers have similarly been transplanted into human recipients, often with less drastic side effects than death. No matter where the transplanted organ comes from, getting it into the patient is invariably going to involve a significant surgical procedure. However, the Lygenesis company recently unveiled its non-invasive solution: tricking the patient\u2019s body into growing a series of miniature, ectopic liver \u201corganoids\u201d in its own lymphatic system like a crop of blood-scrubbing potatoes. For those of you who dozed through high school bio, a quick recap of terms. The lymphatic system is a part of the immune system that serves to circulate some 20 liters of lymph throughout your body, absorb excess interstitial fluids back into the bloodstream, and incubate critical lymphocytes like T-cells . Organoids, on the other hand, are biological masses artificially grown from stem cells that perform the same functions as natural organs , but do so ectopically, in that they function in a different part of the body as a regular liver. Blood-scrubbing potatoes are self-explanatory. \u201cFundamentally, Lygenesis uses the lymph node, your body's natural bio reactors typically used for T-cells,\u201d company CEO and co-founder Michael Hufford, told Engadget. \u201cWe hijacked that same biology, we engraft our therapies into the lymph nodes to grow functioning ectopic organs.\u201d \u201cWe use an outpatient endoscopic ultrasound procedure where we're going down through the mouth of the patient using standard endoscopic equipment,\u201d Hufford continued. \u201cWe engraft ourselves there in minutes under light sedation, so it's very low medical risk and also is really quite inexpensive.\u201d He notes that the average cost for a proper, in-hospital liver transplant will set you back around a million dollars. Lygenesis\u2019 outpatient procedure \u201cis billed at a couple of thousand or so,\u201d he said. More importantly, the Lygenesis technique doesn\u2019t require a full donated liver, or even a large fraction of one. In fact, each donated organ can be split among several dozen recipients. \u201cUsing our technology a single donated liver can reach 75 or more patients,\u201d Hofford said. The process of converting a single donated liver into all those engraftable samples takes a team of three technicians more than six hours and 70 steps to complete. The process does not involve any gene manipulation, such as CRISPR editing. This process is quite necessary as patients cannot donate culturable liver cells to themselves. \u201cOnce you have end-stage liver disease, you typically have a very fibrotic liver ,\u201d Hofford noted. \u201cIt will bleed at the slightest sort of intervention.\u201d Even the simple act of collecting cellular samples can quickly turn deadly if the wrong bit of organ is bisected. And it\u2019s not only the transplant recipients themselves who are unable to donate. Hofford estimates between 30 and 40 percent of donated livers are too worn to be successfully transplanted. \u201cOne of the benefits of our technology is we're using organs that have been donated but will otherwise be discarded,\u201d he said. Once engrafted into a lymph node, the liver organoid will grow and vascularize over the course of two to three months, until it is large enough to begin supporting the existing liver. Hufford points out that even with end-stage disease, a liver can retain up to 30 percent of its original functionality, so these organoids are designed to augment and support the existing organ rather than replace it outright. Lygenesis is currently in Phase 2A of the FDA approval process , meaning that a small group of four patients have each received a single engraftment in a lymph node located in their central body cavity near the liver itself (the body has more than 500 lymph nodes and apparently this treatment can technically target any of them). Should this initial test prove successful subsequent study groups will receive increasing numbers of engraftment, up to a half dozen, to help the company and federal regulators figure out the optimal number of organoids to treat the disease.", "other news sites91": "The study is a collaboration between Dagdeviren\u2019s lab; Siqi Zheng, the STL Champion Professor of Urban and Real Estate Sustainability in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning; and Tolga Durak, managing director of MIT\u2019s Environment, Health, and Safety programs. Jin-Hoon Kim, an MIT postdoc, is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Electronics. The researchers hope that their sensor will help people to find masks that fit them better, and that designers could use it to create masks that fit a wider variety of face shapes and sizes. The sensor can also be used to monitor vital signs such as breathing rate and temperature, as well as environmental conditions such as humidity. \u201cWhat we realized by analyzing our collected data from the individuals in the study was that the masks that we use in daily life are not very suitable for female participants,\u201d says Canan Dagdeviren, the LG Career Development Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT and the corresponding author of the study. Using this sensor, the researchers analyzed the fit of surgical masks on male and female subjects, and found that overall, the masks fit women\u2019s faces much less closely than they fit men\u2019s faces. Currently, there are no simple ways to measure the fit of a mask, but a new sensor developed at MIT could make it much easier to ensure a good fit. The sensor, which measures physical contact between the mask and the wearer\u2019s face, can be applied to any kind of mask. Wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, but a mask\u2019s effectiveness depends on how well it fits. Fit quality The researchers began working on this project before mask-wearing became common during the Covid-19 pandemic. Their original intention was to use sensors embedded in masks to measure the effectiveness of mask-wearing in areas with high levels of air pollution. However, once the pandemic started, they realized that such a sensor could have more widespread applications. With so many different kinds of masks available during the pandemic, the researchers thought this kind of sensor could be useful to help individuals find the best-fitting mask for them. Currently, the only way to measure mask fit is to use a machine called a mask fit tester, which evaluates the mask fit by comparing air particle concentrations inside and outside of the face mask. However, this type of machine is only available in specialized facilities such as hospitals, which use them to evaluate mask fit for health care workers. The MIT team wanted to create a more user-friendly, portable device to measure mask fit. Dagdeviren\u2019s lab, the Conformable Decoders group, specializes in developing flexible, stretchable electronics that can be worn on the skin or incorporated into textiles to detect signals from the body. \u201cIn this project, we wanted to monitor both biological and environmental conditions simultaneously, such as breathing pattern, skin temperature, human activities, temperature and humidity inside the face mask, and the position of the mask, including whether people are wearing it properly or not,\u201d Kim says. \u201cWe also wanted to check the fit quality.\u201d To integrate their sensors into face masks, the researchers created a device that they call a conformable multimodal sensor face mask (cMaSK). Sensors that measure a variety of parameters are embedded in a flexible polymer frame that can be reversibly attached to the inside of any mask, around the edges. To measure fit, the cMaSK has 17 sensors around the edge of the mask that measure capacitance, which can be used to determine whether the mask is touching the skin at each of those locations. The cMaSK interface also has sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure, which can detect activities such as speaking and coughing. An accelerometer within the device can reveal if the wearer is moving around. All of the sensors are embedded into a biocompatible polymer called polyimide, which is used in medical implants such as stents. The conformable electronics are laminated and delaminated on a surgical mask. The researchers tested the cMaSK interface in a group of five men and five women. All of the subjects wore surgical masks, and the researchers monitored the readings from the sensors as the participants performed a variety of activities, such as speaking, walking, and running. They also tested the sensors in a variety of temperature conditions. Using data obtained by the capacitance sensors, the researchers created a machine-learning algorithm to calculate mask fit quality for each subject in the study. These measurements revealed that mask fit was significantly worse for women than men, due to differences in face shape and size. However, the fit for women could be improved slightly by wearing smaller surgical masks. The researchers also found that mask fit quality was low for one of the male subjects who had a beard, which created gaps between the mask and the skin. To verify their results, the researchers also collaborated with MIT\u2019s Environment, Health, and Safety Office on the design and evaluation of the fit, and found that the fit results for each study participant were very similar to what they found using the cMaSK. Customized fit The researchers hope that their findings will encourage mask manufacturers to design masks that fit a variety of face shapes and sizes, especially women\u2019s faces. Dagdeviren\u2019s lab is planning to work on mass production and large-scale deployment of the cMaSK interface. \u201cWe hope to think about ways to design masks and come up with the best fit for individuals,\u201d Dagdeviren says. \u201cWe have different sizes for shoes, and you can even customize your shoes. So why can\u2019t you customize and design your mask, for your own health and for societal benefit?\u201d The researchers also hope to return to their original idea of studying the effects of air pollution on people who work outside. \u201cOur technology can really help to quantify the social costs of these environmental hazards, and also to measure the benefits of any kind of policy intervention,\u201d Zheng says.

If not, they\u2019ll consider the experiment a success. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is return the cell to a near-normal state,\u201d says Daniel Dornbusch, CEO of Excision BioTherapeutics, the San Francisco-based biotech company that\u2019s running the trial. The HIV virus attacks immune cells in the body called CD4 cells and hijacks their machinery to make copies of itself. But some HIV-infected cells can go dormant\u2014sometimes for years\u2014and not actively produce new virus copies. These so-called reservoirs are a major barrier to curing HIV. Advertisement \u201cHIV is a tough foe to fight because it\u2019s able to insert itself into our own DNA, and it\u2019s also able to become silent and reactivate at different points in a person\u2019s life,\u201d says Jonathan Li, a physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and HIV researcher at Harvard University who\u2019s not involved with the Crispr trial. Figuring out how to target these reservoirs\u2014and doing it without harming vital CD4 cells\u2014has proven challenging, Li says. While antiretroviral drugs can halt viral replication and clear the virus from the blood, they can\u2019t reach these reservoirs, so people have to take medication every day for the rest of their lives. But Excision BioTherapeutics is hoping that Crispr will remove HIV for good. Crispr is being used in several other studies to treat a handful of conditions that arise from genetic mutations. In those cases, scientists are using Crispr to edit peoples\u2019 own cells. But for the HIV trial, Excision researchers are turning the gene-editing tool against the virus. The Crispr infusion contains gene-editing molecules that target two regions in the HIV genome important for viral replication. The virus can only reproduce if it\u2019s fully intact, so Crispr disrupts that process by cutting out chunks of the genome. In 2019, researchers at Temple University and the University of Nebraska found that using Crispr to delete those regions eliminated HIV from the genomes of rats and mice. A year later, the Temple group also showed that the approach safely removed viral DNA from macaques with SIV, the monkey version of HIV.", "other news sites93": "In a laboratory study, human epithelial cells were treated with the lubricant before being exposed to HIV or a herpes virus, with subsequent infection rates being as low as 20 per cent The mucus in cows\u2019 salivary glands may have anti-viral properties Getty Images A lubricant derived from the mucus of cow salivary glands has shown promise at preventing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a herpes virus from infecting healthy human cells. Mucus is a protective gel that lubricates the epithelial tissues that cover our organs and line our body cavities, as well as acting as a first line of defence against microorganisms. The main component of mucus, a protein called mucin, may have antiviral properties. Hongji Yan at the KTH Royal \u2026", "other news sites94": "We then set out to understand what signaling cascade governs cell-in-cell structures. Initially, we sought to test if the observed results were cell fusion. Thus, we incubated tumor cells whose cytosols were labeled with either Wasabi or tdTomato with tumor-reactive T cells. Confocal analysis indicated that each cell type in the cell-in-cell formation maintained its cytoplasm, and no mix between colors was detected (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). Furthermore, long-term follow-up of cell dissemination from this structure indicated that each cell maintains its initial single labelling color (Figure 6\u2014video 1 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). To corroborate this, we also incubated tumor cells whose membrane, nucleus, and F-actin were labeled with different fluorophores. Similarly, each cell in this formation was separated and maintained the integrity of its original cell components (Figure 6A). Given the similarity of this formation to entosis, we used ROCK inhibitor, which is the key regulator of this process. Indeed, blocking ROCK almost completely prevented T cell-mediated cell-in-cell formation (Figure 6B, C). We then tested whether the molecular machinery reported to mediate tumor spontaneous entosis applies to govern the current cell-in-cell structure. However, we observed no increase or changes in the cellular localization of phosphorylated \u03b2 catenin, E-cadherin, and phosphorylated integrin \u03b21 (26) (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1) suggesting other mediators promote this entosis. Furthermore, there was no reduction in cell-in-cell formation upon blocking of E- and N- cadherins, or inhibition of Wnt signaling (Figure 6D\u2013E). In sharp contrast, disruption of actin filaments, blocking of mRNA synthesis or protein production completely abrogated tumor cells\u2019 capacity to form a cell-in-cell formation, suggesting that the structure requires de novo synthesis of genes (Figure 6D\u2013E).

Over 400 genes were increased in cell-in-cell formation induced by T cell secreted granules compared to untreated B16F10 cells, 215 of which were also upregulated by the tumor cells sorted from treated animals (Figure 6F, ). KEGG analysis further indicated that multiple signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT3 axis and FGF-receptors downstream pathways, are enriched in cell-in-cell formation generated in vivo, with approximately 80 significantly elevated genes relating to these pathways (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1, ). Indeed, EGR1 and STAT3 expression was significantly elevated in cell-in-cell tumors (Figure 6G). Both mice and human tumors incubated with reactive T cells had elevated their p-STAT3 levels, in comparison to untreated tumor cells (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1), suggesting this mechanism is conserved across species. Since these results may also reflect adaptation to the tumor microenvironments, we next corroborate the necessity of these factors to cell-in-cell formation ex vivo. Overexpression of either STAT3 or EGR1 was sufficient to induce cell-in-cell formation without additional stimulation (Figure 6H). Furthermore, these cells were significantly more resistant to killing by CD8+ T cell, compared to sham transfected cells (Figure 6I). We also tested if inhibiting these genes would reduce cell-in-cell tumor formation. Inhibition of STAT3 and EGR1, but not MAPK3 and EGR2, significantly abrogated the capacity of tumor cells to form cell-in-cell structures upon incubation with IFN\u03b3-stimulated T cells and with T cell secreted granules (Figure 6J and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). In order to integrate cell-in-cell inhibition to an in vivo therapy, we first tested the effect of small molecule inhibitors on tumor cell formation. We found that inhibition of STAT3, or EGR pathway, completely prevented cell-in-cell formation upon incubation with reactive T cells or T cell-secreted granules (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). Since blocking EGR1 also reduced T cell viability, we then set out to establish a treatment protocol that combines STAT3 inhibition (which also inhibits T cell activity) and immunotherapy. To this end, mice bearing palpable tumors were injected with Stattic or with PBS for two consecutive days. On the second day, we sub-lethally irradiated the mice and injected them with 5 \u00d7 106 gp100-reactive T cells and IL-2. In another model, we treated mice for two days with Stattic, followed by treatments with anti-CD40, TNF\u03b1, and anti-TRP1. Recurrent tumors were treated with the same regimen. In both models, injection of Stattic alone had no effect on tumor growth. We found, however, that injection of Stattic prior to administration of immunotherapy partially restored the responsiveness of tumors that re-occur following immunotherapies (Figure 6K\u2013L). While tumor cell sensitization may be a result from multiple mechanisms, these results stress the benefit of combining immunotherapy with STAT3 inhibition.", "techcrunch95": "If you have diabetes, or ever suspected that you might, you will have done the poke-your-finger-and-drop-blood-on-a-stick thing until your finger goes numb. Finger-prick blood glucose monitoring is the de facto standard, but AI company Scanbo wants to put an end to all that, replacing the droplet with some off-the-shelf diagnostic tools and a big helping of data analysis. The company has developed a prototype device that combines a three-lead ECG measurement and a Photoplethysmogram (PPG). The 60-second measurement is fed to a set of algorithms that can give you some very promising measurements. For starters, the device is doing non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, but the company\u2019s founder claims that it can also do blood pressure measurements. I spoke to the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Ashissh Raichura, as part of TechCrunch\u2019s virtual CES coverage, where he told me a bit more about the technology. He also gave me a demonstration, first testing his own blood with a conventional, off-the-shelf fingerprick blood glucose monitor, and then with the company\u2019s own prototype. The measurements were 6.2 and 6.3 mmol/L, respectively, which puts the two devices within a couple of percent accuracy of each other. \u201cWe use the three electrodes for ECG data, and an additional measurement for PPG. We measure for 60 seconds, and then take the raw data and analyze that using the machine learning convolutional neural network, and the deep neural network. We combine all of that data, take the three machine learning algorithms, see what comes as a result, and then analyze the glucose,\u201d Raichura told me, as he was preparing to demo the device for me. \u201cWe want to commercialize our product, and will be looking looking for US FDA in Health Canada approval.\u201d I was surprised to learn that it is possible to do non-invasive blood glucose measuring \u2014 most of the so-called non-invasive methods do use an implant or a filament sensor wire to get readings, but the method that Scanbo uses has been studied and covered in medical journals. It doesn\u2019t look like the FDA has approved any products that take this approach yet, so the company is certainly facing a lengthy medical approval process in order to bring its products to market. The company also claims it is able to do blood pressure measurements, the kind that you might do at home or in the doctor\u2019s office with a blood pressure cuff. \u201cWhen we take your EKG data, we convert that into what is called a short wave transmission length,\u201d Raichura summarizes in how the company is able to pull off blood pressure metrics. \u201cBased on that, we calculate your non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure too. That is another piece of algorithm that we have patent pending.\u201d With all of this tech in its back pocket, the company has an interesting choice to make; is it going to start manufacturing its own hardware devices, or is there an opportunity to license the algorithms and technology to other manufacturers that already have devices with PPG and ECG capabilities on the market. \u201cWe have two patents pending, purely on the hardware, how we designed it, how we amalgamated electrodes and all the sensors in a way where we can take all the parameters in one time,\u201d explains Raichura, hinting at how the company is trying to measure all the things at once. \u201cIf you look at the traditionally available all the devices, you measure one thing at a time, not everything at once. You do blood pressure one time, your EKG at another time. One after another, all in sequential processes. In our case, we are asking you to put four fingers on the device, so we can capture all the data, and use algorithms to report different aspects of your health.\u201d Scanbo sees its technology as an at-home alternative to some of the currently existing clinical techniques and technology. \u201cAs a company, we are a combination of AI and med-tech,\u201d Raichura says, and mentions that the market is starting to take notice. \u201cWith this product, we are just getting started now. Medtronic, Samsung, LG, and others are already talking to us and see can we collaborate with them, and we are exploring a couple of strategic partnerships that could help us in taking us to different markets globally. We see the needs from 400 million people in the world with type two diabetes, and most of the populations can\u2019t afford glucometers \u2014 never mind continuous glucose meters. We are very, very cost-effective, and we can bring the cost down to as low as $20 a month. There is no biowaste, you don\u2019t need any disposables, you don\u2019t need strips or anything, just purely the machine learning algorithm and a device with a chargeable battery.\u201d The company is about to take its prototype and clinical results as leverage to go raise a seed round and kick off the process toward regulatory approval and, eventually, make a product available to the public.", "other news sites96": "In the spring of 1933 , three scientists at the U.K.\u2019s Medical Research Council received a treasure trove of vials containing human mucus from sick hospital patients. It was gross, yes, but not unwarranted: The culprit behind what had caused the 1918 influenza pandemic was still at large. Months later, the trio of scientists published a paper that found that a virus, not a novel strain of bacteria like some within the scientific community originally thought, was to blame. Over the following decades, other scientists unfurled the gnarly branches of the large influenza family tree, gathering enough information to formulate a vaccine, which (hopefully) most of us get before every flu season. But here\u2019s the catch: Influenza is a master shapeshifter. Every year, strains of the virus that infect humans \u2014 influenza type A and B \u2014 evolve in ways that evade vaccines and, subsequently, our immune systems. This results in uneven vaccine effectiveness from year to year and also undermines efforts to pack a flu shot with a broad, long-lasting immune punch. But we may have an ace in the hole thanks to mRNA, the same technology used for our Covid-19 vaccines. In a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and other institutions have cooked up an mRNA-based influenza vaccine that targets four viral proteins that tend to remain the same across different strains of influenza. \u201c[It\u2019s] a nice study with significant clinical implications that uses the same strategy as for Covid vaccination to create a better flu vaccine with broader capabilities by targeting multiple conserved flu [viral proteins] antigens instead of the way we do it now, which is to grow candidate strains in eggs and then inactivate them,\u201d Anne Davidson, a researcher at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York, who was not involved in the study, told Inverse in an email. Artistic rendering of a molecule of hemagglutinin. Shutterstock Here\u2019s the background \u2014 Flu vaccines are updated every year based on influenza patterns most recently seen in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia; its flu season runs from April to October. Scientists pay close attention to one sugar-covered protein called hemagglutinin that dots the surface of the influenza virus, Norbert Pardi, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who co-led the study, tells Inverse. \u201cHemagglutinin has two major parts: the head domain, which is variable and immunodominant, [and a stalk domain],\u201d explains Pardi. \u201cThe current seasonal vaccines that use three or four inactivated [influenza] viruses primarily target the immunodominant head domain\u2026 but the problem is that the virus can change that pretty easily and escape from protective immunity.\u201d A better option would be to target viral proteins that don\u2019t switch up and stay pretty much the same regardless of which strain of influenza you\u2019re infected with, says Pardi and Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who also co-led the study. Those proteins include neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein 2, all of which help the virus make copies of itself. Krammer says while there have been efforts over the years to include conserved influenza proteins, such studies have run up against failure and a whole host of hurdles. For example, to measure a potential shot\u2019s effectiveness, scientists look to see whether it triggers an immune response, indicated via the presence of antibodies. \u201cThe vaccines that we\u2019re testing these proteins with, they don\u2019t induce those types of antibodies that are used as correlates,\u201d explains Krammer. \u201cSo there\u2019s not a lot of confidence during clinical development.\u201d Of the four different types of influenza, A and B primarily infect humans. Shutterstock How they did it \u2014 What has really made the dream of a potent flu shot come alive, says Pardi and Krammer, is messenger RNA (or mRNA) technology, the same used for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s Covid-19 vaccines. It involves taking a piece of genetic code that isn\u2019t capable of altering anyone\u2019s DNA and instructing it to make a particular type of protein that the immune system can then learn to recognize and target. For their influenza vaccine, the researchers created an mRNA cocktail encoding the four influenza proteins neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, matrix protein 2, and the stalk portion of hemagglutinin (which is conserved compared to its head domain). The vaccine was then injected into a group of twenty or so naive mice who had never experienced influenza before. They either got a quadrivalent jab (meaning all four mRNA segments for each protein was present) or monovalent (the conventional flu vaccine or vaccines containing an individual mRNA for any one of the proteins). Some animals received one shot, while others lucked out with one shot plus a booster four weeks later. The mice were then challenged with an assortment of different influenza strains, both that infect humans and other animals like dogs. What they found \u2014 There were two important phenomena the researchers noticed. First, while both the quadrivalent and monovalent jabs encouraged antibody production, only the quadrivalent shot protected the mice against the viral challenge, with exception of the monovalent vaccine containing nucleoprotein, which seemed to protect vaxxed mice from death. While antibodies tend to hog the vaccine limelight, immune cells called T cells, which roam the body and kill infected cells, are also crucial in the fight against viruses. Pardi, Krammer, and their colleagues found that the nucleoprotein-specific jab encouraged a class of cytotoxic T cells that studies have found play an important role in protection against severe influenza infection in humans and animal models. On average around five to 20 percent of Americans will get the flu every year. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a sharp drop in the number of flu cases reported. bluecinema/E+/Getty Images Krammer says this motley of immune responses to the four different influenza viral proteins suggests it's more powerful to have a colorful vaccine cocktail rather than a drab monotone. \u201cWhen we mix all of them together, we get the broadest immune response,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get the engagement of T cells against the nucleoprotein, you get antibodies, and we get a pretty strong neuraminidase response. That\u2019s kind of the beauty here that you\u2019re flexible in what types of [viral proteins] you use\u2026 and you have a lot of possibilities to try [out].\u201d The researchers also expect it wouldn\u2019t need to undergo annual updates as our current ones do. Instead, they might last for a few years. What\u2019s next \u2014 While mice studies are the launch point for future studies into other organisms like monkeys and eventually humans, Pardi and Krammer say it\u2019s not clear whether what we see in mice will necessarily translate to us. For one, humans don\u2019t have a naive immune system like the mice used in the study. Our pre-existing immunity against the flu may impact the quality of any potential vaccine\u2019s antibody response, according to some studies. \u201cClinical trials will be necessary to see how vaccines can overcome the issue with the shortfall from previous immunity,\u201d says Pardi. \u201cPretty much all adults have antibodies against the flu, and we need to see how our vaccine can overcome this issue.\u201d It may take several years of research and clinical trials before their mRNA influenza vaccine sees the light of day, say Pardi and Krammer. In the meanwhile, there\u2019s no point waiting: Go get your flu shot, dear reader.", "other news sites97": "Scientists may be able to turn a long-time germ foe into a cancer-fighting ally, new research this week suggests. In preliminary data from a Phase I trial, a genetically modified version of the herpes virus has shown promise in treating difficult-to-eradicate tumors, with one patient having experienced a complete remission for 15 months so far. Much more research will be needed to confirm the treatment\u2019s early success, however. The viral treatment is known as RP2 and is a genetically engineered strain of herpes simplex 1, the virus responsible for most cases of oral herpes in humans, as well as some cases of genital herpes. Developed by the company Replimune, RP2 is designed to work on two fronts. Injected directly into the tumor, the virus is supposed to selectively infect and kill certain cancer cells. But it also blocks the expression of a protein known as CTLA-4 produced by these cells, and it hijacks their machinery to produce another molecule called GM-CSF. The net result of these cellular changes is to weaken the cancer\u2019s ability to hide from and fend off the immune system. In a Phase I trial conducted by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in the UK, RP2 was given as the only treatment to nine patients with advanced cancers that failed to respond to other therapies; it was also given in combination with another immunotherapy drug to 30 patients. Three patients on RP2 alone appeared to respond to the treatment, meaning their cancers shrank or stopped growing, and seven patients on the combination therapy responded as well. One patient in particular, with a form of carcinoma along his salivary gland, has shown no signs of cancer for at least 15 months after treatment with RP2 alone. There were no life-threatening adverse events reported in the trial, with the most common symptoms post-treatment being fever, chills, and other flu-like illness. Advertisement The findings, presented this week at the 2022 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress (ESMO), are preliminary, since they\u2019ve yet to be vetted through the formal peer review process. They\u2019re also based on a very small sample size, meaning that any results should be taken with caution. But Phase I trials aren\u2019t intended to show that a treatment is effective, only that it\u2019s safe enough for humans to take. So the fact that some people with seemingly incurable cancers already appear to be responding to RP2, the team argues, is a very good sign that it can live up to its potential. \u201cOur study shows that a genetically engineered, cancer-killing virus can deliver a one-two punch against tumors\u2014directly destroying cancer cells from within while also calling in the immune system against them,\u201d said lead author Kevin Harrington, professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research, in a statement from the organization.

In 2015, the first viral therapy was approved in the U.S. for certain advanced cases of melanoma. This May, scientists in California launched a Phase I clinical trial of their anticancer virus, called Vaxinia. Other companies are developing their own candidates, either alone or in combination with other treatments. And Replimune is developing two other candidates based on their modified herpes virus.

A high-tech suit created by a Dutch grad student may be a powerful new way to help keep better tabs on those in recovery. Bart Klaassen, from the Netherlands\u2019 University of Twente, and the rest of his team pursued it as part of a project resulting from Europe\u2019s FP7 research initiative. Klaassen\u2019s doctoral thesis is based on the work, as well. The idea is that while patients are closely monitored while at the rehabilitation clinic or in regular checkups, real-world tasks such as getting out of bed, navigating the house and cooking can only be reported secondhand. \u201cThere has long been a great need for systems like this, but the technology simply was not ready,\u201d explained Klaassen in a news release from the school. But as other projects along these lines have proved, that\u2019s not the case any more: sensors can be made small enough, fabrics smart enough and the resulting data coherent enough that a high-tech suit like this is not only a possibility, but potentially a major advance. The suit, which is worn underneath the clothes for several months, contains 41 sensors that track strength, flexibility, gait and other relevant metrics. They\u2019re collected wirelessly and processed by (at present) university servers. \u201cWe have succeeded in modelling all of the relevant movements, and in cleaning up the data that is relevant for the therapist by filtering out the rest,\u201d said Klaassen. \u201cOur project has delivered new techniques and methods that can be used to monitor patients at home for extended periods of time, and to identify any differences with structured clinical measurements.\u201d Presumably the sensors and data could also be used for tracking progress in cases other than those suffering from strokes, but Klaassen\u2019s research is focused on the one domain for now. If it proves useful it could be adapted for use in other forms of physical therapy. The suit isn\u2019t in production or anything right now and there are plenty of questions, from whether it can be made cheaply to whether it can be washed at all \u2014 I\u2019ve emailed the university with some questions and will update the post if I hear back.", "other news sites99": "Hair straightening chemicals associated with higher uterine cancer risk NIH study finds Black women may be more affected due to higher use. >Women who used chemical hair straightening products were at higher risk for uterine cancer compared to women who did not report using these products, according to a new study from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers found no associations with uterine cancer for other hair products that the women reported using, including hair dyes, bleach, highlights, or perms. The study data includes 33,497 U.S. women ages 35-74 participating in the Sister Study, a study led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, that seeks to identify risk factors for breast cancer and other health conditions. The women were followed for almost 11 years and during that time 378 uterine cancer cases were diagnosed. The researchers found that women who reported frequent use of hair straightening products, defined as more than four times in the previous year, were more than twice as likely to go on to develop uterine cancer compared to those who did not use the products. \u201cWe estimated that 1.64% of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70; but for frequent users, that risk goes up to 4.05%,\u201d said Alexandra White, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group and lead author on the new study. \u201cThis doubling rate is concerning. However, it is important to put this information into context - uterine cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.\u201d Uterine cancer accounts for about 3% of all new cancer cases but is the most common cancer of the female reproductive system, with 65,950 estimated new cases in 2022. Studies show that incidence rates of uterine cancer have been rising in the United States, particularly among Black women. Approximately 60% of the participants who reported using straighteners in the previous year were self-identified Black women, according to the study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Although, the study did not find that the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer incidence was different by race, the adverse health effects may be greater for Black women due to higher prevalence of use. \u201cBecause Black women use hair straightening or relaxer products more frequently and tend to initiate use at earlier ages than other races and ethnicities, these findings may be even more relevant for them,\u201d said Che-Jung Chang, Ph.D., an author on the new study and a research fellow in the NIEHS Epidemiology Branch. The findings are consistent with prior studies showing straighteners can increase the risk of hormone-related cancers in women. The researchers did not collect information on brands or ingredients in the hair products the women used. However, in the paper they note that several chemicals that have been found in straighteners (such as parabens, bisphenol A, metals, and formaldehyde) could be contributing to the increased uterine cancer risk observed. Chemical exposure from hair product use, especially straighteners, could be more concerning than other personal care products due to increased absorption through the scalp which may be exacerbated by burns and lesions caused by straighteners. \u201cTo our knowledge this is the first epidemiologic study that examined the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer,\u201d said White. \u201cMore research is needed to confirm these findings in different populations, to determine if hair products contribute to health disparities in uterine cancer, and to identify the specific chemicals that may be increasing the risk of cancers in women.\u201d This team previously found that permanent hair dye and straighteners may increase breast and ovarian cancer risk.

For years, our understanding of cancer has focused on genetic mutations which permanently change the DNA code. But our research has shown that the way the DNA folds up can change which genes are read without altering the DNA code and this can be very important in determining how cancers behave.\" The research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, Human Technopole in Milan, and the Queen Mary University of London. Epigenetic changes are involved in cancer's evolution In the first paper, the researchers collected 1,373 samples from 30 bowel cancers and looked at epigenetic changes as cancers grew. Their observations showed that epigenetic changes are common in cancerous cells, are heritable, and were present in cancer cells that had \"survival advantages.\" The second paper intended to study why cancer cells within the same tumor can be different from one another. So, the researchers looked at the DNA sequence in diverse samples taken from different parts of the same tumor. The study revealed that less than two percent of \"changes in the DNA code in independent areas of a tumor were associated with changes in gene activity and variation in cancer cell characteristics throughout tumors is often governed by factors other than DNA mutations\". With these studies, scientists were able to track the influence of epigenetic control on the growth and evolution of bowel cancers. They also noted that epigenetic changes are heavily involved in cancer's evolution. \"I hope our work will change the way we think about cancer and its treatment \u2013 and should ultimately affect the way patients are treated. Genetic testing for cancer mutations only gives us part of the picture about a person\u2019s cancer \u2013 and is blind to \u2018epigenetic\u2019 changes to how genes are read. By testing for both genetic and epigenetic changes, we could, potentially, much more accurately predict which treatments will work best for a particular person\u2019s cancer,\" said Graham.", "techcrunch102": "A New York City startup called The Mednet today launched a platform that gives physicians a knowledge-sharing tool that\u2019s as easy to use as Quora, but provides them with expert answers about the latest research in their field. The site has focused, so far, strictly on cancer. Due to rules governing medical information and patients\u2019 privacy, questions posted to The Mednet cannot be case-based. They are situation-based only, meaning doctors don\u2019t share patient info, not even blurred photos. While the startup\u2019s site, theMednet.org, has been in development for about 2.5 years, the company officially launched today and is part of the latest batch of the Y Combinator accelerator. Co-founders Nadine Housri, a radiation oncologist, and her brother CEO Samir Housri told TechCrunch their company has raised some grant funding and equity funding to date, including from YC and The Hope Foundation. Results on the platform have been hope-inspiring so far to Nadine Housri, she said. Cancer experts regularly help each other there to figure out complex issues that will immediately impact their patients. For example, a new study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine came out, and an investigator in that study, Howard Sandler, answered questions about it on The Mednet, helping other doctors decide whether or not to use hormones, along with radiation, to treat a prostate cancer patient. His study had found that adding hormonal therapy to radiation treatment improved the average long-term survival of men with prostate cancer who have had their prostate gland removed. But of course, the science was complicated and the regimen wasn\u2019t recommended for any or every patient. Nadine Housri said when theMednet.org first launched, she wasn\u2019t sure if oncologists, professors, department chairs and other cancer researchers would be too busy to give away their expertise on some new online platform. But, she explained, \u201cExperts are willing to give away info to random people here because they constantly field phone calls, emails and answer questions at medical conferences anyway. One reason you go into academia or medicine is to have a great impact on people, on your community. On Mednet experts can put their answers out there, clear up misconceptions on research and clinical practices.\u201d Like many startups, The Mednet has spent its early years focused on building an expert user community, and becoming a vital resource to users, as well. The Housris said their network will always be accessible for free to doctors, and they want it to serve as a knowledge base for medicine broadly. The company plans to expand beyond oncology over the long run. It is exploring the potential to generate revenue by helping companies raise awareness of and enroll patients in their clinical trials. It could also aggregate some of its expert answers into automated decision support for clinics, the founder said. Depending on its monetization strategy, The Mednet could compete with online resources for physicians like Figure 1 or UpToDate over the long run. But when it comes to medicine, there probably can\u2019t be too many tools to help people get good, up-to-date information.", "other news sites103": "Scientists have harnessed the power of a woman\u2019s hyper-sensitive sense of smell to develop a test to determine whether people have Parkinson\u2019s disease. The test has been years in the making after academics realised that Joy Milne could smell the condition. The 72-year-old from Perth, Scotland, has a rare condition that gives her a heightened sense of smell. She noticed that her late husband, Les, developed a different odour when he was 33 \u2013 12 years before he was diagnosed with the disease, which leads to parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years. Milne, nicknamed \u201cthe woman who can smell Parkinson\u2019s\u201d, described a musky aroma, different from his normal scent. Her observation piqued the interest of scientists who decided to research what she could smell, and whether this could be harnessed to help identify people with the neurological condition. Years later, academics at the University of Manchester have made a breakthrough by developing a test that can identify people with Parkinson\u2019s disease using a simple cotton bud run along the back of the neck. Researchers can examine the sample to identify molecules linked to the disease to help diagnose if someone has it. Though still in the early phases of research, scientists are excited about the prospect of the NHS being able to deploy a simple test for the disease. There is no definitive test for Parkinson\u2019s and diagnosis is based on a patient\u2019s symptoms and medical history. If the skin swab is successful outside laboratory conditions it could be rolled out to achieve faster diagnosis. Milne said it was not acceptable that people with Parkinson\u2019s had such high degrees of neurological damage at the time of diagnosis, adding: \u201cI think it has to be detected far earlier \u2013 the same as cancer and diabetes, earlier diagnosis means far more efficient treatment and a better lifestyle for people. \u201cIt has been found that exercise and change of diet can make a phenomenal difference.\u201d She said her husband, a former doctor, was determined to find the right researcher to examine the link between odour and Parkinson\u2019s and they sought out Dr Tilo Kunath at the University of Edinburgh in 2012. Kunath paired up with Prof Perdita Barran to examine Milne\u2019s sense of smell. The scientists believed that the scent may be caused by a chemical change in skin oil, known as sebum, that is triggered by the disease. In their preliminary work they asked Milne to smell T-shirts worn by people who had Parkinson\u2019s and those who did not. She correctly identified the T-shirts worn by Parkinson\u2019s patients but also said that one from the group of people without Parkinson\u2019s smelled like the disease \u2013 eight months later that individual was diagnosed with the disease. Researchers hoped the finding could lead to a test being developed to detect Parkinson\u2019s, working under the assumption that if they were able to identify a unique chemical signature in the skin linked to the disease, they may eventually be able to diagnose it from simple skin swabs. In 2019, researchers at the University of Manchester, led by Barran, announced they had identified molecules linked to the disease found in skin swabs. The scientists have now developed a test using this information. The tests have been successfully conducted in research labs and scientists are assessing whether they can be used in hospital settings. If successful, the test could potentially be used in the NHS so GPs can refer patients for Parkinson\u2019s tests. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some molecules are present only in people who have Parkinson\u2019s. Researchers compared swabs from 79 people with Parkinson\u2019s with a healthy control group of 71 people. Barran said: \u201cAt the moment, there are no cures for Parkinson\u2019s but a confirmatory diagnostic would allow them to get the right treatment and get the drugs that will help to alleviate their symptoms. \u201cThere would also be non-pharmaceutical interventions, including movement and also nutritional classes, which can really help. And I think most critically, it will allow them to have a confirmed diagnosis to actually know what\u2019s wrong with them.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat we are now doing is seeing if (hospital laboratories) can do what we\u2019ve done in a research lab in a hospital lab. Once that\u2019s happened then we want to see if we can make this a confirmatory diagnostic that could be used along with the referral process from a GP to a consultant. \u201cAt the moment in Greater Manchester there are about 18,000 people waiting for a neurological consult and just to clear that list, without any new people joining it, will take up to two years. Of those 10-15% are suspect Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cOur test would be able to tell them whether they did or whether they didn\u2019t (have Parkinson\u2019s) and allow them to be referred to the right specialist. So at the moment, we\u2019re talking about being able to refer people in a timely manner to the right specialism and that will be transformative.\u201d Milne is working with scientists around the world to see if she can smell other diseases such as cancer and tuberculosis (TB). \u201cI have to go shopping very early or very late because of people\u2019s perfumes, I can\u2019t go into the chemical aisle in the supermarket,\u201d she said. \u201cSo yes, a curse sometimes but I have also been out to Tanzania and have done research on TB and research on cancer in the US \u2013 just preliminary work. So it is a curse and a benefit.\u201d She said she can sometimes smell people who have Parkinson\u2019s while in the supermarket or walking down the street but has been told by medical ethicists she cannot tell them. \u201cWhich GP would accept a man or a woman walking in saying \u2018the woman who smells Parkinson\u2019s has told me I have it\u2019?

In addition, the researchers found that deaths among hospitalized adults, 65 or older, who had been vaccinated were 38% lower compared to those who had not been vaccinated. \u201cA common complaint about influenza vaccine is that they are typically 40-60% effective against infection - or the \u2018what\u2019s the point?\u2019 complaint. So it is important to note that although everyone in this study was hospitalized, vaccinated individuals were less likely to be severely ill or die, suggesting that you are likely to have far less severe consequences if vaccinated,\u201d said Dr. Annette Regan, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health assistant professor of epidemiology and lead author of the peer-reviewed research, published in the October edition of The Lancet Infectious Diseases. \u201cThis is an important point, especially in light of the upcoming influenza season coupled with ongoing COVID-19 activity, both this season and into the future.\u201d Globally, influenza contributes to 9.5 million hospitalizations, 81.5 million hospital days, and 145,000 deaths each year. Vaccination offers the best method of preventing influenza illness, reducing illness in the general population by 40\u201360%, experts say. Specifically, The Lancet analysis found that three groups routinely targeted for influenza vaccination experiences less severe illness. Children who had received only part of their first series of influenza vaccines had 36% lower chances of being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and children who had fully completed their first series of influenza vaccines had 48% lower chances of admission to ICU compared to unvaccinated children, the researchers found. The study \u2013 \u201cSeverity of influenza illness associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among hospitalized patients in four South American countries\u201d \u2013 is the product of an international team of researchers from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay, and drew on data from all four South American countries over a period of seven years. Data were obtained through the Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean, influenza (REVELAC-i) which is coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). \u201cAlthough several studies have reported drops in influenza illness following influenza vaccination, the results have focused predominantly on adults in the United States, and this study aimed to evaluate the severity of influenza illness by vaccination status in a broad range of age groups, and across multiple South American countries,\u201d said Dr. Marta Von Horoch, a co-author who serves as coordinator of the National Immunization Program in Paraguay. \u201cWe were very pleased to work with our partners in the U.S. and across the continent, and these findings demonstrate, quite clearly, the importance of influenza vaccination for children and adults, no matter where they live.\u201d The study \u2013 the first-ever on this scale in South America - examined influenza-related hospitalization rates and outcomes across all four countries from 2013-19. Specifically, the analysts reviewed the outcomes for some 2,747 patients hospitalized with confirmed influenza virus infection, in three age groups \u2013 children aged 6\u201324 months, adults aged 18\u201364 years, and adults aged 65 years or older. Given the reality that vaccination rates have fallen, in the U.S. and globally during the COVID-19 pandemic, including among children, the findings should help make clear the benefits of timely, pro-active immunization campaigns to the public, the researchers said. \u201cWith influenza season approaching this winter and influenza vaccines now available, these results highlight the importance of getting vaccinated for flu for anyone six months of age or older \u2013 as CDC recommends,\u201d Regan said. \u201cIt is critical that healthcare providers and the public understand the risks of missing out on vaccinations \u2013 it is so much better to prevent a serious illness than to suffer through it, for the patient and everyone in their community.\u201d ===================================================", "other news sites105": "For immediate release: Tuesday, November 1, 2022 Boston, MA \u2013 The higher the exposure to political conservatism, the higher the COVID-19 mortality rates and stress on hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, according to a new study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cBefore our study, research on how political ideology affects COVID-19 looked solely at voters\u2019 political lean; we expanded on that research to investigate associations of COVID-19 outcomes with the voting records of federal elected representatives and the concentration of political party power at the state level. The point is not partisan analysis, but rather to understand how politics, and political polarization, are affecting population health,\u201d said Nancy Krieger, professor of social epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and corresponding author of the study. The study was published online in the Lancet Regional Health \u2013 Americas on November 1, 2022. Little prior research had looked at COVID-19 health outcomes in relation to U.S. congressional districts. The researchers analyzed data on COVID-19 mortality rates and stress on ICU capacity from April 2021 to March 2022, a period when adult vaccines were available, across all 435 U.S. Congressional districts. They examined three exposure variables that had not been used previously in COVID-19 research: the political ideology of U.S. elected members of Congress, as measured by their overall voting records; their votes on four key COVID-19 relief bills; and \u201cstate trifectas,\u201d the concentration of political power at the State level, defined as the governor, House, and Senate, all under the control of one party. The study found that the higher the exposure to conservatism on each political metric, the higher the COVID-19 age-standardized mortality rates, even after adjusting for the district\u2019s social characteristics, voters\u2019 political lean, and vaccination rates. The same relationship held true for stress on hospital ICU capacity. For COVID-19 mortality rates, for example, models controlling for political and social metrics and vaccination rates showed that Republican trifectas were, respectively, 11% higher and conservative voter political lean 26% higher. \u201cOur study offers new approaches to analyzing political determinants of COVID-19 metrics\u2014such as mortality, illness, or vaccination rates\u2014as one component of analyzing political accountability for populations\u2019 COVID-19 burdens.

A team of scientists from Yale University recently discovered in a group of volunteers that some strains of the bacterium Morganella morganii produce molecules called indolimines that are toxic for human DNA. In the laboratory, the researchers proved that these substances cause tumors in mice. The finding was published in the journal Science on October 28. A human being has more bacterial cells (38 trillion) than human cells (30 trillion). However, defecation can reverse the proportion in favor of human cells. Through this act, in which a third of the microbes in the colon is expelled, the person ceases to be numerically bacterial and becomes fully human. Most of these microorganisms are harmless, or even beneficial, but some can cause illness, explains Noah Palm, lead author of the study, and it is possible that the indolimines have an effect on colorectal cancer. However, much more work will be needed to prove that they are indeed the cause. More information Scientists transplant human neurons into rats and modify their behavior The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 1 in 23 in men and 1 in 25 in women, according to data from European tumor registries. The usual risk factors are age, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and a diet low in fruit and high in processed meats. Having an inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease, increases the risk as well. Palm\u2019s team developed a new technique that allows for the simultaneous study of a hundred types of microbes and their products. The researchers detected the (previously unknown) indolimines in strains of Morganella morganii in people with inflammatory diseases. However, even though there is a larger amount of this bacterium in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer, it is also present in seemingly healthy people. Even the epithelial cells of the intestines of healthy individuals show some mutations that can be caused by toxins from these communities of microorganisms, such as indolimines, explains Palm. Morganella morganii, which measures one thousandth of a millimeter, is commonly found in water, soil and the intestines of mammals. It is usually a benign microbe, but it is also associated with urinary tract infections. Spanish biotechnologist Cayetano Pleguezuelos and his colleagues at the Hubrecht Institute in the Netherlands were the first to show the direct connection between the bacteria that live in the human digestive system and the genetic alterations that cause the development of cancer. The researchers saw that a specific strain of Escherichia coli produces a toxic molecule called colibactin which damages the DNA of human cells. This was confirmed in miniature versions of intestinal tissue generated in the laboratory. Their discovery was published in the journal Nature on February 27, 2020, while the human race had its attention on another microorganism: a coronavirus that was spreading around the world from China. Pleguezuelos applauds the new work, but suggests prudence. \u201cOur intestinal microbiota is very complex, with many different species of bacteria, and among them there are mutualistic relationships, symbiosis, negative competition\u2026 and there are many other parameters. Bacteria can produce these toxic compounds in humans but, for some reason, they may not be able to reach the epithelial cells of the intestine and damage the DNA. These factors are not seen in experiments with mice,\u201d he warns. The Spanish researcher believes that the new Yale University technique \u201copens the door to evaluating a large number of bacteria and their ability to damage DNA.\u201d A person that weighs 70 kilos has about 46 kilos of human cells, according to a study carried out by a team from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. The heaviest ones are muscle and fat cells. The 38 trillion bacteria only weigh about 200 grams, but they make up an extremely complex universe. \u201cTheir ability to carry out different enzymatic reactions is immense. And we don\u2019t know most things,\u201d says Pleguezuelos. The Spanish biotechnologist explains that every agent that damages human DNA causes a specific pattern of mutations called a mutational signature. Pleguezuelos and his colleagues identified the mutational signature of the harmful strains of the Escherichia coli and found this characteristic trace in more than 5% of the colorectal cancer patients that were analyzed, compared to 0.1% detected in other types of tumors. Of course, that figure must be taken with a grain of salt \u2013 pending further studies in other populations \u2013 but it gives an idea of the magnitude of the problem: 5% of the two million annual cases means 100,000 colorectal cancer patients with the mutational signature of these harmful strains of Escherichia coli. Doctor Palm points out that most cases of colorectal cancer occur in people who have no family history. Therefore, environmental factors, including the microbiome, play a key role in most colorectal cancer cases. However, he explains, it is still impossible to calculate the relative importance of the microbiome against other environmental factors. Although currently there are no specific treatments to prevent DNA damage induced by the microbiome, treatments could be developed to neutralize, or even eliminate, these toxin-producing microbes.", "other news sites107": "Software developed using machine learning can be used to predict someone\u2019s risk of heart disease in less than a minute by analyzing the veins and arteries in their eye. The new research, published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, paves the way for the development of quick and cheap cardiovascular screenings, if the findings are validated in future clinical trials. These screenings would let individuals know their risk of stroke and heart attack without the need for blood tests or even blood pressure measurements. \u201cThis AI tool could let someone know in 60 seconds or less their level of risk,\u201d the lead author of the study, Alicja Rudnicka, told The Guardian. The study found that the predictions were as accurate as those produced by current tests. \u201cThe eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body.\u201d The software works by analyzing the web of blood vessels contained within the retina of the eye. It measures the total area covered by these arteries and veins, as well as their width and \u201ctortuosity\u201d (how bendy they are). All these factors are affected by an individual\u2019s heart health, allowing the software to make predictions about a subject\u2019s risk from heart disease just by looking at a non-invasive snapshot of their eye. \u201cThe study adds to a growing body of knowledge that the eye can be used as a window to the rest of the body,\u201d Pearse Keane, a researcher in ophthalmology and AI analysis not connected to the study, told The Verge. \u201cDoctors have known for more than a hundred years that you could look in the eye and see signs of diabetes and high blood pressure. But the problem was manual assessment: the manual delineation of the vessels by human experts.\u201d The use of machine learning, says Keane, can overcome this challenge. Using AI to diagnose disease from eye scans has proven to be one of the fastest-developing fields of machine learning medicine. The first ever AI diagnostic device approved by the FDA was used to screen for eye disease, and research suggests AI can detect a range of ailments in this way, from diabetic retinopathy to Alzheimer\u2019s (Keane\u2019s own area of research). Tools applying these findings are in various stages of development, but questions do remain about the reliability and universality of their diagnoses. The researcher named their software QUARTZ. Image: Rudnicka et al This recent study, carried out by a team from St George\u2019s, University of London, was only tested on the eye scans of white patients, for example. The team sourced their test data from the UK Biobank, a database that happens to be 94.6 percent white (reflecting the UK\u2019s own demographics in age range of patients included in the BioBank). Such biases would have to be balanced in the future to ensure any diagnostic tool is equally accurate for different ethnicities. The researchers compared the results from their software, named QUARTZ (an inventive acronym derived from the phrase \u201cQUantitative Analysis of Retinal vessels Topology and siZe\u201d) with 10-year risk predictions produced by the standard Framingham Risk Score test (FRS). They found the two methods had \u201ccomparable performance.\u201d", "other news sites108": "A study at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that the coronavirus variant BA.2.75.2, an Omicron sublineage, largely evades neutralizing antibodies in the blood and is resistant to several monoclonal antibody antiviral treatments. The findings, published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, suggest a risk of increased SARS-CoV-2 infections this winter, unless the new updated bivalent vaccines help to boost immunity in the population. \u201cWhile antibody immunity is not completely gone, BA.2.75.2 exhibited far more dramatic resistance than variants we\u2019ve previously studied, largely driven by two mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein,\u201d says the study\u2019s corresponding author Ben Murrell, assistant professor at the Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet. The study shows that antibodies in random serum samples from 75 blood donors in Stockholm were approximately only one-sixth as effective at neutralizing BA.2.75.2 compared with the now-dominant variant BA.5. The serum samples were collected at three time points: In November last year before the emergence of Omicron, in April after a large wave of infections in the country, and at the end of August to early September after the BA.5 variant became dominant. Only one of the clinically available monoclonal antibody treatments that were tested, bebtelovimab, was able to potently neutralize the new variant, according to the study. Monoclonal antibodies are used as antiviral treatments for people at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. BA.2.75.2 is a mutated version of another Omicron variant, BA.2.75. Since it was first discovered earlier this fall, it has spread to several countries but so far represents only a minority of registered cases. \u201cWe now know that this is just one of a constellation of emerging variants with similar mutations that will likely come to dominate in the near future,\u201d Ben Murrell says, adding \u201cwe should expect infections to increase this winter.\u201d Some questions remain. It is unclear whether these new variants will drive an increase in hospitalization rates. Also, while current vaccines have, in general, had a protective effect against severe disease for Omicron infections, there is not yet data showing the degree to which the updated COVID vaccines provide protection from these new variants. \u201cWe expect them to be beneficial, but we don\u2019t yet know by how much,\u201d Ben Murrell says. The study was conducted in collaboration with researchers at ETH Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland and Imperial College London in the U.K. Funding was provided by SciLifeLab, the Erling-Persson Foundation, the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

How will the vaccine work? Cancerous cells can have mutations \u2014 changes in their DNA sequence that make conventional treatment ineffective. By using a personalized cancer vaccine, the patient's immune system can be prepared to generate a mutation-specific anti-tumor response. Moderna's mRNA-4517/V940 is designed to generate Tcell responses based on the mutational signature of the tumor in the patient. T cells are a type of white blood cell that are tasked with defending the body in the event of an infection. Merck's KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that targets the PD-1 protein that cells can use to evade detection by T cells. Since both healthy as well as cancerous cells use this mechanism to evade T cell attack, using KEYTRUDA even puts healthy cells in the firing line. In combination with Moderna's vaccine, the treatment can aim to specifically target tumor cells. KEYNOTE-942 trial Merck's KEYTRUDA is currently being used in over 1,600 trials across a wide range of cancers. Through these trials, Merck is trying to understand the various factors that might affect the effectiveness of the treatment in patients. KEYNOTE 942 is one such trial studying the effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in high-risk melanoma patients. Currently, in Phase 2, the trial has enrolled 157 patients who have been randomized into two groups following the surgical removal of their tumors.", "other news sites110": "In its latest effort to limit health misinformation, YouTube is trying to make it easier for users to identify and differentiate reliable, factual videos made by certified healthcare professionals from those made by wellness gurus and their ilk.

This year\u2019s report, published in Cancer, also places focus on pancreatic cancer. Knowledge in the fight against cancer Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is expected that the number of new cancer cases globally will grow to 27.5 million, with 16.3 million cancer deaths, by 2040. Breast, lung, colon and prostate cancers are the four most common cancers worldwide, accounting for approximately 40% of all new cases collectively. In the US, annual reports on the statistical trends in cancer cases have been published since 1998 as part of a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). These reports examine a plethora of data, analyzing trends in cancer incidence, mortality and survival by cancer type, sex, age and racial/ethnic groups. The current report combined information about race and ethnicity to create five mutually exclusive groups: non\u2010Hispanic White (White), non\u2010Hispanic Black (Black), non\u2010Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), non\u2010Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and Hispanic (of any race). Additionally, data for the various groups analyzed in the current report were collected at time points ranging from 2001\u20132019 \u2013 therefore, it is important to note that all data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancer incidence rates Overall incidence rates per 100,000 individuals were 497 for males and 431 for females from 2014\u20132018. API and Black males had the lowest and highest incidence rates among men, respectively, and API and AI/AN females also had the lowest and highest rates respectively for women. However, incidence varied across 18 of the most common cancer types included in this report: For males \u2013 incidence rates for three of these cancers increased (including pancreas and kidney), seven were stable (including prostate) and eight decreased (including lung and larynx). For females \u2013 incidence rates of seven cancers increased (including melanoma, liver and breast), four cancers were stable (including uterine) and seven decreased (including thyroid and ovary). Additionally, for breast cancer \u2013 the most common cancer among adolescents and young adults (15\u201339 years of age) \u2013 the incidence rate increased by 1.0% per year on average between 2010 and 2018. Mortality rates Combining data from males and females showed that the decline in overall death rates from cancer steepened from 2001 to 2019, decreasing by 2.1% per year. Similar trends in overall death rates were also observed in each of the racial/ethnic groups analyzed in the report. Data from adolescents and young adults showed a decrease in death rates by 3% per year between 2001 and 2005, however, this rate of decline slowed to around 0.9% per year thereafter. Racial and ethnic disparities The report also highlighted racial and ethnic disparities, in both the incidence rates (2014\u20132018) and death rates (2015\u20132019) across many cancer types, as summarized in the table below. Type of cancer Incidence and death rates Bladder cancer In White, Black, ApI and Hispanic males, incidence of bladder cancer decreased. Incidence increased among AI/ AN males. Uterine cancer Incidence rates remained stable in White females but increased in every other racial/ethnic group. Lung, breast and colon cancer Incidence rates decreased for females in all racial/ethnic groups. For AI/ AN females, death rates for breast cancer increased but remained stable for colon cancer. Breast cancer death rates remained stable among API females. Prostate cancer Death rates decreased for API, AI/AN and Hispanic males. Rates remained stable for Black and White males. Lisa C. Richardson MD, director of the CDC\u2019s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, elaborated on these findings in a press release: \u201cFactors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status should not play a role in people\u2019s ability to be healthy or determine how long they live. [The] CDC works with its public health partners \u2013 within and outside the government \u2013 to address these disparities and advance health equity through a range of key initiatives, including programs, research and policy initiatives. We know that we can meet this challenge together and create an America where people are free of cancer.\u201d A special focus on pancreatic cancer The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach which produces enzymes that help digest food, as well as hormones like insulin and glucagon that regulate our blood sugar levels. Cancer of the pancreas is commonly diagnosed once it is already in its advanced stages \u2013 early pancreatic cancers often have vague symptoms or even none at all. For these reasons, the combined five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is just 5\u201310%. In the current report, the researchers explain that diagnoses of pancreatic cancer account for around 3% of new cancer cases \u2013 however, it also accounts for 8% of cancer deaths. Nevertheless, the report also highlights significant steps forward for the survival rates of certain types of pancreatic cancer. Between 2001 and 2017, one-year relative survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors increased from 65.9% to 84.2%, and there was also an increase from 24% to 36.7% for patients with adenocarcinomas. \u201cPancreatic cancer incidence and survival reflect both the underlying risk of disease as well as the difficulty of diagnosing pancreatic cancer at a treatable stage,\u201d said Betsy A. Kohler, M.P.H, NAACCR executive director. \u201cAs advancements in screening technology and effective treatments for early-stage disease become available, we are hopeful for greater improvements in pancreatic cancer survival, which historically has been a particularly lethal cancer type.\u201d", "techcrunch112": "If you\u2019ve ever had the misfortune of needing continuous EKG monitoring, you\u2019ve probably used a Holter monitor. It\u2019s like carrying a 1980s walkman made of metal with a bunch of wires going from it to your chest. If that sounds uncomfortable, and as if you won\u2019t sleep or enjoy showers much for the two weeks you need to carry it around, you\u2019ve neatly stumbled across the use case for the Mawi Heart Patch. The company just released its product, a two-lead cardiac monitor that can be read in real time. There are consumer-grade products that can do EKG readings, including the Withings ScanWatch (and its fancier-looking sibling, the ScanWatch Horizon), and there are other patches on the market, such as the Zio patch, but Mawi claims to have done something unique, and suggests that its Heart Patch is the first ever single-use, two-lead cardiac monitor to reach the market. The company describes it as \u201ca stick-and-go, wireless solution\u201d and further suggests that the disposable nature of the device is a benefit; it means that cardiologists can run tests on as many patients as they need to without having to wait for reusable Holter monitors to come back from other patients and get sanitized and maintained between uses. \u201cHolter monitors aren\u2019t great,\u201d Andrew Klymenko, the CEO of Mawi, says drily in an interview we did last week, and explains that the existing solutions are prone to dislodging, peeling and causing allergic reactions, thus restricting monitoring time. As a result, Mawi claims that more than 50% of arrhythmias go undetected. Equally bad: patients have to wait up to a month to receive the results. Mawi Heart Patch, the company claims, can be applied in under a minute, and you can live like normal as you wear it. \u201cPatients can shower, sleep, work out,\u201d says Klymenko, and highlights that it\u2019s possible to wear the patch and live all aspects of life as normal. \u201cSex is a big and important part of life, and patients can have sex as normal when wearing the Mawi patch.\u201d \u201cCardiovascular diseases pose the greatest risk to our long-term health and are the leading cause of death globally. With a lack of or ineffective monitoring often proving critical, many of these deaths can be avoided with the right preventative measures,\u201d Klymenko said. \u201cToo often, sufferers do not realize the severity of their symptoms before it\u2019s too late. Many patients that use the Mawi Heart Patch look healthy, exercise daily and show no signs of disease, yet have a potentially lethal heart condition. We\u2019re on a mission to prevent the heart\u2019s \u2018silent killers,\u2019 and we\u2019re already working with like-minded clinics that are seeing amazing results.\u201d The patch connects to a smartphone device in the doctor\u2019s office. That device pipes the data through to the cloud, where an AI analyzes the results and highlights anything unusual for the cardiologists to take a closer look at. The process is very quick indeed, meaning that patients can have feedback and next steps for their treatment. \u201cIn less than 24 hours [the doctors] have a very detailed, precise and actionable report,\u201d says Klymenko, suggesting that doctors can focus on treatment, rather than having to spend a lot of time analyzing data. \u201cIt takes just two seconds to manage.\u201d The company currently has around 30 staff, primarily concentrated in Europe. Klymenko himself is from Ukraine, and his team is spread across the world, including teams in Thailand and in the U.S. To date, the company has been bootstrapped. Mawi won\u2019t share exactly how many devices it has in the field, but Klymenko admits they are shipping \u201cthousands of devices\u201d every month, to customers across the U.S., the EU, and the Middle East. The devices need to be prescribed by a doctor, and pricing is heavily dependent on whatever medical insurance and what medical care system you are operating on, but Klymenko says that the devices typically cost \u201cunder $250 per study.\u201d", "other news sites113": "CNN \u2014 The first time molecular biologist Doris Taylor saw heart stem cells beat in unison in a petri dish, she was spellbound. \u201cIt actually changed my life,\u201d said Taylor, who directed regenerative medicine research at Texas Heart Institute in Houston until 2020. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018Oh my gosh, that\u2019s life.\u2019 I wanted to figure out the how and why, and re-create that to save lives.\u201d That goal has become reality. On Wednesday at the Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN, Taylor showed the audience the scaffolding of a pig\u2019s heart infused with human stem cells \u2013 creating a viable, beating human heart the body will not reject. Why? Because it\u2019s made from that person\u2019s own tissues. \u201cNow we can truly imagine building a personalized human heart, taking heart transplants from an emergency procedure where you\u2019re so sick, to a planned procedure,\u201d Taylor told the audience. \u201cThat reduces your risk by eliminating the need for (antirejection) drugs, by using your own cells to build that heart it reduces the cost \u2026 and you aren\u2019t in the hospital as often so it improves your quality of life,\u201d she said. Debuting on stage with her was BAB, a robot Taylor painstakingly taught to inject stem cells into the chambers of ghost hearts inside a sterile environment. As the audience at Life Itself watched BAB functioning in a sterile environment, Taylor showed videos of the pearly white mass called a \u201cghost heart\u201d begin to pinken. Video Ad Feedback Can we grow a personalized human heart? 24:16 - Source: CNN \u201cIt\u2019s the first shot at truly curing the number one killer of men, women and children worldwide \u2013 heart disease. And then I want to make it available to everyone,\u201d said Taylor to audience applause. \u201cShe never gave up,\u201d said Michael Golway, lead inventor of BAB and president and CEO of Advanced Solutions, which designs and creates platforms for building human tissues. \u201cAt any point, Dr. Taylor could have easily said \u2018I\u2019m done, this just isn\u2019t going to work. But she persisted for years, fighting setbacks to find the right type of cells in the right quantities and right conditions to enable those cells to be happy and grow.\u201d Giving birth to a heart Taylor\u2019s fascination with growing hearts began in 1998, when she was part of a team at Duke University that injected cells into a rabbit\u2019s failed heart, creating new heart muscle. As trials began in humans, however, the process was hit or miss. \u201cWe were putting cells into damaged or scarred regions of the heart and hoping that would overcome the existing damage,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI started thinking: What if we could get rid of that bad environment and rebuild the house?\u201d Taylor\u2019s first success came in 2008 when she and a team at the University of Minnesota washed the cells out of a rat\u2019s heart and began to work with the translucent skeleton left behind. Soon, she graduated to using pig\u2019s hearts, due to their anatomical similarity to human hearts. \u201cWe took a pig\u2019s heart, and we washed out all the cells with a gentle baby shampoo,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was left was an extracellular matrix, a transparent framework we called the \u2018ghost heart.\u2019 \u201cThen we infused blood vessel cells and let them grow on the matrix for a couple of weeks,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat built a way to feed the cells we were going to add because we\u2019d reestablished the blood vessels to the heart.\u201d The next step was to begin injecting the immature stem cells into the different regions of the scaffold, \u201cand then we had to teach the cells how to grow up.\u201d \u201cWe must electrically stimulate them, like a pacemaker, but very gently at first, until they get stronger and stronger. First, cells in one spot will twitch, then cells in another spot twitch, but they aren\u2019t together,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOver time they start connecting to each other in the matrix and by about a month, they start beating together as a heart. And let me tell you, it\u2019s a \u2018wow\u2019 moment!\u201d This \"ghost heart,\" created by using the scaffolding of a pig's heart and injected it with human stem cells, may soon be ready for human clinical trials. Advanced Solutions Life Sciences But that\u2019s not the end of the \u201cmothering\u201d Taylor and her team had to do. Now she must nurture the emerging heart by giving it a blood pressure and teaching it to pump. \u201cWe fill the heart chambers with artificial blood and let the heart cells squeeze against it. But we must help them with electrical pumps, or they will die,\u201d she explained. The cells are also fed oxygen from artificial lungs. In the early days all of these steps had to be monitored and coordinated by hand 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Taylor said. \u201cThe heart has to eat every day, and until we built the pieces that made it possible to electronically monitor the hearts someone had to do it person \u2013 and it didn\u2019t matter if it was Christmas or New Year\u2019s Day or your birthday,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken extraordinary groups of people who have worked with me over the years to make this happen.\u201d But once Taylor and her team saw the results of their parenting, any sacrifices they made became insignificant, \u201cbecause then the beauty happens, the magic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve injected the same type of cells everywhere in the heart, so they all started off alike,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut now when we look in the left ventricle, we find left ventricle heart cells. If we look in the atrium, they look like atrial heart cells, and if we look in the right ventricle, they are right ventricle heart cells,\u201d she said. \u201cSo over time they\u2019ve developed based on where they find themselves and grown up to work together and become a heart. Nature is amazing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Billions and billions of stem cells As her creation came to life, Taylor began to dream about a day when her prototypical hearts could be mass produced for the thousands of people on transplant lists, many of whom die while waiting. But how do you scale a heart? \u201cI realized that for every gram of heart tissue we built, we needed a billion heart cells,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat meant for an adult-sized human heart we would need up to 400 billion individual cells. Now, most labs work with a million or so cells, and heart cells don\u2019t divide, which left us with the dilemma: Where will these cells come from?\u201d The answer arrived when Japanese biomedical researcher Dr. Shinya Yamanaka discovered human adult skin cells could be reprogrammed to behave like embryonic or \u201cpluripotent\u201d stem cells, capable of developing into any cell in the body. The 2007 discovery won the scientist a Nobel Prize, and his \u201cinduced pluripotent stem cells (iPS),\u201d soon became known as \u201cYamanaka factors.\u201d \u201cNow for the first time we could take blood, bone marrow or skin from a person and grow cells from that individual that could turn into heart cells,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut the scale was still huge: We needed tens of billions of cells. It took us another 10 years to develop the techniques to do that.\u201d The solution? A bee-like honeycomb of fiber, with thousands of microscopic holes where the cells could attach and be nourished. \u201cThe fiber soaks up the nutrients just like a coffee filter, the cells have access to food all around them and that lets them grow in much larger numbers. We can go from about 50 million cells to a billion cells in a week,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut we need 40 billion or 50 billion or 100 billion, so part of our science over the last few years has been scaling up the number of cells we can grow.\u201d Another issue: Each heart needed a pristine environment free of contaminants for each step of the process. Every time an intervention had to be done, she and her team ran the risk of opening the heart up to infection \u2013 and death. \u201cDo you know how long it takes to inject 350 billion cells by hand?\u201d Taylor asked the Life Itself audience. \u201cWhat if you touch something? You just contaminated the whole heart.\u201d Once her lab suffered an electrical malfunction and all of the hearts died. Taylor and her team were nearly inconsolable. \u201cWhen something happens to one of these hearts, it\u2019s devastating to all of us,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd this is going to sound weird coming from a scientist, but I had to learn to bolster my own heart emotionally, mentally, spiritually and physically to get through this process.\u201d Dr. Doris Taylor (left) is teaching BAB the robot how to properly inject stem cells into a ghost heart. Advanced Solutions Life Sciences Enter BAB, short for BioAssemblyBot, and an \u201cuber-sterile\u201d cradle created by Advance Solutions that could hold the heart and transport it between each step of the process while preserving a germ-free environment. Taylor has now taught BAB the specific process of injecting the cells she has painstakingly developed over the last decade. \u201cWhen Dr. Taylor is injecting cells, it has taken her years to figure out where to inject, how much pressure to put on the syringe, and the best speed and pace to add the cells,\u201d said BAB\u2019s creator Golway. \u201cA robot can do that quickly and precisely. And as we know, no two hearts are the same, so BAB can use ultrasound to see inside the vascular pathway of that specific heart, where Dr. Taylor is working blind, so to speak,\u201d Golway added. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating to watch \u2013 there are times where the hair on the back of my neck literally stands up.\u201d Taylor left academia in 2020 and is currently working with private investors to bring her creation to the masses. If transplants into humans in upcoming clinical trials are successful, Taylor\u2019s personalized hybrid hearts could be used to save thousands of lives around the world. In the US alone, some 3,500 people were on the heart transplant waiting list in 2021. \u201cThat\u2019s not counting the people who never make it on the list, due to their age or heath,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a small woman, if you\u2019re an underrepresented minority, if you\u2019re a child, the chances of getting an organ that matches your body are low. If you do get a heart, many people get sick or otherwise lose their new heart within a decade. We can reduce cost, we can increase access, and we can decrease side effects. It\u2019s a win-win-win.\u201d Taylor can even envision a day when people bank their own stem cells at a young age, taking them out of storage when needed to grow a heart \u2013 and one day even a lung, liver or kidney. \u201cSay they have heart disease in their family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can plan ahead: Grow their cells to the numbers we need and freeze them, then when they are diagnosed with heart failure pull a scaffold off the shelf and build the heart within two months. \u201cI\u2019m just humbled and privileged to do this work, and proud of where we are,\u201d she added. \u201cThe technology is ready. I hope everyone is going to be along with us for the ride because this is game-changing.\u201d", "techcrunch115": "Those at risk are always vigilant for the signs of a stroke in progress, but no one can be vigilant when they\u2019re sleeping, meaning thousands of people suffer \u201cwake-up strokes\u201d that are only identified hours after the fact. Zeit Medical\u2019s brain-monitoring wearable could help raise the alarm and get people to the hospital fast enough to mitigate the stroke\u2019s damage and potentially save lives. A few decades ago, there wasn\u2019t much anyone could do to help a stroke victim. But an effective medication entered use in the \u201990s, and a little later a surgical procedure was also pioneered \u2014 but both need to be administered within a few hours of the stroke\u2019s onset. Orestis Vardoulis and Urs Naber started Zeit (\u201ctime\u201d) after seeing the resources being put toward reducing the delay between a 911 call regarding a stroke and the victim getting the therapy needed. The company is part of Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort. \u201cIt used to be that you couldn\u2019t do anything, but suddenly it really mattered how fast you got to the hospital,\u201d said Naber. \u201cAs soon as the stroke hits you, your brain starts dying, so time is the most crucial thing. People have spent millions shrinking the time between the 911 call and transport, and from the hospital door to treatment. but no one is addressing those hours that happen before the 911 call \u2014 so we realized that\u2019s where we need to innovate.\u201d If only the stroke could be identified before the person even realizes it\u2019s happening, they and others could be alerted and off to the hospital long before an ambulance would normally be called. As it turns out, there\u2019s another situation where this needs to happen: in the OR. Surgeons and nurses performing operations obviously monitor the patient\u2019s vitals closely and have learned to identify the signs of an impending stroke from the EEG monitoring their brainwaves. \u201cThere are specific patterns that people are trained to catch with their eyes. We learned from the best neurologists out there how they process this data visually, and we built a tool to detect that automatically,\u201d said Vardoulis. \u201cThis clinical experience really helped, because they assisted in defining features within the signal that helped us accelerate the process of deciding what is important and what is not.\u201d The team created a soft, wearable headband with a compact EEG built in that monitors the relevant signals from the brain. This data is sent to a smartphone app for analysis by a machine learning model trained on the aforementioned patterns, and if anything is detected, an alarm is sent to the user and pre-specified caregivers. It can also be set to automatically call 911. \u201cThe vast majority of the data we have analyzed comes out of the OR,\u201d said Vardoulis, where it can immediately be checked against the ground truth. \u201cWe saw that we have an algorithm that can robustly capture the onset of events in the OR with zero false positives.\u201d That should translate well to the home, they say, where there are actually fewer complicating variables. To test that, they\u2019re working with a group of high-risk people who have already had one stroke; the months immediately following a stroke or related event (there are various clinically differentiated categories) is a dangerous one when second events are common. \u201cRight now we have a research kit that we\u2019re shipping to individuals involved in our studies that has the headband and phone. Users are wearing it every night,\u201d said Vardoulis. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for a path that will allow us to go commercial at some point in 2023. We\u2019re working with he FDA to define the clinical proof needed to get this clear.\u201d They\u2019ve earned a \u201cBreakthrough Device\u201d classification, which (like stroke rehabilitation company BrainQ) puts them in position to move forward quickly with testing and certification. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start in the U.S., but we see a need globally,\u201d said Naber. \u201cThere are countries where aging is even more prevalent and the support structure for disability care is even less.\u201d The device could significantly lower the risk and cost of at-home and disability care for many people who might otherwise have to regularly visit the hospital. The plan for now is to continue to gather data and partners until they can set up a large-scale study, which will almost certainly be required to move the device from direct-to-consumer to reimbursable (i.e., covered by insurance). And although they are totally focused on strokes for the present, the method could be adapted to watching for other neurological conditions. \u201cWe hope to see a future where everyone with a stroke risk is issued this device,\u201d said Vardoulis. \u201cWe really do see this as the missing puzzle piece in the stroke care continuum.\u201d", "techcrunch116": "Smart contact lenses have been the stuff of science fiction for a long time, but as with jetpacks and faster-than-light travel, we\u2019re still waiting on them. Research is ongoing, though, and a project at the University of Ghent shows promise not just in advancing the technology but providing some therapeutic value, as well. Herbert De Smet\u2019s group has been working for some time with EU grant money on initial applications and executions of smart lenses, and some early results were presented at IEEE\u2019s International Electron Devices Meeting this week. Their device embeds a tiny monochrome LCD in the lens that can be set to varying opacities and patterns. Now, these patterns would be far too close to the eye for you to make them out, except perhaps as smudges or dark areas in your vision. They\u2019re not intended to form images, however, but rather to darken the entire field of view for people who can\u2019t do it themselves. Some people suffer from conditions that limit the ability of their eye\u2019s iris \u2014 that\u2019s the colored circle \u2014 to contract and dilate the pupil and control the amount of light admitted to reach the retina. If the pupil is stuck in the open state, bright situations \u2014 normally handled by reducing the pupil to a pinhole \u2014 will overwhelm the iris and cause pain or even serious damage. A contact lens that automatically changes its shade from totally transparent to as dark as a pair of sunglasses, as required by the ambient light, would fill this role nicely. That\u2019s exactly what De Smet\u2019s team has created; head over to IEEE Spectrum for a video of the LCD in action. The parts are in place: the LCD-infused lens and the chip that controls it are solid, and the power system, a set of tiny photovoltaic cells, captures enough energy \u2014 but the two have yet to be integrated. Once they are, the lenses will still, of course, need to be tested for safety.

(Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) New type of pacemaker is a safer, more advanced option than traditional surgery This March, Dr. Kent Nilsson successfully implanted one of the first wireless, dual chamber pacemakers in the world into a patient. This accomplishment makes Piedmont Hospital the first center in the Southeast and fourth in the U.S. to implant this new device. It was only the 32nd implant in a human in the world. A cardiologist at Piedmont Athens Regional Hospital and professor of medicine at the Augusta University/University of Georgia Medical Partnership, Nilsson has become an expert in implanting single chamber, wireless pacemakers. He was called upon again to test the dual chamber version as part of the clinical trial for the Abbott Aveir DR Leadless (wireless) Pacemaker System. The dual chamber wireless pacemaker is honestly one of the most transformative technologies in cardiology. Ever.\u201d \u2014Dr. Kent Nilsson With this procedure, the hospital joined the ranks of leading medical centers and universities in the country. The three locations ahead of Piedmont for the implantation were the University of Arizona, Cleveland Clinic and Cornell University. \u201cThe dual chamber wireless pacemaker is honestly one of the most transformative technologies in cardiology. Ever,\u201d said Nilsson. \u201cWhen the dual chamber launches, it will completely change the field.\u201d How does a pacemaker work? A pacemaker is a device implanted into the chest to stabilize an irregular or slowly beating heart. A traditional pacemaker is inserted through an incision in the chest and is then connected to wires (leads) that have been inserted into the heart through the subclavian vein. The device sits beneath the skin and on top of the chest muscle, and the wires deliver electrical pulses to correct the heartbeat. In 2014, Piedmont joined a clinical trial to test single chamber leadless \u2013 or wireless \u2013 pacemakers, which are put directly into the lower right ventricle of the heart via the femoral vein and do not require the chest to be opened for implantation. Nilsson gladly came on board for the trial. Piedmont was the first center in Georgia and 15th in the country to implant a wireless pacemaker. By the time the 2014 trial for the single wireless pacemaker was complete, Nilsson had implanted over 30 devices. Although traditional pacemakers have come a long way (the first implantation in 1958 failed within three hours and the patient went on to have 26 pacemakers in his lifetime), Nilsson said this wireless technology is the biggest advancement in the field since the invention. Benefits of wireless pacemakers The wireless pacemaker is about 90% smaller than the average pacemaker and the surgery lasts around 30 minutes. The battery life is also comparable with a traditional pacemaker\u2019s 10-12 years and could be longer in some cases. Patients also will not have an incision scar on the chest or a bump protruding from the skin. \u201cThe psychological aspect of not seeing an incision or having something protruding out of your skin is beneficial,\u201d said Nilsson. \u201cJust being able to not broadcast to the world that there is something wrong.\u201d Another advantage is the elimination of several complications associated with traditional pacemakers. One in 10 patients see complications with pacemaker leads, or wires. Some also experience pocket infections, hematoma, lead dislodgment and lead fracture. Wireless pacemaker patients will also see a shorter, less complicated recovery time. There are no restrictions with taking showers or getting the area wet, and there are also no mobility issues. Traditional pacemaker patients are not able to move their arm above their shoulder for six weeks after surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s same day discharge and people are up and moving around and doing everything they need to do,\u201d said Nilsson. The single chamber wireless pacemaker was approved by the FDA in 2016, and Nilsson is now teaching other physicians how to implant the device. \u201cI\u2019m one of 10 proctors teaching close to 5,000 physicians how to implant,\u201d said Nilsson. \u201cThe reception nationwide has been overwhelming. Every day my Twitter is blowing up with pictures of people doing their first single chamber implant.\u201d Single chamber pacemakers connect to one chamber of the heart while the dual chamber version connects to both chambers on the right side of the heart. Dual chamber pacemakers are the standard of care for pacemaker patients in the United States, so this new technology will affect more patients than the single chamber version. \u201cDual chambers are 95% of what we do,\u201d said Nilsson. First implant of the new device Nilsson kicked off the first dual implantation of the dual chamber, wireless pacemaker in March with a meaningful milestone. \u201cAlmost eight years to the day after we implanted the single chamber, we put in the dual chamber,\u201d he said. Sixty-four-year-old Anna McKuhen was Nilsson\u2019s first patient. She was the first in the Southeast to have the dual chamber pacemaker implanted. \u201cI am all about new technology, so when they asked if I\u2019d like to be a part of this trial, I said sure. It sounded exciting,\u201d said McKuhen. \u201cThe technology amazes me.\u201d McKuhen said she was interested in receiving the wireless pacemaker, in part, because of the greatly reduced recovery time. \u201cMy recovery was fantastic,\u201d said McKuhen. \u201cI did not have any problems whatsoever. I was only confined to a week of not lifting heavy objects. I\u2019ve had zero problems.\u201d Nilsson implanted four dual pacemakers by the time the trial concluded in September. Nilsson hopes the dual chamber will be FDA approved in 2023 and widely available soon after. \u201cI would say this is the future of pacemakers 100 percent,\u201d said Nilsson. \u201cEveryone is trying to catch up at this point. This is really transformative technology.\u201d", "other news sites118": "Ultrasound is a convenient, noninvasive tool for doctors to look inside the human body and check out a person\u2019s liver, heart and other internal structures, as well as the developing fetus of a pregnant patient. But today\u2019s ultrasound imaging technology is large and technical, so it\u2019s only available in healthcare facilities and must be operated by highly trained technicians. Plus, patients, who take time out of their schedules to go to an appointment, have to be covered in a sticky gel. Now, researchers say they\u2019ve developed an innovative solution to some of these challenges. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have unveiled a new adhesive ultrasound patch that\u2019s about the size of a postage stamp and can provide continuous imaging of the body\u2019s inner workings for up to 48 hours. The scientists shared their new technology in a paper published last week in the journal Science. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve opened a new era of wearable imaging,\u201d says Xuanhe Zhao, a mechanical engineer at MIT and one of the study\u2019s authors, in a statement. \u201cWith a few patches on your body, you could see your internal organs.\u201d In the past, engineers developing wearable ultrasound technologies have run into issues with image quality and flexibility, but the new MIT stickers seem to have struck the right balance. To create the small devices, which are about three millimeters thick and two square centimeters in size, engineers combined rigid transducers with a stretchy, sticky layer that encapsulates a layer of water-based hydrogel. The researchers put the stickers to the test by placing them on various body parts of healthy volunteers, including their neck, abdomen, arms and chest. Then, they asked the volunteers to move their bodies in various ways, including drinking juice, jogging, lifting weights, biking, sitting and standing. Not only did the stickers adhere to the volunteers\u2019 skin, but they also produced clear images of their internal organs and major blood vessels for up to 48 hours. The patches allowed the researchers to watch volunteers\u2019 stomachs expand, then shrink, when they drank juice. They could observe major blood vessels changing sizes when a volunteer was sitting versus standing, and witness the heart change shape while pumping blood during exercise. For now, the stickers must be connected to instruments to make sense of the data they\u2019ve gathered. But in the near future, the scientists hope to refine their design so that the stickers can operate wirelessly, communicating with a patient\u2019s smart phone for real-time, on-demand imaging. \u201cWe are working hard on the wireless version,\u201d Zhao tells the Guardian\u2019s Ian Sample. \u201cBecause there are already wireless point-of-care handhold ultrasounds, we are confident that we will be able to achieve the wireless version in a few years.\u201d Already, researchers are dreaming up all the ways the stickers could be useful. Patients could wear them at home to help monitor an array of medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. In hospitals, they could free up medical technicians for other tasks or make it possible to obtain ultrasound images in healthcare facilities with staffing issues. Recommended Videos \u201cYou don\u2019t need a trained sonographer and you don\u2019t need a huge ultrasound machine,\u201d says Philip Tan, an electrical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin, to New Scientist \u2019s Jeremy Hsu. \u201cYou could deploy it to very low-resource communities.\u201d", "other news sites119": "1 Scott AJ Ellison M Sinclair DA The economic value of targeting aging. 2 House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee Ageing: Science, Technology, and Healthy Living. Improvements in health care, sanitation, diet, and education over the past century have markedly increased life expectancy, but this has not been paralleled by concomitant increases in healthy life expectancy. Increasing healthspan, which is the time spent free of major illness or disease, is therefore an important priority worldwide. The UK Government, for example, has pledged to increase the healthy life expectancy of the UK population by an extra 5 years by 2035 without increasing inequality. Achieving this goal would simultaneously improve individual quality of life, increase productivity, and boost national wealth. Notably, a gain of just one additional healthy year is predicted to be worth US$38 trillion to the USA.However, a 2021 review of national progress in the UK towards this goal revealed that policy makers have little confidence that healthy life expectancy can be markedly improved either through focusing on technological solutions (which promote independence but not health) or on diet and exercise regimes (which are often out of reach of those who would most benefit, because of socioeconomic inequalities). 2 House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee Ageing: Science, Technology, and Healthy Living. 3 L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn C Blasco MA Partridge L Serrano M Kroemer G The hallmarks of aging. 4 Fraser HC Kuan V Johnen R et al.

Senolytics in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: results from a first-in-human, open-label, pilot study. The same reviewrevealed a general lack of awareness and scrutiny of the potential offered for improving health in later life by ameliorating the ageing process itself. This unawareness is alarming when set against the backdrop of a quiet research revolution in biogerontology that has seen the identification of some key hallmarks of ageing,evidence that these hallmarks and underlying mechanisms independently predict the emergence of age-related diseases in real patients,and positive outcomes from preclinical and early-stage human clinical trials based on targeting ageing mechanisms.Humanity stands on the threshold of being able to prevent multimorbidity and age-associated diseases by addressing the underlying biology of ageing; parallels with the era of antibiotics do not seem unduly hyperbolic. 7 WHO Decade of healthy ageing: baseline report. 8 Cox LS Bellantuono I Lord JM et al. Tackling immunosenescence to improve COVID-19 outcomes and vaccine response in older adults. Ignorance of these developments carries appalling costs, which have been, and will continue to be, borne by older people unless the situation changes. For example, the UK's 2017 Healthy Ageing Grand Challenge specifically excluded biomedical science research from its funding remit, and the extensive Decade of Healthy Ageing: baseline report,by WHO (2021), fails to mention these advances, or even the word biology, focussing instead on socioeconomic determinants of health and overcoming ageism. Given that hallmark ageing mechanisms cause the progressive failure of innate and adaptive immunity, it is a fascinating counterfactual to consider how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic would have been handled had it been preceded by a sustained international effort to target immune senescence and enhance later life immune function.The need to avoid such mistakes in the future is patent, as are the triple economic benefits (lower health and social care costs, greater economic activity of older adults, and investment into new industries) that will accompany efforts in this area. 2 House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee Ageing: Science, Technology, and Healthy Living. 9 Cox LS The economic and scientific case for therapeutic intervention in ageing.

This breadth allows the networks to identify interventions appropriate for different stages of the life course, with a shift in focus from disease-preventive approaches in early life and mid-life through to more intense clinical monitoring and interventions in older adults, including development and testing of new geroprotective and gerotherapeutic medicines, such as senolytic drugs.A multiscale, multisystem, and whole of life course approach to improve healthy life expectancy can be achieved by drawing these broad research disciplines together through a core focus on hallmarks that underlie the biology of ageing and drive age-related disease.AGENTS=Ageing and Nutrient Sensing network.

It is perhaps the perceived complexity of ageing biology that has dissuaded policy makers from directly tackling it. As a result, academic research on ageing in many parts of the globe is fragmented and siloed,and driven by funding models and professional metrics that reward specialisation and disease-specific focus. However, the biological mechanisms that cause ageing must be a central focus if integrational and intersectional approaches aimed at improving lifelong health figure ) are to be truly effective. 10 UKRI Researchers at 28 UK universities team up to tackle healthy ageing. It is therefore hugely exciting that the diversity and complexity of ageing across the life course has now been recognised in a national initiative by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and Medical Research Council of UK Research and Innovation (the national government-sponsored research funder). Launched in March, 2022,the UK Ageing Network comprises 11 new research networks addressing core aspects of ageing biology and health in a national macro network, drawing together ageing research across systems and scales ( figure ). These networks aim to enable knowledge exchange and research beyond the narrow focus of individual research projects and academic disciplines, drawing from the social sciences, humanities, economics, and biomedical and physical sciences, as well as bringing in expertise from industry, biotechnology, the third sector, and policy makers; membership is open and non-prescriptive, and interested individuals and organisations are encouraged to join . Importantly, the networks also include the voice of those with the lived experience of ageing, to enable relevant co-design of future research strategies, together with health practitioners and clinical trialists to ensure that promising interventions can be taken forward from the laboratory into patients. Through workshops, training programmes, grassroots events, and research pump priming, the networks will not only enable integration of expertise and cross-disciplinary working to generate new knowledge and provide solutions to ageing problems, they also aim to build ageing research capacity, enticing researchers from all career stages and disciplines in academia and beyond to embrace ageing research. Dissemination of new findings and development of new training materials for a range of audiences, including clinical practitioners and policy makers, is also key to the networks\u2019 goals, to ensure that actionable findings from ageing research are rapidly adopted into policy and practice. Initially funded for 2 years, positive outcomes from the networks should drive investment to sustain and grow them, with expansion to include colleagues from around the world. We therefore welcome input, suggestions, and support from all who wish to contribute to improve health across the life course and work towards the goal of substantially extending healthy life expectancy.", "other news sites120": "Blood glucose monitoring is touted to be the next big breakthrough for wearable devices like the Apple Watch. However, the hardware is yet to be seen on a commercially available, mass-market device. That might change soon. A team from Georgia\u2019s Kennesaw State University claims to have developed a noninvasive system of blood glucose level measurement, thanks to a device called GlucoCheck. It follows the same fundamental approach as the oxygen-level analysis sensor on smartwatches like the Apple Watch Series 8 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 5. Team lead Maria Valero, an assistant professor at the institution\u2019s College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE), notes that the device delivers 90% accuracy in analyzing glucose concentration in blood samples. The biosensor works in tandem with a phone application, but the team is already at work on integrating Amazon\u2019s Alexa virtual assistant. GlucoCheck shines light across the human skin, and then a camera captures the view from the other side. The goal is to study the varying level of light absorption by blood flowing in the vessels to determine the glucose concentration. The team has already filed a patent for the tech and now aims to test it on more body types to diversify the test data. This step is of critical importance, because commercially available wearables like those made by Fitbit and even Apple are known to be inaccurate at reading data from people with dark or tattoed skin types. The latest development is remarkable because it achieves the holy grail of glucose-level monitoring, which is to develop a noninvasive method that can be miniaturized and connected to devices such as phones. Currently, people with diabetes need to prick their fingers to obtain a blood sample to analyze their sugar levels. Commercial players are also at it This is not the first research of its kind. In July 2020, Samsung showcased a noninvasive method for blood glucose monitoring in partnership with experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The same year, Movano revealed a wearable device that can measure blood sugar levels using a light diffusion method. But it didn\u2019t do much else. A year later, a Japanese company named Quantum Operation showcased a wearable-mounted sensor at CES 2021 that was capable of noninvasive blood glucose analysis. According to multiple reports that have surfaced over the past couple of years, both Apple and Samsung are interested in the promising tech for their smartwatches. Quantum Operation Non-Invasive Blood Glucometer U.K.-based Rockley Photonics is also working toward the same objective, but instead of LEDs, the company is focused more on laser-based analysis. Regarding the in-house tech, CEO Dr. Andrew Rickman told Digital Trends that it \u201ccollects incredibly rich data that we extract to measure, amongst other things, hydration, lactate, and blood pressure.\u201d Notably, Apple is said to be one of the biggest clients of Rockley Photonics and is rumored to include the noninvasive blood glucose monitoring tech on the Apple Watch portfolio in the near future.

Scientists at Cambridge have now identified a protein that plays a key role in metastasis, which not only hints at a new potential treatment but reveals for the first time that this process isn\u2019t unique to cancer. No matter where in the body it originates, cancer can eventually begin to colonize other organs and tissues through a process known as metastasis, which makes it much harder to treat. Unfortunately, there\u2019s still much about metastasis that scientists don\u2019t understand, but ongoing research is continually uncovering mechanisms that could lead to new therapy options. In the new study, Cambridge scientists discovered not just a new mechanism for metastasis, but completely recontextualized its role. It\u2019s long been thought that metastasis was an abnormal process that arises in cancer, but the new study found that it\u2019s a process used by healthy cells as well \u2013 cancer just hijacks it for its own purposes. The team made the discovery while investigating a cellular structure known as sodium leak channel, non-selective (NALCN). These channels are located on cell membranes and control how salt goes in and out of the cell. In the new study, the researchers found that NALCN also regulates the release of cells from tissues into the bloodstream, where they can be taken up by other organs and tissues. In tests in mice, the scientists blocked the function of the NALCN protein, and found that it triggered metastasis in stomach, intestinal and pancreatic cancers. That suggests this could be a new target for preventing metastasis, potentially improving outcomes for patients with cancer. But the most surprising discovery came when the team tested the technique in mice without cancer. Blocking NALCN also caused healthy cells to migrate away from their original organs to other ones \u2013 pancreatic cells, for instance, moved to the kidney and became healthy kidney cells instead. \u201cThese findings are among the most important to have come out of my lab for three decades,\u201d said Professor Richard Gilbertson, Group Leader of the study. \u201cNot only have we identified one of the elusive drivers of metastasis, but we have also turned a commonly held understanding of this on its head, showing how cancer hijacks processes in healthy cells for its own gains. If validated through further research, this could have far-reaching implications for how we prevent cancer from spreading and allow us to manipulate this process to repair damaged organs.\u201d The team now plans to investigate ways to take advantage of this discovery to prevent metastasis, including repurposing existing drugs. The research was published in the journal Nature Genetics.

According to the results of the study, the Apple Watch Series 6 is able to \u201creliably detect states of reduced blood oxygen saturation\u201d in comparison to medical-grade pulse oximeters. Here\u2019s how the study came to determine this\u2026 How reliable is the Apple Watch\u2019s blood oxygen sensor? As spotted by MyHealthyApple, the study was published this month in the Digital Health open access journal. The objective of the study was to investigate \u201chow a commercially available smartwatch that measures peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) can detect hypoxemia compared to a medical-grade pulse oximeter.\u201d For the study, researchers recruited 24 healthy participants. Each person wore an Apple Watch Series 6 on their left wrist and a pulse oximeter sensor on their left middle finger (the Masimo Radical-7). The participants breathed via a breathing circuit with a three-way non-rebreathing valve in three phases. First, in the 2-minute initial stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air. Then in the 5-minute desaturation phase, the participants breathed the oxygen-reduced gas mixture (12% O 2 ), which temporarily reduced their blood oxygen saturation. In the final stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air again until SpO 2 returned to normal values. Measurements of SpO 2 were taken from the smartwatch and the pulse oximeter simultaneously in 30-s intervals. The study resulted in 642 individual pairs of blood oxygen measurements: The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%-100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%. As such, the researchers conclude: The bias in SpO 2 between the smartwatch and the oximeter was 0.0% for all the data points. The bias for SpO 2 less than 90% was 1.2%. The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO 2 can be expected for SpO 2 readings 90%\u2013100% and up to 8% for SpO 2 readings less than 90%. Apple first added blood oxygen measurement support to the Apple Watch Series 6. It\u2019s also a feature on the newest Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, and Apple Watch Ultra.

Across several common procedures, some research has found that robotic surgery can improve outcomes in areas such as blood loss, complications, and recovery times, compared to open and some laparoscopic surgeries. Robotic procedures have been game changers in minimally invasive care, and innovative surgical systems have been crucial. Robotic surgery isn\u2019t performed by a machine; a specially trained surgeon uses advanced medical technology to streamline the surgical process. The end goal is to increase safety, reduce complications, and improve patient outcomes. By reducing surgical trauma and increasing precision, robotic surgery can help pave the way for predictable, reproducible results. Although robotic surgery has made impressive advances over the past two decades, there is much more to be done. As minimally invasive care continues to advance, researchers are finding new ways to help surgeons do more for patients. How robotic surgery works The first commercially viable robotic surgical system was developed in the late 1990s by Intuitive. Intuitive\u2019s systems have gone on to become the most advanced and widely used in the world. Four generations of its pioneering da Vinci system have so far been used in more than 10 million procedures. Intuitive\u2019s robotic surgical systems enable surgeons to use a console, precisely guiding surgical instruments inside the patient\u2019s body. The surgeon\u2019s hand movements are translated in real time to the instruments, which are situated on a cart beside the patient. The instruments are small, nimble, and have a greater range of motion than the human wrist and hand, helping to enable surgical precision in moments that matter. In contrast to open surgery, which typically requires a large incision, robotic surgery involves one or more very small incisions to insert the robotic arms. One of the arms has a camera that feeds high-quality 3D video to the surgeon\u2019s console. \u201cI remember distinctly when I first sat at the console,\u201d says Tanuja Damani, a general surgeon at New York University who first began using the da Vinci system in 2011. \u201cI realized right away that this was the future of surgery. But there was tremendous skepticism early on.\u201d Dr. Damani and other early adopters saw the potential of this approach. Their vision, perseverance, and mentoring have smoothed the way for those who have followed. Take Amanda Pysher, a young bariatric and general surgeon with Surgical Consultants of Northern Virginia, who was first introduced to robotics during her residency and fellowship. Unlike Dr. Damani, Dr. Pysher has benefited from a robust network of mentors, who\u2019ve helped her as she\u2019s learned the ropes of using the da Vinci system. She\u2019s become so comfortable with the system that three years ago she focused her practice on robotic surgery. She now mentors other surgeons who are in the process of learning robotic surgery. \u201cI think it has been easier for me to transition to robotics than the first adopters years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I feel so strongly about mentoring. I want to be able to give back and help others the way that the mentors above me helped me. We\u2019re helping people live longer for their families and their friends. I just can\u2019t think of any other surgery which has a bigger impact than that.\u201d Robotic surgery\u2019s impact on patients For both Dr. Pysher and Dr. Damani, the goal is to do more for their patients. One such patient is Jennifer Luebke. Last year, after struggling with her weight for decades, Luebke decided to have a robotic bariatric surgery with Dr. Pysher. That decision stemmed largely from her sense that her weight increased her long-term health risks. \u201cI want to be able to grow old and be a grandmother, and I really didn\u2019t see that in my future,\u201d Luebke says. \u201cI really was concerned. This is the one thing that has completely changed my life.\u201d As an emergency room nurse, Luebke was reluctant to undergo traditional open bariatric surgery \u2013 she\u2019d seen patients who\u2019d had to deal with complications. But as her weight increased and her health problems grew, she decided that robotic surgery might reduce the risk of complications. Her decision paid off. After the procedure, she spent the night in the hospital and was discharged the next morning. As the technology continues to advance, more and more surgeons and hospitals are coming on board. The number of worldwide robotic procedures more than doubled between 2012 to 2020. A study published two years ago in JAMA Network Open analyzed records from 73 hospitals in Michigan, finding that 8.7 percent of surgeons performed robotic general surgery in 2012; by 2018, that number had jumped to over 35 percent. \u201cWe are turning the skeptics into believers,\u201d Dr. Damani says. \u201cThe shared sense of purpose of the robotics surgery community now is something that is so refreshing.\u201d Total da Vinci Practice* *Total da Vinci Practice refers to the transferable value of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci system across procedures in a surgeon\u2019s minimally invasive practice. It is at the surgeon\u2019s discretion to determine when a patient is a candidate for minimally invasive surgery and whether robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci system is an option.", "techcrunch124": "FlyFeed claims it signed more than $10 million worth of contracts and closed a $3 million round of investment to launch its first insect farm in Vietnam, in its push to produce low-cost, high-nutrient protein for human consumption. The company was founded less than a year ago and is targeting the three billion people who are facing food insecurity due to climate and global financial shifts. The production process uses organic leftovers as food for the black soldier fly (BSF) insects, which significantly reduces the final price of manufactured protein. As a bonus, it also helps reduce local food waste issues. \u201cFive billion dollars invested in agtech in 2021 shows that the fragile global food chain, relying on exhaustible natural resources, faces new challenges and needs a change. In this case, insect proteins are an effective solution that can transform inedible resources into nutritious proteins. Supported by laboratory tests and approved by local authorities, we will open 10 farms in Asia and Africa by 2026 and contribute to solving the global food shortage crisis,\u201d says Arseniy Olkhovskiy, CEO and founder of FlyFeed, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThere are many things I find wrong with the world, but the fact that global hunger still exists is the most absurd. There are more than three billion people who cannot afford healthy food, and almost one billion live in food insecurity. The worst part is that this number continues to rise. Until we rethink our food chain, this won\u2019t change because conservative agriculture isn\u2019t designed to feed a growing population.\u201d In the first instance, the insects will be used for animal feed and pet food, with future plans to include turning the insects into flour that can be used for human food in five years or so. The plan is for the first farm in Vietnam to produce 17.5+ thousand tons of insect products per year, including insect fat, protein flour and fertilizers, and process 40+ thousand tons of organic leftovers for BSF feed, gathered and processed for free by a partnership with local authorities. The $3 million angel round will be used to establish operations, further develop technological solutions and construct the first industrial-sized farm in Vietnam in 2023, producing affordable proteins, oils and fertilizers from insects. \u201cWith personal money invested and this seed round, we\u2019ve been able to build an infrastructure that unlocks our scale. Our production technology was developed by our specialists and world-class engineering teams, we secured resources in Vietnam for construction and operations, we signed over $10 million in pre-contracts to verify demand and validate our product development strategy, and we built an A-class team and advisory board to support the company,\u201d says Olkhovskiy. \u201cFlyFeed\u2019s goal is to feed 250 million people annually, providing nutritious and wholesome food to those who don\u2019t have access to it or can\u2019t afford it. This means 250 million more people can live healthier and happier lives and focus on what matters to them.

After peaking in 2014 at 10 percent, the trend has been decreasing, especially since China stopped accepting the West's plastic waste in 2018. Virgin production \u2014 of non-recycled plastic, that is \u2014 meanwhile is rapidly rising as the petrochemical industry expands, lowering costs. \"Industry groups and big corporations have been pushing for recycling as a solution,\" Greenpeace USA campaigner Lisa Ramsden told AFP. \"By doing that, they have shirked all responsibility\" for ensuring that recycling actually works, she added. She named Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever and Nestle as prime offenders. According to Greenpeace USA's survey, only two types of plastic are widely accepted at the nation's 375 material recovery facilities. The first is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly used in water and soda bottles; and the second is high density polyethylene (HDPE), seen in milk jugs, shampoo bottles and cleaning product containers. These are numbered \"1\" and \"2\" according to a standardized system in which there are seven plastic types. But being recyclable in theory doesn't mean products are being recycled in practice. The report found that PET and HDPE products had actual reprocessing rates of 20.9 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively \u2014 both down slightly from Greenpeace USA's last survey in 2020. Plastic types \"3\" through \"7\" \u2014 including children's toys, plastic bags, produce wrappings, yogurt and margarine tubs, coffee cups and to-go food containers \u2014 were reprocessed at rates of less than five percent. Despite often carrying the recycling symbol on their labels, products that use plastic types \"3\" through \"7\" fail to meet the Federal Trade Commission classification of recyclable. This is because recycling facilities for these types aren't available to a \"substantial majority\" of the population, defined as 60 percent, and because the collected products are not being used in the manufacturing or assembly of new items. According to the report, there were five main reasons why plastic recycling is a \"failed concept.\" First, plastic waste is generated in vast quantities and is extremely difficult to collect \u2014 as becomes clear during what the report called ineffective \"volunteer cleanup stunts\" funded by nonprofits such as \"Keep America Beautiful.\" Second, even if it were all collected, mixed plastic waste cannot be recycled together, and it would be \"functionally impossible to sort the trillions of pieces of consumer plastic waste produced each year,\" the report said. Third, the recycling process itself is environmentally harmful, exposing workers to toxic chemicals and itself generating microplastics. Fourth, recycled plastic carries toxicity risks through contamination with other plastic types in collection bins, preventing it from becoming food-grade material again. Fifth and finally, the process of recycling is prohibitively expensive. \"New plastic directly competes with recycled plastic, and it's far cheaper to produce and of higher quality,\" said the report. Ramsden called on corporations to support a Global Plastics Treaty, which United Nations members agreed to create in February, and move toward refill and reuse strategies. \"This isn't actually a new concept \u2014 it's how the milkman used to be, it's how Coca-Cola used to get its beverages to people. They would drink their beverage, give the glass bottle back, and it would be sanitized and reused,\" she said. Some countries are leading the way, including India, which recently banned 19 single-use plastic items. Austria has set reuse targets of 25 percent by 2025 and at least 30 percent by 2030 for beverage packaging, while Portugal has also set the 30 percent by 2030 goal. Chile is moving to phase out single-use cutlery and mandating refillable bottles.", "other news sites126": "Media release The University of Queensland Some of Asia\u2019s largest animals, including tigers and elephants, are defying 12,000 years of extinction trends by thriving alongside humans, a University of Queensland-led study has revealed. Researchers scoured paleontological records to compare the historic distribution of Asia\u2019s 14 largest species with their populations in present-day tropical forests. PhD candidate Zachary Amir, from UQ\u2019s School of Biological Sciences and the Ecological Cascades Lab, said four species \u2013 tigers, Asian elephants, wild boars and clouded leopards \u2013 showed increased populations in areas with human infrastructure. \u201cThese results show that, under the right conditions, some large animals can live nearby humans and avoid extinction,\u201d Mr Amir said. \u201cThese results challenge the narrative within some conservation circles that humans and megafauna are incompatible. \u201cGlobally there is a trend towards \u2018trophic downgrading\u2019, a term referring to the disproportionate loss of the world\u2019s largest animals. \u201cTrophic downgrading is usually worst near humans because hunters target larger species. \u201cBut in the case of tigers, elephants, wild boars and clouded leopards, their Asian populations are higher nearby humans. \u201cThis may be the outcome of tougher anti-poaching efforts in the national parks that are closer to human settlements and are more frequently visited by tourists.\u201d The study also found deforestation was still impacting species, and clouded leopard numbers in particular experienced a strong decline in those areas. But, Mr Amir said the research showed that if the large animal species were not hunted, they could live in relatively small habitats and near humans. \u201cPreviously, there have only been a few examples of large Asian species thriving in small habitats near humans, notably in Mumbai, India where leopards in an urban park prey on stray dogs,\u201d Mr Amir said referring to a prior UQ study. \u201cThankfully, we found that a wider range of animals can coexist with humans.\u201d At one of their study sites in Singapore, where poaching has been eliminated and there are considerable forest restoration efforts, two large animal species are thriving again. \u201cSingapore has actually experienced the natural re-wilding of sambar deer and wild boars, which are now frequently observed in an urban forest, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve,\u201d Mr Amir said. \u201cIf we replicate those protection efforts in larger forests and other counties, we may see positive impacts right around the world. \u201cBut before this can happen, humans need to get our act together and limit poaching.\u201d While there are some positive results, UQ\u2019s Dr Matthew Luskin said the study also noted strong declines in tapirs, Sumatran rhinoceros, sun bears, guar and other large animals. \u201cThe key innovation of this work was to systematically investigate the population trends of many different wildlife species across the region,\u201d Dr Luskin said. \u201cThen we tested if all species showed consistent trends and if similar parks retained similar species. \u201cRemarkably, we found no two forests currently possess the same group of wildlife compared to thousands of years ago.\u201d Dr Luskin said the research offered an opportunity to shape the future of nature. \u201cThese results provide hope for wildlife in forests previously considered too far degraded or too close to cities,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re exploring new conservation strategies for these surprising places.\u201d", "techcrunch127": "BENDLAY 3D Is A Bendable Printing Filament That You Can Use To Make Clear, Flexible Straps And Bands [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=VtYbYr19GVg] Kai Parthy is a German engineer who creates odd printing filaments for 3D printers.

Now he\u2019s created a bendable printing filament called BENDLAY that is 91% transparent and remains \u201cbendable\u201d after printing.

It is foodsafe and can be used for clear bottles and containers and works well for flexible straps. While ABS can be used to create flexible items like bracelets, this material will truly bend without breaking, allowing for hinges and other mechanical parts to be built into other, stiffer parts.

The AMP technology can be used to recover plastics, cardboard, paper, cans, cartons and many other containers and packaging types reclaimed for raw material processing. The tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene.

In January, before the pandemic began, AMP Robotics worked with its investor, Sidewalk Labs on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits. Working with the building and a waste hauler, Sidewalk Labs transported the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics. Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how they\u2019re doing in their recycling efforts. Sidewalk says that the tips were communicated through email, an online portal and signage throughout the building every two weeks over a three-month period.

That's a potential application of a recent breakthrough by Japanese researchers who demonstrated the ability to mount \"backpacks\" of solar cells and electronics on the bugs and control their motion by remote control. Kenjiro Fukuda and his team at the Thin-Film Device Laboratory at Japanese research giant Riken developed a flexible solar cell film that's 4 microns thick, about 1/25 the width of a human hair, and can fit on the insect's abdomen. The film allows the roach to move freely while the solar cell generates enough power to process and send directional signals into sensory organs on the bug's hindquarters. The work builds upon previous insect-control experiments at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and could one day result in cyborg insects that can enter hazardous areas much more efficiently than robots. \"The batteries inside small robots run out quickly, so the time for exploration becomes shorter,\" Fukuda said. \"A key benefit (of a cyborg insect) is that when it comes to an insect's movements, the insect is causing itself to move, so the electricity required is nowhere near as much.\" [1/5] A Madagascar hissing cockroach, mounted with a \"backpack\" of electronics and a solar cell that enable remote control of its movement, is pictured during a photo opportunity at the Thin-Film Device Laboratory of Japanese research institution Riken in Wako, Saitama Prefecture, Japan September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon 1 2 3 4 5 Fukuda and his team chose Madagascar hissing cockroaches for the experiments because they are big enough to carry the equipment and have no wings that would get in the way. Even when the backpack and film are glued to their backs, the bugs can traverse small obstacles or right themselves when flipped over. The research still has a long way to go. In a recent demonstration, Riken researcher Yujiro Kakei used a specialized computer and wireless Bluetooth signal to tell the cyborg roach to turn left, causing it to scramble in that general direction. But when given the \"right\" signal, the bug turned in circles. The next challenge is miniaturising the components so that the insects can move more easily and to allow for mounting of sensors and even cameras. Kakei said he constructed the cyborg backpack with 5,000 yen ($35) worth of parts purchased at Tokyo's famed Akihabara electronics district. The backpack and film can be removed, allowing the roaches to go back to life in the lab's terrarium. The insects mature in four months and have been known to live up to five years in captivity. Beyond disaster rescue bugs, Fukuda sees broad applications for the solar cell film, composed of microscopic layers of plastic, silver, and gold. The film could be built into clothing or skin patches for use in monitoring vital signs.

Above, members of the Anderson lab at work. Credit: John Zich/University of Chicago Scientists with the University of Chicago have discovered a way to create a material that can be made like a plastic, but conducts electricity more like a metal. The research, published Oct. 26 in Nature, shows how to make a kind of material in which the molecular fragments are jumbled and disordered, but can still conduct electricity extremely well. This goes against all of the rules we know about for conductivity\u2014to a scientist, it's kind of like seeing a car driving on water and still going 70 mph. But the finding could also be extraordinarily useful; if you want to invent something revolutionary, the process often first starts with discovering a completely new material. \"In principle, this opens up the design of a whole new class of materials that conduct electricity, are easy to shape, and are very robust in everyday conditions,\" said John Anderson, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago and the senior author on the study. \"Essentially, it suggests new possibilities for an extremely important technological group of materials,\" said Jiaze Xie (Ph.D. '22, now at Princeton), the first author on the paper. 'There isn't a solid theory to explain this' Conductive materials are absolutely essential if you're making any kind of electronic device, whether it be an iPhone, a solar panel, or a television. By far the oldest and largest group of conductors is the metals: copper, gold, aluminum. Then, about 50 years ago, scientists were able to create conductors made out of organic materials, using a chemical treatment known as \"doping,\" which sprinkles in different atoms or electrons through the material. This is advantageous because these materials are more flexible and easier to process than traditional metals, but the trouble is they aren't very stable; they can lose their conductivity if exposed to moisture or if the temperature gets too high. But fundamentally, both of these organic and traditional metallic conductors share a common characteristic. They are made up of straight, closely packed rows of atoms or molecules. This means that electrons can easily flow through the material, much like cars on a highway. In fact, scientists thought a material had to have these straight, orderly rows in order to conduct electricity efficiently. Then Xie began experimenting with some materials discovered years ago, but largely ignored. He strung nickel atoms like pearls into a string of of molecular beads made of carbon and sulfur, and began testing. To the scientists' astonishment, the material easily and strongly conducted electricity. What's more, it was very stable. \"We heated it, chilled it, exposed it to air and humidity, and even dripped acid and base on it, and nothing happened,\" said Xie. That is enormously helpful for a device that has to function in the real world. But to the scientists, the most striking thing was that the molecular structure of the material was disordered. \"From a fundamental picture, that should not be able to be a metal,\" said Anderson. \"There isn't a solid theory to explain this.\" Xie, Anderson, and their lab worked with other scientists around the university to try to understand how the material can conduct electricity. After tests, simulations, and theoretical work, they think that the material forms layers, like sheets in a lasagna. Even if the sheets rotate sideways, no longer forming a neat lasagna stack, electrons can still move horizontally or vertically\u2014as long as the pieces touch. The end result is unprecedented for a conductive material. \"It's almost like conductive Play-Doh\u2014you can smush it into place and it conducts electricity,\" Anderson said. The scientists are excited because the discovery suggests a fundamentally new design principle for electronics technology. Conductors are so important that virtually any new development opens up new lines for technology, they explained. One of the material's attractive characteristics is new options for processing. For example, metals usually have to be melted in order to be made into the right shape for a chip or device, which limits what you can make with them, since other components of the device have to be able to withstand the heat needed to process these materials. The new material has no such restriction because it can be made at room temperatures. It can also be used where the need for a device or pieces of the device to withstand heat, acid or alkalinity, or humidity has previously limited engineers' options to develop new technology. The team is also exploring the different forms and functions the material might make. \"We think we can make it 2D or 3D, make it porous, or even introduce other functions by adding different linkers or nodes,\" said Xie.

These new generations of robots are more accessible, easier to operate, more autonomous, affordable, and adaptable than previous generations, and capable of navigating into locations previously inaccessible to automated or remotely-controlled technologies. We believe that advanced mobile robots will provide great benefit to society as co-workers in industry and companions in our homes. As with any new technology offering new capabilities, the emergence of advanced mobile robots offers the possibility of misuse. Untrustworthy people could use them to invade civil rights or to threaten, harm, or intimidate others. One area of particular concern is weaponization. We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues. Weaponized applications of these newly-capable robots will also harm public trust in the technology in ways that damage the tremendous benefits they will bring to society. For these reasons, we do not support the weaponization of our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots. For those of us who have spoken on this issue in the past, and those engaging for the first time, we now feel renewed urgency in light of the increasing public concern in recent months caused by a small number of people who have visibly publicized their makeshift efforts to weaponize commercially available robots. We pledge that we will not weaponize our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots or the software we develop that enables advanced robotics and we will not support others to do so. When possible, we will carefully review our customers\u2019 intended applications to avoid potential weaponization. We also pledge to explore the development of technological features that could mitigate or reduce these risks. To be clear, we are not taking issue with existing technologies that nations and their government agencies use to defend themselves and uphold their laws. We understand that our commitment alone is not enough to fully address these risks, and therefore we call on policymakers to work with us to promote safe use of these robots and to prohibit their misuse. We also call on every organization, developer, researcher, and user in the robotics community to make similar pledges not to build, authorize, support, or enable the attachment of weaponry to such robots. We are convinced that the benefits for humanity of these technologies strongly outweigh the risk of misuse, and we are excited about a bright future in which humans and robots work side by side to tackle some of the world\u2019s challenges.

The machine is under development, with the plan to build it by 2028. When it is ready, it should be more efficient than ASML's Twinscan NXT:2000i tool, whose development took over a decade. After Russia unleashed its bloody war against Ukraine on February 24, Taiwan was quick to ban shipments of advanced chips to the nation. The U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. then followed up with sanctions that effectively prohibit virtually all contract chipmakers with advanced fabs from working with Russian entities. In addition, companies like Arm cannot license their technologies to Russia-based chip designers. As a result, the Russian government rolled out a national program to develop the country's own 28nm-class fabrication technology by 2030, reverse engineer as many foreign chips as possible, and educate local talent to work on domestic chips. However, there is a problem with a 28nm-class production node by 2030. Russia's most advanced fab can produce chips using a 65nm fabrication technology. Meanwhile, American and European makers of fab tools cannot supply their equipment to Russia due to sanctions, so the country has to design and build domestic wafer production equipment if it wants to adopt a 28nm node. Essentially, what has taken companies like ASML and Applied Materials decades to develop and iterate has to be done in about eight years. Apparently, the Russian Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences intends to beat all expectations and produce a 7nm-capable lithography scanner by 2028, according to its plans published on Nizhy Novgorod Strategy Development website (via CNews). A modern lithography scanner capable of processing wafers using a 7nm-class process technology is a highly complex apparatus that involves a high-performance light source, sophisticated optics, and precise metrology, just to name a few critical parts. However, as a leading applied physics university in Russia, IAP believes that it can develop such a tool in a relatively short amount of time. The tool will be somewhat different from scanners produced by companies like ASML or Nikon. For example, IAP plans to use a >600W light source (total power, not intermediate focus power) with an 11.3nm exposure wavelength (EUV wavelength is 13.5nm), which will require considerably more sophisticated optics than exists today. Because the light source of the device will be relatively low power, it will make the tool more compact and easier to build. Yet, it also means that its production of the scanner will be considerably lower than that of modern deep ultraviolet (DUV) tools. That might not be a problem, according to IAP. When it comes to timing, IAP may be slightly too optimistic. For everything below 32nm, chipmakers use the so-called immersion lithography (which is essentially a booster to DUV tools). ASML introduced its first immersion lithography system \u2014 the Twinscan XT:1250i \u2014 in late 2003 with a plan to deliver one in Q3 2004 to produce 65nm logic chips and 70nm half-pitch DRAMs. It took the company about five years and another generation of tools to announce its 32nm-capable Twinscan NXT:1950i in late 2008, with customer deliveries starting in 2009. Then, it took the market leader some nine years to deliver its 7nm and 5nm-capable Twinscan NXT:2000i DUV tool in 2018. TSMC used less advanced tools with multi-patterning for its first-generation N7 fabrication technology, but the timing of ASML\u2019s introductions demonstrate how hard it is to transition from 65nm to 7nm. It took ASML 14 years to go from 65nm to 7nm. Now, IAP, which does not have any experience in chip production or ties with chipmakers, intends to build a 7nm-capable machine for volume production from scratch in about six years. While the plan does not sound feasible, it looks like IAP is full of enthusiasm. \"ASML, the global lithography leader, has been developing its EUV lithography system for almost 20 years and the technology has turned out to be incredibly complex,\" said Nikolai Chkhalo, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences for scientific and technological development. \"The main objective of ASML in this case was to maintain the extremely high productivity that is needed only at the world's largest factories. In Russia, no one needs such high productivity. In our work, we start from the needs and tasks faced by domestic microelectronics \u2014 and this is not so much about quantity, but about quality. First of all, we need to transit to our own fabrication processes, develop our own design standards, our own tools, engineering, materials, so our own path is inevitable here. In fact, we need to balance between simplicity and performance.\" IAP plans to build a fully functional alpha scanner by 2024. This one will not have to offer high productivity or maximum resolution but will have to work and be attractive to potential investors. IAP intends to build a beta version of the scanner with higher productivity and resolution by 2026. This machine should be mass production ready, but its productivity is not expected to be at its maximum. The final iteration of the litho scanner is said to emerge in 2028. It should get a high-performance light source (hence better productivity), better metrology and overall capabilities. There is no word how many of such machines IAP and/or its production partners will be able to produce by 2028. It should be noted that fab equipment is not limited to lithography scanners. There are other types of machines performing etching, deposition, resist removal, metrology, and inspection operations that are not made in Russia. Furthermore, there is somewhat less advanced machinery like ultrapure air and water generators which also are not produced in Russia. Even if IAP RAS manages to build a lithography tool, Russia will still be a few hundred tools short of building a modern fab. Also, fabs need ultrapure raw materials produced in countries that will not supply to Russia.", "techcrunch138": "AMP Robotics, the recycling robotics technology developer backed by investors including Sequoia Capital and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, is close to closing on as much as $70 million in new financing, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans. The new financing speaks to AMP Robotics\u2019 continued success in pilot projects and with new partnerships that are exponentially expanding the company\u2019s deployments. Earlier this month the company announced a new deal that represented its largest purchase order for its trash-sorting and recycling robots. That order, for 24 machine learning-enabled robotic recycling systems with the waste-handling company Waste Connections, was a showcase for the efficacy of the company\u2019s recycling technology. That comes on the back of a pilot program earlier in the year with one Toronto apartment complex, where the complex\u2019s tenants were able to opt into a program that would share with the building\u2019s renters recycling habits monitored by AMP Robotics in an effort to improve their recycling behavior. The potential benefits of AMP Robotic\u2019s machine learning-enabled robots are undeniable. The company\u2019s technology can sort waste streams in ways that traditional systems never could and at a cost that\u2019s far lower than most waste-handling facilities. As TechCrunch reported earlier, the tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The robots can also sort for color, clarity, opacity and shapes like lids, tubs, clamshells and cups \u2014 the robots can even identify the brands on packaging. AMP\u2019s robots already have been deployed in North America, Asia and Europe, with recent installations in Spain and across the U.S. in California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. At the beginning of the year, AMP Robotics worked with its investor, Sidewalk Labs, on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits. Sidewalk Labs is transporting the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics. Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how they\u2019re doing in their recycling efforts. It was only last November that the Denver-based AMP Robotics raised a $16 million round from Sequoia Capital and others to finance the early commercialization of its technology.", "other news sites139": "In the murky waters of Lake Ontario just off the Toronto harbor, a stream of trash inches toward a round, tubular-looking device floating in the water. A piece of white styrofoam bumps up against the device\u2019s lip. Then, in one fluid motion, it tumbles over the edge. With tendrils of marine plants circling the waste, it looks like the styrofoam could have entered a portal to an undersea world. Instead, the device is a gateway to a less mystical \u2014 yet vital \u2014 destination: the garbage dump. \u201cIt\u2019s basically like a floating trash can,\u201d says Chelsea Rochman, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto, who has worked with a team at the university to capture trash in Lake Ontario with bins like these since 2019. Powered from shore, the device, called a Seabin, uses a motor to create a vortex that gently pulls in floating waste from a 160-foot radius and then stores the trash in an attached basket. Across the Great Lakes, which stretch from Duluth, Minnesota, to the border between the United States and Canada in northern New York, dozens of Seabins now work alongside stormwater filters in a cross-border project dubbed the Great Lakes Plastic Cleanup. In mid-September, they were also joined by aquatic waste-collection drones and beach-cleaning roving robots \u2014 all to remove some of the 22 million pounds of plastic that enter the lakes each year and help researchers like Rochman understand the Great Lakes waste problem. People can\u2019t remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices can \u201cWe know that the amount of litter we have out there needs more power than the people power that we have,\u201d Rochman explains. Though local groups have organized beach cleanups for decades, people can\u2019t remove waste 24 hours a day like the devices can, nor can they pick up the tiny pieces that machines are able to capture. Standing on the shore of Lake Ontario, with Toronto\u2019s streetcars rattling by, Rochman points out the overflowing municipal trash bin along the sidewalk \u2014 one of several sources of the trash. Municipal sewage systems, industrial spills, stormwater runoff, recreational boating and beach waste, and agricultural debris all wind up in the lakes as well. In one bin, toothbrushes, tampon applicators, dental flossers, shoe strings, eyeglasses, food scraps, and syringes are entwined in the tendrils of marine plants. Between the leaves, tiny flecks of plastic poke out. Bright colored plastic floats among leaves and other debris in one of the Great Lakes Image: Great Lakes Plastic Cleanup In the lakes, which 40 million people rely on as their primary drinking water source, this waste breaks down, turning into microscopic pieces of plastic and debris, which are then eaten by fish, sucked into surrounding water treatment plants, or pulled to shore or out into the ocean. When plastic is consumed by fish, it can release chemicals like dyes and flame retardants, irritating and potentially damaging their digestive systems. In big sport fish, like lake trout or salmon, Rochman expects to find hundreds of pieces of plastic. Microplastics have also been found in drinking water in the region, where many water treatment plants are ill-equipped to filter the tiny pieces out. (The risk of consuming microplastics for humans remains unclear, though researchers continue to investigate the potential problem.) Once captured by researchers like Rochman, each piece of trash becomes another data point. Each day during the summer, students haul out the bins to count, classify, and dispose of their contents. \u201cThey know how many cigarette butts we collect, how many straws we collect, how many foam containers we collect,\u201d Rochman says. Some days, the catch is more surprising \u2014 students have counted slices of deli meat, old shoes, and, once, a coconut in Seabins this summer. The Seabins capture 28 grams of waste, on average, each day. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound like a small number because plastic is light,\u201d says Rochman. That weight translates to a couple hundred to 2,000 pieces of microplastic, along with multiple pieces of larger waste. This summer, Rochman expects her team to remove the amount of plastic equivalent to 7,000 plastic water bottles \u2014 and that\u2019s only in the 12 bins the university oversees, which make up just a fraction of the devices deployed at 45 marinas across the Great Lakes region. From the northern shores of Lake Superior in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to the harbor of Buffalo, New York, just a short drive from Niagara Falls, Seabins like the ones in the Toronto harborfront are deployed at 44 other locations, typically in operation from May to November. These bins are monitored not by researchers but by marina owners or local organizations. Partners at the participating sites weigh and dispose of the bins\u2019 contents as they fill up and perform full waste characterizing audits five to 10 times each year. Many marinas also have catch basin baskets installed, called LittaTraps, that sit inside stormwater drains to capture waste before it enters the lake system. Between 2020 and 2021, the project\u2019s technology captured over 74,000 pieces of trash, a number that the team expects will increase as they continue outreach to marinas and municipalities in the region. A promotional photo of the beach-cleaning BeBot. Image: The Searial Cleaners In September, a waste collecting drone and beach-cleaning robot also joined the project\u2019s fleet of trash catching technology. The devices, built by French waste capture technology company The Searial Cleaners, collect waste from lakes and beaches, working both via remote control and autonomously. The roving robots are also key public engagement tools, says Claire Touvier, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThat\u2019s why this robot needed to be sexy and cool and fun, and to also have a cool name \u2014 these are extremely efficient tools when it comes to raising awareness,\u201d she says. Still, the technology remains a reactive approach. Robots can help clean up the lakes, but human choices about how much plastic to produce, consume, and throw out are at the core of the Great Lakes trash problem. Changing them will be key to any long-term solution, says Melissa De Young, policy and programs director at the Canadian nonprofit Pollution Probe, one of the project\u2019s main funders. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can to remove plastic from the water, but we know that the technologies alone are not going to solve the problem,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe data that we\u2019re collecting is really critical because it provides, first, an understanding of the extent of the problem.\u201d If large macroplastics wind up in capture devices in a certain area, for example, that can indicate communities nearby may lack easy access to disposal facilities or may be uninformed on why proper waste disposal is important. Alternatively, if small plastic pieces used to build other products, called preproduction pellets, or nurdles, are more common, that can indicate that somewhere upstream, a manufacturer may be improperly disposing of its trash. The PixieDrone collects plastic. Image: The Searial Cleaners The captured waste then informs the group\u2019s approach to local solutions, whether that means starting a new educational campaign, meeting with policymakers, or advocating for new industry mandates. Last year, the team consulted on a new Ontario law that requires the foam used to build floating docks for cottages and marinas to be fully enclosed so it does not break down into the water. The group has also contributed to proposed legislation to include mandates for filters on washing machines to prevent microfibers from entering the sewage system in Ontario and stronger laws regarding preproduction plastic disposal in Illinois. \u201cWhen we go to government policymakers, when we go to industry in the region, when we go to others to say, \u2018Listen, we\u2019ve got a problem here and we need to fix it,\u2019 having that localized data, having that regional data, really aids us in those conversations in terms of capturing people\u2019s attention and really motivating them to do something,\u201d says Mark Fisher, head of the Council for the Great Lakes, a binational organization that also funds the project. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to have trash traps in the water forever.\u201d Other researchers in the region are hopeful about the new technology in the lakes, too. No initiative is going to be able to pick up 22 million pounds of plastic out of the Great Lakes every year, but a project that can motivate public and political action can have magnifying results, explains Timothy Hoellein, a biology professor at Loyola University Chicago who has worked on separate lake cleanup projects but is not involved in this one. When it comes to the Seabins, \u201cTheir individual footprint is pretty small,\u201d Hoellein says. \u201cBut on a collective basis, it could really make a difference.\u201d As the strategy garners success in the region, its lessons have begun to reach far beyond the shores of the Great Lakes. Rochman and the team at the University of Toronto have partnered with the nonprofit environmental group Ocean Conservancy to found the International Trash Trap Network, which works with groups from Fiji to Florida to help create more trash trapping strategies. Wherever trash traps capture waste, data collection follows. It\u2019s all part of the goal of achieving a future where freshwater sources, like the Great Lakes, are no longer dumping zones for waste, Rochman says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to have trash traps in the water forever,\u201d she adds.", "techcrunch140": "In a deal that has potentially big implications for the sustainability of consumer packaged goods, biomaterial manufacturing technology developer Genomatica and the massive nylon material manufacturer Aquafil have partnered on a new demonstration scale facility. Nylon-6 is used to make everything from toothbrush bristles to pantyhose and industrial materials like carpeting and other heavy-duty fabrics. The material will be used to develop renewable products and showcase goods that can be brought to market as more companies look to clean up their supply chains and make products that have fewer negative consequences for the environment at the end of their life. The deal is a 50-fold expansion of previous production levels for Genomatica and represents a significant expansion of Genomatica\u2019s capabilities. The textile industry is a $960 billion business, and it\u2019s one of the most polluting in the world \u2014 both in terms of chemical treatments and greenhouse gas emissions. According to data cited by the World Economic Forum, the textile industry accounts for 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per-year \u2014 nearly as much as the auto industry. Nylon production alone is responsible for about 60 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, according to the companies. The multi-year agreement with European-based Aquafil expands on the two companies\u2019 existing relationship. Earlier this year the two companies produced the first ton of bio-nylon-6 precursor material at a pilot scale. Now, the move to a demonstration scale plant will give Genomatica the ability to move ahead with supply agreements to certain brand partners. Clothing maker Far Eastern New Century uses Genomatica\u2019s products in its clothes, and other partnerships are in the works, the company said. Genomatica is backed by Casdin Capital, Viking Global Investors, which continues as Genomatica\u2019s largest shareholder, and organism engineering partner Ginkgo Bioworks. \u201cBio-nylon is positioned to replace a material that\u2019s used in millions of applications every day,\u201d said Christophe Schilling, Genomatica CEO. \u201cOur research shows that despite health and economic turmoil, 56% of Americans still want brands to prioritize sustainability. With this scale, Genomatica is offering our brand partners a key way to meet their sustainability objectives, differentiate themselves, and meet surging consumer demand.\u201d Aquafil is building the plant in Slovenia, where the Genomatica biological precursor material will be converted into bio-nylon-6 yarns, films and engineered plastics.", "other news sites141": "Edd Gent is a freelance science and technology writer based in Bengaluru, India.

One company is hoping to change that with the power of robots. Eric Adamson's company is behind a strawberry robotic revolution. He said they're programmed to think on their own, with cameras that sense texture and color. \"People think robots have been around forever, but they're actually very, very new, especially robots that make decisions and are autonomous,\" Adamson said. They work in a hydroponic field, which is a type of farming that can use up to 90% less water than traditional methods. As good as they are, though, they're hardly foolproof. \"We expect we'll make mistakes and we'll expect things will break,\" he said. Adamson said the robots pick with 95% accuracy. And it's not just the robots that are learning. Jeanpol Rodriguez, who used to work in the fields, now manages the robots picking strawberries. He said he didn't know anything about robotics before entering this new role. \"The robot is doing the job. I'm like \u2014 I'm cool!\" Rodriguez told CBS News. Adamson said this is a way that \"we can create jobs with higher wages and with higher skill development.\" Adamson said his goal is to expand beyond just strawberry picking. \"We hope to have hundreds and hundreds of robots around the world's leading farms, picking table grapes, peppers, cucumbers, blackberries, raspberries,\" he told CBS News.", "techcrunch143": "As part of its Ground X-Vehicle Technologies program, DARPA is showcasing some new defense vehicle tech that\u2019s as futuristic as it is practical.

The wheel-track is just one of a handful of designs meant to improve survivability of combat vehicles beyond just up-armoring them. As you can see in the video, the reconfigurable wheel-track demonstrates a seamless transition between a round wheel shape and a triangular track in about two seconds, and the shift between its two modes can be executed while the vehicle is in motion without cutting speed. Round wheels are optimal for hard terrain while track-style treads allow an armored vehicle to move freely on softer ground.

Spanish researchers have found that chemicals in the saliva of the wax worm can break down polyethylene, a particularly hard-wearing material. Their research found that exposing the plastic to the creature's saliva caused it to degrade as much in a single hour as several years worth of normal exposure to the elements. Wax worms, the larvae of the wax moth, usually feed on the tough wax bees use to make honeycombs and are actually considered pests by beekeepers. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, discovered that two enzymes in the worm's saliva - which it uses to break down the wax - also break down the plastic. For plastic to degrade, oxygen needs to penetrate the plastic's molecules, known as polymers, a process known as oxidation. The research found that the enzymes in the saliva caused this process to occur in a matter of hours without any need to pre-treat the plastic by exposing it to heat or radiation. Polyethylene is the most widely used plastic in the world and responsible for vast amounts of pollution. First created in 1933, it is inexpensive, hard wearing and doesn't interact with food, making it widely used.

She went on to explain that they had not only found out which enzymes break down the plastic, but had also managed to produce them synthetically, avoiding the need to use billions of wax worms to do the job.

This site features several honeybee hives that are used for research. In the event of overcrowding of a beehive, the original queen leaves the hive with a fraction of the workers (on average around 12,000 bees) (), resulting in occasional swarming events near PG measuring equipment at our study site. When honeybees swarm, they usually cluster on a limb of a tree for several days while scout bees search for suitable cavities to nest in. After an appropriate nest is found, the swarm will collectively migrate. An electric field monitor was placed near the swarm. A camera (AKASO V50\u00d7, 30 fps) was positioned next to the field mill with an upward orientation to record the swarm in flight ( Figure 1 B). A second electric field monitor was placed in an open field, 50m away from the other electric field monitor and swarm to ascertain any dynamics in the electric field monitor was caused by the presence of a swarm. For about three minutes, part of the swarm passed over the electric field monitor. Modelling of electric fields was performed using finite element analysis within COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae v. 5.4 (COMSOL AB, Stockholm, Sweden) utilising the \u201cElectrostatics\u201d interface within the \u201cAC/DC\u201d module. The three-dimensional geometry consisted of a 60 m \u00d7 60 m x 40 m (length, width, height) cuboid within which the model operated. The two runs made for differently sized and charged ellipsoids represented insect swarms of honeybees and locusts. The honeybee swarm was represented as an ellipsoid with semi-axes 2 m x 1 m x 0.5 m ellipsoid at a height of 3 m, and the locust swarm an ellipsoid with semi-axes 4 m x 1 m x 1 m at a height of 15 m. The swarm charge was distributed evenly as a volume charge within the ellipsoids, with the total charge calculated respectively as the sum of 500 bees each carrying +100 pC (order of magnitude from ()) and 1000 locusts carrying +850 pC each. An approximately 8 m tall deciduous tree was included in each model to provide scale and an electrical landmark for comparison (). The remainder of the model domain was assigned as air. The upper surface of this air column was given an electrical potential typical of a 40 m altitude in fair-weather conditions (+4 kV), with the bottom surface defined as zero potential, equivalent to the established surface (first meter) atmospheric potential gradient of 100 V/m (). The surface of the tree was also defined as ground (). Meshing of the geometry was physics-controlled, set to \u201cextremely fine\u201d. The relative permittivity, \u03b5, was defined as \u03b5= 12 for living trees (), \u03b5= 1 for air, and \u03b5= 80 inside the insect swarms (likely an overestimate, based on the permittivity of water). Model outputs presented for this study were produced by plotting data from two-dimensional slices through the centre of the three-dimensional dataset. Quantification and statistical analysis The video recording capturing the swarm event was cropped to a 500 by 220-pixel window to remove foreground objects obstructing the view of the swarm and was analysed using a custom script in Python 3.8.1. The video was converted to black and white pixels such that the background was white and any non-background objects, comprising the swarm, were black. The ratio of black to white pixels was calculated for each frame of the video resulting in a proxy measure for bee density, defined as relative pixel density here. At points during the swarm\u2019s passage, flowering heads of grass entered the frame, increasing the relative pixel density. Such affected data were therefore removed. The relative pixel densities were filtered by a moving mean over 10 data points (corresponding to 0.5 s) to emphasise the long-term trend of the data.

Stuart Gordon and Mark Appleford are the co-founders of Varden, a company that has developed a process to take the waste material from sugarcane and convert it into a paper-like packaging product with the functional attributes of plastic. Their technology managed to grab the attention of \u2014 and $2.2 million in funding from \u2014 Horizons Ventures, the venture capital fund managing the money of Li Ka-shing, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men. It\u2019s an opportune time to launch a novel packaging technology, as the European Union has already instituted a ban on single-use plastic items, which will go into effect in 2021. Taking their lead, companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Walmart have pledged to use only sustainable packaging for products beginning in 2025. The environmental toll that packaging takes on the earth\u2019s habitats is already a concern for many, and the urgency to find a solution is only mounting with consumers and businesses actually producing more waste in the rush to change consumer behavior and socially distance as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. \u201cI like technologies that focus on carbon reductions,\u201d said Chris Liu, Horizons Ventures\u2019 representative in Australia. A longtime tech and product executive who had stints at Intel and Fjord, a digital design studio, Liu relocated to Australia recently and has actually taken himself off the grid. Living in Western Australia, the climate emergency was brought directly to the top of Liu\u2019s mind when the wildfires, which raged through the country, came within two kilometers of his new home. For Mark Appleford, it wasn\u2019t so much the fires as it was the garbage that kept washing up on the shores of his beloved beaches. Over beers at a barbecue he began talking to his eventual co-founder, Stuart Gordon, about the environmental problem they\u2019d solve if they had the ability to change things. They settled on plastics. Working in Appleford\u2019s laundry room they started developing the technology that would become Varden. That early laundry room-work in 2015 led to a small seed round and the company\u2019s long slog to get an initial product in the hands of test customers. Finagling some time with the New Zealand manufacturer Fisher and Paykel, the two co-founders put together an early prototype of their coffee pods made from sugarcane bagasse, a waste byproduct of the sugar feedstock. \u201cWe worked backwards through customers to supply chain, which led us to material selection, which was something that would allow us to create a product that people understood,\u201d said Gordon. The production process has evolved to fit inside a 40-foot container that holds the firm\u2019s machine, which takes agricultural waste and converts that waste into packaging. Instead of using rollers like a paper mill, Varden\u2019s technology uses a thermoform to mold the plant waste into a product that has the same properties as plastic. It removes a complicated step that\u2019s been essential to the current crop of bioplastics, which use bacteria to convert plant waste into plastic substitutes that are then sold to the industry. \u201cIt looks like paper\u2026 you can tear it in half and it sounds like paper when you rip it, and you can throw it in the bin,\u201d said Appleford. Gordon said that the company\u2019s containers are outperforming commodity based plastics. And the first target for replacement, the founders said, is coffee capsules. \u201cWe went for coffee because it\u2019s the hardest,\u201d said Appleford. It\u2019s also a huge market, according to the company. Varden estimates there are more than 20 billion coffee pods consumed every year. With the new money, Varden will begin manufacturing at scale to meet initial demand from pilot customers and is hoping to expand its product line to include medical blister packs in addition to the coffee pods. \u201cA pilot plant on the products we\u2019re looking at is a pilot plant that can generate 20 million units a year,\u201d said Gordon. Both men are hoping that their product \u2014 and others like it \u2014 can usher in a generation of new sustainable packaging materials that are better for the environment at every stage of their life cycle. \u201cThe next generation of packaging will be better\u2026 there are plant-based flexibles for your salads, for your potato chips\u2026 [But] the next generation of molded packaging is us\u2026 bioplastic will ultimately go.\u201d", "other news sites147": "Scientists have been able to direct a swarm of microscopic swimming robots to clear out pneumonia microbes in the lungs of mice, raising hopes that a similar treatment could be developed to treat deadly bacterial pneumonia in humans. The microbots are made from algae cells and covered with a layer of antibiotic nanoparticles. The algae provide movement through the lungs, which is key to the treatment being targeted and effective. In experiments, the infections in the mice treated with the algae bots all cleared up, whereas the mice that weren't treated all died within three days. The technology is still at a proof-of-concept stage, but the early signs are very promising. \"Based on this mouse data, we see that the microrobots could potentially improve antibiotic penetration to kill bacterial pathogens and save more patients' lives,\" says Victor Nizet, a physician and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego. The nanoparticles on the algae cells are made of tiny polymer spheres coated with the membranes of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. These membranes neutralize inflammatory molecules produced by bacteria and the body's own immune system, and both the nanoparticles and the algae degrade naturally. Harmful inflammation is reduced, improving the fight against infection, and the swimming microbots are able to deliver their treatment right where it's needed \u2013 it's the precision that makes this approach work so well. The researchers also established that the microbot treatment was more effective than an intravenous injection of antibiotics \u2013 in fact, the injection dose had to be 3,000 times higher than the one loaded on to the algae cells to achieve the same effect in the mice. \"These results show how targeted drug delivery combined with active movement from the microalgae improves therapeutic efficacy,\" says Joseph Wang, nanoengineer from UC San Diego. In humans, the pneumonia caused byPseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria used in this study occurs after patients are put on a mechanical ventilator in intensive care. The infection often prolongs stays in hospital and significantly increases the risk of death. The researchers are confident that their new method can be scaled up as required, and would be straightforward to administer to the lungs of ventilated patients (the microbots were delivered to the mice through a tube in the windpipe). Next up for the team is more research into how the microbots interact with the immune system, then scaling up the work and getting it ready to be tested in larger animals \u2013 and then eventually, humans. \"Our goal is to do targeted drug delivery into more challenging parts of the body, like the lungs,\" says chemical engineer Liangfang Zhang from UC San Diego. \"And we want to do it in a way that is safe, easy, biocompatible, and long-lasting.\" \"That is what we've demonstrated in this work.\" The research has been published in Nature Materials.", "other news sites148": "URBANA, Ill. \u2013 Bats help keep forests growing. Without bats to hold their populations in check, insects that munch on tree seedlings go wild, doing three to nine times more damage than when bats are on the scene. That\u2019s according to a groundbreaking new study from the University of Illinois. \u201cA lot of folks associate bats with caves. But as it turns out, the habitat you could really associate with almost every bat species in North America is forest. And this is true globally. Forests are just really important to bats,\u201d says Joy O\u2019Keefe, study co-author and assistant professor and wildlife extension specialist in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at Illinois. \u201cWe wanted to ask the question: Are bats important to forests? And in this study, we've demonstrated they are.\u201d Other researchers have demonstrated bats\u2019 insect-control services in crop fields and tropical forest systems, but no one has shown their benefits in temperate forests until now. \u201cIt's especially important for us to learn how bats affect forests, given that bats are declining due to diseases like white-nose syndrome or collisions with wind turbines. This type of work can reveal the long-term consequences of bat declines,\u201d says Elizabeth Beilke, postdoctoral researcher and lead author on the study. The research team built giant mesh-enclosed structures in an Indiana forest to exclude the eight bat species that frequent the area, including two federally threatened or endangered species. The mesh openings were large enough to allow insects free movement in and out, but not flying bats. Every morning and evening for three summers, Beilke opened and closed the mesh sides and tops of the structures to ensure birds had daytime access to the plots. That way, she could be sure she was isolating the impacts of bats. Beilke then measured the number of insects on oak and hickory seedlings in the forest understory, as well as the amount of defoliation per seedling. Because she erected an equal number of box frames without mesh, Beilke was able to compare insect density and defoliation with and without bats. Overall, the researchers found three times as many insects and five times more defoliation on the seedlings when bats were excluded than in control plots that allowed bats in each night. When analyzed separately, oaks experienced nine times more defoliation and hickories three times more without bats. \u201cWe know from other research that oaks and hickories are ecologically important, with acorns and hickory nuts providing food sources for wildlife and the trees acting as hosts to native insects. Bats use both oaks and hickories as roosts, and now we see they may be using them as sources of prey insects, as well. Our data suggest bats and oaks have a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Beilke says. While insect pressure was intense in plots without bat predation, the seedlings didn\u2019t succumb to their injuries. But the researchers say long-term bat declines could prove fatal for the baby trees. \u201cWe were observing sublethal levels of defoliation, but we know defoliation makes seedlings more vulnerable to death from other factors such as drought or fungal diseases. It would be hard to track the fate of these trees over 90 years, but I think a natural next step is to examine the impact of persistent low levels of defoliation on these seedlings,\u201d Beilke says. \u201cTo what extent does repeated defoliation reduce their competitive ability and contribute to oak declines?\u201d The researchers point out that birds, many of which share the same insect diets as bats, are also declining. While they specifically sought to isolate bats\u2019 impact on forest trees, the researchers are confident insect density and defoliation rates would have been higher if they had excluded both birds and bats in their study. In fact, similar exclusion studies focusing on birds failed to account for bats in their study designs, leaving mesh enclosures up all night. \u201cWhen we were initially working on the proposal for this research, we looked at 37 different bird exclusion studies, across agriculture and forest systems. We found nearly all of them had made this mistake. Most of them had not opened or removed their treatment plots to bats,\u201d Beilke says. In other words, before Beilke\u2019s study, birds were getting at least partial credit for work bats were doing in the shadows. Clearly, both types of winged predators are important for forest health in temperate systems. And, according to O\u2019Keefe, that makes these studies even more critical to inform forest management. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to stress the value of this type of experimental work with bats, to really try to dig into what their ecosystem services are in a deliberate manner. While we can probably extrapolate out and say bats are important in other types of forest, I wouldn't discount the value of doing the same kind of work in other systems, especially if there are questions about certain insect or tree species and how bats affect them. So rather than extrapolating out across the board, let's do the work to try to figure out how bats are benefiting plants,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd before they're gone, hopefully.\u201d The article, \u201cBats reduce insect density and defoliation in temperate forests: an exclusion experiment,\u201d is published in Ecology [DOI: 10.1002/ecy.3903].

Optrodes have the potential to make future prosthetics as functional as the limb they replace. Image: Shutterstock Biomedical and electrical engineers at UNSW Sydney have developed a new way to measure neural activity using light \u2013 rather than electricity \u2013 which could lead to a complete reimagining of medical technologies like nerve-operated prosthetics and brain-machine interfaces. Professor Fran\u00e7ois Ladouceur, with UNSW\u2019s School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, says the multi-disciplinary team has just demonstrated in the lab what it proved theoretically shortly before the pandemic: that sensors built using liquid crystal and integrated optics technologies \u2013 dubbed \u2018optrodes\u2019 \u2013 can register nerve impulses in a living animal body. Not only do these optrodes perform just as well as conventional electrodes \u2013 that use electricity to detect a nerve impulse \u2013 but they also address \u201cvery thorny issues that competing technologies cannot address\u201d, says Prof. Ladouceur. \u201cFirstly, it\u2019s very difficult to shrink the size of the interface using conventional electrodes so that thousands of them can connect to thousands of nerves within a very small area. \u201cOne of the problems as you shrink thousands of electrodes and put them ever closer together to connect to the biological tissues is that their individual resistance increases, which degrades the signal-to-noise ratio so we have a problem reading the signal. We call this \u2018impedance mismatch\u2019. \u201cAnother problem is what we call \u2018crosstalk\u2019 \u2013 when you shrink these electrodes and bring them closer together, they start to talk to, or affect each other because of their proximity.\u201d \u201cThe real advantage of our approach is that we can make this connection very dense in the optical domain and we don\u2019t pay the price that you have to pay in the electrical domain,\u201d Prof. Ladouceur says. In research published recently in the Journal of Neural Engineering, Prof. Ladouceur and fellow researchers at UNSW wanted to show that they could use optrodes to accurately measure the neural impulses as they travel along a nerve fibre in a living animal. Scientia Professor Nigel Lovell, who heads the Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering and is Director of the Tyree Foundation Institute of Health Engineering, was part of the research team that sought to demonstrate this in the lab. He says the team connected an optrode to the sciatic nerve of an anaesthetised animal. The nerve was then stimulated with a small current and the neural signals were recorded with the optrode. Then they did the same using a conventional electrode and a bioamplifier. \u201cWe demonstrated that the nerve responses were essentially the same,\u201d says Prof. Lovell. \u201cThere\u2019s still more noise in the optical one, but that\u2019s not surprising given this is brand new technology, and we can work on that. But ultimately, we could identify the same characteristics by measuring electrically or optically.\u201d New dawn for prosthetics So far the team has been able to show that nerve impulses \u2013 which are relatively weak and measured in microvolts \u2013 can be registered by optrode technology. The next step will be to scale up the number of optrodes to be able to handle complex networks of nervous and excitable tissue. Prof. Ladouceur says at the beginning of the project, his colleagues asked themselves, how many neural connections does a man or woman need to operate a hand with a degree of finesse? \u201cThat you can pick up an object, that you can judge the friction, you can apply just the right pressure to hold it, you can move from A to B with precision, you can go fast and slow \u2013 all these things that we don\u2019t even think about when we perform these actions. The answer is not so obvious, we had to search quite a bit in the literature, but we believe it\u2019s about 5000 to 10,000 connections.\u201d In other words, between your brain and your hand there is a bundle of nerves that travels down from your cortex and eventually divides into those 5000 to 10,000 nerves that control the delicate operations of your hand. If a chip with thousands of optical connections could connect to your brain, or some place in the arm before the nerve bundle separates, a prosthetic hand could potentially be able to function with much the same ability as a biological one. That\u2019s the dream, anyway, and Prof. Ladouceur says there are likely decades of further research before it\u2019s a reality. This would include developing the ability for optrodes to be bidirectional. Not only would they receive and interpret signals from the brain on the way to the body, they could receive feedback in the form of neural impulses going back to the brain. The long game: brain-machine interface Neural prosthetics isn\u2019t the only space that optrode technology has the potential to redefine. Humans have long fantasised about integrating technology and machinery into the human body to either repair or enhance it. Some of this is now a reality, such as Cochlear implants, pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, not to mention smart watches and other tracking devices giving continual biofeedback. But one of the more ambitious goals in biomedical engineering and neuroscience is the brain-machine interface that aims to connect the brain to not only the rest of the body, but potentially the world. \u201cThe area of neural interfacing is an incredibly exciting field and will be the subject of intense research and development over the next decade,\u201d says Prof. Lovell. While this is more fiction than fact right now, there are many biotech companies taking this very seriously. Entrepreneur Elon Musk was one of the co-founders of Neuralink that aims to create brain-computer interfaces with the potential to help people with paralysis as well as incorporating artificial intelligence into our brain activities. The Neuralink approach uses conventional wire electrodes in its devices so it must overcome impedance mismatch and crosstalk \u2013 among many other challenges \u2013 if they are to develop devices that host thousands, if not millions, of connections between the brain and the implanted device. Recently Mr Musk was reported as being frustrated at the slow pace in developing the technology. Read more: UNSW engineers win US Naval grant to develop brain-machine interface Prof. Ladouceur says time will tell whether Neuralink and its competitors succeed in removing these obstacles. However, given that implantable, in vivo devices that capture neural activity are currently constrained to about 100 or so electrodes, there is still a long way to go. \u201cI'm not saying that it's impossible, but it becomes really problematic if you were to stick to standard electrodes,\u201d Prof. Ladouceur says. \u201cWe don't have these problems in the optical domain. In our devices, if there is neural activity, its presence influences the orientation of the liquid crystal which we can detect and quantify by shining light on it. It means we don't extract current from the biological tissues as the wire electrodes do. And so the biosensing can be done much more efficiently.\u201d Now that the researchers have shown that the optrode method works in vivo, they will shortly publish research that shows the optrode technology is bidirectional \u2013 that it can not only read neural signals, but can write them too.", "other news sites151": "Every year around 2 million people die worldwide from hemorrhaging or blood loss. Uncontrolled hemorrhaging accounts for more than 30% of trauma deaths. To stop the bleeding, doctors often apply pressure to the wound and seal the site with medical glue. But what happens when applying pressure is difficult or could make things worse? Or the surface of the wound is too bloody for glue? Drawing inspiration from nature, researchers from McGill University have developed a medical adhesive that could save lives, modeled after structures found in marine animals like mussels and flatworms. \u201cWhen applied to the bleeding site, the new adhesive uses suction to absorb blood, clear the surface for adhesion, and bond to the tissue providing a physical seal.

That number is expected to drop further as more plastic is produced. Greenpeace found that no plastic \u2014 not even soda bottles, one of the most prolific items thrown into recycling bins \u2014 meets the threshold to be called \"recyclable\" according to standards set by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation New Plastic Economy Initiative. Plastic must have a recycling rate of 30% to reach that standard; no plastic has ever been recycled and reused close to that rate. \"More plastic is being produced, and an even smaller percentage of it is being recycled,\" says Lisa Ramsden, senior plastic campaigner for Greenpeace USA. \"The crisis just gets worse and worse, and without drastic change will continue to worsen as the industry plans to triple plastic production by 2050.\" Waste management experts say the problem with plastic is that it is expensive to collect and sort. There are now thousands of different types of plastic, and none of them can be melted down together. Plastic also degrades after one or two uses. Greenpeace found the more plastic is reused the more toxic it becomes. New plastic, on the other hand, is cheap and easy to produce. The result is that plastic trash has few markets \u2014 a reality the public has not wanted to hear. Trent Carpenter, the general manager of Southern Oregon Sanitation, says when they told customers a couple years ago that they could no longer take any plastic trash other than soda bottles and jugs \u2014 like milk containers and detergent bottles \u2014 people were upset. They wanted to put their strawberry containers, bags, yogurt cups and all manner of plastic trash in their recycling bin. \"We had to re-educate individuals that a great deal of that material is ending up in a landfill,\" Carpenter said. \"It's not going to a recycling facility and being recycled. It's going to a recycling facility and being landfilled someplace else because [you] can't do anything with that material.\" That message has been difficult for the public to absorb with so many different bins in public spaces, and their own communities telling them to put their plastic in recycling containers. Carpenter says they wanted to be transparent with their customers and tell them the truth, unlike companies that continue to tell customers that plastic, such as bags and containers, is being turned into new things. \"Politically it's easier to just say 'Gosh, we're going to take everything and we think we can get it recycled,' and then look the other way,\" Carpenter said of the other companies. \"That's greenwashing at its best.\" Greenpeace found a couple facilities are trying to reprocess cups and containers \u2014 sometimes called \"number 5s\" because of the markings on the containers. But the numbers are low. While 52% of recycling facilities in the U.S. accept that kind of plastic, the report found less than 5% of it is actually repurposed \u2014 and the rest is put into a landfill. Similarly, the National Association for PET Container Resources, an industry trade group, found in 2017 that only 21 percent of the plastic bottles collected for recycling were turned into new things. The low reprocessing rates are at odds with plans from the oil and gas industry. Industry lobbyists say they plan to recycle every piece of plastic they make into something new by 2040. In interviews with NPR, industry officials were unable to explain how they planned to reach a 100 percent recycling rate. An NPR investigative report found in 2020 that industry officials misled the public about the recyclability of plastic even though their own reports showed they knew as early as the 1970s and 1980s that plastic could not be economically recycled. The American Chemistry Council, an industry lobby group, initially did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the Greenpeace report. After publication, Joshua Baca, vice president of plastics for the group, sent an email to NPR calling Greenpeace's views \"misleading, out of touch and misguided.\" He said the industry believes it is \"on the cusp of a circularity revolution\" when it comes to recycling plastic by \"scaling up sortation, advanced recycling, and new partnerships that enable used plastic to be remade again and again.\" Environmentalists and lawmakers in some states are now pushing for legislation that bans single use plastics, and for \"bottle bills\" which pay customers to bring back their plastic bottles. The bills have led to successful recycling rates for plastic bottles in places like Oregon and Michigan, but have faced steep resistance from plastic and oil industry lobbyists. \"The real solution is to switch to systems of reuse and refill,\" Ramsden said. \"We are at a decision point on plastic pollution. It is time for corporations to turn off the plastic tap.\" After years of embracing plastic recycling, many environmental groups say they hope the public will finally see plastic for what they say it is \u2014 trash \u2014 and that people will ask themselves if there is something else they could be using instead.", "other news sites154": "Newswise \u2014 An interdisciplinary team of University of Minnesota Twin Cities scientists and engineers has developed a first-of-its-kind, plant-inspired extrusion process that enables synthetic material growth. The new approach will allow researchers to build better soft robots that can navigate hard-to-reach places, complicated terrain, and potentially areas within the human body. The paper is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), a peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary, high-impact scientific journal. \u201cThis is the first time these concepts have been fundamentally demonstrated,\u201d said Chris Ellison, a lead author of the paper and professor in the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. \u201cDeveloping new ways of manufacturing are paramount for the competitiveness of our country and for bringing new products to people. On the robotic side, robots are being used more and more in dangerous, remote environments, and these are the kinds of areas where this work could have an impact.\u201d Soft robotics is an emerging field where robots are made of soft, pliable materials as opposed to rigid ones. Soft growing robots can create new material and \u201cgrow\u201d as they move. These machines could be used for operations in remote areas where humans can\u2019t go, such as inspecting or installing tubes underground or navigating inside the human body for biomedical applications. Current soft growing robots drag a trail of solid material behind them and can use heat and/or pressure to transform that material into a more permanent structure, much like how a 3D printer is fed solid filament to produce its shaped product. However, the trail of solid material gets more difficult to pull around bends and turns, making it hard for the robots to navigate terrain with obstacles or winding paths. The University of Minnesota team solved this problem by developing a new means of extrusion, a process where material is pushed through an opening to create a specific shape. Using this new process allows the robot to create its synthetic material from a liquid instead of a solid. \u201cWe were really inspired by how plants and fungi grow,\u201d said Matthew Hausladen, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. student in the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. \u201cWe took the idea that plants and fungi add material at the end of their bodies, either at their root tips or at their new shoots, and we translated that to an engineering system.\u201d Plants use water to transport the building blocks that get transformed into solid roots as the plant grows outward. The researchers were able to mimic this process with synthetic material using a technique called photopolymerization, which uses light to transform liquid monomers into a solid material. Using this technology, the soft robot can more easily navigate obstacles and winding paths without having to drag any solid material behind it. This new process also has applications in manufacturing. Since the researchers\u2019 technique only uses liquid and light, operations that use heat, pressure, and expensive machinery to create and shape materials might not be needed. \u201cA very important part of this project is that we have material scientists, chemical engineers, and robotic engineers all involved,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cBy putting all of our different expertise together, we really brought something unique to this project, and I\u2019m confident that not one of us could have done this alone. This is a great example of how collaboration enables scientists to address really hard fundamental problems while also having a technological impact.\u201d The research was funded by the National Science Foundation. In addition to Ellison and Hausladen, the research team included University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science researchers Boran Zhao (postdoctoral researcher) and Lorraine Francis (College of Science and Engineering Distinguished Professor); and University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering researchers Tim Kowalewski (associate professor) and Matthew Kubala (graduate student).

Our perception of our bodies is not always correct or realistic, as any athlete or fashion-conscious person knows, but it\u2019s a crucial factor in how we behave in society. Your brain is continuously preparing for movement while you play ball or get dressed so that you can move your body without bumping, tripping, or falling. Humans develop our body models as infants, and robots are starting to do the same. A team at Columbia Engineering revealed today that they have developed a robot that, for the first time, can learn a model of its whole body from scratch without any human aid. The researchers explain how their robot built a kinematic model of itself in a recent paper published in Science Robotics, and how it utilized that model to plan movements, accomplish objectives, and avoid obstacles in a range of scenarios. Even damage to its body was automatically detected and corrected. The robot watches itself like an infant exploring itself in a hall of mirrors The researchers placed a robotic arm within a circle of five streaming video cameras. The robot watched itself through the cameras as it undulated freely. Like an infant exploring itself for the first time in a hall of mirrors, the robot wiggled and contorted to learn how exactly its body moved in response to various motor commands. After about three hours, the robot stopped. Its internal deep neural network had finished learning the relationship between the robot\u2019s motor actions and the volume it occupied in its environment. \u201cWe were really curious to see how the robot imagined itself,\u201d said Hod Lipson, professor of mechanical engineering and director of Columbia\u2019s Creative Machines Lab, where the work was done. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just peek into a neural network, it\u2019s a black box.\u201d After the researchers struggled with various visualization techniques, the self-image gradually emerged. \u201cIt was a sort of gently flickering cloud that appeared to engulf the robot\u2019s three-dimensional body,\u201d said Lipson. \u201cAs the robot moved, the flickering cloud gently followed it.\u201d The robot\u2019s self-model was accurate to about 1% of its workspace. A technical summary of the study. Credit: Columbia Engineering Self-modeling robots will lead to more self-reliant autonomous systems The ability of robots to model themselves without being assisted by engineers is important for many reasons: Not only does it save labor, but it also allows the robot to keep up with its own wear-and-tear, and even detect and compensate for damage. The authors argue that this ability is important as we need autonomous systems to be more self-reliant. A factory robot, for instance, could detect that something isn\u2019t moving right, and compensate or call for assistance. \u201cWe humans clearly have a notion of self,\u201d explained the study\u2019s first author Boyuan Chen, who led the work and is now an assistant professor at Duke University. \u201cClose your eyes and try to imagine how your own body would move if you were to take some action, such as stretch your arms forward or take a step backward. Somewhere inside our brain we have a notion of self, a self-model that informs us what volume of our immediate surroundings we occupy, and how that volume changes as we move.\u201d Self-awareness in robots The work is part of Lipson\u2019s decades-long quest to find ways to grant robots some form of self-awareness. \u201cSelf-modeling is a primitive form of self-awareness,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf a robot, animal, or human, has an accurate self-model, it can function better in the world, it can make better decisions, and it has an evolutionary advantage.\u201d The researchers are aware of the limits, risks, and controversies surrounding granting machines greater autonomy through self-awareness. Lipson is quick to admit that the kind of self-awareness demonstrated in this study is, as he noted, \u201ctrivial compared to that of humans, but you have to start somewhere. We have to go slowly and carefully, so we can reap the benefits while minimizing the risks.\u201d Reference: \u201cFully body visual self-modeling of robot morphologies\u201d by Boyuan Chen, Robert Kwiatkowski, Carl Vondrick and Hod Lipson, 13 July 2022, Science Robotics.

In the last few hours the self styled \u201cChief Twit\u201d) has tweeted a yes/no poll to his 112.4 million followers \u2014 pithily positing: \u201cBring back Vine?\u201d. The question \u2014 whether serious product idea or another Elon flight of fancy/\u2019trollercoaster\u2019 tweet \u2014 quickly drew millions of votes (most in favor) and thousands of responding tweets. This engagement in turn garnered a bit of additional attention from Musk who responded to some of his followers\u2019 questions/suggestions on the social video topic. In response to a tweet from YouTuber, Mr Beast \u2014 which jokily referenced TikTok \u2014 Musk struck a serious tone, asking: \u201cWhat could we do to make it better than TikTok?\u201d He also took the time to publicly agree with another Twitter user \u2014 who had chimed in to opine that \u201cvideo shouldn\u2019t be a separate app\u201d but should rather be \u201cwithin Twitter\u201d. That observation earned the \u2018Tesla Owners Silicon Valley\u2019 account an \u2018100\u2019 emoji reply from Musk, to signal (apparent) total approval of the idea that any Vine/video revival should be a feature inside Twitter, not a standalone product. So make of that what you will. The Vine revival poll (plus Musk\u2019s wider engagement to the chatter it generated) could imply his attention to the topic of video is, at least, genuine \u2014 although it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether a Vine reboot is actually being seriously considered, or what that would even mean beyond reviving a brand name if his plan would include a major feature set makeover. (Twitter\u2019s press team did not respond to requests for comment.) It\u2019s equally plausible Musk is doing the equivalent of throwing spaghetti at a wall and seeing which/if bits stick. Or he\u2019s just bored in the small hours and thought he\u2019d bounce another shower thought off-of his fanbase. And/or fancied indulging in a spot of \u2018lazy web\u2019 brainstorming outsourcing. As ever where Elon is concerned, the usual caveats apply. Still, Vine\u2019s demise was a pretty self-defeating chapter in Twitter\u2019s company history \u2014 so a reboot could offer Musk the chance to rewrite that particular bit of the script and claim incoming hero status with former Vine fans. Bring back Vine? \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 31, 2022 At the time of writing, more than 2.8M votes had been cast in Musk\u2019s poll about bringing back Vine, with a strong majority (69.4%) voting for a return \u2014 although the poll still has 14 hours left to run. Twitter acquired the short form video platform Twitter back in 2013. But, in typical clown car fashion, the company ended up squandering the opportunity to build the fledgling social video platform into a TikTok-style juggernaut, after then-CEO Jack Dorsey opted to ditch the app a few short years later. The shuttering of Vine earned Twitter the baldest of subtweets from Vine\u2019s founder, Rus Yusupov \u2014 who had this straight-up warning to other entrepreneurs at the time: \u201cDon\u2019t sell your company!\u201d Ironically enough (given it\u2019s *Twitter* that\u2019s now been sold), Yusupov has chipped into the Musk-initiated chatter around reviving Vine \u2014 offering up the (non-serious?) suggestion that Vine should have \u201c69 second videos\u201d. 69 second videos \u2014 Rus (@rus) October 31, 2022 While Vine launched with hyper short videos (of up to 6 seconds), the max upload length was later expanded to 140 seconds \u2014 and social video behemoth TikTok has gone way beyond that and even began letting its users upload videos of up to 10mins long earlier this year \u2014 so 69 second videos is probably just an attempt to grab Musk\u2019s attention (with a puerile joke), not a serious product suggestion. Regardless, the interaction does indicate that Yusupov is watching what\u2019s unfolding at Twitter with interest. And that\u2019s relevant because this is also not his first foray into tweeting at Musk about Vine: His public timeline remains topped with an earlier tweet \u2014 from April 25 \u2014 when he posted a photo of himself with the (then) would-be Twitter owner, asking Musk a (rhetorical?) question: \u201cHey @elonmusk was this meeting about saving Vine? I forget\u2026 \u201d Public response from Musk to that tweet there came none. But the Chief Twit is king of keeping everyone else guessing over what he\u2019s actually going to do next \u2014 so, again, you can\u2019t read much/anything into his public silence back then. (Musk did also try to wiggle out of buying Twitter entirely prior to agreeing to closing the deal last week; ergo, there have been a fair few cycles of ups and downs even just over these past few months.) Hey \u2066@elonmusk\u2069 was this meeting about saving Vine? I forget\u2026. pic.twitter.com/FgmxIfS8Vx \u2014 Rus (@rus) April 25, 2022 If Yusupov and Musk have been talking about a Vine reboot, the former\u2019s response to another Twitter user\u2019s question last month \u2014 when author Eli Pariser asked the Twitterverse for \u201cthe smart take on why Vine died even though it was basically TikTok\u201d \u2014 might offer a few clues about what any discussions might have focused on. The Vine founder responded to Pariser by lamenting over not having built the right features \u201cin time\u201d \u2014 likely linked to another blindspot he conceded around not understanding the importance of building on trends like lip-sync video \u2014 as well as blaming the app\u2019s demise on a failure to help creators monetize.", "techcrunch158": "AgriWebb is on a mission to help livestock producers feed the world efficiently, profitably and sustainably by providing its comprehensive, ground-truth database for beef production worldwide. The Australian startup, which builds a livestock management platform for ranchers and farmers, wants to digitize farm records and the meat production process from the cow to the consumer and drive the industry\u2019s animal and environmental welfare transparency. The startup said today it has raised another $6.8 million of funding led by Germin8 Ventures and iSelect Fund. In total, AgriWebb has raised $27 million in Series B and about $29.3 million since its inception in 2014. It did not disclose its valuation when asked. Its app allows users to visualize their operations and give insights on animals and grazing, including the best grass location and which animals gain weight. On top of that, it lets ranchers improve their sustainable land management for better profits and leverage the on-farm data they\u2019re recording to make more intelligent business decisions, according to the company. AgriWebb claims more than 16,000 farmers and ranchers globally are using its cloud-based platform and managing approximately 19 million animals on over 136 million acres of grazing land across the globe, including Australia, the U.S. and the U.K. The global beef market is estimated at $500 billion, but the pure farm management software market in its core geographies is estimated at around $3.5 billion, the company executive chairman Justin Webb told TechCrunch. AgriWebb\u2019s key markets include Australia \u2014 where more than 15% of the national herd is managed using its platform \u2014 the U.K. and the U.S. Additionally, AgriWebb has partnerships in Brazil and South Africa, Webb said. Unlike most competitors who act as a point solution focused on one or two areas of farm management, AgriWebb\u2019s platform brings together animal management, grazing management and team communication; task and compliance management; and daily record-keeping in one place, Webb explained. \u201cIts grazing insights enable ranchers to maximize productivity, eliminate waste, and validate grazing and animal management decisions in a way that other record-keeping systems can\u2019t touch,\u201d Webb pointed out. Webb founded AgriWebb with John Fargher (chief revenue officer) and Kevin Baum (chief executive officer) in 2014. In Australia, the three founders discovered that farmers were not only interested in the advantages of technology but were also desperately cobbling their own solutions with scrappy spreadsheets and notebooks. \u201cLivestock producers deserve better technology to help them maximize their business and consumers need more reliable provenance for the animal and environmental welfare of their food,\u201d Webb said. \u201cAgriWebb has always been about serving the farmers, and this round of funding doesn\u2019t change our mission; it simply magnifies it.\u201d The latest funding will be used for the international expansion of AgriWebb to ranchers and farmers in the U.S., the U.K., and Latin America, both directly and via partnerships. AgriWebb has secured customers in 28 of the 50 states since its U.S. launch in 2021 and plans to continue rapidly expanding. In addition, the latest funding will enable the company to establish its database. Apart from the funding, AgriWebb recently joined two project proposals to the USDA CSC program, one led by American Farmland Trust and the other by Farm Journal\u2019s Trust in Food initiative, Webb said. Both aim to improve the U.S. beef supply chain\u2019s climate footprint and scale regenerative agriculture practices, Webb continued. One project is focused on improving transparency in the beef supply chain and understanding the GHG impact of different practices; the second aims to scale the adoption of practices through payments for practice changes. \u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that agriculture is at odds with climate, but the importance of sustainability and implementing sustainable practices is far from lost on farmers and producers,\u201d Webb said. \u201cIn fact, the long-term sustainability and viability of their land are of utmost importance. Talk to any landholder and you\u2019ll understand their long-term goal is to pass on their land in better condition to the next generation. Sustainable and regenerative practices can and do exist in tandem with productive and profitable farms, and we remain steadfast in our endeavor to support producers now and in the future through data that measures, manages and improves the sustainability of the food supply chain from farm to plate.\u201d The company raised its first Series B from investors, including Telus Ventures, Grosvenor Food & AgTech and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in January 2021. \u201cAgriWebb fits with Germin8\u2019s thesis to invest in the full-stack enterprise software companies within AgTech that bring essential enterprise value to farmers in alignment with practices that are sustainable,\u201d said managing partner at Germin8 Ventures Michael Lavin. \u201cThere are very few software offerings capable of accelerating the regenerative agriculture practices our climate stands to benefit from, and even fewer that target livestock production rather than being at odds with it.\u201d", "techcrunch159": "AgBiome, developing products from microbial communities, brought in a $116 million Series D round as the company prepares to pad its pipeline with new products. The company, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., was co-founded in 2012 by a group including co-CEOs Scott Uknes and Eric Ward, who have known each other for over 30 years. They created the Genesis discovery platform to capture diverse microbes for agricultural applications, like crop protection, and screen the strains for the best assays that would work for insect, disease and nematode control. \u201cThe microbial world is immense,\u201d said Uknes, who explained that there is estimated to be a trillion microbes, but only 1% have been discovered. The microbes already discovered are used by humans for things like pharmaceuticals, food and agriculture. AgBiome built its database in Genesis to house over 100,000 microbes and every genome in every microbe was sequenced into hundreds of strains. The company randomly selects strains and looks for the best family of strains with a certain activity, like preventing fungus on strawberries, and creates the product. Its first fungicide product, Howler, was launched last year and works on more than 300 crop-disease combinations. The company saw 10x sales growth in 2020, Uknes told TechCrunch. As part of farmers\u2019 integrated pest program, they often spray fungicide applications 12 times per year in order to yield fruits and vegetables. Due to its safer formula, Howler can be used as the last spray in the program, and its differentiator is a shorter re-entry period \u2014 farmers can spray in the morning and be able to go back out in the field in the afternoon. It also has a shorter pre-harvest time of four hours after application. Other fungicides on the market today require seven days before re-entry and pre-harvest, Uknes explained. AgBiome aims to add a second fungicide product, Theia, in early 2022, while a third, Esendo was submitted for Environmental Protection Agency registration. Uknes expects to have 11 products, also expanding into insecticides and herbicides, by 2025. The oversubscribed Series D round was co-led by Blue Horizon and Novalis LifeSciences and included multiple new and existing investors. The latest investment gives AgBiome over $200 million in total funding to date. The company\u2019s last funding round was a $65 million Series C raised in 2018. While competitors in synthetic biology often sell their companies to someone who can manufacture their products, Uknes said AgBiome decided to manufacture and commercialize the products itself, something he is proud of his team for being able to do. \u201cWe want to feed the world responsibly, and these products have the ability to substitute for synthetic chemicals and provide growers a way to protect their crops, especially as consumers want natural, sustainable tools,\u201d he added. The company has grown to over 100 employees and will use the new funding to accelerate production of its two new products, building out its manufacturing capacity in North America and expanding its footprint internationally. Uknes anticipates growing its employee headcount to 300 in the next five years. AgBiome anticipates rolling up some smaller companies that have a product in production to expand its pipeline in addition to its organic growth. As a result, Uknes said he was particular about the kind of investment partners that would work best toward that goal. Przemek Obloj, managing partner at Blue Horizon, was introduced to the company by existing investors. His firm has an impact fund focused on the future of food and began investing in alternative proteins in 2016 before expanding that to delivery systems in agriculture technology, he said. Obloj said AgBiome is operating in a $60 billion market where the problems include products that put toxic chemicals into the ground that end up in water systems. While the solution would be to not do that, not doing that would mean produce doesn\u2019t grow as well, he added. The change in technology in agriculture is enabling Uknes and Ward to do something that wasn\u2019t possible 10 years ago because there was not enough compute or storage power to discover and sequence microbes. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to pollute the Earth, but we have to find a way to feed 9 billion people by 2050,\u201d Obloj said. \u201cWith AgBiome, there is an alternative way to protect crops than by polluting the Earth or having health risks.\u201d", "other news sites160": "Ninety percent of American adults don\u2019t eat enough fruits and vegetables, opting for fast food and processed foods instead. Cost, flavor, and convenience are all factors in this imbalance, but as health statistics show, we should be working harder to reverse our dietary trends. A startup called PairWise is out to help change the way we eat by making fruits and vegetables more appealing. The company is zeroing in on traits that may deter people from consuming produce and tweaking those traits using CRISPR gene editing. Their hope is that the resulting products will not only pique consumers\u2019 interest, but keep them healthy and keep them coming back. Tom Adams, PairWise cofounder and CEO, shared details about the company and its products in an interview. CRISPR\u2019d Produce CRISPR was first used to edit bacterial DNA in 2012. Since then, scientists have used the tool to edit the genomes of crops, animals, and even humans, and have begun testing it as a means of curing inherited conditions from blindness to muscular dystrophy and other genetic diseases. CRISPR is made up of a synthesized sequence of guide RNA that matches a target DNA sequence\u2014that is, the portion of DNA to be altered\u2014and a Cas enzyme. Once in a cell\u2019s nucleus, the guide RNA links up with the target DNA sequence. The Cas enzyme cuts the DNA at that point, and the cell repairs the cut. The repairs can either knock out a gene, inactivating it, or insert a new sequence. Modifying a gene that encodes for a given trait either eliminates or alters that trait; in the case of fruits and vegetables, say, the bitterness of mustard greens or the seeds in blackberries. Given that the genomes of PairWise products are modified, some consumers may want to know whether the fruits and vegetables are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The short answer is no. The USDA doesn\u2019t regulate gene-edited plants as long as their traits could have occurred through traditional breeding methods or a whim of nature. The CRISPR technique PairWise uses involves manipulating genes that exist naturally in a given species\u2019 genome. \u201cThe changes PairWise has made in our greens are no different than what can be achieved through conventional breeding, contain no foreign DNA, and therefore are not considered GMOs,\u201d Adams said. GMOs, on the other hand, can contain genes from other species, and wouldn\u2019t come about naturally even after decades of traditional breeding. Bt crops, for example, are engineered to contain a natural form of pesticide derived from bacteria, which means they don\u2019t need to be sprayed with chemical pesticides. Adams pointed out that the anti-GMO sentiment out there isn\u2019t necessarily about resistance to the technology itself. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons GMOs may be less popular, and one of them is that people didn\u2019t feel there was transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the products that fall under the category GMO are things that get added to foods as ingredients, and nobody knew when they were getting it and when they weren\u2019t, and it created this stigma.\u201d He wants PairWise to take a more proactive and transparent approach. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very clear about the processes we\u2019re using to create the products, and it\u2019s your choice whether you like the benefits or you\u2019re worried about the technology,\u201d he said. Next-Gen Produce The first product PairWise will bring to market is a milder-tasting version of mustard greens. \u201cAlmost four years ago, we were searching for things we could do that were amenable to the technology but also were addressing a consumer need,\u201d Adams said. The company\u2019s market research found that people often ended up buying romaine lettuce even after saying they\u2019d prefer kale or another green because of their greater nutritional value. \u201cPeople want healthy salads, but they keep buying romaine because they\u2019re used to the flavor,\u201d Adams said. Ease of preparation is a factor too. Mustard greens, Adams told me, are a relative of kale, but they taste like horseradish when you bite into them. Two components come together that react and cause the horseradish flavor. PairWise used CRISPR-Cas12a to edit the green\u2019s genome and remove one of those components. \u201cIt\u2019s really just removing something that the plant doesn\u2019t need for survival and doesn\u2019t contribute to the nutritional benefits,\u201d Adams said. The mustard greens have already been approved by the FDA and will start being sold in California and the Pacific Northwest in early 2023 under the brand Conscious Foods. The company\u2019s not stopping there, though; they have multiple fruit and veggie improvement projects underway. One is a softer version of kale. If you\u2019ve ever made a kale salad from the stuff that comes still on the stalk, you know it\u2019s labor-intensive: there\u2019s the washing, the de-stemming, the chopping, the massaging\u2026 (that\u2019s right, massaging!). PairWise kale will retain all of the leafy green\u2019s nutritional properties, but have a texture more like lettuce, making it easier to prepare and eat. Another is seedless berries, including blackberries and raspberries. Hate how those tiny seeds get stuck in your teeth, always in the hardest-to-reach places? CRISPR to the rescue. One of the company\u2019s most intriguing projects, in my opinion, is pitless cherries. \u201cI love cherries, but they\u2019re a pain to eat,\u201d Adams said. \u201cYour fingers are all red when you\u2019re done with a few of them, and if there\u2019s not a trash can nearby you don\u2019t know what to do with the pit.\u201d I asked him how it\u2019s possible to grow a cherry\u2014or any other stone fruit, like plums, peaches, or apricots\u2014without the pit, as it connects to the fruit\u2019s stem and is its lifeline to the tree. \u201cIt\u2019s easiest to think about it like a seedless grape,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually still has a seed in it, but the seed has lost its hard outer shell. There\u2019s still that nutritious plant embryo that\u2019s normally protected by the shell, we\u2019re just making it so it\u2019s all edible.\u201d If they succeed, eating pitless cherries will be a different experience altogether; isn\u2019t having to remove the pit the only thing keeping us from stuffing handfuls of the scrumptious fruit into our mouths at once? A Whole New Plant When it comes to cherries, it\u2019s not just the end product PairWise is focusing on. Currently 90 percent of sweet cherries are grown in Washington state, where there\u2019s little to no rain in the summer. The fruit is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and can only thrive in a dry climate; this specificity and the fact that the fruit needs to be shipped from the far northwest corner of the country pushes up its price. But what if cherries could grow in, say, Michigan, or Kansas, or Vermont? \u201cWe think we understand the genetics well enough that we could modify the architecture of the tree so that it\u2019s more like a blueberry bush,\u201d Adams said. \u201cAnd then you can grow them in more environments and put them at less risk.\u201d PairWise is also trying to alter the way blackberries grow. The moisture sensitivity has already been taken care of by nature, as has the bush-not-tree situation\u2014but the bushes have thorns, and thorns make fruit hard to harvest. The company is working on cutting out the thorns. Here\u2019s an idea: blueberry-sized cherries without a pit that grow on bushes without thorns in any climate. Seems like a product that would need a whole new name, and heck if I have any suggestions. (Not to mention, it probably wouldn\u2019t occur naturally no matter how many generations you waited.) Getting Healthier Be it softer kale, pitless cherries, or thornless bushes, PairWise\u2019s mission is to create a healthier world by taking away barriers to eating fresh produce. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in anything that moves the needle on the fact that only 10 percent of Americans eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t change very much just by telling people they should eat more of them. Our idea is, you need to take down the barriers.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a noble aim. But how likely is engineered produce to play an instrumental role in changing consumers\u2019 habits, or in attracting a previously-veggie-averse demographic? People who already buy and eat kale on a regular basis may opt for a smoother kale 2.0, but people who have never bought kale may not be so easily swayed by a newfangled version of the green. Adams believes there\u2019s a consumer base out there who will benefit from products like PairWise\u2019s. \u201cThere are people who are looking for a healthy lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re looking for something different in salads. We\u2019re coming in with a new category: a nutritious green that still tastes good.\u201d Physical traits of produce may be one barrier that deters people from buying them, but cost is equally important (if not more so). With years of research and development going into CRISPR\u2019d produce, my assumption was that it won\u2019t be affordable. Ten dollars for a bag of lettuce-like kale? No thanks. Not the case, according to Adams. \u201cThere\u2019s a fairly wide range of pricing within the salad space. We expect to be in the top quartile of the pricing, but we\u2019re not going to be above it,\u201d he said. Production of PairWise greens, he added, is actually quite cost-competitive with other types of salad greens. Based on marketing activation events the company ran over the summer in Seattle, Austin, and Palo Alto, the outlook for their first product looks pretty rosy. They gave away bags of salad (which were clearly labeled as being gene-edited) consisting of red- and green-leaf mustard greens, and asked people to complete a short survey about it. Adams estimated that more than 6,000 people tried the salads, and over 90 percent responded that they were \u201cvery motivated\u201d or \u201csomewhat motivated\u201d to buy the product. A New Green Revolution? Helping people make healthier dietary choices is just one benefit that CRISPR could bring to produce. Its possibilities are wide-ranging, as evidenced by PairWise\u2019s work to create fruit trees that can grow in different climates and yield food that\u2019s easier to harvest. It\u2019s not unlike Norman Borlaug\u2019s work back in the 1940s to create a high-yield wheat seed that was resistant to stem rust\u2014a project that ended up saving millions of people from hunger and famine. The difference is that technology has taken over the painstaking, time-consuming steps Borlaug had to slog through, like pollinating and inspecting thousands of plants by hand (a hundred and ten thousand in just one growing season! Talk about labor-intensive). Adams sees PairWise\u2019s work similarly and believes CRISPR holds all sorts of possibilities for a new frontier of engineered foods. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the same thing as traditional plant breeders, but it\u2019s just faster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could create a lot more resilience for the whole food system.\u201d Image Credit: Anrita from Pixabay", "other news sites161": "Chipotle Mexican Grill is moving one step closer to having a robot make its tortilla chips. The burrito chain said Tuesday that it will test \"Chippy,\" an autonomous kitchen assistant made by Miso Robotics, next month in a restaurant in Fountain Valley, California. Chipotle has already tested Chippy's ability to make and season its tortilla chips with salt and lime at its headquarters' innovation hub in Irvine, California. Like the rest of its new tech and menu items, the company is relying on its \"stage-gate process\" to test and learn from workers and customers to decide how to roll out the technology nationwide. Today, workers at Chipotle restaurants fry and season the chips, which can be time consuming. Restaurants and retailers have been testing robotics and automation to speed up operations and reduce menial tasks for workers. Starbucks recently unveiled new systems for more efficiently making cold coffee drinks, brewing drip coffee and serving food. Elsewhere, Panera Bread and McDonald's have been testing automated drive-thru ordering to cut down service times, while White Castle and Buffalo Wild Wings also are testing Miso Robotics' technology. In addition to the Chippy restaurant test, Chipotle said it's piloting a new kitchen management system that uses machine learning to predict demand for its ingredients in order to improve freshness and minimize food waste. The system designed by PreciTaste is being tested at eight restaurants in Orange County. And in Cleveland, the company said 73 of its restaurants are piloting location-based technology to improve its mobile app. The program is meant to help customers and delivery drivers know when orders are ready, if they're at the wrong location and to scan loyalty QR codes.

The company helps farmers mitigate all sorts of risks, from extreme weather events to diseases that affect various crops. It is both a hardware and software play with a forecasting service that you can access through a subscription product. Weather forecasting is a complicated industry as it requires a ton of data to create an accurate forecasting model. That\u2019s why Sencrop is drawing inspiration from Netatmo or Waze and betting on crowdsourcing to improve its service. Sencrop customers can buy their own connected stations to measure temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed and sunlight. These weather stations all contribute to Sencrop\u2019s real-time data. And it\u2019s been working well as the company has already sold over 20,000 weather stations. In France, there\u2019s one weather station per 20 square kilometers on average. The company operates in 20 countries and has office in France, the Netherlands, the U.K., Germany, Spain and Italy. Customers can see current weather conditions and export historical data. But they can also move around the map, set up alerts and select between multiple forecasting models to prepare for the next few days and anticipate agronomic risks. Sencrop can help you when it comes to water stress and irrigation management as well. There are multiple subscription levels that let you access more features. Sencrop also provides multiple integrations with Decision Support Tools, such as Rimpro, VitiMeteo, fruitweb, 360 viti and Idroplan. This metric-driven way of growing fruits, cereals or vines should lead to better productivity and an improvement on the bottom line.

It\u2019s a big category that\u2019s going to require a number of solutions to various problems, though lately it\u2019s been hit by a number of false starts. Abundant Robotics, for instance, went under, only to be resurrected by a new brand currently exploring the equity crowdfunding route. Meanwhile, strawberry-picking Traptic quite literally took itself out of the field, getting snapped up by Bowery for vertical farming applications. Founded in 2018, East Bay-based Verdant Robotics has raised $21.5 million to date, including an $11.5 million Series A, back in 2019. The firm appears to be casting its net fairly wide, though it\u2019s starting specifically with carrot crops, offering up its system through a RaaS (robotics as a service) model to select farmers. The model seems to make the most sense for these systems \u2014 at least during the early stages. Likely most important to a company like Verdant is getting as many of its robotic systems as possible out to farms for real-world testing and data collection.

Weeks after withdrawing e-commerce sites from the UK, Spain and Austria, Rakuten is putting an undisclosed sum into seven-year-old Telefarm, which operates a platform that promotes organic farmers in Japan. Most notably, Telefarm connects consumers with organic farmers and their produce, while it also helps with processes such as storage, transportation, manufacturing, and even the hiring of farm workers. It\u2019s an interesting move for Rakuten, which is best known for its online shopping empire in Japan, where it has also expanding into financial, a mobile service and more. Rakuten\u2019s presence outside of Japan has been less successful. While it has invested in a range of U.S. companies including Lyft and Pinterest, and it has acquired firms like chat app Viber, video platform Viki, and U.S. coupon site Ebates, the company has withdrawn from less lucrative regions as part of a new strategy. Organic farming, or organic products, could be a part of that new focus in Japan. Rakuten said that this invest in Telefarm would lead to it launching new products in its domestic market. With the working population in the agricultural industry steadily declining, coupled with Japan\u2019s aging population, labor shortages in the industry are becoming a serious problem, and the amount of deserted arable land is increasing every year. Farmers are facing serious challenges, with initial investment and unstable revenues posing obstacles for new farmers, and the securement of stable sales channels and a shortage of successors presenting challenges for established, small-scale farmers. Going forward, Rakuten will explore the development of new services in the agriculture field through the internet, while aiming to contribute to regional revitalization through the utilization of deserted arable land and support for new farmers. Beyond scaling back parts of its global business, Rakuten recently embraced drones \u2014 running its first trial on a golf course \u2014 and earlier this month it struck an agreement to bring a selection of premium Japanese goods to China via Kaola, the cross-border e-commerce service operated by Chinese internet giant NetEase.", "techcrunch165": "New data from Carta indicates that valuations for very early-stage startups are holding up better than we might have expected in the current slowdown.

In a world where under-watering has far more damaging results than over-watering, a non-tech-enabled farmer may be tempted to keep the soil wetter than it needs to \u2014 wasting a tremendous amount of precious water in the process. By carefully measuring the plants, and pairing their status with weather and soil data, it can give very precise watering needs. The company just raised $27 million to continue fertilizing and watering its own growth trajectory. When the agricultural revolution happened 12,000 years ago, farmers started tracking how crops grew based on various weather patterns and broad-stroke variability in weather forecasting, etc. A lot of these patterns are being disrupted by climate change. \u201cThe ability to make decisions based on seasonality of the weather is literally getting lost \u2014 that\u2019s where we come in. By sensing the plant we can identify exactly what it needs regardless of the season,\u201d explains Ori Ben Ner, CEO, and founder at SupPlant, who is a third-generation farmer. He admits that his grandfather \u2014 who is 91 this year and still grows onions, watermelons and corn \u2014 would barely recognize what he does as farming. The company has two products: a software-only solution and a hardware-and-software product. The hardware product measures one plant per 25 acres or so, and uses this data to extrapolate the needs of all the crops in the field. The solution uses five different sensors \u2014 deep soil, shallow soil, trunk, leaf and fruit. Each of the sensors feeds data into an algorithm, which also takes into consideration weather patterns, weather forecasts, soil information and other proprietary data, to give advice about how to water crops strategically over the next 10 to 14 days. \u201cWe learned the specific patterns of the trunk and \u2014 later on the season \u2014 of the fruit itself through tweaking the irrigation recommendations that we\u2019re giving. Our system learns the optimal patterns and irrigation regimes. It keeps the plant and fruit on the maximized growth pattern that the plant is capable of,\u201d explains Ben Ner. \u201cFrom there, it starts to get into specifics of their specific regimes to increase sugar levels. For wine grape growers, for example, you want to stress the plant at a certain time, three weeks from now, to encourage the plant to accumulate sugar. The more sugar in the grape, the better the wine. Basically, the end result is dramatic enhancements of yields. Our main goal is to increase and enhance produce, but the byproduct is that we save a lot of water.\u201d The company closed a $27 million round led by Red Dot Capital, with participation from strategic philanthropy investors Menomadin Foundation, Smart Agro Fund, Maor Investments and others. The round brings SupPlants\u2019s total funding to date to more than $46 million. The company currently has 70 or so employees and is planning to grow to more than 100 this year. In addition to the hardware-based product, the company recently launched an API product, a sensor-less technology that has served 500,000 maize farmers in Kenya over the last season. SupPlant is making its technology available to these smallholder farmers by changing the basic concept of irrigation methods. The new technology is designed for the world\u2019s 450 million small growers. In 2022, SupPlant\u2019s aim is to get more than a million African and Indian smallholders on its platform. \u201cAfter a couple of years on the market, and with tens of thousands of sensors deployed, we have millions of irrigation events, covering more than 33 crops, with over 200 varieties in any geography you can imagine, and in every climate condition you can imagine. So the fundamental value of the product today is the fact that we own the most unique database of irrigation on Earth. The hardware will be an enabler for that,\u201d explains Ben Ner. Obviously, the hardware solution is more accurate than software alone, but as the company gathers more and more data, it is able to extrapolate how various crops will perform. \u201cOur main markets \u2014 that is, where most of the sales teams are located \u2014 are Australia, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina. We are just on the verge after a super successful proof-of-concept, of signing 100% of the dates in UAE. That comprises 2.1 million trees. Our solution enables the UAE to save 70% of its water consumption. The amount that we are able to save per tree is the consumption of 10 people in the Emirates \u2014 one of the aridest places on Earth.\u201d Update: A previous version of this article listed total funds raised at $45 million. That has been corrected to $46 million.", "other news sites167": "In 1931, Winston Churchill predicted the rise of animal-free food. Then an opposition MP in his wilderness years, Churchill wrote an essay that imagined life in 50 years\u2019 time. \u201cSynthetic food will, of course, be used in the future,\u201d he wrote. The artificial stuff would \u201cbe practically indistinguishable from the natural products, and any changes will be so gradual as to escape observation,\u201d Churchill wrote. \u201cMicrobes, which at present convert the nitrogen of the air into proteins by which animals live, will be fostered and made to work under controlled conditions just as yeast is now.\u201d Though several decades later than envisaged, Churchill\u2019s prediction has been borne out by the development of lab-grown meat and, more recently, animal-free dairy products. Synthetic milk has emerged as a new potential alternative to cow\u2019s milk, one that \u2013 unlike plant-based oat, nut and soy milks \u2013 purports to replicate its taste, appearance and mouthfeel. Described by experts as the future of milk, it has been touted as an environmentally friendly option that may shake up the dairy industry \u2013 and leave small-scale farmers in the lurch. \u201cLab-grown milk is considered the next food frontier,\u201d says Dr Diana Bogueva, of Curtin University\u2019s Sustainability Policy Institute, citing the growing popularity of dairy alternatives. Compared with dairy production, synthetic milk is likely to have a smaller carbon footprint and cause less pollution, and obviously eliminates animal welfare concerns, she says. The industry is expanding rapidly. In the US, cow-free dairy proteins produced by the firm Perfect Day are now widely used in products including ice-cream, cream cheese, chocolate and protein powders. Another American startup, New Culture, is commercialising a synthetic milk-based mozzarella, while the Israeli firm Remilk has set up a giant facility in Denmark to produce cheese, yoghurt and ice-cream. It will be some time before cow-free milk arrives in Australian supermarkets, but startups such as All G Foods and the CSIRO spin-off company Eden Brew are racing to bring products to market within the next two years. Yeast of Eden Chemically, milk is mostly water \u2013 about 87%, to be precise. Milk solids comprise the rest: fats, proteins, sugars \u2013 primarily lactose \u2013 and minerals. By Australian law, at least 3.2% of the liquid in full-cream milk must be fat and another 3% protein. Most synthetic dairy companies are focusing on producing milk proteins using a process known as precision fermentation. It involves genetically programming yeast or other microorganisms using synthetic DNA to produce a specific protein. Jim Fader, the co-founder of Eden Brew, compares the process to beer brewing. \u201cWe use yeast to make a protein to make a drink. They use yeast to make alcohol to make a drink,\u201d he says. There are at least 20 proteins in cow\u2019s milk, about 80% of which are casein proteins, found in the curds; the rest are whey proteins, perhaps most familiar as a component of powdered protein shakes. Aggregates of casein, known as micelles, give milk its characteristic appearance and heat stability. \u201cThe micelle plays a fundamental role in many parts of milk,\u201d Fader says. \u201cFor example, when it binds with calcium, it makes the milk look white. If you want to froth your milk and put it in your cappuccino, the ability for the milk to withstand that heat and the bubbles to be able to form \u2026 is also down to the micelle.\u201d Synthetic milk technology is \u2018less about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairy\u2019 but \u2018augmenting supply\u2019, Jim Fader says. Photograph: Reuters Eden Brew is producing six proteins that are most abundant in milk. Once brewed, these will be purified and dried. A key investor in the firm is the New South Wales dairy cooperative Norco, which will be responsible for rehydrating and blending the proteins. At this stage, other components such as minerals and coconut-based fat will be added. The end product will be lactose-free, with a small quantity of table sugar used to approximate the sweetness of cow\u2019s milk. Fader says the firm will launch an ice-cream \u2013 simpler than milk because it can be made with just two proteins \u2013 around December next year. Milk will follow, likely in August 2024. All G Foods is focusing its efforts on whey proteins. The firm\u2019s plant-based meat products are already served in commercial burger chains and sold in some supermarkets. The company\u2019s chief scientific officer, Jared Raynes, says the ultimate goal is to produce yoghurts, cheese and fresh milk. But the firm\u2019s focus for now is on beta-lactoglobulin, the main protein in whey. \u201cWe are going to be applying for regulatory approval with our protein powder,\u201d he says. Parallels with synthetic fabrics Milena Bojovic, who is completing a PhD at Macquarie University, says while the promise of cow-free fresh milk has been widely trumpeted, the impact of synthetic dairy is likely to be greater on products such as milk powder. \u201cFresh milk consumption is on the decline,\u201d she says and consumers may be wary of drinking a synthetic version of a natural product. She points out that traditional dairy production is also \u201cvery much technologically mitigated, from conception to the birth of calves to the milking process\u201d. \u201cIf synthetic milk really takes off, the biggest disruption I think will be if it can be powdered and used in the ingredients space \u2026 as an additive like milk solids, which is in a lot of processed foods,\u201d Bojovic says. \u201cI don\u2019t think most consumers are questioning where the milk solids in their KitKat came from.\u201d \u201cIf and possibly when that happens, that will be one of the major disruptions for dairy industries that are producing exclusively for export in the form of powdered milk.\u201d Bojovic, who has analysed global dairy trends as part of her research, is concerned that technological advances may leave farmers behind. Large dairy players such as Norco and Fonterra, a New Zealand multinational cooperative, have begun to invest in synthetic protein production. \u201cSmall-scale operations are really going to struggle in the context of global dairy consolidation,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s more pressure on farmers to innovate and also to invest in technology to make sure that they\u2019re at the standard that bigger corporates are at.\u201d Bojovic sees parallels with the rise of synthetic fabrics. \u201cWhen synthetic fibres hit the market, that decimated the wool industry in a lot of regions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time that farmers have been faced with the threat of synthetics, but they\u2019ve adapted, they\u2019ve innovated.\u201d Melissa Cameron, Dairy Australia\u2019s human health and nutrition policy manager, says it is yet to be seen how consumers will respond to a synthetic product. She points to statistics suggesting that 58% of Australian households exclusively buy fresh and long-life cow\u2019s milk. \u201cPeople are not abandoning dairy,\u201d she says. \u201cThe commercialisation of synthetic proteins and products to a scale that makes these products available widely to consumers is yet quite a while off. As our populations grow around the world, synthetic products will deliver complementary protein and products. There will be room for all.\u201d Dairy demand worldwide grew by 36% between 2007 and 2017 and is expected to keep rising as the world\u2019s population increases and per-capita consumption grows. Fader says the technology that companies such as Eden Brew are developing is \u201cless about trying to displace cows everywhere from dairy\u201d. Rather, \u201cit\u2019s about augmenting the current supply because demand is forecast to go up by so much\u201d.", "techcrunch168": "Agtech startup Source.ag today announced it harvested a $10 million investment to make greenhouses smarter. The founders have set their eyes on a horizon where, driven by climate change and a rapid increase in global food demand as population continues to increase, more crops are being forced indoors to secure greater crop yields. You wouldn\u2019t believe the amount of restraint it takes to not make a pun about seed funding in a piece about greenhouses. I have no such restraint, so let\u2019s report on this, ahem, growth industry. The $10 million funding round was led by Acre Venture Partners, with participation from the E14 fund and food-focused venture firm Astanor ventures. The company also raised from industry insiders, including the international association of (mostly) salad growers Harvest House, tomato specialists Agrocare and bell pepper specialists Rainbow Growers. The company is developing software to empower greenhouses to get smarter. The company argues that greenhouse agriculture is a safer, more reliable and more climate-resilient mode of food production, producing up to 15 times higher yields, using a twentieth as much water as traditional agriculture. What Source adds to the mix is the ability to use data and AI to help greenhouses operate at even higher levels of efficiency and repeatability of high-yield harvests. \u201cClimate change is driving substantial scarcity and strains in our global food supply. As this accelerates in the coming years, we must find ways to scale efficient growing solutions that lighten the footprint of agriculture,\u201d said Lucas Mann, managing partner at Acre. \u201cGreenhouse agriculture is a proven and viable solution, but without innovation, demand will be impossible to meet. We believe Source.ag can play a vital role in driving its global scalability.\u201d The funding will be used to accelerate product development and expand commercial collaborations. \u201cGreenhouses come in all shapes and forms \u2014 both more and less technically advanced. On the higher-tech side, want to have control over every dimension you can imagine, including humidity, irrigation and nutrition. Tomatoes, for example, don\u2019t grow in soil. They go in substrate slabs. That means that these operations are arable land independent,\u201d explains Rien Kamman, co-founder ad CEO at Source. \u201cBecause you have more control, you\u2019ll have to make more decisions every day. Growers are making decisions on 60-70 parameters every day, which influences how this crop will grow for the rest of the season. You need to get the decision right every day. This might include what to feed the plant, plant-specific parameters, pruning, etc. It\u2019s really a craft and this is why it\u2019s still so hard. You need decades of experience to be doing well at it.\u201d The complexity of the farming operation itself isn\u2019t in doubt, and Source\u2019s pitch is to take all of these growth parameters, combine that with historical crop yield data and market pricing etc., to create a better experience for the growers. \u201cOur system is comprised of two aspects. One is a recommendation system that assesses the current state of the plant. It looks at forward-looking predictors like resource prices, weather, etc. And then gives very concrete recommendations to the grower. What should you do today and tomorrow, both on the plant (i.e. how should you trim it, prune it, etc.) and on the indoor climate around the plants to maximize sustainability and production. The second part is what happens when something doesn\u2019t go to plan? This is where the algorithms come in,\u201d Kamman says. \u201cThey collaborate with the different control systems to take that strategy and actually make sure to do so implemented in the most efficient way possible.\u201d Indoor farming still requires a fair chunk of manual labor, especially for big-vine crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, etc.; but Source suggests that it can be helpful there, too \u2014 by choosing how and where to prune or how many crops to leave to ripen on the vine, you can affect various aspects of the plants\u2019 growth. The interesting thing is overlaying real-time pricing data here \u2014 by speeding up or slowing down ripening, I can imagine that could potentially time the harvest time around when your competitors have ripe products, potentially even trading lower yields for better prices, or working with temperatures and weather conditions to reduce production costs, for example. The company is running on a SaaS model, charging growers on a sliding scale depending on the amount of space they are using for growing. \u201cOur belief is that agriculture is at an inflection point in history. [Farming] that brought us to where we are today won\u2019t bring us to 10 billion people with a more changing extreme climate. This is a massive market \u2014 the need for climate-resilient food systems is going to increase. And then we haven\u2019t even talked about what other traditional agriculture crops could be moved indoors in the next decades,\u201d says Kamman. \u201cI think that what unites our investors and our team is that we\u2019re not so much looking at these advantages short term, but we can build knowledge that is scalable globally.\u201d The company declined to share screenshots of its product, stating it was \u201ccompetitively sensitive\u201d.", "techcrunch169": "Fermentation has a long, rich history in food production, from beer and wine to yogurt and cheese, leavened bread and coffee, miso and tempeh, sauerkraut and kimchi, to name just a few of the tasty things we can consume thanks to a chemical process thought to date back to the Neolithic period. But if this 2017-founded Finnish startup, Solar Foods, has its way, fermentation could have a very special place in the future of human food too. The industrial biotech startup is working on bringing a novel protein to market \u2014 one it says will offer a nutritious, sustainable alternative to animal-derived proteins. The product, a single-cell protein it\u2019s branding Solein, is essentially an edible bacteria; a single-cell microbe grown using gas fermentation. Or, put another way, they\u2019re harvesting edible calories from hydrogen-oxyidizing microbes. \u201cTechnically it\u2019s like a brewery,\u201d explains CEO and co-founder Dr. Pasi Vainikka in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cLike fermentation technologies are. It\u2019s not that strange [a process] \u2014 there is this one difference, which is the feedstock.\u201d The production of Solein requires just a handful of \u2018ingredients\u2019: Air, water and energy (electricity) \u2014 which means there\u2019s no need for vast tracts of agricultural land to be given out to making this future foodstuff. It could be produced in factories located in remote areas or inside cities and urban centers. Nor indeed are other foods needed to feed it to create an adequate yield, as is the case with rearing livestock for human consumption. So the promise looks immense. (As Vainikka argues: \u201cLand use and energy use are the two main problems of human kind \u2014 and the rest follows from these two.) Nutritionally speaking, Solein resembles some existing foodstuffs \u2014 sitting between dried meat, dried carrot or dried soy in terms of the blend of vitamins, amino acids, proteins (overall, it\u2019s 65% protein), per Vainikka. \u201cSo it\u2019s very familiar but it\u2019s a bit [of a] new combination,\u201d he suggests, adding: \u201cThe taste is very mild, very neutral.\u201d (A mild taste may not sound especially scintillating for the tastebuds but it means it\u2019s easy to include as an ingredient in a wide range of foods without the need for a strong flavor to be masked.) While Solar Foods has essentially discovered a new species through its fermentation process, the microbe itself obviously hasn\u2019t just appeared on planet Earth \u2014 and is likely very ancient; perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. So there\u2019s a fascinating blend of old and new coming together in the startup\u2019s bioreactor. Why is finding new forms of protein important? The problem Solar Foods is aiming to tackle is that the environmental costs of livestock-based meat production are indisputably massive \u2014 whether you\u2019re talking unsustainable land and water use; climate-heating emissions and pollution; or animal welfare concerns. But what if you could produce billions of nutritious meals without the need to deforest huge swathes of land and slaughter masses of livestock to produce the food? What if humanity could feed itself and stop consuming the planet in the process? That\u2019s the promise and the core differentiator that Solar Foods claims vs. animal-derived proteins. If you compare Solein to the growing gaggle of plant-based meat alternatives, they do still rely upon land being farmed to produce the necessary plants \u2014 whether soy or pea or oat, etc. \u2014 that form the basis of their products. Although they need far less land than meat production requires so the environment upside is still very real. But Solar Foods sees itself blending into this competitive mix \u2014 selling Solein to companies producing plant-based foods as another ingredient they can use to cook up nutritious, environmentally friendly meals. \u201cCereals, vegetables, fruits, herbs aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d says Vainikka, discussing how Solein might fit into an evolved food production system. \u201cSo if we go back to the original problem \u2014 80% of all the problems that have to do with food, whether it\u2019s loss of natural habitat or forest loss or whatever, has to do with the industrialized animal production \u2026 So actually Solein could solve 80% of the problem but 20% of the calories because mostly we are, on a calorie basis, eating carbohydrates.\u201d And if you\u2019re excited about the promise of lab-grown meat \u2014 which is also seeking to delink protein production from land use \u2014 Vainikka says the startup is supportive of such efforts since, once again, it\u2019s spying potential customers as he says cultivated/lab-grown meat producers could use Solein to feed the cell cultures they\u2019re using to grow slaughter-free steaks. So use cases for Solar Foods\u2019 edible bacteria look broad, provided people are willing to eat it (or have it fed to something in their food chain). Conceivably it could even be used as a feedstock for livestock \u2014 although the startup\u2019s messaging is focused on the need to transform a broken food system and enter \u201cthe era of sustainable food production,\u201d as its website puts it. It is also working on developing a closed-loop system in which the sole byproduct of its production process \u2014 water containing bits of the Solein protein \u2014 would be continuously recycled back into production of more of the foodstuff. And if it can pull that off, the edible bacteria could potentially function as a life support system for humans on space missions where the timescales are too long for astronauts to rely on food supplies brought with them from Earth (such as, for example, a mission to Mars). \u201cThe specific thing that we think is different in what we\u2019re doing \u2014 compared to anything else on the market today \u2014 is that we don\u2019t use any agriculture in the foods,\u201d Vainikka tells TechCrunch. \u201cElectricity and carbon dioxide are the main ingredients \u2014 instead of sunlight and carbohydrates or oils. So that\u2019s the fundamental point where the disconnection of food production from agriculture happens. \u201cThat\u2019s our thing. And the reason to do that is once you can delink the connection between use of land and land-use impacts and food production then basically all the environmental benefits fall on your lap that there can be in relation to food production.\u201d Down here on Earth, being able to unhitch food production from the vagaries of seasonal weather and other factors that can have major impacts on agricultural yields \u2014 such as pests, natural disasters, issues with supply chains specific to farming and so on \u2014 is another touted advantage for Solar Foods\u2019 approach. \u201cSecurity of supply \u2026 consistency and quality,\u201d says Vainikka, checking off some of the added advantages he says the edible protein offers vs. traditional farming, i.e., on top of the massive heap of land-delinking-based environmental gains which could \u2014 for example \u2014 support a mass reforestation of farm land, promoting biodiversity and fighting global warming since trees suck up CO2. Europe\u2019s energy crisis bites Solein looks like a no-brainer on the environmental front. But one key component of its production \u2014 energy, i.e., electricity \u2014 is facing supply issues of its own in Europe at present in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. (Russia being a major but unreliable supplier of gas to Europe.) Solar Foods\u2019 long-term bet is on energy production costs being brought down (or, well, stabilized) by widespread access to cheap renewables \u2014 such as wind and hydro energy in the north of Europe and solar in the sunny south. Thing is, for now, the European energy markets are typically structured so that the wholesale price of energy is linked to the cost of the most expensive type of energy (fossil fuel derived) despite there already being a fair amount of renewable energy available which is far cheaper to produce. (Hence why if the price of gas goes up the wholesale price of energy rises, and the bill payer must pay more even if their energy supplier sources their energy from cheaper to produce renewable sources.) Since the Ukraine war started, Europe has been facing an exacerbated supply vs. demand issue. And over the past several months it\u2019s been hard for Europeans to escape energy price spikes as their governments have sought to reduce reliance on Russian gas imports \u2014 shrinking energy supply options and helping keep war-spiked wholesale prices high. The coming winter looks very grim, with Russia recently electing to entirely shutter gas exports via its Nord Stream pipeline to Germany in what looks like an attempt to weaken Western support for the pro-Ukraine sanctions. So energy supply in Europe has become a weapon of economic war. It\u2019s an incredibly volatile situation but one thing is clear: Europe\u2019s \u2018competitive\u2019 marginal-cost-based energy markets are in desperate need of structural reform \u2014 to reflect the cheaper production costs of renewables and ensure consumers and businesses aren\u2019t at the mercy of fossil fuel volatility and cripplingly high prices linked to Russian aggression. But, in the meanwhile, with electricity being a key component of Solar Foods\u2019 process, the startup is having to manage what Vainikka \u2014 who has a background in energy economics that he says allows him to understand where the markets are headed \u2014 refers to with classic Nordic understatement as \u201cturbulence.\u201d He suggests Solar Foods may therefore need to wait out the current energy crisis before it\u2019s able to scale commercial production of Solein in a way that\u2019s economically viable \u2014 though it\u2019s banking on Europe being able to find a way through to more stable electricity prices in the not too distant future. (In recent days, the Commission has said it will be coming with an emergency reform plan to curb energy prices \u2014 both in the short term and over the longer run, to ensure prices reflect cheaper renewables.) \u201cAt the moment we shouldn\u2019t make electricity supply agreements for our factory. We can\u2019t be on the market today to make those agreements,\u201d confirms Vainikka. \u201cBecause of this [energy price volatility] \u2014 it\u2019s a fact. The second [thing] is we are quite happy that we are not fermenting natural gas \u2014 we are fermenting electricity. So we have an opportunity to make a good deal after turbulence.\u201d \u201cWe need to replace fossil fuels with electricity so we need a lot of new generation capacity which is also a problem in the market but we\u2019re confident that this works,\u201d he adds. \u201cUnfortunately there is this turbulence now.\u201d Solar Foods is pressing on regardless of the current energy crisis. It\u2019s in the process of building its first factory \u2014 actually a demo facility, as a step on the road to future commercial scaling up of Solein production \u2014 at a cost of around \u20ac40 million, drawing on backing from a number of VC funds since 2017, over seed and Series A rounds, as well as raising debt financing (such as \u20ac15 million from Danske Bank Growth earlier this year). The demo facility at least won\u2019t have major energy requirements to run. (Although he says it\u2019s still holding off on signing an energy supply contract for now.) \u201cWe\u2019ll manage the turbulence but of course it would be better for it not to continue too long,\u201d says Vainikka. \u201cWe\u2019re using this demo [facility] operated by one wind turbine to prove that this scales \u2014 but the real factories would be 100x larger in terms of energy use, 50x larger \u2014 and it would need rather 50 turbines to run a huge facility that will produce half a billion meals. Then you must get a good [energy supply] contract and if we were investing into that factory now it might be postponed because of the turbulence.\u201d Good food and food for good? With the demo factory set to come on stream in 2023, Solar Foods\u2019 hope is the first consumer product containing Solein will be on the market by the end of next year (or, failing that, in early 2024). Which global market will get the first commercial taste of the novel protein will depend on regulatory clearances. Solar Foods has applied for clearance in multiple jurisdictions but can\u2019t predict whether regulators in Europe or the U.S. or Asia will be first with approval, given variances in this process. (But Vainikka says it\u2019s possible the first clearance could happen this year.) What the first product for sale to consumers that contains Solein will be also isn\u2019t yet clear. Vainikka suggests a few possibilities \u2014 such as that it could be added to existing foods like breakfast cereals or vegan meals for fortification purposes (owing to its vitamin and mineral content, such as iron and B vitamins); or as a main ingredient in plant-based meat replacement products, replacing stuff like pea protein. Or he says it could be used as an egg replacement in pasta or pastry production. Or as a principle ingredient in ice cream or yogurt (or even to make a spreadable faux cheese). \u201cWe leave the final formulation and product development for our customers so that we can empower them to renew categories,\u201d he suggests. \u201cAnd make having a food an act for good.\u201d \u201cFrankly as a company we think that it might be a good idea to focus on what we master \u2014 which is this conversion-fermentation; producing this ingredient and so that it would have the functionalities needed for food products,\u201d he continues, expanding on Solar Foods\u2019 decision to stay in its biotech lane. \u201cThere are so many, so huge, or so experienced or so old [food] companies on the market who have already access to the consumer, all the experience regarding textures, product development regarding all kinds of plant-based ingredients and so on. So when we introduce Solein into the market you would not only need to get everything right, what we are doing and mastering now, but also the final product \u2014 of course taste and texture is decisive.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s a heavy investment program that we\u2019ve dived into,\u201d he adds, emphasizing the still extensive range of requirements for developing a product that\u2019s designed even to be an ingredient in processed foods that people eat. \u201cNutrition must be there \u2026 then second is safety, then functionality, of course \u2014 how it works and forms texture \u2014 and then scaling and production technology; who has it, how does it work, is it scalable, and how does the supply chain work \u2014 so who\u2019s really the gatekeeper? So this we are in the middle of now \u2026 A lot will happen in the next 12-16 months.\u201d While Solar Foods won\u2019t be a food product maker itself it does have an R&D lab where it carries out culinary experiments with its product \u2014 and images on its website show a selection of demo foodstuffs, from chicken-style chunks served with pasta to soup, bread and a breakfast smoothies, all with a distinctive rich yellow hue. In its refined form \u2014 i.e., after it\u2019s passed through Solar Foods\u2019 electrolyzing and fermenting bioreactors and been dried \u2014 Solein takes the form of a yellow powder (the hue is down to betacarotene it naturally contains). The strong color makes it looks a bit like a custom blend of turmeric and cumin. But tastewise it\u2019s nothing like that strong. Per Vainikka, one expert taster who sampled it suggested it was akin to dried carrot. But whether you\u2019re a fan of carrots is beside the point; he emphasizes that the taste is mild enough that it can be easily masked in whatever food product it was being incorporated into \u2014 just without the added nutrients going anywhere. For example, in the sample case of adding Solein to pasta, Vainikka says it would \u2014 nutritionally speaking \u2014 be akin to eating, say, a plate of spaghetti bolognese with all the nourishment derived from an animal-based ingredient but without the need to have any minced meat on the plate. Which, well, might take some swallowing for those used to consuming traditional (and oftentimes culturally significant) recipes. (An Italian I described this meatless but nutritionally meat-like pasta dish to at a dinner party I attended recently was visibly shocked at the prospect and a second Italian she started to explain the concept to responded by suggesting we should focus on having fun eating the actual food on our plates instead of talking about, er, such high-concept stuff, so, well, there may be some acceptance humps in the short term.) But as plant-based faux meats advance in taste and texture it\u2019s easy to envisage creative food producers being able to whip up something that has a meat-like taste and texture and \u2014 thanks to the addition of Solein \u2014 is also imbued with similar levels of protein, iron and vitamins as actual meat. And that could be a strong selling point for consumers, especially with the current food fad for high-protein eating. Other food ideas Solar Foods has been experimenting with in its labs are \u2018cheese\u2019 ball lollypops, mayonnaises and dressings, pancakes and plenty more besides. Vainikka says he hopes the first commercial food to contain the ingredient won\u2019t be a burger \u2014 since there are so many meat-alternative patty options out there already. But he suggests it could be a \u201cmeat-like bite\u201d \u2014 something akin to a nugget \u2014 such as might be be served in an Asian hot pot or similar. \u201cThen yogurt, ice cream, soup, bakery pastry application is something that might go first,\u201d he postulates. \u201cYou could imagine it could be a frozen food, fresh or even on the street kitchen of an Asian city,\u201d he also suggests, saying the startup is keen to branch out and \u201cappreciate different food cultures on the planet\u201d \u2014 so it can \u201ctry to explain how Solein could be an ingredient in different kinds of dishes from the Asian hot pots to burger patties to soups or pastries or whatever.\u201d Food is of course not only cultural but individual tastes can be hugely personal \u2014 and/or political. So once Solein leaves Solar Foods\u2019 factories and arrives in customers\u2019 commercial kitchens that\u2019s where all these localizing product and branding challenges will really kick in \u2014 as buyers will have to work on figuring out how best to blend it in with other taste and cultural considerations or indeed make its presence stick out loudly (at least on the packet) where shouting about sustainability benefits might be the best way to reap big sales in their particular target market. One thing looks clear: The future of food won\u2019t be dull \u2014 or even uniformly yellow hued. A full rainbow of possibilities for alternative eats are coming down the pipe \u2014 and the environmental challenges we face, as a species, demand we find the appetite to consume them.", "techcrunch170": "Climate change and geopolitical instability are wreaking havoc on agriculture. To gauge how VCs are responding to these issues, we spoke with seven investors. For starters, rising greenhouse gas emissions are driving punishing droughts and storms, which are harming crops, exacerbating food insecurity and threatening countless livelihoods. At the same time, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is rattling the world\u2019s grain supply, driving up costs and further aggravating supply chains. Even as these and other crises hammer the multitrillion-dollar industry, startup investors see potential for huge returns with tech that could boost yields, slash emissions and mitigate waste. \u201cThere are opportunities to develop [and] adopt new technologies all along the food value chain that will impact key issues like food security and emissions,\u201d Adam Anders, a managing partner at Anterra Capital, told TechCrunch. Among the areas where he sees the biggest potential impact, the investor cited improving plant genetics, boosting the shelf life of more products and putting digital tools in the hands of farmers. Consumer behavior is another piece of the proverbial puzzle as climate literacy increasingly alters how folks shop. \u201cOver the last few years, we have seen skyrocketing interest in sustainability from consumers and food brands, and awareness over the negative impacts of agriculture continues to grow,\u201d said Ting-Ting Liu, investor at Prosus Ventures. \u201cPeople are not only paying more attention to agricultural-related emissions but also how much land and water is required to support the world\u2019s food supply and the amount of runoff being generated,\u201d she said. Liu argued that this demand is creating strong tailwinds for businesses that strive to address agriculture\u2019s environmental impact, ultimately driving more capital into everything from cellular agriculture to methane reduction solutions for livestock. Still, agtech is not immune to some of the broader trends in venture. While the value of agtech VC deals rose to $11.4 billion in 2021 from $6.5 billion in 2020, several investors told TechCrunch they\u2019ve noticed a slowdown in agtech deals this year amid the wider tech downturn of 2022. \u201c2021 was a record year for VC across the board. In 2022, VC investments across the board are about 30% lower year on year, and I would expect a similar slowdown for agtech,\u201d Monica Varman, a partner at G2 Venture Partners, told TechCrunch. \u201cOver the medium to long term, however, I do expect agtech VC funding to grow, given supply chain challenges, traceability concerns and advancements in enabling technologies in synbio and robotics,\u201d she added. Agtech investors are also still largely funding men. Out of the nearly $11 billion dispensed into agtech in 2021, 78% went to firms with all-male founders, according to PitchBook. The disparity has only worsened so far in 2022, rising to 81% (out of nearly $7.3 billion) as of September 14, per the data firm. To gauge whether (and how) VCs are responding to these issues and more, we reached out to: Brett Brohl, managing director, Techstars Farm to Fork, and managing partner, Bread and Butter Ventures Agtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue? It\u2019s not going to continue in the short run largely because of macroeconomic factors you\u2019re just not seeing \u2014 for example, many late-stage deals are going through recently \u2014 so in the short term, definitely not. In the long run, the sector has a tremendous amount of opportunity and room for innovation, so with time, you will see continued growth and investor focus on agtech. Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of global GhG emissions. How has the climate crisis changed how you invest? It is a huge reason deal value skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021. Investors understand that this challenge creates an opportunity. Agtech is not as mainstream as many other sectors, so we need more eyeballs and capital. If you are making the food system more effective and efficient, you are making it more sustainable. We aren\u2019t a big enough fund to finance a startup forever, and we depend on later-stage investors, so this attention and resulting influx of capital helps remove some risk from our portfolio. Which emerging technologies, such as cellular agriculture and AI-powered robots, have the greatest potential to impact key issues like food security and emissions in the next decade? We 100% believe in cellular agriculture and are also huge fans of the robotics space, especially robotics that solve very specific pain points and have low BOMs. \u201cAutomation and computer vision will be transformative for agriculture over the next decade, particularly as food production is moved closer to the point of consumption due to food security concerns.\u201d Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture Partners We also love the packaging space \u2014 lots of packaging goes into the transportation and movement of food. We\u2019re also excited about anything to do with logistics, manufacturing or transportation that makes the food chain more sustainable. When investing in an agtech startup, which green flags do you look for? Are you open to backing founders who don\u2019t have experience in the industry? Investing in agtech startups is no different from any other company. A great team can take a C- idea, pivot, iterate and make it work. But a C- founder will run any idea into the ground, regardless of how good it is. While founder-market fit can be a benefit to a company, great entrepreneurs are smart, have a great work ethic, are coachable and know how to surround themselves with people who make up for their weaknesses. So industry experience isn\u2019t a requirement for us. Which areas of agtech have received the most attention from early-stage founders in recent years? In which areas would you like to see more work done or investments? The obvious answer is alternative proteins. So much capital has been invested and so many founders are building cool things in the space. I\u2019d love to see more attention paid to things that are a bit downstream, such as manufacturing, logistics and the future of food retail. Over the last few years, you have seen traditional agtech investors move their thesis further downstream, so it is happening. I\u2019m also really interested in fintech applications in the agriculture space, like what Traive and Milk Moovement are doing. What are you doing to fund underrepresented founders in agtech? We actively seek out investors, forums and networks that support underrepresented founders and invest or work with entrepreneurs that are a stage earlier than where we invest. We also maintain a diverse investment team \u2014 75% of our fund are women. Finally, we hold open office hours for anyone every week and provide free public education through multiple channels to help founders level up. Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 28% of wheat and 15% of corn exports globally. How has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected agtech VC deal-making given its impact on the global supply chain and the world\u2019s grain supply? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s done much to early-stage agtech founders or venture capital. The macroeconomic effect of the war has at least, in part, been a tightening of monetary supply, which will trickle down to early-stage startups. However, the impact has not been significant at early stages yet. Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018, and a year earlier, ChemChina acquired Syngenta for $43 billion. Today, Bayer\u2019s market cap is less than that deal\u2019s value, and China\u2019s ambassador to Switzerland has called the Syngenta acquisition a bad deal for Beijing. Have the outcomes of these deals affected investors\u2019 hopes for blowout late-stage exits? I wouldn\u2019t call these acquisitions of \u201cmodern\u201d agtech companies. Monsanto has been around for 100+ years, and Syngenta was formed over 20 years ago, and even then it was a spin-off. Additionally, these happened in 2017 and 2018. Investment in agtech has exploded since then, indicating that the market does not think these two acquisitions are indicative of underperforming venture investments. The outcomes of companies like Upside Foods, FBN and Indigo Ag will be far more important to the agtech ecosystem. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a very tough market for late-stage companies right now, and that will slow exits and depress ROI on many venture investments, not just agtech deals. How do you prefer to receive pitches? What\u2019s the most important thing a founder should know before they get on a call with you? I\u2019m open to warm intros, thoughtful cold emails or pitches during my open office hours. If you\u2019re pitching me on a call, the number one thing is to be yourself. Anything else you\u2019d like to comment on? I think the blurred lines between food tech and agtech are really interesting. What is agtech? It\u2019s not just farm inputs; there is a lot more to it and that, to me, is exciting. Monica Varman, partner, G2 Venture Partners Agtech VC deal value rocketed from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $11.4 billion in 2021. Will this sort of growth continue? 2021 was a record year for VC. In 2022, VC investments across the board are about 30% lower, and I would expect a similar slowdown for agtech.

This new technique simplifies the production process of cell-based meat by reducing reliance on animal products, and it is also greener, cleaner, safer and more cost-effective. Cultured meat is an alternative to animal farming with advantages such as reducing carbon footprint and the risk of transmitting diseases in animals. However, the current method of producing cultured meat involves using other animal products, which largely defeats the purpose, or drugs to stimulate the growth of the meat. To cultivate cell-based meat, animal cells are fed animal serum \u2013 usually foetal bovine serum (FBS), which is a mixture harvested from the blood of foetuses excised from pregnant cows slaughtered in the dairy or meat industries \u2013 to help them grow and proliferate. This is a critical, yet cruel and expensive, step in the current cell-based meat production process. Ironically, many of these molecules come from the muscles within the slaughtered animal, but scientists did not know how to stimulate their release in production scale bioreactors. Other methods to promote cell growth are using drugs or relying on genetic engineering. The complex production process for cell-based meat increases cost, limits the manufacturing scale and undermines the commercial viability of cell-based meat. To help address this challenge, a multidisciplinary research team led by Associate Professor Alfredo Franco-Obreg\u00f3n, who is from the NUS Institute for Health Innovation & Technology and the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, came up with an unconventional method of using magnetic pulses to stimulate the growth of cell-based meat.", "techcrunch173": "A McKinsey and Co. study suggests that while sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to increase (even triple) its agricultural output and overall contribution to the economy, the sector remains untapped largely due to lack of access to quality farm inputs, up to par infrastructure like warehousing and market.

Noting critical gaps in the region\u2019s agri-food space, Ghanaian agritech Farmerline has stepped in to deliver technologies that are envisaged to increase farmers\u2019 access to high-quality production inputs and education on the best farming practices, including on how to better deal with the effects of climate change.

Having a network of partners that can help us quickly move inputs like fertilizer and seeds to rural areas, and farm produce from rural areas, is important and part of what we do. We don\u2019t intend to bring all of the logistics and storage in-house, but we want to be more efficient and that means working with the right partners,\u201d he said. Greater reach Farmerline works with agribusinesses (usually small retail shops that stock farm inputs) to ensure that farmers get access to high-quality supplies. These shop owners, usually the first point of knowledge for the farmers, are used by Farmerline to distribute educational material and to gather farmers together for training. The partnering shops use the startup\u2019s Mergdata, a proprietary AI technology platform for supply chain intelligence, to digitize the farmers they serve, and to generate the data the agritech needs to predict the demand of farm supplies. \u201cWe are tapping into that network of agribusiness, and in a way, we are tapping into a network of trust \u2014 the relationship that these shop owners have with farmers to help us expand,\u201d said Attah. The partnership with retailers, said Attah, emerged after Farmerline realized that working directly with the farmers would amount to \u201ccompeting with local businesses, and it didn\u2019t make any sense. The cost of going door to door to each farmer was really high,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking with the agribusinesses made our businesses scalable, and it also helped us make more impact especially during the pandemic when we couldn\u2019t travel \u2014 they became our eyes and ears on the ground. We sent trucks full of fertilizer and seeds to them that they would then distribute to farmers. That model worked really well.\u201d Using Mergdata, Farmerline can tell the performance of their partnering agribusinesses (retail shops), and develop a credit scoring program that guides the extension of business expansion loans. According to Attah, the startup more than doubled its direct-reach last year to 79,000 farmers, up from 36,000 in 2020 and 8,000 in 2019. Moreover, through third party licensing for Mergdata \u2014 which is now used by 180 clients including governments, non-governmental organizations and agri-companies to ensure transparency in their supply chain and traceability \u2014 the agtech has digitized over 1 million farmers in 26 countries across the globe.

The new product will roll out nationwide at more than 5,000 Kroger and Walmart stores, as well as Albertsons , Ahold Delhaize , Jewel-Osco, Sprouts and other local grocers. The announcement concludes a rocky month for the maker of meat alternatives. Beyond ousted Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey after he was arrested for allegedly biting another man's nose. The company also announced plans to cut 19% of its workforce, or roughly 200 employees, as well as the departure of its chief financial officer and the elimination of the chief growth officer role. Amid the chaos, Beyond and Yum Brands' Taco Bell started testing meatless carne asada using its Beyond Steak product at restaurants in Dayton, Ohio. The Beyond Steak that will be sold in grocery stores comes packaged in bite-sized pieces. It uses faba bean protein as its base and contains 21 grams of protein per serving, according to the company. It also has lower saturated fat content than beef steak and contains no cholesterol. The 10-ounce package will retail for $7.99. Historically, product launches have boosted Beyond's sales, driving new and returning customers to try the item. That would be welcome news for the company, which has seen its sales slide and investors lose hope in its long-term growth prospects. In the second quarter, Beyond reported U.S. grocery sales rose just 2.2% while restaurant revenue was off 2.4%. This year, shares of the company have lost 80% of their value, shrinking its market value to $821 million. At its record high in July 2019, Beyond was valued at $13.4 billion.", "techcrunch175": "For most dairy farmers, milk flowing from their cows is tested by a traveling technician once per month. But in a world where bovine mastitis can appear from one day to the next, it is udderly ridiculous to test milk flowing from cows once per month. Today at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield, Labby offered a different solution, with an inline optical sensor that can test cows every time they are milked. For now, the product detects potential issues early, but over time, the company believes it can start predicting issues before they occur. The company\u2019s product is called MilKey and comes in two variants: a hand-held product that can be used anywhere, or an inline product that can be hooked into the milking machines, which enables daily farmers to test continuously. The main difference between the two products is also their strengths. The handheld device can be used by any technician out in the (literal) field; you select the cow you\u2019re testing on a smartphone app, and the test results show up with the right animal. That\u2019s great when a cow is wandering about or if you have suspicions about a particular animal having an illness. The inline device is fully automatic and works over Wi-Fi. For this device, the results need to be assigned to the right cow manually, but it makes it feasible to test every cow, every milking. Labby tells TechCrunch that the device takes spectral measurements of milk samples and uploads them to the cloud. From there, the company uses machine-learning models to take spectral readings as inputs. It can estimate the content of the milk, broken down into fats, proteins and somatic cell counts. Once the measurements are taken and assigned to an animal, the farmers can use an app or any web browser to see the full testing history of any animal, to ensure they are going a-bovine and beyond in terms of milk production. \u201cAnimal health records are like human records; they give critical indications about animal health and feed efficiency. It turns out that milk is the best biomarker for everything. Currently, the industry only tests once a month for each animal. We think this is a systemic failure for the farmers and for the animals,\u201d says Julia Somerdin, CEO and founder of Labby, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cOne complication for animal health is mastitis. It one of the most common yet expensive diseases, and it can change from day to day. So when they do 30-day testing, the test will tell you everything is fine, but the next day the animal could develop a case, which can be subclinical with no symptoms. So for farmers, between testing days, they have no idea how the animal is doing.\u201d You may be wondering \u201cwho cares,\u201d but dairy farming is a hell of an industry. There are 9 million cows across 40,000 farms in the U.S. Worldwide, there are 250 million cows across 115 million farms; it all adds up. \u201cWith our solution, we can provide on-farm real-time testing to help provide the farmer with daily, weekly and monthly health records,\u201d says Somerdin. \u201cAnimal health is the critical indicator that\u2019s missing from today\u2019s industry practices.\u201d From the numbers and the impact, you\u2019ll be unsurprised that there are big sums of money involved. The best milk gets farmers the best price, which means that milk quality is directly linked to revenue, the Labby team tells me. The benefit is two-fold: Healthier cows need less veterinary attention, and higher-quality milk nets the milk producers more money per gallon of milk delivered. \u201cWe can insert Labby in the value chain. Dairy is a very input-intensive industry so we have all kinds of suppliers that help farmers produce more and better milk, and then the dairy farmers sell their milk to dairy processors. With our service, the big battle, besides the money-saving aspect, is we create all this real-time data,\u201d says Somerdin. \u201cAnimal genetics companies can use that data, helping them refine their algorithms. We can also bridge the gap between dairy producers and veterinarians, enabling telehealth for cows.\u201d Apart from the fact that when I hear \u201ctelehealth for cows,\u201d I giggle at the thought of a cow staring into a Zoom screen and talking about its feelings and its four upset stomachs, it\u2019s easy to understand how Labby adds significant value and the ability to be an early warning system for animal health. \u201cThe most important thing is that you don\u2019t need a technician to sample the milk anymore. The cleaning can also be integrated with the current system,\u201d says Somerdin, explaining how the company has designed a set-it-and-forget-it approach to continuous testing. Labby was part of Techstars, and raised a total of $1.3 million from them and a number of other investors, including MIT Media lab\u2019s E14 fund. The company officially started selling its products in early October, and has only just started shipping its products to customers. In the short term, it\u2019s a hardware+SaaS business, but after that, it\u2019s time to start milking the data itself for wisdom. \u201cOur business model has three revenue streams. For the dairy farmers, they pay once for the hardware equipment, then monthly for us to provide the testing in the cloud. The farmer pays per cow per day,\u201d says Somerdin. \u201cIn addition, we\u2019re looking at data. We believe we are generating significant value for the industry, such as for genetic companies. We will have a data licensing fee, but we will wait to offer that until we have half a million cows on the platform.\u201d Over time, the company hopes to be able to use big data to catch a glimpse of the future, too. \u201cThe data will help us develop a reliable benchmark for each animal,\u201d says Somerdin, and suggests that deviations from the benchmark could tell you something about what\u2019s going on for the cows, health-wise. \u201cBased on that, we can look at pattern recognition for disease onset among the herd. We could also predict patterns for milk production, which currently relies only on historical data, which limits their accuracy.\u201d All in all, the company seems eager to (milk)shake up the industry, and bring all the farmers to the yard. And they\u2019re like, it\u2019s better than yours. They will teach you, but they\u2019ll have to charge.", "other news sites176": "CNN \u2014 It tastes like a tomato, smells like a tomato, and even looks (mostly) like a tomato. There\u2019s just one catch: It\u2019s purple. The USDA has approved a genetically modified purple tomato, clearing the path for the unique fruit to be sold in American stores next year. \u201cFrom a plant pest risk perspective, this plant may be safely grown and used in breeding,\u201d the agency said in a September 7 news release. The approval moves the purple tomato one step closer to widespread distribution. In addition to its unique color, the purple tomato also has health benefits and a longer shelf life than garden variety red tomatoes, scientists say. The tomato was developed by a team of scientists, including British biochemist Cathie Martin, who is a professor at the University of East Anglia and a project leader at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, England. Martin worked on pigment production in flowers for over 20 years, she told CNN. \u201cI wanted to start projects where we could look and see whether there were health benefits for this particular group of pigments,\u201d she said. The pigments that drew Martin\u2019s interest are anthocyanins, which give blueberries, blackberries and eggplants their rich blue-purple hues. With funding from a German consortium, she decided to engineer tomatoes that were rich in anthocyanins, hoping to \u201cincrease the antioxidant capacity\u201d of the fruits. By comparing regular tomatoes to the engineered purple tomatoes, she would be able to easily identify whether the anthocyanins were linked to any specific health benefits. To engineer the purple tomatoes, the scientists used transcription factors from snapdragons to trigger the tomatoes to produce more anthocyanin, creating a vibrant purple color. Martin and her colleagues published the first results of their research in 2008 in an article in Nature Biotechnology. The results were \u201cstunning,\u201d she said. Cancer-prone mice that ate the purple tomatoes lived around 30% longer than those that ate normal tomatoes, according to the study. Martin said there are \u201cmany explanations\u201d as to why anthocyanin-rich tomatoes may have health benefits. There are \u201cprobably multiple mechanisms involved,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a drug, where there\u2019s a single target. It\u2019s about them having antioxidant capacity. It also may influence the composition of the microbiome, so it\u2019s better able to deal with digestion of other nutrients.\u201d And in 2013, Martin and colleagues released a study that found the purple tomatoes had double the shelf life of their red cousins. Martin established a spinout company, Norfolk Plant Sciences, to bring the purple tomatoes to market. Nathan Pumplin, the CEO of Norfolk\u2019s US-based commercial business, told CNN that the purple tomato \u201cstrikes a cord with people in this very basic way.\u201d The distinctive purple color means that \u201cit takes no imagination to see that it\u2019s different,\u201d Pumplin said. \u201cIt really allows people to make a choice.\u201d FDA approval and commercialization are next steps In the past, forays into genetically modified foods have often focused on engineering crops that are more sustainable to produce, he added. But for consumers, the benefits of eating a genetically modified food are murky. \u201cIt\u2019s very abstract, hard to understand,\u201d Pumplin said. \u201cBut a purple tomato \u2013 you either choose or choose not to consume.\u201d The difference between the GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) product and the non-modified tomato are stark \u2013 and the possible health benefits for consumers are also clear. Pumplin says that consumers are \u201cwarming up\u201d to genetically modified foods across the world. \u201cWe look at the problems facing our society as far as sustainability, climate change, health tied to diet and nutrition, and what\u2019s clear from the response from our announcement is that it\u2019s a really important topic to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged that a lot of people are starting to relook at biotechnology in light of the important challenges.\u201d At the same time, \u201cGMOs are not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one tool in our toolbox as plant scientists, as scientists, agronomists, to improve the food production system.\u201d The next steps for the purple tomato are FDA approval and commercialization, Pumplin said. \u201cWe need to breed excellent, delicious purple tomatoes. We need to work with producers to produce them and distribute them.\u201d Norfolk will begin to launch limited test markets in 2023 to identify which consumers are most interested in purple tomatoes. As for the taste? The purple tomato is indistinguishable from your standard red tomato, Pumplin said. \u201cIt tastes like a great tomato,\u201d he said.", "techcrunch177": "Welcome back to Found, the TechCrunch podcast that brings you the stories behind the startups.

Can John Deere become one of the leading AI and robotics companies in the world alongside Tesla and Silicon Valley technology giants over the next decade? That notion may seem incongruous with the general perception of the 185-year-old company as a heavy-metal manufacturer of tractors, bulldozers and lawnmowers painted in the signature green and yellow colors. But that is what the company sees in its future, according to Jorge Heraud, vice president of automation and autonomy for Moline, Illinois-based Deere, a glimpse of which was showcased at last January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Deere unveiled its fully autonomous 8R farm tractor, driven by artificial intelligence rather than a farmer behind the wheel. The autonomous 8R is the culmination of Deere's nearly two decades of strategic planning and investment in automation, data analytics, GPS guidance, internet-of-things connectivity and software engineering. While a good deal of that R&D has been homegrown, the company also has been on a spree of acquisitions and partnerships with agtech startups, harvesting know-how as well as talent. \"This comes from our realization that technology is going to drive value creation and increase productivity, profitability and sustainability for farmers,\" Heraud said. While Deere made a big splash at CES and intrigued the investment community, Stephen Volkmann, equity research analyst at Jefferies, said, \"We are very, very, very early in this process.\" \"The total global fleet of autonomous Deere tractors is less than 50 today,\" he added. And even though Deere's goal is to have a fully autonomous farming system for row crops in place by 2030, Volkmann said, \"in Wall Street time, that's an eternity.\" For the time being, Deere is creating value and profits with well-established automated systems that can be retrofitted to its existing tractors, such as GPS-based self-steering and precision seeding that measures how deep and far apart to plant. Those steps have to be in place, Volkmann said, before you can put full autonomy around them. The autonomous 8R represents a giant leap in current agtech, not to mention the marketing benefit. \"Prior to its introduction at CES, everybody thought [full autonomy] was pie in the sky,\" said Scott Shearer, chair of the department of food, agricultural and biological engineering at Ohio State University. Around the world, Shearer said, there are probably 30 different autonomous tractor projects in the works, though none are commercially available. \"But when Deere, with 60% of the tractor market share in North America, comes out with one, that's when reality sets in,\" Shearer said. That reality reflects Deere's autonomy strategy. \"The AI we use involves computer vision and machine learning,\" Heraud said, science that was well underway at Silicon Valley startup Blue River Technology, which Deere bought in 2017 for $305 million \u2014 a deal that also brought on Blue River co-founder and CEO Heraud. Blue River's \"see and spray\" robotics platform utilizes dozens of sophisticated cameras and processors to distinguish weeds from crop plants when applying herbicides. Attached to the autonomous tractor are six pairs of stereo cameras that can \"see\" an obstacle in the field \u2014 whether it's a rock, a log or a person \u2014 and determine its size and relative distance. Images captured by the cameras are passed through a deep neural network that classifies each pixel in approximately 100 milliseconds and decides whether the tractor should keep moving or stop. \"We've curated hundreds of thousands of images from different farm locations and under various weather and lighting conditions,\" Heraud said, \"so that with machine learning, the tractor can understand what it's seeing and react accordingly. This capability also allows the farmer, instead of being in the tractor, to operate it remotely while doing something else.\" Heraud was referring to autonomous driving, another piece of Deere's agtech puzzle that came together when it purchased Bear Flag Robotics last year for $250 million. Also a Silicon Valley startup, launched in 2017, Bear Flag's autonomous navigation system can be retrofitted onto existing tractors. In the case of Deere's 8R model, a tractor which first went on the market in 2020, the latest version with autonomous capabilities uses technology from Blue River. Since the CES rollout, Deere has acquired AI assets from two other agtech pioneers. In April, Deere formed a joint venture with GUSS Automation, which has devised semi-autonomous orchard and vineyard sprayers. Using AI and IoT, multiple GUSS (Global Unmanned Spray System) sprayers can be remotely controlled by a single operator, running up to eight sprayers simultaneously from a laptop. GUSS can detect trees and determine how much to spray on each one, regardless of height or canopy size. A month later, Deere announced the acquisition of numerous patents and other intellectual property from AI startup Light, according to The Robot Report. Light's depth-perception platform improves upon existing stereo-vision systems by using additional cameras, mimicking the structure of a human eye to enable more accurate 3D vision. Deere plans to integrate Light's platform into future versions of its autonomous farm equipment. To keep a close eye on other agtech R&D, Deere has established a Startup Collaborator program to test innovative technologies with customers and dealers without a more formal business relationship. \"The hope is that they find the diamonds before they become obvious to [competitors] and keep them in the fold,\" Volkmann said. Among the current crop are Four Growers, a Pittsburgh-based startup providing robotic harvesting and analytics for high-value crops, starting with greenhouse tomatoes, and Philadelphia-based Burro, which is producing small, autonomous robots that can assist farm workers with various conveyance tasks. Not surprisingly, Deere's biggest competitors have been developing automation and autonomy for its farm machinery, too. AGCO, whose brands include Massey Ferguson and Fendt, \"has been automating farming operations since the mid-1990s,\" said Seth Crawford, senior vice president and general manager of the Duluth, Georgia-based company's precision agriculture and digital division. \"We're at a stage we call supervised autonomy, where we still have someone in the cab of the machine,\" he said. \"The buzz is around fully autonomous operations, but where farmers are willing to pay for automation is feature by feature.\" Whereas Deere is focused on adding full autonomy to its own farm equipment, AGCO is eying the wider retrofit market, Crawford said. \"In summer 2023, we'll have a performance-enhancing retrofit kit available for multiple brands of machines,\" he said. \"Where others say we bring you autonomy with a half-million-dollar tractor,\" he said, alluding to the price tag of Deere's 8R, \"we have kits that allow you to do that with your existing fleet. We see a huge opportunity with the installed base, where farmers want to adopt technology to enhance their outcomes, and yet don't want to flip their entire fleet and make that massive investment.\" In 2016, Case IH, a subsidiary of CNH Industrial, headquartered in London, rolled up to the Farm Progress Show with what it called the Autonomous Concept Vehicle. The sleek prototype tractor, minus a driver's cab, hinted at the view of autonomy at the time. Fast forward six years, to September's Farm Progress Show, where Case IH unveiled its Trident 5550 autonomous applicator.", "techcrunch179": "Spraying plants with fertilizers and pesticides is typically a highly lossy affair \u2014 as little as 1% of the substances currently used in industrial and food production farming is actually taken up by the plant, while the rest leaches off into the soil. A new technology demonstrated for the first time by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Greg Lowry and his team reverses that \u2014 causing a plant to absorb molecules with up to 99% efficiency, meaning only 1% is wasted. There are efficiency improvements, and then there are technology demonstrations that could completely upend current methods of doing things \u2014 like this one. Lowry\u2019s research, which has been demonstrated as outlined in a peer-review publication now available in Nanoscale Communications, makes use of nanoparticles to coat molecular substances that you would want to be absorbed by a plant. These could include nutrients designed to optimize growth and crop yields, for instance, or pesticides that could protect them from destructive bugs and infestations. We covered this work last year, when it was still just at the pre-demonstration stage \u2014 now, Lowry\u2019s team has shown that you can indeed engineer nanoparticles specifically to target pores on the surface of a leaf. Essentially, it\u2019s like custom-creating Lego blocks for receptors on the leaf\u2019s surface and then tying the nutrients you want to deliver to those custom Lego blocks for a perfect fit. This demonstration bears out the team\u2019s hypothesis, which sets the stage for potential further development and, eventually, commercial application. The biggest potential commercial use of this technology could be in pesticides, as it\u2019s estimated that as much as 40% of potential crop yield is still lost to plant disease that\u2019s preventable with effective use of pesticides that can block them from entering through pores on leaves. They could also improve absorption of plant food and fertilizer designed to stimulate growth, and potentially these two uses could be combined into a single \u201cdose\u201d of nanoparticles that can do double duty, with great potential to increase plant and crop output.", "techcrunch180": "Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have discovered a new method for delivering key nutrients to plant roots \u2013 without having to ensure they\u2019re present in the soil where the plants are growing. The landmark study greatly increases the efficiency of surface delivery of nutrients and pesticides to plants. Currently, when crops are sprayed with stuff that\u2019s supposed to help them grow faster or better, the vast majority of that (up to 95 percent, according to CMU\u2019s engineering blog) will just end up either as concentrated deposits in the surrounding soil, or dissolving into ground water. In both cases, accumulation over time can have negative knock-on effects, in addition to being terribly inefficient at their primary task. This method, described by researchers in detail in a new academic paper, would manage to improve efficiency to nearly 100% absorption of nutrients and pesticides delivered as nanoparticles (particles smaller than 50 nanometers across \u2013 a human hair is about 75,000 nanometers wide, for context) sprayed onto the leaves of plants, which then make their way through the plant\u2019s internal vascular system all the way down into the root system. Using this method, agricultural professionals could also greatly improve delivery of plant antibiotics, making it easier and more cost-effective to treat plant diseases affecting crop yields. It would be cheaper to delivery all nutrients and pesticides, too, because the big bump in efficiency of uptake by the plants means you can use much less of anything you want to deliver to achieve your desired effect. This research could have huge impact in terms of addressing growing global food supply needs while making the most existing agricultural land footprint and decreasing the need for potentially damaging expansion of the same.", "techcrunch181": "Most people don\u2019t spend much time thinking about where their poultry comes from, much less what it was eating when it was alive but the feeding practices on large farms are harmful to the environment and have led to bland, unhealthy chickens.

Now that it's seeing more widespread adoption, do you agree with those claims? According to a new study, many people feel 5G connectivity is overhyped and have failed to notice any speed or reliability improvements since upgrading. Research from UK-based price comparison service and switching website Uswitch found that one in six 5G users feel the technology doesn't live up to its promise. Less than half said they notice faster speeds or more stable connections since jumping to the fifth-generation cellular network. One of the problems with 5G has long been its coverage in rural areas. That's an issue everywhere mobile networks are found, including the UK, where 17% of those who live outside of urban areas say they've never been able to connect to a 5G signal\u2014three times more than those in cities. Some mobile users in the countryside can't even get reliable connections to older networks. Only 48% of people in the county of Yorkshire said they could access 4G reliably, and 14% said they often had to revert to 2G. 5G advocates have talked about its lower latency and higher speeds enabling more applications for consumers, including the use of mobile virtual and augmented reality. Many point to the metaverse as one of the biggest areas that will benefit from 5G connectivity. But most people remain apathetic towards the concept, and a recent report predicting most business projects in this virtual realm will close by 2025 hasn't helped increase enthusiasm. While it might not be living up to the hype for some users, 5G still has the distinction of being the fastest-growing mobile communications technology ever. Ericsson said coverage reached roughly 25% at the end of 2021, hitting the milestone about 18 months faster than 4G. 5G is also expected to have around one billion users by the end of the year. Part of the reason why people feel somewhat disappointed in 5G is that we're yet to see its full potential; the technology is still in its relative infancy. As 5G expands\u2014it's expected to be the dominant network with 4.4 billion users by 2027\u2014so will the number of applications that take advantage of it. At least that's the plan.", "other news sites186": "Imagine you go to a zoology conference. The first speaker talks about her 3D model of a 12-legged purple spider that lives in the Arctic. There\u2019s no evidence it exists, she admits, but it\u2019s a testable hypothesis, and she argues that a mission should be sent off to search the Arctic for spiders. The second speaker has a model for a flying earthworm, but it flies only in caves. There\u2019s no evidence for that either, but he petitions to search the world\u2019s caves. The third one has a model for octopuses on Mars. It\u2019s testable, he stresses. Kudos to zoologists, I\u2019ve never heard of such a conference. But almost every particle physics conference has sessions just like this, except they do it with more maths. It has become common among physicists to invent new particles for which there is no evidence, publish papers about them, write more papers about these particles\u2019 properties, and demand the hypothesis be experimentally tested. Many of these tests have actually been done, and more are being commissioned as we speak. It is wasting time and money. Since the 1980s, physicists have invented an entire particle zoo, whose inhabitants carry names like preons, sfermions, dyons, magnetic monopoles, simps, wimps, wimpzillas, axions, flaxions, erebons, accelerons, cornucopions, giant magnons, maximons, macros, wisps, fips, branons, skyrmions, chameleons, cuscutons, planckons and sterile neutrinos, to mention just a few. We even had a (luckily short-lived) fad of \u201cunparticles\u201d. All experiments looking for those particles have come back empty-handed, in particular those that have looked for particles that make up dark matter, a type of matter that supposedly fills the universe and makes itself noticeable by its gravitational pull. However, we do not know that dark matter is indeed made of particles; and even if it is, to explain astrophysical observations one does not need to know details of the particles\u2019 behaviour. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) hasn\u2019t seen any of those particles either, even though, before its launch, many theoretical physicists were confident it would see at least a few. Talk to particle physicists in private, and many of them will admit they do not actually believe those particles exist. They justify their work by claiming that it is good practice, or that every once in a while one of them accidentally comes up with an idea that is useful for something else. An army of typewriting monkeys may also sometimes produce a useful sentence. But is this a good strategy? Experimental particle physicists know of the problem, and try to distance themselves from what their colleagues in theory development do. At the same time, they profit from it, because all those hypothetical particles are used in grant proposals to justify experiments. And so the experimentalists keep their mouths shut, too. This leaves people like me, who have left the field \u2013 I now work in astrophysics \u2013 as the only ones able and willing to criticise the situation. There are many factors that have contributed to this sad decline of particle physics. Partly the problem is social: most people who work in the field (I used to be one of them) genuinely believe that inventing particles is good procedure because it\u2019s what they have learned, and what all their colleagues are doing. But I believe the biggest contributor to this trend is a misunderstanding of Karl Popper\u2019s philosophy of science, which, to make a long story short, demands that a good scientific idea has to be falsifiable. Particle physicists seem to have misconstrued this to mean that any falsifiable idea is also good science. In the past, predictions for new particles were correct only when adding them solved a problem with the existing theories. For example, the currently accepted theory of elementary particles \u2013 the Standard Model \u2013 doesn\u2019t require new particles; it works just fine the way it is. The Higgs boson, on the other hand, was required to solve a problem. The antiparticles that Paul Dirac predicted were likewise necessary to solve a problem, and so were the neutrinos that were predicted by Wolfgang Pauli. The modern new particles don\u2019t solve any problems. In some cases, the new particles\u2019 task is to make a theory more aesthetically appealing, but in many cases their purpose is to fit statistical anomalies. Each time an anomaly is reported, particle physicists will quickly write hundreds of papers about how new particles allegedly explain the observation. This behaviour is so common they even have a name for it: \u201cambulance-chasing\u201d, after the anecdotal strategy of lawyers to follow ambulances in the hope of finding new clients. Ambulance-chasing is a good strategy to further one\u2019s career in particle physics. Most of those papers pass peer review and get published because they are not technically wrong. And since ambulance-chasers cite each other\u2019s papers, they can each rack up hundreds of citations quickly. But it\u2019s a bad strategy for scientific progress. After the anomaly has disappeared, those papers will become irrelevant. This procedure of inventing particles and then ruling them out has been going on so long that there are thousands of tenured professors with research groups who make a living from this. It has become generally accepted practice in the physics community. No one even questions whether it makes sense. At least not in public. I believe there are breakthroughs waiting to be made in the foundations of physics; the world needs technological advances more than ever before, and now is not the time to idle around inventing particles, arguing that even a blind chicken sometimes finds a grain. As a former particle physicist, it saddens me to see that the field has become a factory for useless academic papers.", "other news sites187": "This telescope is producing impeccable results, but do our models match its excellence? It has become exceedingly clear, over the past few months, that NASA's James Webb Space Telescope does exactly what it set out to do. Just as its creators had hoped, the multibillion-dollar machine is flawlessly \"unfolding the universe\" by revealing cosmic light we cannot see with our own eyes -- and its excellent results make even the most unlikely of stargazers feel alive. Because of this gold-plated telescope, Twitter went wild one day over a bleary red dot. For 48 hours, people worldwide were gawking at a galaxy born shortly after the birth of time itself. It would appear that, thanks to the technological prowess of the JWST, humanity stands united over stardust.

Amid personal awe, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology warn that we ought to consider one crucial scientific consequence of having a superhero telescope. If the JWST is like a zero-to-100 'scope upgrade, they wonder, is it possible our science models need a zero-to-100 reboot, too? Are the datasets scientists have been using for decades unable to match the device's power and therefore falling short in revealing what it's trying to tell us? \"The data we will be getting from the JWST will be incredible, but ... our insights will be limited if our models don't match it in quality,\" Clara Sousa-Silva, a quantum astrochemist at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, told CNET. And, according to a new study of which she's a co-author, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, the answer is yes. More specifically, this paper suggests some of the light-parsing tools scientists normally use to understand exoplanet atmospheres aren't totally equipped to deal with the JWST's exceptional light data. In the long run, such a hindrance may impact the most massive JWST quest of all: the hunt for extraterrestrial life. \"Currently, the model we use to decrypt spectral information is not up to par with the precision and quality of data we have from the James Webb telescope,\" Prajwal Niraula, graduate student at MIT's department of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"We need to up our game.\" NASA Here's one way to think about the conundrum. Imagine pairing the newest, most powerful Xbox console with the very first iteration of a TV. (Yes, I know the extreme hypothetical nature of my scenario). The Xbox would be trying to give the TV awesome high-resolution, colorful, beautiful graphics to show us -- but the TV wouldn't have the capacity to compute any of it. I wouldn't be surprised if the TV straight up exploded. But the point is you wouldn't know what the Xbox is trying to provide for you, unless you get an equally high-res TV. Similarly, in the vein of exoplanet discoveries, scientists feed a bunch of deep-space light, or photon, data into models that test for \"opacity.\" Opacity measures how easily photons pass through a material and differs depending on things like light wavelength, material temperature and pressure. This means every such interaction leaves behind a telltale signature of what the photon's properties are, and therefore, when it comes to exoplanets, what kind of chemical atmosphere those photons passed through to get to the light detector. That's how scientists sort of reverse-calculate, from light data, what an exoplanet's atmosphere is composed of. In this case, the detector liaison lies on the James Webb Space Telescope -- but in the team's new study, after putting the most commonly used opacity model to the test, the researchers saw JWST light data hitting what they call an \"accuracy wall.\" The model wasn't sensitive enough to parse stuff like whether a planet has an atmospheric temperature of 300 or 600 Kelvin, the researchers say, or whether a certain gas takes up 5% or 25% of the atmosphere. Such a difference is not only statistically significant, but per Niraula, also \"matters in order for us to constrain planetary formation mechanisms and reliably identify biosignatures.\" That is, evidence of alien life. \"We need to work on our interpretive tools,\" Sousa-Silva said, \"so that we don't find ourselves seeing something amazing through JWST but not knowing how to interpret it.\" T. Treu/GLASS-JWST/NASA/CSA/ESA/STScI Further, the team also found its models kind of disguising its uncertain readings. A few adjustments can easily paper over uncertainty, deeming results a good fit when they're incorrect. \"We found that there are enough parameters to tweak, even with a wrong model, to still get a good fit, meaning you wouldn't know that your model is wrong and what it's telling you is wrong,\" Julien de Wit, assistant professor at MIT's EAPS and study co-author, said in a statement. Going forward, the team urges opacity models be improved to accommodate our spectacular JWST revelations \u2013 especially calling for crossover studies between astronomy and spectroscopy. \"There is so much that could be done if we knew perfectly how light and matter interact,\" Niraula says. \"We know that well enough around the Earth's conditions, but as soon as we move to different types of atmospheres, things change, and that's a lot of data, with increasing quality, that we risk misinterpreting.\" De Wit compares the current opacity model to the ancient language translation tool the Rosetta Stone, explaining that so far, this Rosetta Stone has been doing OK, such as with the Hubble Space Telescope. \"But now that we're going to the next level with Webb's precision,\" the researcher said, \"our translation process will prevent us from catching important subtleties, such as those making the difference between a planet being habitable or not.\" As Sousa-Silva puts it, \"it's a call to improve our models, so that we will not miss the subtleties of data.\"", "other news sites188": "In a non peer-reviewed paper published on arXiv, Humphreys claims to have provided the most complete characterization of Starlink\u2019s signals to date. This information, he says, is the first step toward developing a new global navigation technology that would operate independently of GPS or its European, Russian, and Chinese equivalents. \u201cThe Starlink system signal is a closely guarded secret,\u201d says Humphreys. \u201cEven in our early discussions, when SpaceX was being more cooperative, they didn\u2019t reveal any of the signal structure to us. We had to start from scratch, building basically a little radio telescope to eavesdrop on their signals.\u201d To get the project started, UT Austin acquired a Starlink terminal and used it to stream high-definition tennis videos of Rafael Nadal from YouTube. This provided a constant source of Starlink signals that a separate nearby antenna could listen in on. Humphreys quickly realized that Starlink relies on a technology called orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM is an efficient method of encoding digital transmissions, originally developed at Bell Labs in the 1960s and now used in Wi-Fi and 5G. \u201cOFDM is all the rage,\u201d says Mark Psiaki, a GPS expert and aerospace professor at Virginia Tech. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to pack the most bits per second into a given bandwidth.\u201d The UT Austin researchers did not try to break Starlink\u2019s encryption or access any user data coming down from satellites. Instead, they sought out synchronization sequences\u2014predictable, repeating signals beamed down by the satellites in orbit to help receivers coordinate with them. Not only did Humphreys find such sequences, but \u201cwe were pleasantly surprised to find that they [had] more synchronization sequences than is strictly required,\u201d he says. Each sequence also contains clues to the satellite\u2019s distance and velocity. With the Starlink satellites transmitting about four sequences every millisecond \u201cthat\u2019s just wonderful for dual use of their system for positioning,\u201d says Humphreys. If the terrestrial receiver has a good idea of the satellites\u2019 movements\u2014which SpaceX shares online to reduce the risk of orbital collisions\u2014it can use the sequences\u2019 regularity to work out which satellite they came from, and then calculate the distance to that satellite.

Companies use GPS to track trucks and keep them on time and their cargo secure. Little wonder, then, that criminals are turning to cheap GPS jamming devices to ransack the cargo on roads and at sea, a problem that's getting worse but may be ameliorated with a new generation of safety technology designed to overcome threats from jamming. In case you aren't a master criminal or a secret agent, here's some background. The core problem for any system using GPS is that the signals are extremely weak, an inevitable byproduct of the vast distances those signals need to travel. Jammers work by overpowering GPS signals by emitting a signal at the same frequency, just a bit more powerful than the original. The typical jammers used for cargo hijackings are able to jam frequencies from up to 5 miles away rendering GPS tracking and security apparatuses, such as those used by trucking syndicates, totally useless. In Mexico, jammers are used in some 85% of cargo truck thefts. Statistics are harder to come by in the United States, but there can be little doubt the devices are prevalent and widely used. Russia is currently availing itself of the technology to jam commercial planes in Ukraine. As we've covered, the proliferating commercial drone sector is also prey to attack. Drones often rely on GPS for navigation as well as security tracking, making them especially vulnerable. Drones equipped with back-up methods still often rely on GPS for positioning, navigation, and stabilization, making jammers a way to take a drone down and potentially cause harm to life and property. During a light show in Hong Kong in 2018, a jamming device caused 46 drones to fall out of the sky, raising public awareness of the issue. Technologies are emerging to counter this problem. A company called infiniDome has developed an anti-jamming solution that is compatible with almost any GPS-based telematics unit, a catch-all term for the technologies trucking companies use to track and monitor their assets on the road. InfiniDome's \"OtoSphere\" is a small add-on device created for commercial GNSS receivers, providing protection and increasing the resiliency of GPS devices against jamming attacks. By identifying and preventing instances of jamming, fleet operators are able to prevent cargo theft. Other companies, such as Sepentrio, are also taking GPS jamming in drone applications seriously with integrated sensor solutions. In the meantime, governments are hoping to fight back through regulation, although that may be a losing battle. Mexico passed an anti-jamming law in late 2020, allowing for penalties of 12-15 years in prison for persons caught using such devices while committing crimes. Nevertheless, jammers remain widely available online, where they can be purchased for as little as $50.", "other news sites191": "A 16-person team \u2014 including an astronaut, a space-treaty drafter, a boxer, and several astrobiologists \u2014 will soon begin its review of unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) for NASA.

However, these technologies have not been able to identify where it came from, how much water there is or even if it is, in fact, water. Now, utilizing Goddard technology, engineer Dr. Berhanu Bulcha has developed an instrument to definitively locate and identify water sources on the Moon, according to a NASA post. \"Other missions found hydration on the Moon, but that could indicate hydroxyl or water. If it's water, where did it come from? Is it indigenous to the formation of the Moon, or did it arrive later by comet impacts? How much water is there? We need to answer these questions because water is critical for survival and can be used to make fuel for further exploration,\" said Dr. Bulcha. SEE: NASA enters contract for computing processor that will change space exploration NASA prioritizes identifying water and other resources because it is crucial to exploring the Moon and other objects in the solar system. Dr. Bulcha said that an instrument known as a heterodyne spectrometer could zoom in on particular frequencies to locate and identify the hydration on the Moon. A stable, high-power terahertz laser that is needed for the spectrometer was prototyped in collaboration with Longwave Photonics through NASA's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. \"The problem with existing laser technology is that no materials have the right properties to produce a terahertz wave,\" said Dr. Bulcha. SEE: NASA is blazing an inspirational trail. We need to make sure everyone can follow it Hydrogen-containing compounds such as water emit photons in the terahertz frequency range, says NASA. However, traditional lasers fall short in the portion of the spectrum known as the terahertz gap. In order to fill the gap, Dr. Bulch's team is developing quantum cascade lasers. To bypass issues with the quantum cascade laser beams spreading out in a large angle, the team, using innovative technology supported by Goddard's Internal Research and Development (IRAD) funding, integrated the laser on a waveguide with a thin optical antenna to tighten the beam. Dr. Bulch hopes to have a flight-ready laser for NASA's Artemis program.

Turns out we're getting jumbled data here on Earth, because the probe's attitude articulation and control system (AACS) has been sending back information through an onboard computer that had stopped working years ago. The computer was corrupting the data before it even went out. Voyager project manager Suzanne Dodd said that when her team suspected that this was the issue, they implemented a low-risk fix: They commanded the AACS to send its data through the probe's working computer again. While the engineers have fixed the glitch, they've yet to figure out why the AACS started routing information through the old computer in the first place. They believe it was triggered by a faulty command by another onboard computer, which was itself triggered by an underlying issue with the spacecraft.

It\u2019s part of a rebranding initiative that the organization kicked off last year with the introduction of a new series of packaging, port, and cable logos. But with its latest set of branding and logo guidelines it\u2019s going even further, simplifying its legacy branding and signaling the end of the decade-old SuperSpeed branding. If the name doesn\u2019t ring any bells, then that\u2019s probably because you (like most other people) simply referred to it by its USB 3 version number. Alongside it, the USB-IF is also ditching USB4 as a consumer-facing brand name. An old Certified SuperSpeed logo. Photo by The Verge The changes came into effect this quarter, and could start appearing on products and packaging as early as by the end of the year, according to the USB-IF\u2019s president and chief operating officer Jeff Ravencraft. But any products that were certified prior to the shift will still be able to use the old brand names. In a Zoom call, Ravencraft explains that the new branding is designed to prioritize what the standards can actually do, rather than the USB version they\u2019re based on. \u201cAs we started to update our branding we did a lot of focus group studies with many different types of consumers,\u201d he tells The Verge, \u201cand none of those people understood the messaging and the branding, and they don\u2019t understand revision control or spec names.\u201d The new range of USB packaging and device logos, no \u201cSuperSpeed\u201d or \u201cUSB4\u201d branding in sight. Image: USB-IF \u201cWhat consumers want to know \u2014 and what we learned \u2014 is they want to know two things: What\u2019s the highest data performance level the product can achieve? And what\u2019s the highest power level I can get or drive from this product,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s all they want to know.\u201d So, instead of referring to USB devices by a version number or vague name like \u201cSuperSpeed,\u201d the USB-IF wants companies to use branding that reflects these all-important specs. \u201cSuperSpeed USB 5Gbps\u201d and \u201cSuperSpeed USB 10Gbps\u201d are now just \u201cUSB 5Gbps\u201d and \u201cUSB 10Gbps\u201d respectively, while \u201cUSB4 40Gbps\u201d and \u201cUSB4 20Gbps\u201d are becoming \u201cUSB 40Gbps\u201d and \u201cUSB 20Gbps.\u201d Branding for certified USB Type-C cables is also being updated. Rather than simply listing their data transfer speeds, cables will also (for the most part) have to list the charging wattage they\u2019re capable of carrying. So a cable can\u2019t just be branded as being a 40Gbps cable as with last year\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019ll now also have to list a charging speed like 60W or 240W. It\u2019s important to note that using these brandnames is far from mandatory. They apply to USB devices certified by the USB-IF, but these only cover a fraction of the total number of USB products out on the market. That\u2019s because unlike specifications like Thunderbolt 4, which manufacturers have to license directly from Intel, USB is an open standard that anyone is free to use. That\u2019s allowed it to become as ubiquitous as it is, but means the USB-IF is all-but-powerless to stop companies from building USB products that don\u2019t use the specification properly. And no one\u2019s going to stop them from branding a device as USB4 Version 2, or offer no branding at all. Certified cables will now need to show maximum wattage alongside data transfer speeds, unless they\u2019re using the older Hi-Speed standard. Image: USB-IF The underlying USB version numbers aren\u2019t going anywhere. But while manufacturers and OEMs still have to wrap their heads around specs like USB4 Gen3x2 and USB4 Version 2, the USB-IF doesn\u2019t want customers to care what version number their devices or cables are using. Yes, USB4 Version 2.0 is a terrible name, but the idea is that most consumers should end up seeing it branded as USB 80Gbps. This branding applies regardless of the specific USB port being used, whether it\u2019s old fashioned USB Type-A, microUSB, or USB Type-C. But naturally the higher performance logos will only be applicable to USB Type-C, which is the only connector to support transfer speeds over 10Gbps. Putting the two most important specs front-and-center A key exception to all these rules is USB Hi-Speed, more commonly known by its version number USB 2.0, which maxes out at a now achingly slow 480Mbps. But the USB-IF\u2019s reasoning is that if it were to be completely consistent, and brand USB 2.0 ports as \u201cUSB 480Mbps,\u201d then it\u2019d risk confusing customers who might see the branding next to a \u201cUSB 5Gbps\u201d device and wrongly assume it\u2019s faster because of the higher number. Original USB 1.0 branding is also unaffected by this year\u2019s changes. As my former colleague Chaim Gartenberg wrote last year, even with new simplified branding the situation is still far from perfect. Ideally we wouldn\u2019t need half a dozen different logos to describe all the variations of a single connector. But Ravencraft argues that it wouldn\u2019t make sense to force every manufacturer to support the highest specs. \u201cA USB printer will never be USB4 Version 2,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for it, and no one\u2019s going to put the cost of this higher end technology into a printer or a keyboard or a mouse.\u201d Instead, the \u201cbillions\u201d of devices on the market that only need the transfer speeds of older standards like USB 2.0 (ahem, sorry, USB Hi-Speed) can continue to use them. There\u2019ll still be lots of different USB versions out there The new branding guidelines also don\u2019t cover absolutely everything that a USB cable can do. There\u2019s no information on resolutions or refresh rates if you need a cable that\u2019s going to carry a DisplayPort video signal, nor is there anything to say how a cable might handle taking a PCIe signal. The logos are focused on the USB-IF\u2019s own standards like USB Power Delivery. That also means they don\u2019t offer the same guarantees if you need support for a competing fast-charging standard like Qualcomm\u2019s Quick Charge.", "other news sites196": "NASA is just days away from slamming a spacecraft into an asteroid 7 million miles (11 million kilometers) from Earth. The agency's long-awaited Double Asteroid Redirection Test ( DART ) mission will impact with the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos on Monday (Sept. 26), if all goes according to plan. The DART mission launched on Nov. 23, 2021 on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and is now hurtling through deep space toward the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos. The mission, which is managed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL), is humanity's first attempt to determine if we could alter the course of an asteroid, a feat that might one day be required to save human civilization. While changing the orbit of an asteroid 7 million miles away sounds daunting, DART team members from NASA and JHUAPL said during a media briefing on Thursday (Sept. 22) that they are confident that the years of planning that have gone into the mission will lead to success. Related: NASA's DART asteroid-impact mission will be a key test of planetary defense Traveling at speeds of 4.1 miles per second (6.6 km/s), or 14,760 mph (23,760 kph), the DART spacecraft will impact the 560-foot-wide (170 meters) Dimorphos, a moonlet that orbits the other member of its binary system, the 2,600-foot-wide (780 m) asteroid Didymos. Doing so, NASA believes, will shift Dimorphos' orbital period enough to alter its gravitational effects on the larger Didymos, changing the trajectory of the pair. DART will crash into Dimorphos, causing a change to the moonlet's orbit. (Image credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL) Katherine Calvin, chief scientist and senior climate advisor at NASA, said that while DART will be a key test of this \"kinetic impactor\" planetary defense strategy, the mission will also produce valuable science that will allow astronomers to peer back into the deep history of the solar system. \"We're looking at asteroids to make sure that we don't find ourselves in their path. We also study asteroids to learn more about the formation and history of our solar system. Every time we see an asteroid, we're catching a glimpse of a fossil of the early solar system,\" Calvin said. \"These remnants capture a time when planets like Earth were forming,\" she added. \"Asteroids and other small bodies also delivered water, other ingredients of life to Earth as it was maturing. We're studying these to learn more about the history of our solar system.\" Lindley Johnson, planetary defense officer at NASA, said that DART marks a turning point in the history of the human species. \"This is an exciting time, not only for the agency, but for space history and the history of humankind,\" Johnson said during Thursday's briefing. \"It's quite frankly the first time that we are able to demonstrate that we have not only the knowledge of the hazards posed by these asteroids and comets that are left over from the formation of the solar system, but also have the technology that we could deflect one from a course inbound to impact the Earth. So this demonstration is extremely important to our future.\" That sentiment was echoed by Tom Statler, a DART program scientist at NASA. \"The first test is a test of our ability to build an autonomously guided spacecraft that will actually achieve the kinetic impact on the asteroid. The second test is a test of how the actual asteroid responds to the kinetic impact,\" Statler said. \"Because, at the end of the day, the real question is: How effectively did we move the asteroid, and can this technique of kinetic impact be used in the future if we ever needed to?\" Read more: DART asteroid mission: NASA's first planetary defense spacecraft The asteroid Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos are shown in a composite image taken by DART's DRACO instrument on July 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA JPL DART Navigation Team) The outcome of the DART mission on Monday (Sept. 26) will certainly help answer that question, and many of the DART team members shared their confidence in the mission during the briefing. Edward Reynolds, DART project manager at JHUAPL, said the spacecraft is ready to smash itself to pieces on the surface of Dimorphos when the time comes. \"What we can say at this point is that all subsystems on the spacecraft are green, they're healthy, they're performing very well. We have plenty of propellant and we have plenty of power,\" Reynolds said. \"We've been doing a bunch of rehearsals, and some of the rehearsals are very nominal.\" \"At this point, I can say that the team is ready,\" Reynolds added. \"The ground systems are ready, and the spacecraft is healthy and on track for an impact on Monday.\" Engineers on the DART team are watching the spacecraft's trajectory carefully over the coming days leading up to the impact, which should occur at 7:14 p.m. EDT (2314 GMT) on Monday (Sept. 26). Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at JHUAPL, said that the team is still making sure the impactor spacecraft is on course. \"Over the next couple of days, we're actually still performing some trajectory correction maneuvers to make sure that we are on the right path to hit the asteroid,\" Adams said. \"We rehearsed a lot. But as we go through the cruise phase, we update parameters in the spacecraft to make sure that we can actually hit the asteroid. And so in the last couple of days, we'll update those parameters; we'll do checks like streaming images back to Earth.\" \"So in the next few days, we'll take more images of the Didymos system, we'll do trajectory correction maneuvers, and then at 24 hours prior to impact, it's all hands on deck,\" she added. Adams said the team has 21 contingencies in place in case DART's Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real Time Navigation (Smart Nav) system determines that the spacecraft is off course. \"We've planned for all the things, and we're ready to intervene. And we have been rehearsing this for quite some time.\" NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, is moved into a shipping container for its trip to the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for a launch on Nov. 24, 2021. (Image credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Ed Whitman) The 21st contingency the team has planned for is DART's survival. In the event that DART misses Dimorphos, Adams says the team will immediately begin processing the data the spacecraft collected and plan for a possible impact with other objects. \"We're going to sit down back into our seats and we're going to start preserving all the data on board if it misses. And we'll have time with our Deep Space Network right afterwards to be able to actually get all that data down,\" Adams said. \"And then we'll start conserving propellant and we'll start looking for [other] objects to come back to.\" In response to a question from Space.com concerning any flight testing the team has conducted, Adams mentioned a recent set of images the DART spacecraft's DRACO camera took of Jupiter and its four big Galilean moons . The DART team captured the images in order to \"fool\" the DART spacecraft's SMART Nav system so that its tracking capabilities could be tested. \"We actually watched Europa exit from behind Jupiter. And we fooled our Smart Nav that Jupiter was Didymos and Europa was Dimorphos, and we actually watched the separation happen,\" Adams said. That's important, she added, \"because in the last four hours during our terminal phase, when the spacecraft is completely autonomous, we're going to watch Dimorphos emerge from behind Didymos. So, we already trained the system to do this in flight. So we're looking forward to it. I think we can do it.\" Statler reiterated that confidence, adding that, while this type of mission was once the stuff of fantasy, the DART team believes we now have the tools and the knowledge to carry out a successful planetary defense mission. \"We're moving an asteroid. We are changing the motion of a natural celestial body in space,\" Statler said. \"Humanity has never done that before. And this is the stuff of science fiction books, and really corny episodes of 'Star Trek' from when I was a kid. And now it's real. And that's kind of astonishing that we are actually doing that and what that bodes for the future: What we can do, as well as our discussions of what humanity should do. \"It opens up an amazing frontier,\" he added. \"It's very exciting.\"", "other news sites197": "After nearly a year in transit, NASA's experimental Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which sought to answer the questions, \"Could you potentially shove a asteroid off its planet-killing trajectory by hitting it with a specially designed satellite? How about several?\" has successfully collided with the Dimorphos asteroid. Results and data from the collision are still coming in but NASA ground control confirms that the DART impact vehicle has intercepted the target asteroid. Yes, granted, Dimorphos is roughly the size of an American football stadium but space is both very large and very dark, and both asteroid and spacecraft were moving quite fast at the time. NASA \"It's been a successful completion of the first part of the world's first planetary defense test,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said after the impact. \"I believe it's going to teach us how one day to protect our own planet from an incoming asteroid. We are showing that planetary defense is a global endeavor and it is very possible to save our planet.\" NASA launched the DART mission in November, 2021 in an effort to explore the use of defensive satellites as a means of planetary defense against Near Earth Objects. The vending machine-sized DART impactor vehicle was travelling at roughly 14,000 MPH when it fatally crossed Dimorphos' path nearly 68 million miles away from Earth. Whether future iterations of a planetary defense system brimming with satellites willing to go all June Bug vs Chrysler Windshield against true planet-killer asteroids remains to be seen. Dimorphos itself is the smaller of a pair of gravitationally-entangled asteroids \u2014 its parent rock is more than five times as large \u2014 but both are dwarfed by the space rock that hit Earth 66 million years ago, wiping out 75 percent of multicellular life on the planet while gouging out the Gulf of Mexico. NASA The DART team will likely be poring over the data generated by both the impactor and cameras released before the spacecraft made its final approach for days to come. However the team will consider shortening the orbital track of Dimorphos around Didymos by 10 minutes an ideal outcome, though any change of at least 73 seconds will still be hailed as a rousing success. The team will have to observe Dimorphos' orbit for half a day to confirm their success, as the moonlet needs nearly 12 hours to complete an circuit around Didymos.

Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, astronomers report in the Oct. 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but it\u2019s hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form. Science News headlines, in your inbox Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your email inbox every Thursday. Client key* E-mail Address* Sign up Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up. Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (SN: 7/11/22). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified. For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues. \u201cWhen we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called \u2018the sparkles,\u2019\u201d says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (SN: 10/15/20). \u201cThe outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?\u201d Mowla says. Were they born at \u201ccosmic noon,\u201d 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at \u201ccosmic dawn,\u201d when stars were first able to form at all (SN: 3/4/22)? Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question. Zooming into one part of JWST\u2019s image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler. Some of the dots may be globular clusters of same-age stars formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. L. Mowla et al/The Astrophysical Journal Letters 2022 Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before. \u201cWhen we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,\u201d says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto. That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, \u201cthere\u2019s only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,\u201d he says. In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon. Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universe\u2019s history. They could also help unravel galaxies\u2019 formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWST\u2019s first year that could do just that. Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,\u201d Claeyssens says. \u201cJames Webb will be a game changer for this field.\u201d", "other news sites199": " Sept 26 (Reuters) - NASA's DART spacecraft successfully slammed into a distant asteroid at hypersonic speed on Monday in the world's first test of a planetary defense system, designed to prevent a potential doomsday meteorite collision with Earth. Humanity's first attempt to alter the motion of an asteroid or any celestial body played out in a NASA webcast from the mission operations center outside Washington, D.C., 10 months after DART was launched. The livestream showed images taken by DART's camera as the cube-shaped \"impactor\" vehicle, no bigger than a vending machine with two rectangular solar arrays, streaked into the asteroid Dimorphos, about the size of a football stadium, at 7:14 p.m. EDT (2314 GMT) some 6.8 million miles (11 million km) from Earth. The $330 million mission, some seven years in development, was devised to determine if a spacecraft is capable of changing the trajectory of an asteroid through sheer kinetic force, nudging it off course just enough to keep Earth out of harm's way. Whether the experiment succeeded beyond accomplishing its intended impact will not be known until further ground-based telescope observations of the asteroid next month. But NASA officials hailed the immediate outcome of Monday's test, saying the spacecraft achieved its purpose. \"NASA works for the benefit of humanity, so for us it\u2019s the ultimate fulfillment of our mission to do something like this - a technology demonstration that, who knows, some day could save our home,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, a retired astronaut, said minutes after the impact. DART, launched by a SpaceX rocket in November 2021, made most of its voyage under the guidance of NASA's flight directors, with control handed over to an autonomous on-board navigation system in the final hours of the journey. Monday evening's bullseye impact was monitored in near real time from the mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Cheers erupted from the control room as second-by-second images of the target asteroid, captured by DART's onboard camera, grew larger and ultimately filled the TV screen of NASA's live webcast just before the signal was lost, confirming the spacecraft had crashed into Dimorphos. DART's celestial target was an oblong asteroid \"moonlet\" about 560 feet (170 meters) in diameter that orbits a parent asteroid five times larger called Didymos as part of a binary pair with the same name, the Greek word for twin. Neither object presents any actual threat to Earth, and NASA scientists said their DART test could not create a new hazard by mistake. Dimorphos and Didymos are both tiny compared with the cataclysmic Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, wiping out about three-quarters of the world's plant and animal species including the dinosaurs. [1/4] The last complete image of asteroid moonlet Dimorphos, taken by the DRACO imager on NASA's DART mission 12 kilometers from the asteroid and 2 seconds before impact, showing a patch of the asteroid that is 31 meters across, released September 26, 2022. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Handout via REUTERS 1 2 3 4 Smaller asteroids are far more common and present a greater theoretical concern in the near term, making the Didymos pair suitable test subjects for their size, according to NASA scientists and planetary defense experts. A Dimorphos-sized asteroid, while not capable of posing a planet-wide threat, could level a major city with a direct hit. Also, the two asteroids' relative proximity to Earth and dual configuration make them ideal for the first proof-of-concept mission of DART, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test. ROBOTIC SUICIDE MISSION The mission represented a rare instance in which a NASA spacecraft had to crash to succeed. DART flew directly into Dimorphos at 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph), creating the force scientists hope will be enough to shift its orbital track closer to the parent asteroid. APL engineers said the spacecraft was presumably smashed to bits and left a small impact crater in the boulder-strewn surface of the asteroid. The DART team said it expects to shorten the orbital path of Dimorphos by 10 minutes but would consider at least 73 seconds a success, proving the exercise as a viable technique to deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth - if one were ever discovered. A nudge to an asteroid millions of miles away years in advance could be sufficient to safely reroute it. Earlier calculations of the starting location and orbital period of Dimorphos were made during a six-day observation period in July and will be compared with post-impact measurements made in October to determine whether the asteroid budged and by how much. Monday's test also was observed by a camera mounted on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft released from DART days in advance, as well as by ground-based observatories and the Hubble and Webb space telescopes, but images from those were not immediately available. DART is the latest of several NASA missions in recent years to explore and interact with asteroids, primordial rocky remnants from the solar system's formation more than 4.5 billion years ago. Last year, NASA launched a probe on a voyage to the Trojan asteroid clusters orbiting near Jupiter, while the grab-and-go spacecraft OSIRIS-REx is on its way back to Earth with a sample collected in October 2020 from the asteroid Bennu. The Dimorphos moonlet is one of the smallest astronomical objects to receive a permanent name and is one of 27,500 known near-Earth asteroids of all sizes tracked by NASA. Although none are known to pose a foreseeable hazard to humankind, NASA estimates that many more asteroids remain undetected in the near-Earth vicinity.

Relativity\u2019s Terran 1 rocket will carry Momentus\u2019 small and medium-sized satellite payloads on its rocket and Momentus will then move those satellites into geosynchronous orbit using its own in-space shuttle technology. The deal between Momentus and Relativity covers the first Terran 1 launch scheduled for 2021, with the option for five additional Relativity launches, according to a statement from the company. Carrying Momentus\u2019 payloads enables the company to include more diverse ranges of orbits for Terran 1\u2019s initial launch, including geostationary transfer orbit, Lunar and deep space orbits, lower inclinations and phasing multiple spacecraft in low Earth orbit, the company said. The tie-up links two of Y Combinator\u2019s space-focused alumni, with Momentus graduating in 2018 and Relativity launching from the accelerator in 2016. In July, Momentus closed on a $25 million round of funding to move its business from simply providing a thruster for existing small-sats to becoming a full-service provider of orbital transportation services for payloads.

See More \u2192 Humans have spent centuries wondering if we are alone in the universe, or if there are alien beings somewhere in the vast reaches of space. Given that Earth remains the only planet that we know supports life\u2014and we are not even sure how it arose here\u2014it remains challenging to assess the odds that extraterrestrial life exists based on this lonely sample size of one. These limitations in our knowledge prompted the theoretical physicist Brandon Carter to propose decades ago that the presence of life on Earth does not indicate that the mysterious process of abiogenesis, in which living organisms arise from inanimate matter, is more or less likely to occur on other planets. Now, a mathematician has revisited this idea and come to a very different conclusion with a more optimistic view about the existence of alien life. Advertisement During the 1970s, Carter developed an influential series of arguments based on this \u201cselection effect\u201d of our own existence. This view suggests that humans, as a species that lives on a planet where life emerged, cannot make objective inferences about the possibility that life may be present on other worlds, in part because we have no idea if Earth is typical of planets that might host life. For this reason, we cannot exclude the possibility that Earth may be the only world in the universe that supports living beings. This argument is widely accepted in the scientific community. But now, Daniel Whitmire, an astrophysicist who teaches mathematics at the University of Arkansas, has presented a new challenge to Carter\u2019s assumptions that suggests \u201cthe occurrence of abiogenesis on Earth-like planets is not rare,\u201d according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Astrobiology. Whitmire told Motherboard over email that up until last year, he was one of countless researchers who thought that the Carter argument was \u201cunassailable.\u201d But he started to have doubts about its foundations during the peer review process for a different paper, when an anonymous reviewer offered an analogy between abiogenesis and human conception that inspired Whitmire to counter these long-held assumptions. In order to rethink Carter\u2019s assertion that we can\u2019t judge if abiogenesis on Earth was easy or hard, Whitmire draws a comparison to his own existence, noting that he is here regardless of whether his conception, or origin, was easy or hard. For the purposes of this thought experiment, conception would be \u201chard\u201d if contraception was used, and \u201ceasy\u201d if it was not used. The basic idea is that, rather than a person\u2019s existence not telling us anything about whether conceiving them was easy or hard, it can be shown mathematically that it was most likely easy. Advertisement \u201cThe Conception analogy stuck in my mind and ultimately I came to believe that the Carter argument must be wrong,\u201d Whitmire said. \u201cBut at that point I didn't know why it was wrong.\u201d To tug on this thread, Whitmire developed a mathematics-based argument that builds on the analogy with the help of the so-called \u201cold evidence problem\u201d in Bayesian Confirmation Theory, which concerns the incorporation of newly-acquired data into existing hypotheses. The details are pretty complicated, but the gist is that while Carter holds that old evidence (i.e. the existence of life on Earth) has no influence on the probability of its occurrence elsewhere, Whitmire\u2019s paper attempts to show that, actually, this \u201cold evidence\u201d does in fact increase the probability of it occurring in the first place. Under this novel framework, both abiogenesis on Earth and Whitmire\u2019s conception are more likely to have been easy than hard, which suggests that life on other planets may be common. These ideas are a bit heady, and Whitmire notes that they might not actually have that much of an impact on anyone\u2019s hopes or doubts about the probability of alien life existing somewhere in space. \u201cMy opinion is that what many scientists believe about life and intelligent life in the universe is almost political or psychological,\u201d Whitmire said. \u201cIf they want to believe life is rare they will point to the Carter argument or some other argument, like the statistical improbability of abiogenesis, to make their case.\u201d Advertisement Whitmire's formula. AB means abiogenesis, and LoE means life on Earth. Likewise, Whitmire added that those who want to believe life is abundant can find evidence for that position in other studies, including his new paper. \u201cThere is no reason that I know of (outside of my paper) for any objective optimism about abiogenesis being easy, yet this is the belief of most astrobiologists in spite of the Carter argument,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps my paper will give some objective credence to this subjective belief. That said, I think that arguments like mine and Carter's have some influence but the dominant attitude is that since none of the arguments are 100 percent, only future observations will decide.\u201d Fortunately, we live in an era packed with exciting missions focused on the search for extraterrestrial life, both inside our solar system and beyond it. NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient life on Mars, and future missions may scout out Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa or Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, which are both considered to be potentially habitable. Next-generation observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope, have the capacity to spot signs of life (or biosignatures) on planets in other star systems, and astronomers are scanning the skies for messages from technologically advanced aliens. Of course, all of these efforts could come up short in the search for life beyond Earth. But just one detection of life beyond our planet\u2014even if it were microbial, or long-extinct\u2014would validate Whitmire\u2019s new argument that abiogenesis is not rare in the universe.", "other news sites203": "Clear your plans on Saturday: NASA says we\u2019re going to have a rocket launch. The space agency moved the date for the next Artemis I rocket launch attempt to Saturday, September 3rd, after determining that the initial plan for Friday was going to run into bad weather. There was a 60 percent chance that the launch would have been delayed for weather on Friday, officials said during a media briefing. The two-hour launch window opens at 2:17PM. This will be NASA\u2019s second attempt this week at launching its massive next-generation rockets. The first attempted launch on Monday was scrubbed after one of the four RS-25 engines failed to reach the appropriate temperature to allow for liftoff. This will be NASA\u2019s second attempt this week at launching its massive next-generation rockets The Artemis I mission is comprised of the 322-foot tall Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, with the Orion crew capsule at the top. If the launch is successful, the 39-day mission will see SLS carry the uncrewed Orion to an altitude of just under 4,000 kilometers before the two craft separate and the core stage of the rocket falls back to Earth. Orion will continue onward to the Moon, which it will orbit for six days before returning to Earth. The capsule is scheduled to splash down in the ocean on October 11th.", "other news sites204": "Researchers created a new system that uses infrared light to safely transfer high levels of power over distances of up to 30 meters. This type of long-range optical wireless power transfer system could enable real-time power transmission to fixed and mobile receivers. Credit: Jinyong Ha, Sejong University Imagine walking into an airport or grocery store and your smartphone automatically starts charging. This could be a reality one day, thanks to a new wireless laser charging system that overcomes some of the challenges that have hindered previous attempts to develop safe and convenient on-the-go charging systems. \"The ability to power devices wirelessly could eliminate the need to carry around power cables for our phones or tablets,\" said research team leader Jinyong Ha from Sejong University in South Korea. \"It could also power various sensors such as those in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors used for monitoring processes in manufacturing plants.\" In Optics Express, the researchers describe their new system, which uses infrared light to safely transfer high levels of power. Laboratory tests showed that it could transfer 400 mW light power over distances of up to 30 meters. This power is sufficient for charging sensors, and with further development, it could be increased to levels necessary to charge mobile devices. Several techniques have been studied for long-range wireless power transfer. However, it has been difficult to safely send enough power over meter-level distances. To overcome this challenge, the researchers optimized a method called distributed laser charging, which has recently gained more attention for this application because it provides safe high-power illumination with less light loss. \"While most other approaches require the receiving device to be in a special charging cradle or to be stationary, distributed laser charging enables self-alignment without tracking processes as long as the transmitter and receiver are in the line of sight of each other,\" said Ha. \"It also automatically shifts to a safe low power delivery mode if an object or a person blocks the line of sight.\" Going the distance Distributed laser charging works somewhat like a traditional laser but instead of the optical components of the laser cavity being integrated into one device, they are separated into a transmitter and receiver. When the transmitter and receiver are within a line of sight, a laser cavity is formed between them over the air\u2014or free space\u2014which allows the system to deliver light-based power. If an obstacle cuts the transmitter-receiver line of sight, the system automatically switches to a power-safe mode, achieving hazard-free power delivery in the air. In the new system, the researchers used an erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical power source with a central wavelength of 1550 nm. This wavelength range is in the safest region of the spectrum and poses no danger to human eyes or skin at the power used. Another key component was a wavelength division multiplexing filter that created a narrowband beam with optical power within the safety limits for free space propagation. \"In the receiver unit, we incorporated a spherical ball lens retroreflector to facilitate 360-degree transmitter-receiver alignment, which maximized the power transfer efficiency,\" said Ha. \"We experimentally observed that the system's overall performance depended on the refractive index of the ball lens, with a 2.003 refractive index being the most effective.\" Laboratory testing To demonstrate the system, the researchers set up a 30-meter separation between a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter was made of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier optical source, and the receiver unit included a retroreflector, a photovoltaic cell that converts the optical signal to electrical power and an LED that illuminates when power is being delivered. This receiver, which is about 10 by 10 millimeters, could easily be integrated into devices and sensors. The experimental results showed that a single-channel wireless optical power transfer system could provide an optical power of 400 mW with a channel linewidth of 1 nm over a distance of 30 meters. The photovoltaic converted this to an electrical power of 85 mW. The researchers also showed that the system automatically shifted to a safe power transfer mode when the line of sight was interrupted by a human hand. In this mode, the transmitter produced an incredibly low intensity light that did not pose any risk to people. \"Using the laser charging system to replace power cords in factories could save on maintenance and replacement costs,\" said Ha. \"This could be particularly useful in harsh environments where electrical connections can cause interference or pose a fire hazard.\" Now that they have demonstrated the system, the researchers are working to make it more practical. For example, the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell could be increased to better convert light into electrical power. They also plan to develop a way to use the system to charge multiple receivers simultaneously.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. CNN \u2014 The Artemis I mega moon rocket is gearing up for another test Wednesday before its next launch attempt to journey around the moon and back. The mission team is aiming to begin the Artemis I cryogenic demonstration test at 7:15 a.m. ET on Wednesday, and NASA will share live coverage on its website. The Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft continue to sit on the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Since the second scrubbed launch attempt of the uncrewed Artemis I mission on September 3, engineers have replaced two seals on an interface for the liquid hydrogen fuel line between the rocket and mobile launcher, according to NASA officials. These seals were associated with a large hydrogen leak that led to the scrub of the launch attempt. When engineers replaced the seal on an 8-inch (20-centeimeter) quick disconnect line for hydrogen, they found a \u201cwitness marker,\u201d or indentation on the seal associated with foreign object debris, said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager, at a Monday NASA press conference. The team did not recover any piece of debris, but the dent was clear and pointed to a problem that contributed to the hydrogen leak, Sarafin said. The indentation was under 0.01 inch (0.3 millimeter), but it allows pressurized gas to leak through, something that can be very dangerous given the flammability of hydrogen. The team believes the dent is associated with the leak, but the results of the test could confirm it. On September 3, the large hydrogen leak was between two and three times the accepted limit, Sarafin said. Testing \u2018kinder\u2019 procedures The purpose of the cryogenic demonstration is to test the seals and use updated, \u201ckinder and gentler\u201d loading procedures of the supercold propellant, which is what the rocket would experience on launch day. Unlike the wet dress rehearsals, the previous tests of Artemis I that simulated every stage leading up to launch, the cryo test focuses on a very specific aspect in the countdown: loading supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the rocket\u2019s core stage and upper stage. The Orion spacecraft and rocket boosters will remain unpowered during the test, and the team does not intend to go into terminal count, or the final 10 minutes that occur in the countdown before launch, said Jeremy Parsons, deputy manager for NASA\u2019s Exploration Ground Systems Program at Kennedy Space Center. The kinder and gentler loading procedure is to minimize pressure spikes and thermal spikes witnessed during prior launch attempts. To achieve this, the team will slowly bring up the pressure on the liquid hydrogen storage tank. The slower procedure is estimated to add no more than 30 minutes to the process, Parsons said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very slow, steady ramp,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cSo (we\u2019re) really just trying to slowly introduce some of those thermal differences and reduce thermal and pressure shock.\u201d Liquid oxygen is relatively dense, about the density of water, and it is pumped into the rocket. Meanwhile, hydrogen is very light, so it is moved using pressure rather than being pumped, said Tom Whitmeyer, deputy associate administrator for NASA\u2019s common exploration systems development. The new loading operations will use a slower rate of pressure with more gradual temperature changes, Whitmeyer said. The call to stations for the test, when all of the teams associated with the mission arrive at their consoles and report they\u2019re ready, begins today at 3 p.m. ET. The mission team anticipates receiving a \u201cgo\u201d to begin loading the rocket with propellant around 7 a.m. ET on Wednesday. If all goes well, the team expects the test to be completed by 3 p.m. ET that day, Parsons said. The test will also include an engine bleed, which chills the engines for launch. The mission team scrubbed the first Artemis I launch attempt on August 29 largely due to an issue with a faulty sensor that occurred during this bleed. So far, the forecast looks promising for the test. The Artemis team is receiving daily briefings about Hurricane Fiona in case it has any impact on whether or not the rocket stack needs to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that can take three days. Preparing for launch If the cryo test goes well, the next launch attempt could take place on Tuesday, September 27, with a 70-minute window that opens at 11:37 a.m. ET. The mission managers will meet to discuss the test results on September 25 to assess the potential launch date. If Artemis I launches on that day, it would go on a 39-day mission and return to Earth on November 5. Another backup launch date is possible on October 2. While these launch dates are recommended by NASA, the team ultimately depends on a decision by the US Space Force, which would need to issue a waiver for the launch. The US Space Force, an arm of the military, still oversees all rocket launches from the United States\u2019 East Coast, including NASA\u2019s Florida launch site, and that area is known as the Eastern Range. The officials at the range are tasked with making sure there\u2019s no risk to people or property with any launch attempt. The Artemis team continues to have \u201cproductive and collaborative\u201d discussions with the Eastern Range, and NASA is sharing additional detailed information requested by the Space Force for review. The team is taking things one step at a time and wants to get through the test before other decisions are made, Whitmeyer said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go when we\u2019re ready,\u201d Sarafin said. \u201cBut in terms of the reward of flying this flight, we have said from the outset that this is the first in increasingly complex series of missions, and it is a purposeful stress test of the rocket.\u201d The inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of NASA space exploration that intends to land diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon \u2013 on the Artemis II and Artemis III missions, slated for 2024 and 2025 respectively \u2013 and eventually deliver crewed missions to Mars."}
