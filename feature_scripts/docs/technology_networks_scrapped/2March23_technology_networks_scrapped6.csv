Researchers said this abnormal processing of the visual motion stimuli in the brain was linked to migraine disability and more susceptibility to motion sickness.""Millions of people regularly experience painful and debilitating migraine headaches that can reduce their quality of life,"" said study author Arne May, MD, PhD, of the University of Hamburg in Germany. ""People with migraine often complain of dizziness, balance problems and misperception of their body's place in space during migraine. By simulating a virtual roller coaster ride, our study found that some of these problems are not only magnified in people who experience migraine, but they are also associated with changes in various areas of the brain. By identifying and pinpointing these changes, our research could lead to a better understanding of migraine which could in turn lead to the development of better treatments.""The study involved 20 people with migraine who were compared to 20 people without migraine. Participants had an average age of 30 and more than 80% were women. People with migraine had an average of four migraines per month.Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to take brain scans of each participant as they watched videos to experience the virtual roller coaster rides. No participants experienced a migraine during the virtual rides. After the virtual rides, participants were surveyed about their perceived levels of dizziness, motion sickness and other symptoms.Researchers found that 65% of people with migraine experienced dizziness compared to 30% of people without migraine. On a questionnaire about motion sickness, which scored symptom intensity on a scale of 1-180, those with migraine had an average score of 47 compared to an average score of 24 for people without migraine. People with migraine also experienced symptoms longer, an average of 1 minute and 19 seconds compared to an average of 27 seconds. Their symptoms were also more intense.From the brain scans, researchers were able to identify changes in nerve cell activity based on blood flow to certain areas of the brain. People with migraine had increased activity in five areas of the brain, including two areas in the occipital gyrus, the visual processing area of the brain, and decreased activity in two other areas including the middle frontal gyrus. These brain changes correlated with migraine disability and motion sickness scores.""One other area of the brain where we found pronounced nerve cell activity in people with migraine was within the pontine nuclei, which helps regulate movement and other motor activity,"" said May. ""This increased activity could relate to abnormal transmission of visual, auditory and sensory information within the brain. Future research should now look at larger groups of people with migraine to see if our findings can be confirmed.""Reference: Carvalho G, Mehnert J, Basedau H, Luedtke K, May A. brain processing of a visual self-motion study in patients with migraine: An fMRI study.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/background-noise-in-the-brain-keeps-nerve-connections-young-351169, Background Noise  in the Brain Keeps Nerve Connections Young Researchers have found that a form of neuron to neuron communication that has long been dismissed is required to keep nerve junctions intact as animals age  This finding suggests that defects in this type of neural communication could contribute to neurodegenerative disorders and other brain conditions  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Neurons communicate through rapid electrical signals that regulate the release of neurotransmitters, the brain's chemical messengers. Once transmitted across a neuron, electrical signals cause the juncture with another neuron, known as a synapse, to release droplets filled with neurotransmitters that pass the information on to the next neuron. This type of neuron-to-neuron communication is known as evoked neurotransmission.However, some neurotransmitter-packed droplets are released at the synapse even in the absence of electrical impulses. These miniature release events -- or minis -- have long been regarded as 'background noise', says Brian McCabe, Director of the Laboratory of Neural Genetics and Disease and a Professor in the EPFL Brain Mind Institute.But several studies have suggested that minis do have a function -- and an important one. In 2014, for example, McCabe and his team showed that minis are important for the development of synapses. If neurons in the brain were a network of computers, evoked releases would be packets of data through which the machines exchange information, whereas minis would be pings -- brief electronic signals that determine if there is a connection between two computers, McCabe says. ""Minis are the pings that neurons use to say 'I am connected.'""To assess whether minis could play a role in the mature nervous system, Soumya Banerjee, a postdoc in McCabe's group, and his colleagues set out to study a set of neurons that control movement in fruit flies. As the insects aged, their synapses started to break up into smaller fragments, the researchers found. (A similar process occurs in aging mammals, including people.) As nerve junctions broke down, both evoked and miniature neurotransmission were dampened, and the flies showed motor problems such as a reduced ability to climb the walls of a plastic vial.Next, the team assessed the effects of stimulating or inhibiting evoked and miniature neurotransmission. When both types of neurotransmission were blocked, synapses aged prematurely, suggesting that during aging or in neurological diseases associated with old age, changes in neurotransmission happen before synapses start to crumble. This finding, McCabe says, upends a longstanding idea in neuroscience. ""The idea has long been that the structure of the synapse breaks down, and that causes a functional change in the synapse, but we found it is the other way around,"" he says.Stimulating evoked neurotransmission alone had no effect on aging synapses, the researchers found. However, increasing the frequency of minis kept synapses intact and preserved the motor ability of middle-aged flies at levels comparable to those of young flies. ""Motor ability declines in all aging animals, including humans, so it was a delightful surprise to see that we could change that,"" McCabe says.The findings, published in Nature Communications, could have important implications for human health: minis have been found at every type of synapse studied so far, and defects in miniature neurotransmission have been linked to range of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Figuring out how a reduction in miniature neurotransmission changes the structure of synapses, and how that in turn affects behavior, could help to better understand neurodegenerative disorders and other brain conditions.Reference: Banerjee S, Vernon S, Jiao W, et al.

He greeted a team of neuroscientists and doctors and dutifully adjusted his face mask before beginning a simple neurological exam.As Imbrie walked, a distinct sway hinted at why he was there, yet belied what he was once told: that he would never be able to walk or use his arms again.After his exam, as he settled into a chair and put on a fresh mask   this one covered in the logos of his favorite Chicago sports teams   Imbrie began to share his story. I m doing a lot of things in life that they told me I can never do,  he said.  I broke my neck in 1985, and I was told I was going to be a quadriplegic when I woke up. When they told me that, I knew it wasn t going to be that way. Imbrie was 19 when a car accident damaged his spinal cord and left him paralyzed from the neck down. Though his doctors said it was unlikely, over months of rehabilitation, he relearned how to walk. Now, decades later, he s pushing the envelope of medical possibility yet again   this time as a subject in a unique research trial that tests the use of neuroprosthetic devices to allow him to sense and manipulate a virtual hand and, eventually, a robotic prosthetic.In October 2020, Imbrie became the first patient in Chicago and just the fourth person in an ongoing multisite study to undergo the delicate surgical procedure of implanting specialized electrodes into his brain. These electrodes receive neuronal signals from his motor cortex, allowing him to control and manipulate an arm in a virtual reality environment. They also send sensory feedback to his brain, allowing him to experience touch sensations on his hand   so that he can  feel  pressure and vibration.Ultimately, the UChicago Medicine team plans to connect the system to a robotic prosthetic hand so that Imbrie can use the device in the real world. Refining this research and developing new advanced neuroprosthetic devices will provide new freedom for people who are paralyzed or who are missing a limb.The study is an expansion of ongoing research conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and UChicago in other paralyzed patients. Like something out of a sci-fi movie, the goal, the researchers say, is to develop technologies that can replace missing limbs or restore touch and movement for those who are paralyzed. Some of the masterminds behind the work include Sliman Bensmaia, PhD, an international expert on how the brain encodes and uses sensory information, and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, PhD, a leader in the field of the brain basis of motor control and learning. The brains of people who are paralyzed can still generate the signals that would normally control movement, but the signal can t make it past the injury,  said project lead John Downey, PhD, a staff scientist at the University of Chicago.  We re trying to determine how to use that signal from the brain to allow them to control a prosthetic robotic arm and hand. And in addition to being able to control the arm and hand, we want to give them the ability to feel as though their own hand were touching an object when that prosthetic touches an object.

They have been termed the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with the French National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), Ipsos and Sant  publique France, conducted a nationwide case-control study to evaluate the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against symptomatic forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, be that non-variant virus or the Alpha and Beta variants. The results show that the two-dose vaccination regimen of mRNA vaccines provides 88% protection against non-variant virus, 86% against the Alpha variant and 77% against the Beta variant. The results of this study were published in The Lancet Regional Health Europe on July 14, 2021.In late 2020, two new variants of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in the United Kingdom and in South Africa, respectively. This occurred at a time when the United Kingdom was experiencing a resurgence in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This was later attributed to the emergence of the Alpha variant, which has now demonstrated increased transmissibility as compared to the original SARS-CoV-2. The Beta variant was first reported in South Africa and later identified to carry a mutation known as E484K and which is associated with immune evasion. The reporting of the first SARS-CoV-2 variants occurred as mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns were commencing at global level. In France, both Alpha and Beta were circulating in the first months of 2021. It was therefore important to analyze the effectiveness of the messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines against these SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.In October 2020, the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with the French National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), Ipsos and Sant  publique France, launched the ComCor study, a case-control study at national level to analyze the sociodemographic, behavioral and practical factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All those infected with SARS-CoV-2 were invited to take part in the study by the CNAM, while non-infected control were identified through an Ipsos representative panel. The first results of the study were published in The Lancet Regional Health on June 7, 2021.In February 2021, the scientists adapted the ComCor questionnaire to add information about vaccination against COVID-19, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and information on the variants responsible for infection, provided as part of test results. This information was used to assess the effectiveness of two doses of mRNA vaccine against the Alpha and Beta variants, and to evaluate the protection conferred by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.In this study, 7,288 people infected with the original strain, 31,313 people infected with the Alpha variant, 2,550 people infected with the Beta variant and 3,644 non-infected controls were included between February and May 2021. The study enabled the scientists to demonstrate that two doses of mRNA vaccine conferred 88% (81-92) effectiveness against infection with original virus, 86% (81-90) effectiveness against infection with the Alpha variant and 77% (71-90) effectiveness against infection with the Beta variant, as measured seven days after the second dose. No difference in vaccine effectiveness was found between different categories of age, sex or occupational exposure.""There was much expectation surrounding the (vaccine effectiveness) results for the Beta variant, known for its E484K mutation associated with immune evasion. Our estimate of 77% protection is very close to the estimate of 75% reached by the only other study worldwide to have evaluated the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against this variant. These analyses confirm the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and the key role that they have to play in tackling the epidemic,"" explains Arnaud Fontanet, Head of the Epidemiology of Emerging Diseases Unit at the Institut Pasteur and Professor at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M tiers (CNAM).Another important finding of the study related to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The scientists demonstrated that recent infection (in the past 2 to 6 months) confers similar protection to that observed with mRNA vaccines.The analyses will now be extended to estimate vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant, which has been the dominant variant in France since early July 2021.Reference: Charmet T, Schaeffer L, Grant R, et al.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/breakthrough-in-detection-of-sars-cov-2-variant-in-wastewater-351163,Breakthrough in Detection of SARS CoV   Variant in Wastewater Researchers have developed an innovative  open source molecular detection method that is able to detect and quantify the B        Alpha  variant of SARS CoV    ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers from the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Interdisciplinary Research Group (IRG) at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT s research enterprise in Singapore, alongside collaborators from Biobot Analytics, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have successfully developed an innovative, open-source molecular detection method that is able to detect and quantify the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant of SARS-CoV-2. The breakthrough paves the way for rapid, inexpensive surveillance of other SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater.As the world continues to battle and contain COVID-19, the recent identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmissibility and increased severity has made the development of convenient variant tracking methods essential. Currently, identified variants include the B.1.17 (Alpha) variant first identified in the United Kingdom and the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant first detected in India.Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a critical public health tool to safely and efficiently track the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in a non-intrusive manner, providing complementary information that enables health authorities to acquire actionable community-level information. Most recently, viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in housing estates in Singapore through a proactive wastewater surveillance programme. This information, alongside surveillance testing, allowed Singapore s Ministry of Health (MOH) to swiftly respond, isolate and conduct swab tests as part of precautionary measures.However, detecting variants through wastewater surveillance is less commonplace due to challenges in existing technology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) for wastewater surveillance is time-consuming and expensive. They also lack the sensitivity required to detect low variant abundances in dilute and mixed wastewater samples due to inconsistent and/or low sequencing coverage.The method developed by the researchers is uniquely tailored to address these challenges and expands the utility of wastewater surveillance beyond testing for SARS-CoV-2, towards tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Dr Wei Lin Lee, Research Scientist at SMART AMR and first author on the paper added,  This is especially important in countries battling SARS-CoV-2 variants. Wastewater surveillance will help find out the true proportion and spread of the variants in the local communities. Our method is sensitive enough to detect variants in highly diluted SARS-CoV-2 concentrations typically seen in wastewater samples, and produces reliable results even for samples which contain multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Led by Associate Professor Janelle Thompson of NTU, and MIT Professor and SMART AMR Principal Investigator Eric Alm, the team s research  Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant B.1.1.7 Tracking in Wastewater by Allele-Specific RT-qPCR  has been published in prestigious journal, Environmental Science & Technology Letters. The research explains the innovative, open-source molecular detection method based on allele-specific RT-qPCR that detects and quantifies the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. The developed assay, tested and validated in wastewater samples across 19 communities in the US is able to reliably detect and quantify low levels of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant with low cross-reactivity, and at variant proportions down to 1% in a background of mixed SARS-CoV-2 viruses.Targeting spike protein mutations that are highly predictive of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant, the method can be implemented using commercially available RT-qPCR protocols. Unlike commercially available products that use proprietary primers and probes for wastewater surveillance, the paper details the open-source method and its development that can be freely used by other organisations and research institutes for their work on wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.The breakthrough by the research team in Singapore is currently utilised by Biobot Analytics, a global leader in wastewater epidemiology headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the US, serving states and localities throughout the country. Using the method, Biobot Analytics is able to accept and analyse wastewater samples for the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and plans to add additional variants to its analysis as methods are developed. Using the team s innovative method, we have been able to monitor the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant in local populations in the US - empowering leaders with information about COVID-19 trends in their communities and allowing them to make considered recommendations and changes to control measures,  said Dr Mariana Matus, Biobot Analytics CEO and Cofounder.The SMART AMR team is also currently developing specific assays that will be able to detect and quantify the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, which has recently been identified as a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation. This method can be rapidly adapted to detect new variants of concern beyond B.1.1.7,  said co-corresponding author Professor Eric Alm of MIT and Principal Investigator at SMART AMR.  Our partnership with Biobot Analytics has translated our research into real-world impact beyond the shores of Singapore and aid in the detection of COVID-19 and its variants, serving as an early warning system and guidance for policymakers as they trace infection clusters and consider suitable public health measures.

The better the virus can manipulate the spike protein, the easier time it has accessing the cell and eventually spreading in an unvaccinated population. Think of it as a moldable key,  said physicist Prem Chapagain, the associate director of FIU s Biomolecular Sciences Institute and one of the study s authors.  The key itself is flexible and it finds the right groove and fits better because of that flexibility. In computer simulations conducted at FIU, Chapagain, physics professor Bernard Gerstman and graduate students Nisha Bhattarai and Prabin Baral saw how the tip of the original coronavirus  spike protein wiggled but the tip of the South African variant wiggled even more. That extra flexibility, researchers said, helps it to better bind with human cells, though that alone may not fully account for the South African variant s higher infection rate.These spike proteins are of particular interest to researchers, too, because some of the most effective coronavirus vaccines block the spike protein from working and infecting cells. While other studies have shown vaccines are effective against these variants, FIU researchers suggest more research is needed to determine whether changes seen in these and any future variants might make vaccines ineffective. Vaccines are still the best chance we have to cut the spread of the virus. If you can contain it everywhere and vaccinate most of the world s population, you don t have the breeding ground for the virus,  Chapagain said.  We cannot give the virus a chance to acquire dangerous mutations. The more it spreads the more it mutates. Reference: Bhattarai N, Baral P, Gerstman BS, Chapagain PP.

With the sample vitrified, high-resolution pictures of their molecular structure can be taken with an electron microscope, an instrument that forms images using a beam of electrons instead of light.CryoEM has opened up new dimensions in life sciences, chemistry, and medicine. For example, it was recently used to map the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is the target of many of the COVID-19 vaccines.Proteins constantly change their 3D structure in the cell. These conformational rearrangements are integral for proteins to perform their specialized functions, and take place within millionths to thousandths of a second. Such fast movements are too fast to be observed in real time by current cryoEM protocols, rendering our understanding of proteins incomplete.But a team of scientists led by Ulrich Lorenz at EPFL s School of Basic Sciences has developed a cryoEM method that can capture images of protein movements at the microsecond (a millionth of a second) timescale. The work is published in Chemical Physics Letters.The method involves rapidly melting the vitrified sample with a laser pulse. When the ice melts into a liquid, there is a tunable time window in which the protein can be induced to move in the way they do in their natural liquid state in the cell. Generally speaking, warming up a cryo sample causes it to de-vitrify,  says Ulrich Lorenz.  But we can overcome this obstacle by how quickly we melt the sample.""After the laser pulse, the sample is re-vitrified in just a few microseconds, trapping the particles in their transient configurations. In this  paused  state, they can now be observed with conventional cryoEM methods. Matching the time resolution of cryoEM to the natural timescale of proteins will allow us to directly study processes that were previously inaccessible,  says Lorenz.The team of scientists tested their new method by disassembling proteins after structurally damaging them, and trapping them in partially unraveled configurations.Reference: Voss JM, Harder OF, Olshin PK, Drabbels M, Lorenz UJ.

Type 1 diabetes is the most common autoimmune disease in childhood.   Our previous work has shown that exposing young animals to antibiotics perturbs the microbiome, which may change age-associated immunity and organ-specific inflammation, increasing risk of immune-mediated diseases,  said co-author Martin Blaser, director of the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine at Rutgers.The study compared mice that were exposed to antibiotics between days 5 and 10 of life and given a transplant of maternal microbiota up to a week later, and those that were not. The researchers found that the mice given the transplant had their microbiome partially restored and their diabetes risk brought back to the baseline level. The mice that were exposed to antibiotics had the expression of indicator genes in their intestinal wall that were either too high or too low, but the transplant brought that back almost to the original levels and restored metabolic pathways,  said co-author Xue-Song Zhang, an assistant research professor at the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine at Rutgers.  We were able to identify groups of genes that returned to normal after the transplant as if the mice had never received the antibiotics.

Besides following guidelines currently in place to slow the spread of the virus, we provide support for other relatively simple ways in which individuals can reduce their risk and that is through diet and nutrition,  Cornelis said. The paper on nutrition and COVID-19 protection was published recently in the journal Nutrients.One or more cups of coffee per day was associated with about a 10% decrease in risk of COVID-19 compared to less than one cup per day. Consumption of at least 0.67 servings per day of vegetables (cooked or raw, excluding potatoes) was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection. Processed meat consumption of as little as 0.43 servings per day was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. Having been breastfed as a baby reduced the risk 10% compared to not having been breastfed. While the study shows diet appears to modestly reduce disease risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends vaccines as the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness and death. COVID-19 vaccines also reduce the risk of people spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.Thus far, most COVID-19 research has focused on individual factors assessed after a positive COVID-19 test. Individuals with suppressed immune systems such as the elderly and those with existing comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes and obesity, are more likely to experience severe outcomes of COVID-19. But other than weight management, less attention has focused on other modifiable risk factors preceding COVID-19 infection, said Cornelis, who studies how diet and nutrition contribute to chronic disease. Dr. Thanh-Huyen Vu, the study s first author and a research associate professor of medicine at Northwestern, is now leading analyses to determine whether these protective diet behaviors are specific to COVID or respiratory infections more broadly. Exact mechanisms linking these diet factors to COVID are unknown.  Coffee is a major source of caffeine, but there are also dozens of other compounds that may potentially underlie the protective associations we observed,  Cornelius said.  Associations with processed meat, but not red meat, point to non-meat factors. Using data from the UK Biobank, researchers examined the associations between dietary behaviors measured in 2006-2010 and COVID-19 infections in March to December 2020, before vaccines were available. They focused on 1) diet factors for which data were available and previously implicated in immunity based on human and animal studies; 2) self-reported intakes of coffee, tea, vegetables, fruit, fatty fish, processed meat and red meat. An early-life exposure to breastmilk also was analyzed.  Among the 37,988 participants tested for COVID-19 and included in the study, 17% tested positive. The observational nature of the UK Biobank research limits the extent to which mechanisms of protection can be tested, Cornelis said. However, much of her nutrition research uses genetics, and with all UK Biobank participants currently genotyped, she hopes to use this information to gain better insight into how diet and nutrition offer protection from the disease.Other Northwestern authors include Kelsey Rydland, Dr. Chad Achenbach and Linda Van Horn.Reference: Vu T-HT, Rydland KJ, Achenbach CJ, Van Horn L, Cornelis MC.

The study included a four-year follow up. Coffee is the primary source of caffeine for most people, and it has a reputation for causing or exacerbating arrhythmias,  said senior and corresponding author Gregory Marcus, MD, professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiology at UCSF.   But we found no evidence that caffeine consumption leads to a greater risk of arrhythmias,  said Marcus, who specializes in the treatment of arrhythmias.  Our population-based study provides reassurance that common prohibitions against caffeine to reduce arrhythmia risk are likely unwarranted.  While some professional societies suggest avoiding caffeinated products to lower the risk for arrhythmia, this connection has not been consistently demonstrated   indeed, coffee consumption may have anti-inflammatory benefits and is associated with reduced risks of some illnesses including cancer, diabetes and Parkinson disease.  In the new study, UCSF scientists explored whether habitual coffee intake was associated with a risk of arrhythmia, and whether genetic variants that affect caffeine metabolism could modify that association.  Their investigation was conducted via the community-based UK Biobank, a prospective study of participants in England s National Health Services.Some 386,258 coffee drinkers took part in the coffee research, with an average mean age of 56 years; slightly more than half were female. It was an unprecedented sample size for this type of inquiry.  In addition to a conventional analysis examining self-reported coffee consumption as a predictor of future arrhythmias, the investigators employed a technique called  Mendelian Randomization,  leveraging genetic data to infer causal relationships. As those with the genetic variants associated with faster caffeine metabolism drank more coffee, this analysis provided a method to test the caffeine-arrhythmia relationship in a way that did not rely on participant self-report and should have been immune to much of the confounding inherent to most observational studies.  With a mean four-year follow up, data were adjusted for demographic characteristics, health and lifestyle habits.   Ultimately, approximately 4 percent of the sample developed an arrhythmia. No evidence of a heightened risk of arrhythmias was observed among those genetically predisposed to metabolize caffeine differently. The researchers said that higher amounts of coffee were actually associated with a 3 percent reduced risk of developing an arrhythmia. The authors noted limitations including the self-reporting nature of the study, and that detailed information on the type of coffee   such as espresso or not   was unavailable.   Only a randomized clinical trial can definitively demonstrate clear effects of coffee or caffeine consumption,  said Marcus.  But our study found no evidence that consuming caffeinated beverages increased the risk of arrhythmia. Coffee s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may play a role, and some properties of caffeine could be protective against some arrhythmias. Reference: Kim E, Hoffman TJ, Nah G, et al.

Invasive treatments can take hours as patients wait for adequate amounts of drugs to be absorbed at the right location. The same problem is holding back newer treatments like gene-altering therapies.Now the MIT spinout Suono Bio is advancing a new approach that uses ultrasound to deliver drugs, including nucleic acids like DNA and RNA, to the GI tract more effectively. The company believes its technology can be used to get a broad array of therapeutic molecules into the areas of the body that have proven most difficult to drug. Ultrasound is a well-known technology that s been used for decades in the clinic,  Suono co-founder and CTO Carl Schoellhammer PhD  15 says.  But now we re doing something really unique and novel with it to facilitate the delivery of things that couldn t be delivered before. Suono s technology is the culmination of more than three decades of discoveries made in MIT labs by researchers including Schoellhammer and fellow Suono co-founders Robert Langer, who is the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT, and Giovanni Traverso, an assistant professor at MIT. The platform takes advantage of a phenomena in which ultrasound waves create little jets in liquid that can be used to push drugs into cells.The company s first treatment program targets ulcerative colitis. Last week, Suono announced a funding round to advance that program and others in its pipeline into clinical trials.Beyond that first program, the founders say the platform could be used to deliver a range of molecules, from nucleic acids to peptides and larger proteins, to any part of the GI tract. And although the first iteration of Suono s delivery platform will leverage hand-held systems, the founders believe the technology could one day be contained in a battery-powered, ingestible pill. That [first drug candidate] is the proof of concept where we could potentially solve a very pressing clinical problem and do a lot of good for a lot of patients,  Schoellhammer says.  But then you ve de-risked the whole platform, because the trial is applying ultrasound to a mucosal surface, and your entire GI tract is one big mucosal surface. So, all the subsequent products that we do, even in other form factors, will build on each other.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

""We are able to show that this, too, plays a critical role in regulating the types of signals that get preserved in sediments.""We need to be aware of this when trying to extract records of past 'global' environmental change,"" he said.Scientists have long used information from sediments at the bottom of the ocean -- layers of rock and microbial muck -- to reconstruct the conditions in oceans of the past.A critical challenge in understanding Earth's surface evolution is differentiating between signals preserved in the sedimentary record that reflect global processes, such as the evolution of ocean chemistry, and those that are local, representing the depositional environment and the burial history of the sediments.The new study is based on analyses of a mineral called pyrite (FeS2) that is formed in marine sediments influenced by bacterial activity. The scientists examined concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur and stable isotopes of glacial-interglacial sediments on the seafloor along the continental margin off of modern-day Peru.Varying rates of microbial metabolic activity, regulated by regional oceanographic variations in oxygen availability and the flux of sinking organic matter, appear to have driven the observed pyrite sulfur variability on the Peruvian margin, the scientists discovered.The study was led by Virgil Pasquier, a postdoctoral fellow at the Weizmann Institute of Sciences in Israel, and co-authored by Itay Halevy, also of the Weizmann Institute. Pasquier previously worked with Fike at Washington University. Together, the collaborators have raised concerns about the common use of pyrite sulfur isotopes to reconstruct Earth's evolving oxidation state.""We seek to understand how Earth's surface environment has changed over time,"" said Fike, who also serves as director of Washington University's International Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainability. ""In order to do this, it's critical to understand the kinds of processes that can influence the records we use for these reconstructions.""""In this study, we have identified an important factor -- local organic carbon delivery to the seafloor -- that modifies the geochemical signatures preserved in sedimentary pyrite records,"" he said. ""It overprints potential records of global biogeochemical cycling with information about changes in the local environment.""This observation provides a new window to reconstruct past local environmental conditions, which is quite exciting,"" Fike said.Reference: Pasquier V, Fike DA, Halevy I.

Though it affects more than half of human genes, the significance of APA was poorly understood. Now a new study by The Wistar Institute describes an important function of APA in allowing certain mRNAs to reach specific sites of protein synthesis and reveals that length, sequence and structural properties can determine the destination (and fate) of mRNAs within the cell. These findings, published online in the journal Cell Reports, shed light on the consequences of APA that may represent a paradigm shift in the mRNA metabolism field. The laboratory of Bin Tian, Ph.D., professor and co-leader of the Gene Expression & Regulation Program at The Wistar Institute Cancer Center and senior author on the study, was among the first to discover the widespread occurence of APA using genomic and bioinformatic approaches.Following gene transcription, messenger RNAs are chemically modified to become mature RNA molecules that can leave the nucleus and perform their functions. One of these modifications is polyadenylation, which prevents RNA degradation and favors its translation into protein.  Through APA, a gene can be polyadenylated at multiple sites, resulting in mRNAs with different coding sequences and/or regulatory regions (3 untranslated regions or 3 UTRs), called isoforms. Transcripts encoding the same protein can have different fates in the cell because of distinct 3 UTRs, which harbor regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism. This dramatically increases the complexity of our genome, so that fewer genes are needed to encode all the proteins a cell needs. Tian and colleagues employed functional genomics methods to analyze the distribution of the APA isoforms in mouse cells. Bioinformatic analysis and machine learning approaches revealed that APA, via modulation of mRNA 3 UTRs, impacts the connection between mRNAs and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a network of tubes that build, package and transport proteins. They named this mechanism translation-independent ER association (TiERA) and found that some mRNAs possess specific sequences and structures that determine their potential to undergo APA and ultimately associate with the ER.  When mRNAs leave the nucleus and move to the cytoplasm, they need to be properly directed to reach the appropriate site of protein translation,  said Tian.  The cytoplasm is a huge space for an RNA molecule: For comparison, imagine entering a baseball stadium and needing directions to reach your seat. The team found that mRNAs with higher TiERA tend to encode for signaling proteins,which help cells communicate with each other by sending, receiving and processing signals in response to changes in the environment.  They propose that APA renders this process more efficient by anchoring certain mRNA isoforms with the ER in specific cellular locations where important signaling events happen.  According to our model, the ER would serve as a scaffold to keep proteins  on hand  where they are most needed,  said Tian.  This would provide a platform for signaling events to happen effectively at the right place in the cell. Reference: Zheng D, Cheng LC, Tian B.

Even so, the development of biomarkers can give patients and their families answers during life: Alzheimer's disease can be accurately detected via peptides and proteins in a patient's cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), which can be collected through a lumbar puncture and tested while the patient is alive. In 2018, a new framework suggested combining three Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in CSF - pathologic amyloid plaques (A), tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N), collectively called ATN. According to recent research from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the ATN framework can be extended to detect another neurodegenerative condition: frontotemporal degeneration.Patients with frontotemporal degeneration can experience a range of symptoms, including behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, and language impairments. Distinguishing frontotemporal degeneration from Alzheimer's disease can be a challenge for clinicians: the symptoms of frontotemporal degeneration can sometimes overlap with Alzheimer's disease, and a subset of patients can even have both pathologies. Biomarkers can fill the gap by providing evidence of whether Alzheimer's pathology underlies a patient's symptoms.""CSF biomarkers work similarly to a pregnancy test, offering a simple positive or negative result when enough of a substance is detected. But like a pregnancy test, biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease can provide false negatives or positives,"" said lead investigator Katheryn A.Q. Cousins, PhD, a research associate in the Frontotemporal Degeneration Center in the Department of Neurology at Penn Medicine. ""Alzheimer's is a diverse disease, and it is common for other conditions to also be present in the brain. The ATN framework may provide a more complete look at a person's diagnosis and give us a much richer understanding of not only Alzheimer's disease, but other co-occurring neurodegenerative conditions. However, to accomplish this, additional biomarkers that can detect other neurodegenerative conditions are critically needed.""The findings, published in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, show that ATN incorporating neurofilament light chain (NfL) may provide a more accurate and precise diagnosis for patients with frontotemporal degeneration. NfL is a protein abundant in the brain, whose levels increase as degeneration progresses. Cousins' work shows that CSF NfL may be a more accurate marker of neurodegeneration for patients with frontotemporal degeneration, including for Alzheimer's disease.""While the ATN framework is very exciting and offers much opportunity for patients with Alzheimer's disease, these biomarkers don't capture every case of the disease. We want to be able to detect and treat every patient with neurodegenerative disease as early as possible, and more research is needed to fully understand how biofluids track with the disease process,"" said Cousins.

Such cancer can spread to lymph nodes in the neck, as well as other organs in the body. Surgically removing lymph nodes in the neck can help doctors investigate the risk of spread, but may result in pain and stiffness in the shoulders and neck for years afterward.Identifying which patients may have issues with neck movement ""can be difficult, as the findings are often subtle and challenging to quantify,"" said Scott Troob, assistant professor of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery and division chief of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. However, successfully targeting what difficulties they might have with mobility can help patients benefit from targeted physical therapy interventions, he explained.The current techniques and tools that doctors have to judge the range of motion a patient may have lost in their neck and shoulders are somewhat crude, explained Sunil K. Agrawal, a professor of mechanical engineering and rehabilitative and regenerative medicine and director of the ROAR (Robotics and Rehabilitation) Laboratory at Columbia Engineering. They usually either provide unreliable measurements or require too much time and space to set up for use in routine clinical visits.To develop a more reliable and portable tool to analyze neck mobility, Agrawal and his colleagues drew inspiration from a robotic neck brace they previously developed to analyze head and neck motions in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In partnership with Troob's group, they have now designed a new wearable robotic neck brace. Their study appears July 12 in the journal Wearable Technologies.The new brace was made using 3D-printed materials and inexpensive sensors. The easy-to-wear device was based on the head and neck movements of 10 healthy individuals.""This is the first study of this kind where a wearable robotic neck brace has been designed to characterize the full head and neck range of motion,"" Agrawal said.In the new study, the researchers used the prototype brace, along with electrical measurements of muscle activity, to compare the neck mobility of five cancer patients before and one month after surgical removal of neck lymph nodes. They found their device could precisely detect changes in patient neck movements during routine clinical visits.""Use of the sensing neck brace allows a surgeon to screen patients postoperatively for movement difficulty, quantify their degree of impairment, and select patients for physical therapy and rehabilitation,"" Troob said.""Patients consistently identify need for rehabilitation and guided exercises after surgery as an unmet need in their medical care,"" Troob said. ""This work will lay the foundation for the appropriate identification of patients for intervention. We additionally hope that through using the neck brace, we will be able to objectively quantify their improvement and develop evidence-based rehabilitative programs.""In the future, the researchers hope to investigate larger groups of patients and use the neck brace to follow patients through physical therapy to develop evidence-based protocols for rehabilitation, Troob said.

But those who tend to be ""night owls"" could take more than a week to get back on track with sleep schedule, according to new data published in Scientific Reports by a team from the University of Michigan.The study uses data from continuous sleep tracking of 831 doctors in the first year of post-medical school training when the time shift occurred in spring 2019. All were first-year residents or ""interns"" in medical parlance, and taking part in the Intern Health Study based at the Michigan Neuroscience Institute.From the large UK Biobank dataset, the researchers calculated genomic ""chronotype"" predisposition information, also known as the Objective Sleep Midpoint polygenic score. People with low scores were genomically predisposed to be ""early birds"" and those with high scores were genomically ""night owls.""The team then applied these genomic scores in the intern sample and focused on the two groups of about 130 physicians each that had the strongest tendencies to be ""early birds"" and ""night owls"" based on their scores. The researchers looked at how their sleep patterns changed from the week before DST to the weekend after it.In general, the difference in post-DST weekday wakeup times between the two groups was not large - probably because first-year medical residents have very strict work schedules.In fact, the stressful duties and demanding schedules that interns endure is what made this population such an interesting one to study, and the larger Intern Health Study that the data come from has yielded important findings about the relationship between stress, sleep, genetics, mood and mental health.But the time they got to sleep on the nights before workdays, and both sleep and wake times on the weekend, varied significantly between the two groups. The DST change made the differences even more pronounced.Early birds had adjusted their sleep times by Tuesday, but night owls were still off track on the following Saturday.Margit Burmeister, Ph.D., the U-M neuroscientist and geneticist who is the paper's senior and corresponding author, says the study gives one more strong reason for abolishing Daylight Saving Time.""It's already known that DST has effects on rates of heart attacks, motor vehicle accidents, and other incidents, but what we know about these impacts mostly comes from looking for associations in large data pools after the fact,"" she says. ""These data from direct monitoring and genetic testing allows us to directly see the effect, and to see the differences between people with different circadian rhythm tendencies that are influenced by both genes and environment. To put it plainly, DST makes everything worse for no good reason.""The study's first author is Jonathan Tyler, Ph.D., a postdoctoral assistant professor of mathematics at U-M.Sleep schedules depend on a combination of many factors - but the fact that people can react so differently to the same abrupt change in time makes it important to study further. The researchers also looked at the ""fall back"" time change in autumn and found no significant differences between early birds and night owls in how they reacted to the abrupt addition of an hour of sleep.The findings have implications not just for the annual spring time change, but also for shift workers, travelers across time zones and even people deciding which profession to choose, the researchers note. Burmeister says she hopes to look further at differences between people in different professions in future studies.Co-author Srijan Sen, M.D., Ph.D. who leads the Intern Health Study and directs the Frances and Kenneth Eisenberg and Family Depression Center at U-M, continues to lead other studies of how each year's crop of interns at over 100 hospitals react to the stresses of their training. The interns in the newly published study, like all interns, are in general chronically sleep-deprived because of the number of hours they need to be on duty or preparing for duty.""This study is a demonstration of how we much we vary in our response to even relatively minor challenges to our daily routines, like DST,"" he said.

Most of those viruses, which survived because they had remained frozen, are unlike any viruses that have been cataloged to date.The findings, published today in the journal Microbiome, could help scientists understand how viruses have evolved over centuries. For this study, the scientists also created a new, ultra-clean method of analyzing microbes and viruses in ice without contaminating it.""These glaciers were formed gradually, and along with dust and gases, many, many viruses were also deposited in that ice,"" said Zhi-Ping Zhong, lead author of the study and a researcher at The Ohio State University Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center who also focuses on microbiology. ""The glaciers in western China are not well-studied, and our goal is to use this information to reflect past environments. And viruses are a part of those environments.""The researchers analyzed ice cores taken in 2015 from the Guliya ice cap in western China. The cores are collected at high altitudes - the summit of Guliya, where this ice originated, is 22,000 feet above sea level. The ice cores contain layers of ice that accumulate year after year, trapping whatever was in the atmosphere around them at the time each layer froze. Those layers create a timeline of sorts, which scientists have used to understand more about climate change, microbes, viruses and gases throughout history.Researchers determined that the ice was nearly 15,000 years old using a combination of traditional and new, novel techniques to date this ice core.When they analyzed the ice, they found genetic codes for 33 viruses. Four of those viruses have already been identified by the scientific community. But at least 28 of them are novel. About half of them seemed to have survived at the time they were frozen not in spite of the ice, but because of it.""These are viruses that would have thrived in extreme environments,"" said Matthew Sullivan, co-author of the study, professor of microbiology at Ohio State and director of Ohio State's Center of Microbiome Science. ""These viruses have signatures of genes that help them infect cells in cold environments - just surreal genetic signatures for how a virus is able to survive in extreme conditions. These are not easy signatures to pull out, and the method that Zhi-Ping developed to decontaminate the cores and to study microbes and viruses in ice could help us search for these genetic sequences in other extreme icy environments - Mars, for example, the moon, or closer to home in Earth's Atacama Desert.""Viruses do not share a common, universal gene, so naming a new virus - and attempting to figure out where it fits into the landscape of known viruses - involves multiple steps. To compare unidentified viruses with known viruses, scientists compare gene sets. Gene sets from known viruses are cataloged in scientific databases.Those database comparisons showed that four of the viruses in the Guliya ice cap cores had previously been identified and were from virus families that typically infect bacteria. The researchers found the viruses in concentrations much lower than have been found to exist in oceans or soil.The researchers' analysis showed that the viruses likely originated with soil or plants, not with animals or humans, based on both the environment and the databases of known viruses.The study of viruses in glaciers is relatively new: Just two previous studies have identified viruses in ancient glacier ice. But it is an area of science that is becoming more important as the climate changes, said Lonnie Thompson, senior author of the study, distinguished university professor of earth sciences at Ohio State and senior research scientist at the Byrd Center.""We know very little about viruses and microbes in these extreme environments, and what is actually there,"" Thompson said.

However, despite extensive global studies, there is no standardised approach for their collection and analysis.Currently, studies regularly involve retrieving microplastic samples from water using a filtration method. Samples are commonly analysed in situ on the filter or after removal from it by hand, which is time consuming and risks accidental loss of the particles and cross contamination.Claire Gwinnett, Professor of Forensic and Environmental Science, is part of the team that created Easylift  tape more than a decade ago and has more recently applied her expertise in fibre analysis to microplastics.She explained:  Easylift  tape was developed for the forensic market. However, what we have found is that the same benefits are true when looking at particulates from any environment. We realised that it holds great potential for microplastics work particularly when you are out in the field, for example on a boat or on a beach, where the risk of losing or contaminating your microplastic samples is huge. A new paper, published in Environmental Advances, addresses the shortcomings of current research methods and sets out a new workflow using Easylift  tape. The technique uses the self-adhesive tape to  lift  microplastic particles from a filter then safely preserves them between the tape and a sheet of suitable material   in this case glass.This method was trialled by Professor Gwinnett during an expedition to collect microplastic samples along the Hudson River in New York with the Rozalia Project where it proved highly effective, with a mean fibre recovery rate of 96.4%. It also enables multiple analytical techniques to be applied to the samples afterwards and preserves them for future study.Professor Gwinnett said:  The ultimate goal is that this will become the standardised workflow for microplastics research across the world. At the moment, scientists are extrapolating data and it is only through constant monitoring that we will we truly know how much microplastic pollution is out there. If there is a standardised method to globally track microplastics then we can much better understand the risks and where we should be targeting our efforts for mitigation. We know plastic pollution is widespread, but we need to understand how much is in different locations, where it has come from and where it is going. What we need is a global collaborative effort to gather that large-scale data. Easylift  tape is already being employed more widely and was used to collect microplastic samples during a transatlantic sailing expedition on former racing vessel the SV Jolokia last year. The Marine Education Centre based in New York State is also training  citizen scientists  to take samples from the Hudson River and other locations using the tape.Staffordshire University is now collaborating with the University of Oxford and Nekton Mission to analyse microplastic samples from an expedition to the Antarctic where these particulates will be retrieved from ice cores using Easylift  tape.Professor Gwinnett added:  We need the ability for people to constantly monitor plastic pollution without massive expertise and the beauty of Easylift  is that it can be used by anyone   volunteers, sailing crews, people working in waste-water management can all use this in a robust way. It will allow us to share microplastic samples with partner institutions across the world for further analysis and to validate research methods. As with evidence recovered from crime scenes, we will also be able to store microplastic samples to be re-examined in a decade s time or longer. Being able to collaborate and share research in this way is an exciting step forward. Reference: Gwinnett CMB, Osborne AO, Jackson ARW.

These surviving cells are called persisters because they are responsible for persistent bacterial infections and contribute to antibiotic resistance.Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing public health challenges and threatens the ability to effectively fight infectious diseases, with around 10 million people predicted to die annually of infections by 2050.The University of Exeter research team has discovered the mechanisms that permit persisters to have an acidic pH. By measuring the genetic properties of these cells, they found that two cellular processes, namely tryptophan metabolism and carboxylic acid catabolism, are responsible for the low pH measured in persister bacteria.Dr Stefano Pagliara, a biophysicist in the Living Systems Institute, leading this research at the University of Exeter, said: ""Our findings indicate that the manipulation of the intracellular pH represents a bacterial strategy for surviving antibiotic treatment. Our new data suggest a strategy for developing antibiotics that interfere with key cellular components of persisters and decrease their acidity.""The team is now working on expanding this research to find out whether cell acidity is key for antibiotic resistance in other critical bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia pseudomallei and to identify drug molecules that can alter the pH of persister cells before antibiotic treatment.Reference: Goode O, Smith A, Zarkan A, et al.

As a panel of amateur beer tasters at Washington State University recently demonstrated, malted barley, the number one ingredient in beer besides water, can have a range of desirable flavors too.Researchers recruited a panel of about 100 craft beer drinkers to taste some so-called SMaSH beers--those brewed with a single barley malt and single hop. All the beers contained the same hop variety, called Tahoma, but each had a malt from a different barley genotype, or genetic makeup. Trained tasters can distinguish these easily, but even the untrained panel could taste the difference among five different barley varieties--and definitely favored some more than others.""We found that the untrained panelists could differentiate among the barley breeding lines in the beer,"" said Evan Craine, a WSU doctoral student and first author on the study in the Journal of Food Science. ""They did a good job of selecting attributes that revealed distinctive profiles for each of the beers.""The panel generally preferred the four barley breeding lines developed at WSU over the control, known as Copeland, a high-quality malting barley widely grown in Washington state. The panelists were able to easily identify the flavor profiles of the beers, such as one with a ""fruity and sweet aromatic"" flavor and another with a ""citrus"" profile made with a barley called Palmer, a variety recently released by WSU for commercial use.While the untrained panel could distinguish flavors from brewed beers, they were not as adept at tasting the differences among ""hot steep"" samples which are made by combining hot water and ground barley malt before filtering. This creates a sweet liquid--similar to that made by brewers before yeast is added to create alcohol.The researchers had hoped amateur beer tasters could distinguish flavor differences in the hot steep as it would shorten the testing process for new barley varieties. Corresponding author Kevin Murphy was not ready to give up on the method.""Hot steep malt still shows a lot of promise,"" said Murphy, a WSU associate professor of crop and soil sciences. ""The next step would be testing it with a trained panel to see if they can distinguish barley varieties. Ideally, we would just set it out to consumers because hot steep malting is great outreach. It gets people involved. They love tasting and talking about it.""While U.S. craft beer drinkers are known for their love of hop-heavy India Pale Ales, the results of this study add evidence that barley malts might be another good way to develop new beers.For this study, Craine and Murphy worked with Scott Fisk, a faculty research assistant at Oregon State University, to create the malts and brewer Aaron Hart of Moscow Brewing Company to develop the beers, using hops only to add a little bitterness to balance the sweetness from the malt. These types of beers are called ""malt-forward."" They can be light or strong flavored, ranging in types from lagers and pilsners to ambers and stouts. Hart called the beers developed for this study ""American Pale Ales.""More variety from malt-forward beers can potentially benefit not only beer lovers but also the environment and brewers' bottom lines, said Craine.""In terms of sustainability, hops can be pretty resource intensive, and at least around us in Pullman, we can grow barley that's just rain fed,"" he said. ""Hops can also be really expensive. Brewers are already buying the malt, so if we can find ways to increase the flavor contribution from the malt, hopefully, they can rely less on the hops and save money.""While the hops craze is continuing, the malt-forward beers have the potential to spur the next evolution in craft brewing, said Murphy.""Just as craft beer flavor has evolved in the last 20 years, we can expect it to continue to change over the next 20, and the new frontier will be adding different barley flavors or barley-hop combinations,"" he said.

However, the reality is more complicated. New research suggests that processes below the ocean surface may be controlling what is happening above.Plankton are some of the most numerous and important organisms in the ocean. The balance of chemical elements inside them varies and is critical to shaping many marine processes, including the food web and the global carbon cycle. Temperature has been traditionally thought to control the ratio of these elements. However, a new study suggests this balance is largely dependent on activity in the subsurface ocean, from depths of over 300 feet. The work, led by scientists at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, was recently published in Communications Earth and Environment.The team looked at samples from eight locations in oceans around the world. They found that the ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus introduced from the subsurface ocean controls the balance of those nutrients in the marine microorganisms that form the foundation of ocean health. This discovery could allow scientists to more accurately explore complex ocean processes.""This is the first time that we've looked across a broad range of ocean regions and directly measured the balance of nutrients in ocean microorganisms, which is really exciting,"" said Mike Lomas, lead author on the paper. ""Now we can apply more realistic parameters based on what is actually driving marine dynamics to the computer models used to forecast ocean change ""For decades, researchers have been using a fixed ratio to estimate the balance of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in marine environments. Scientists and groups like the International Panel on Climate Change use this ratio in computer simulations to make predictions about the future of the planet.However, it does not necessarily represent the wide diversity of chemical balances in the ocean or the significant role that organisms play in cycling nutrients.""The problem is that the fixed ratios are safe estimates that do not actually represent how biology works,"" Lomas said. ""More realistic, but risky and complicated, approaches are not yet widely utilized.""To develop a more accurate understanding of these ratios, Lomas directly measured them in phytoplankton - some of the most critical marine organisms worldwide. The elements in these organisms' cells reflect the available nutrients in their habitat and shine light on the role of biodiversity in how the nutrients cycle.This is not the first time phytoplankton have been examined to understand nutrient levels in the ocean, but it is the most advanced and comprehensive. The team examined phytoplankton around the world to create a snapshot of three critical nutrient elements across broad environmental conditions. Traditionally, researchers have used physical filters to sort out plankton from seawater before examining them. However, this approach can also capture bacteria and tiny particles, leading to errors.This study used a technique called flow cytometry, which allows researchers to examine and sort hundreds to thousands of cells per second. This enabled the researchers to isolate and examine only the cells they were interested in. It not only gave them a more accurate understanding of the diverse ratios of elements in the ocean, but also what processes are controlling them.The team found that, contrary to the most common hypothesis, the ratio of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in cells was primarily dependent on the ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus supplied from the subsurface ocean to the sunlit waters where phytoplankton are active. This was true across all locations, regardless of the kind of phytoplankton or their environmental conditions.Lomas hopes that this improved understanding of nutrients can be used to better picture how oceans will respond to climate change.""We can't examine the nutrients in every single cell in every ocean, but we need to be sure all the controlling factors are included in computer models,"" Lomas said. ""As we blend these results with other advanced disciplines, we will really advance our understanding of ocean dynamics and ability to forecast future conditions.""Reference: Lomas MW, Baer SE, Mouginot C, et al.

We have all seen how vital vaccines are in the fight against COVID-19   our work could help in efforts to create the most effective possible T-cell-mediated vaccine which offers just the right strength of immune response; not too weak that it is rendered ineffective but also not too strong that it hurts the body. The study highlights the role of a protein called CD8, which is a T-cell co-receptor vital for controlling an effective immune response to an invading pathogen.The research team s aim was to work out a way of making T-cells effective against a range of pathogens and viruses via CD8 but while avoiding causing damage to the host. Essentially, the more types of targets a T-cell can recognise and react against, the more risk there is of autoimmunity.In this study, the team describe a mechanism that resolves this conundrum by showing how CD8 can allow individual T-cells to focus on specific targets without driving autoimmunity.Dr Hugo van den Berg, a senior author on the study from Warwick University s Mathematics institute, said the data shows for the first time  a phenomenon that was predicted based on mathematical calculations .The researchers employed different disease targets in the lab and modified CD8 while monitoring the immune responses produced. Tinkering with the CD8 receptor allowed them to ""fine-tune"" the immune response against different disease targets   without altering the structural integrity of this critical receptor. Our study suggests that the immune system can be specifically adjusted to operate at the level of individual T-cells to allow the T-cell to do its job and kill invading pathogens while safeguarding the host in the face of an ongoing immune response,  said Dr Clement.Reference: Clement M, Knezevic L, Dockree T, et al.

Wild pigs are just like tractors ploughing through fields, turning over soil to find food,  Dr O Bryan said. When soils are disturbed from humans ploughing a field or, in this case, from wild animals uprooting, carbon is released into the atmosphere. Since soil contains nearly three times as much carbon than in the atmosphere, even a small fraction of carbon emitted from soil has the potential to accelerate climate change. Our models show a wide range of outcomes, but they indicate that wild pigs are most likely currently uprooting an area of around 36,000 to 124,000 square kilometres, in environments where they re not native. This is an enormous amount of land, and this not only affects soil health and carbon emissions, but it also threatens biodiversity and food security that are crucial for sustainable development. Using existing models on wild pig numbers and locations, the team simulated 10,000 maps of potential global wild pig density.They then modelled the amount of soil area disturbed from a long-term study of wild pig damage across a range of climatic conditions, vegetation types and elevations spanning lowland grasslands to sub-alpine woodlands.The researchers then simulated the global carbon emissions from wild pig soil damage based on previous research in the Americas, Europe, and China.University of Canterbury PhD candidate Nicholas Patton said the research would have ramifications for curbing the effects of climate change into the future. Invasive species are a human caused problem, so we need to acknowledge and take responsibility for their environmental and ecological implications,  Mr Patton said. If invasive pigs are allowed to expand into areas with abundant soil carbon, there may be an even greater risk of greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Because wild pigs are prolific and cause widespread damage, they re both costly and challenging to manage. Wild pig control will definitely require cooperation and collaboration across multiple jurisdictions, and our work is but one piece of the puzzle, helping managers better understand their impacts. It s clear that more work still needs to be done, but in the interim, we should continue to protect and monitor ecosystems and their soil which are susceptible to invasive species via loss of carbon.

Little is known about whether a fruit can communicate with the plant to which it s attached, which could be important for warning the plant of threats. This early evidence shows that pest attacks do trigger defensive electrical and biochemical responses across the plant. This could provide more effective monitoring strategies for detecting agricultural pests in the future.A recent study in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems shows that the fruits of a type of tomato plant send electrical signals to the rest of the plant when they are infested by caterpillars. Plants have a multitude of chemical and hormonal signaling pathways, which are generally transmitted through the sap (the nutrient-rich water that moves through the plant). In the case of fruits, nutrients flow exclusively to the fruit and there has been little research into whether there is any communication in the opposite direction i.e. from fruit to plant.We usually forget that a plant s fruits are living and semiautonomous parts of their mother-plants, far more complex than we currently think! Since fruits are part of the plant, made of the same tissues of the leaves and stems, why couldn t they communicate with the plant, informing it about what they are experiencing, just like regular leaves do?  says first author Dr Gabriela Niemeyer Reissig, of the Federal University of Pelotas, in Pelotas, Brazil.  What we found is that fruits can share important information such as caterpillar attack which is a serious issue for a plant with the rest of the plant, and that can probably prepare other parts of the plant for the same attack.  To test the hypothesis that fruits communicate by electrical signals, Niemeyer Reissig and her collaborators placed tomato plants in a Faraday s cage with electrodes at the ends of the branches connecting the fruits to the plant. They then measured the electrical responses before, during and after the fruits had been attacked by Helicoverpa armigera caterpillars for 24 hours. The team also used machine learning to identify patterns in the signals.The results showed a clear difference between the signals before and after attack. In addition, the authors measured the biochemical responses, such as defensive chemicals like hydrogen peroxide, across other parts of the plant. This showed that these defenses were triggered even in parts of the plant that were far away from the damage caused by the caterpillars.The authors emphasize that these are still early results. Their measurements provide a  big picture  view of all of the electrical signals, rather than distinguishing individual signals more precisely. It will also be interesting to see whether this phenomenon holds true for other plant species, as well as different types of threats.That said, this novel use of machine learning appears to have very high potential for answering these and other future questions. The technique may also provide new and possibly more environmentally friendly approaches for insect control in agriculture. If studies like ours continue to advance and the techniques for measuring electrical signals in open environments continue to improve, it will be possible to detect infestation of agricultural pests quite early, allowing for less aggressive control measures and more accurate insect management,  explains Niemeyer Reissig.  Understanding how the plant interacts with its fruits, and the fruits among themselves, may bring insights about how to  manipulate  this communication for enhancing fruit quality, resistance to pests and shelf life after harvest.

This is because clouds, depending on properties such as their density and height in the atmosphere, can either enhance or dampen warming.Cloud calculationsCo-author Dr Paulo Ceppi, from the Grantham Institute   Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial, said:  The value of the climate sensitivity is highly uncertain, and this translates into uncertainty in future global warming projections and in the remaining  carbon budget    how much we can emit before we reach common targets of 1.5 C or 2 C of global warming. There is therefore a critical need to more accurately quantify how clouds will affect future global warming. Our results will mean we are more confident in climate projections and we can get a clearer picture of the severity of future climate change. This should help us know our limits   and take action to stay within them. Low clouds tend to have a cooling effect, as they block the sun from reaching the ground. High clouds, however, have a warming effect, as while they let solar energy reach the ground, the energy emitted back from the Earth is different. This energy can be trapped by the clouds, enhancing the greenhouse effect. Therefore, the type and amount of cloud a warming world will produce impacts further warming potential.Inspired by ideas from the artificial intelligence community, the researchers developed a new method to quantify relationships between state-of-the-art global satellite observations of clouds, and the associated temperature, humidity and wind conditions. From these observed relationships, they were then able to better constrain how clouds will change as the Earth warms.Narrowing uncertaintyThey found it was very likely (more than 97.5% probability) that clouds will amplify global heating, by both reflecting less solar radiation and enhancing the greenhouse effect. These results also suggest that a doubling of CO2 concentrations will lead to around 3.2 C of warming. This is the highest confidence of any study so far, and is based on data from global observations, rather than local regions or specific cloud types.Co-author Dr Peer Nowack, from the School of Environmental Sciences and Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia and Imperial s Grantham Institute and Data Science Institute, said:  Over the last few years, there s been a growing amount of evidence that clouds probably have an amplifying effect on global warming. However, our new approach allowed us for the first time to derive a global value for this feedback effect using only the highest quality satellite data as our preferred line of evidence. Our paper makes a major step towards narrowing the most important uncertainty factor in climate sensitivity projections. As such, our work also highlights a new pathway in which machine learning methods can help us constrain the key remaining uncertainty factors in climate science. Reference: Ceppi P and Nowack P.

However, such efforts have mostly failed because doing it well was too costly, and trying to do it at a low cost led to poor performance.Now, researchers from The University of Texas at Austin have found a low-cost way to solve one half of the equation, using sunlight to efficiently split off oxygen molecules from water. The finding, published recently in Nature Communications, represents a step forward toward greater adoption of hydrogen as a key part of our energy infrastructure.As early as the 1970s, researchers were investigating the possibility of using solar energy to generate hydrogen. But the inability to find materials with the combination of properties needed for a device that can perform the key chemical reactions efficiently has kept it from becoming a mainstream method. You need materials that are good at absorbing sunlight and, at the same time, don t degrade while the water-splitting reactions take place,  said Edward Yu, a professor in the Cockrell School s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  It turns out materials that are good at absorbing sunlight tend to be unstable under the conditions required for the water-splitting reaction, while the materials that are stable tend to be poor absorbers of sunlight. These conflicting requirements drive you toward a seemingly inevitable tradeoff, but by combining multiple materials   one that efficiently absorbs sunlight, such as silicon, and another that provides good stability, such as silicon dioxide   into a single device, this conflict can be resolved. However, this creates another challenge   the electrons and holes created by absorption of sunlight in silicon must be able to move easily across the silicon dioxide layer. This usually requires the silicon dioxide layer to be no more than a few nanometers, which reduces its effectiveness in protecting the silicon absorber from degradation.The key to this breakthrough came through a method of creating electrically conductive paths through a thick silicon dioxide layer that can be performed at low cost and scaled to high manufacturing volumes. To get there, Yu and his team used a technique first deployed in the manufacturing of semiconductor electronic chips. By coating the silicon dioxide layer with a thin film of aluminum and then heating the entire structure, arrays of nanoscale  spikes  of aluminum that completely bridge the silicon dioxide layer are formed. These can then easily be replaced by nickel or other materials that help catalyze the water-splitting reactions.When illuminated by sunlight, the devices can efficiently oxidize water to form oxygen molecules while also generating hydrogen at a separate electrode and exhibit outstanding stability under extended operation. Because the techniques employed to create these devices are commonly used in manufacturing of semiconductor electronics, they should be easy to scale for mass production.The team has filed a provisional patent application to commercialize the technology.Improving the way hydrogen is generated is key to its emergence as a viable fuel source. Most hydrogen production today occurs through heating steam and methane, but that relies heavily on fossil fuels and produces carbon emissions.There is a push toward ""green hydrogen"" which uses more environmentally friendly methods to generate hydrogen. And simplifying the water-splitting reaction is a key part of that effort.Hydrogen has potential to become an important renewable resource with some unique qualities. It already has a major role in significant industrial processes, and it is starting to show up in the automotive industry. Fuel cell batteries look promising in long-haul trucking, and hydrogen technology could be a boon to energy storage, with the ability to store excess wind and solar energy produced when conditions are ripe for them.Going forward, the team will work to improve the efficiency of the oxygen portion of water-splitting by increasing the reaction rate. The researchers  next major challenge is then to move on to the other half of the equation.""We were able to address the oxygen side of the reaction first, which is the more challenging part, "" Yu said, ""but you need to perform both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to completely split the water molecules, so that's why our next step is to look at applying these ideas to make devices for the hydrogen portion of the reaction.""Reference: Lee S, Ji L, De Palma AC, Yu ET.

It is one of the most common drivers of cancer and its mutations can be detected in around 25 per cent of human tumours. The development of KRAS inhibitors is, thus, an extremely active line of research. Effective results have been elusive so far, though - no KRAS inhibitor had been available until a month ago, when the FDA granted approval to Sotorasib.KRAS encodes two gene products, KRAS4A and KRAS4B, whose levels can vary across organs and embryonic stages. When KRAS mutates, both variants, or isoforms, are activated. Though, some studies have focussed on approaches to target only KRAS4B, since it usually found to be expressed at higher levels in tumours.In this study, Matthias Drosten, Marina Salm n and Guillem Paniagua of the Experimental Oncology Programme, headed by Mariano Barbacid at the CNIO, had a more fundamental goal: to understand how the isoforms work separately. As they state in the paper to be published in PNAS, ""The biological relevance of the expression of two isoforms has puzzled researchers for decades.""","Published: July 20, 2021"

But genetic variation means that what is turned off in some people remains turned on in others. This is why, for example, some adults can digest dairy products and others are lactose intolerant; the gene for making the enzyme lactase is turned off when some people become adults, but not others. One way that genes can be turned on and off is through a process called histone methylation in which special enzymes transfer methyl groups to histone proteins that are wrapped around DNA.Variations in genes related to methylation during brain development can lead to serious problems. One such variation occurs in a rare disorder called Kleefstra Syndrome, in which a mutation prevents methylation of H3K9--a specific location on histone H3. Because Kleefstra Syndrome resembles autism in some ways, RIKEN CBS researchers led by Takeo Yoshikawa looked for autism-specific variations in genes that can modify H3K9. Among nine such genes, they found one variant in an H3K9 methyltransferase gene--SUV39H2--that was present in autism, and the mutated SUV39H2 prevented methylation when tested in the lab. Similar loss-of-function results were found for the mouse version of the variant.The next step was to see what happens in mice that lack the Suv39h2 gene. Behaviorally, the researchers found that the mice could learn a simple cognitive task, but had difficultly when the task required cognitive flexibility. In the simple task, mice learned to get a reward by poking a door at alternating diagonal corners of a cage. After they could do this well, the possible reward locations switched to the other two diagonal corners. The genetically modified mice did this as well as wild-type mice. In another task, after learning to alternate between the two diagonal corners, only the location of one reward was switched. When the mice were challenged to alternate randomly between these two tasks, wild-type mice could adapt quickly, but the Suv39h2-deficient mice took much longer. ""This serial reversal-learning task was essential,"" says first author Shabeesh Balan. ""Cognitive inflexibility is a core symptom of ASD, and our new task was able to address this behavioral feature in ways that previous mouse studies could not.""When the researchers examined what happened in the mouse brain when H3K9 methylation failed to occur, they found that important genes that are usually silenced in early development were turned on in the experimental mice. ""Suv39h2 is known to be expressed in early neurodevelopment and to methylate H3K9,"" explains Yoshikawa. ""This keeps a check on genes that should be switched-off. But without it, genes in the protocadherin   cluster were abnormally expressed at high levels in embryonic mice."" Because protocadherins are critical for the formation of neural circuits, the researchers believe they have found an important biological pathway that could be central to several neurodevelopmental disorders.The team then verified the importance of SUV39H2 in human ASD by finding that its expression was lower in the postmortem brains of people with ASD than of controls. ""What began with a loss-of-function mutation in only one person with ASD,"" says Yoshikawa, ""has led to a general causal landscape for ASD that culminates in brain circuit abnormality.""Protocadherins have already been proposed to be related to a broad range of mental disorders. This study shows that activating the SUV39H2 gene is a potential therapy for mental disorders--including ASD--that should be investigated more thoroughly in future studies.Reference: Balan S, Iwayama Y, Ohnishi T, et al.

Olfaction, our sense of smell, is a major contributor to how we perceive aromas, especially those related to what we eat.With hopes to capitalize on the smell factor in flavor development, researchers are exploring how the route an aroma takes to get to the olfactory system, through the nose or the back of the throat, influences our response to the scent in question.In a new study, when participants were asked to match a known scent such as rose with one of four unknown scents, they did best when the aromas were introduced in the same way, either through sniffing them in a vial or drinking them in a solution - an expected result.The scientists were surprised to find, however, that participants were also better at matching aromas when the reference scent - the one that they were going to try to find a match for - was not labeled with its familiar name. The less they knew about the reference aroma, the higher their chances of correctly identifying a match - a finding that suggests aroma detection involves learning, memory and cognitive strategy.The team eventually wants to consider other factors that could influence the perception of aromas and flavors, such as genetics and our microbiomes, the communities of microbes living in our nasal passages and oral cavities.""A better understanding of these mechanisms could give us another way to modulate flavors and to modulate food-related experiences,"" said Christopher Simons, associate professor of food science and technology at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study. ""It's really hard to understand what people experience, and I don't have access to your brain to see exactly what you're perceiving. But if there are ways to influence that perception, maybe that's a way to get people to eat healthier.""The study is published in the September 2021 issue of the journal Physiology and Behavior.Simons and colleagues were testing the theory known as the ""duality of smell,"" which posits that how we perceive what we're smelling depends on which path it takes to get to the olfactory system.The theory has been supported by tests of food flavors that we're used to putting in our mouths. In this study, the researchers used less familiar floral scents - which study participants drank in a solution to activate the sense of smell through the back of the throat and sniffed from a vial to activate the sense of smell through the nose.The 34 participants would first either sniff or drink the reference scent, which was labeled with its common name - the choices were rose, lavender, honeysuckle or jasmine - its Latin name, or a generic label that gave no information. They then sampled the same unnamed four floral scents - either through the same sense-of-smell pathway or its opposite - with the goal of finding the match to the reference aroma.When the routes of delivery differed, participants made more mistakes, meaning there was something about those delivery systems to the nose that altered their ability to recognize similar scents - further supporting the duality of smell hypothesis.But the finding that no information was better than a clear scent name was unexpected - and also suggests that this is where cognitive activity comes into play.""If I say 'rose,' there's information that will affect the way you process and smell those aromas. When there's no identifying information, what you have to do is profile - smell it and find something distinguishing about that particular aroma. That's much harder than knowing what you're looking for,"" Simons said.""We think there's cognitive interference from the language centers that impacts how people do this matching and searching test. ... Fundamentally, the fact you have exactly the same stimulus that activates exactly the same receptors, and you can't make a match - that's fascinating.""Simons is interested in repeating this kind of test with unpleasant aromas to see if the theory holds up, and also hopes to conduct experiments that could reveal whether our genetic makeup or the array of microbes and enzymes in our noses and mouths hold secrets to why the duality of smell exists in the first place.Reference: Hannum ME, Fryer JA, Simons CT.

This period is a key time in the development of adolescents  thinking, reasoning and understanding of the world.The study, published in Nature Sustainability, looked at the links between different types of natural urban environments and the pupils  cognitive development, mental health and overall well-being.The environments were divided into what planners call green space (woods, meadows and parks) and blue space (rivers, lakes and the sea), with green space separated further into grassland and woodland. Researchers used satellite data to help calculate each adolescent s daily exposure rate to each of these environments within 50m, 100m, 250m and 500m of their home and school.After adjusting for other variables, the results showed that higher daily exposure to woodland (but not grassland) was associated with higher scores for cognitive development, and a 16% lower risk of emotional and behavioural problems two years later.A similar but smaller effect was seen for green space, with higher scores for cognitive development, but this was not seen for blue space. The researchers note though that access to blue space in the cohort studied was generally low. Examples of other explanatory variables considered included the young person s age, ethnic background, gender, parental occupation and type of school, e.g., state or independent. The level of air pollution might have influenced adolescents  cognitive development, but researchers did not feel these observations were reliable or conclusive, and these require further investigations.It is already estimated that one in 10 of London s children and adolescents between the ages of five and 16 suffer from a clinical mental health illness and excess costs are estimated between  11,030 and  59,130 annually for each person. As with adults, there is also evidence that natural environments play an important role in children and adolescents  cognitive development and mental health into adulthood, but less is known about why this is.The results of this study suggest that urban planning decisions to optimise ecosystem benefits linked to cognitive development and mental health should carefully consider the type of natural environment included. Natural environments further away from an adolescent s residence and school may play an important role too, not just their immediate environment.Lead author, PhD student Mika l Maes (UCL Geography, UCL Biosciences and Imperial College London School of Public Health) said:  Previous studies have revealed positive associations between exposure to nature in urban environments, cognitive development and mental health. Why these health benefits are received remains unclear, especially in adolescents. These findings contribute to our understanding of natural environment types as an important protective factor for an adolescent s cognitive development and mental health and suggest that not every environment type may contribute equally to these health benefits. Forest bathing, for example (being immersed in the sights, sounds and smells of a forest), is a relaxation therapy that has been associated with physiological benefits, supporting the human immune function, reducing heart rate variability and salivary cortisol, and various psychological benefits. However, the reasons why we experience these psychological benefits from woodland remain unknown. Joint senior author Professor Mireille Toledano (Director, Mohn Centre for Children s Health and Wellbeing and Investigator, MRC Centre for Environment and Health and Principal Investigator of the SCAMP study, Imperial College London) said:  It s been suggested previously that the benefits of natural environments to mental health are comparable in magnitude to family history, parental age and even more significant than factors like the degree of urbanisation around you, but lower than your parents  socio-economic status. Sensory and non-sensory pathways have been suggested as potentially important for delivering cognition and mental health benefits received from exposure to nature. It s critical for us to tease out why natural environments are so important to our mental health throughout the life course   does the benefit derive from the physical exercise we do in these environments, from the social interactions we often have in them, or from the fauna and flora we get to enjoy in these environments or a combination of all of these? Joint senior author Professor Kate Jones (UCL Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research, UCL Biosciences) said:  One possible explanation for our findings may be that audio-visual exposure through vegetation and animal abundance provides psychological benefits, of which both features are expected in higher abundance in woodland. Even though our results show that urban woodland is associated with adolescent s cognitive development and mental health, the cause of this association remains unknown. Further research is fundamental to our understanding of the links between nature and health. To arrive at the findings, researchers analysed a longitudinal dataset of 3,568 adolescents between 2014 and 2018, whose residence was known, from the Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (SCAMP) across the London metropolitan area. They assessed adolescents  mental health and overall well-being from a self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)   covering areas such as emotional problems, conduct, hyperactivity and peer problems   and the KIDSCREEN-10 Questionnaire taken by each adolescent for SCAMP.Reference: Maes MJA, Pirani M, Booth ER, et al.

It must capture nutrients - nitrogen, phosphorus, or iron - to survive, yet in vast expanses of the ocean, nutrients are extremely scarce. And the stakes are high: Marine microbial communities drive many of the elemental cycles that sustain all life on Earth.One ingenious solution to this challenge is reported this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In low-nutrient environments, marine microbes can clump together and hook up with even tinier cells that have vibrating, hairlike appendages (cilia) on their surface. The beating cilia create microcurrents that can pull up to 10 times more nutrients within the microbes' reach - thereby serving up a meal through cooperative work.Even if the ocean is wildly turbulent, microbes can piggyback into consortia for division of labor, says senior corresponding author John H. Costello of Providence College and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, where much of the research was conducted.""For all conditions but the most radically extreme mixing, these microbial cells live in fluid spaces that are smaller than the eddies caused by ocean mixing,"" Costello says. ""In their world, the surrounding fluid is always viscous and they do not experience turbulent eddies as humans feel them.""The team used a technology called Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to measure the direction and magnitude of fluid flows around a photosynthetic marine diatom, Coscinodiscus wailesii, with and without an attached ciliate ""partner,"" Pseudovorticella coscinodisci. They found that fluid flows generated by ciliary beating can increase nutrient flux to the diatom's cell surface 4-10 times greater than fluxes to the diatom alone.This cooperative solution is one way microbes can cope in low-nutrient environments. Another previously known tactic for individual cells is sinking to greater depths, which creates relative motion between the cell and surrounding water and increases its exposure to higher nutrient concentrations.""Sinking might work well in low-nutrient conditions where mixing will recirculate the cells back up from the depths to the sunlit layers,"" Costello says. ""That way, the risk to the diatom of sinking might be countered by the probability of being returned to high-light environments. But in low-mixing conditions, forming consortia with ciliates could be a more favorable solution to low nutrient availability.""Diatoms are among the most important groups of single-celled photosynthesizers for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Thus, the study helps to illuminate ocean-atmospheric exchanges that have become increasingly important for understanding climate change.""We have described a collaborative solution - consortium formation - that has evolved on the microscopic scale to allow this large diatom species to successfully persist in low-nutrient waters that would otherwise appear to restrict its success,"" Costello says.Reference: Kanso EA, Lopes RM, Strickler JR, Dabiri JO, Costello JH.

Scientists needed to find out just how the necessary building blocks are imported into the complex biochemical apparatus of these cell areas. The TOM complex (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane) is considered the gateway to the mitochondrion, the proverbial powerhouse of the cell. The working group headed by Professor Chris Meisinger at the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Freiburg has now demonstrated - in human cells - how signaling molecules control this gate. A signaling protein called DYRK1A modifies the molecular machinery of TOM and makes it more permeable for enzymes that are important for the cell metabolism. The group has thus discovered the first signaling protein that directly influences this import process in humans.Developmental disorders in a new lightIn neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, microcephaly and Down's syndrome, DYRK1A is defective. ""The connection with mitochondria is new. These results allow us to better understand these disorders and develop treatment strategies,"" says Dr. Adinarayana Marada, a member of Meisinger's team.""For a long time, researchers thought that the TOM complex was a rigid structure in the mitochondrial membrane whose doors were always open,"" Meisinger explains. His team recently demonstrated signaling mechanisms in baker's yeast that alter the subunits of the TOM complex depending on the metabolic state of the cell, or in response to sudden stress. In this way, the cell can specifically control the influx of precursor proteins for building elements of the metabolism, and it can adapt the function of the mitochondria to an altered cellular state. Whether such mechanisms also exist in humans was previously unknown.DYRK1A acts upon the TOM complexThe first authors of the study, Dr. Corvin Walter and Dr. Adinarayana Marada of Meisinger's research group, developed a systematic approach to track down signaling mechanisms such as those triggered by protein kinases, in humans. Over several years, they tested candidates using cell biological and bioinformatic methods and found what they were looking for - DYRK1A, one such protein kinase, acts on the TOM complex.

Edwards School of Medicine.The study, recently published in eNeuro, an open access journal for the Society of Neuroscience, showed a significantly more robust synaptogenic response in male-derived cells compared to female-derived cells when exposed to factors secreted from astrocytes, which are non-neuronal cells found throughout the central nervous system. This difference was driven largely by how neurons responded to thrombospondin-2 (TSP2), a protein with cell adhesion properties that is normally secreted by astrocytes. In the study, TSP2 prompted a strong increase in synapses in male neurons while showing no effect on female neurons.This work provides strong evidence that synapses, which serve as the basic building blocks for brain connectivity, may be formed by vastly different mechanisms during early development. Our goal is to better understand at a basic cellular level if there are sex differences in how cellular networks form in the brain,  said W. Christopher Risher, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biomedical sciences at the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and corresponding author on the study.  In this study, for the first time, we see evidence that events which were always assumed to be occurring in the same manner, regardless of sex, may actually be completely different in males compared to females. The fact that these differences involve astrocytes, which have traditionally been ignored in neuroscience but have recently become a hot topic for study, makes them all the more intriguing. Risher s team, led by first author Anna Mazur, Ph.D., isolated brain cells (neurons and astrocytes) from male and female newborn rats for this study. Once the cells were isolated, they were cultured for up to two weeks in various combinations with each other and then imaged on a fluorescent microscope to determine how many synapses were formed at the end of the experiment. In addition, the cells were treated with TSP2 as well as numerous regulators of estrogen signaling, in order to determine the effect of each of these factors on synapse formation in male- and female-derived cultures. The fact that we have identified molecular pathways present in males that are either absent or less prominent in females indicates that there may be much that researchers have missed in the area of synaptic development, simply because we weren t looking separately at males and females,  Risher said.Risher and his team continue to research the presence and impact of differences in cellular networks. Ultimately, findings from their work could help pave the way for sex-specific therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, that present with strong sex biases in humans.Reference: Mazur A, Bills EH, DeSchepper KM, Williamson JC, Henderson BJ, Risher WC.

They also aim to use similar biological signatures to develop a test and monitor for long COVID.While most people recover from COVID-19 in a matter of days or weeks, around one in ten people go on to develop symptoms that can last for several months. This can be the case irrespective of the severity of their COVID-19   even individuals who were asymptomatic can experience so-called  long COVID .Diagnosing long COVID can be a challenge, however. A patient with asymptomatic or mild disease may not have taken a PCR test at the time of infection   the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19   and so has never had a confirmed diagnosis.  Even antibody tests   which look for immune cells produced in response to infection   are estimated to miss around 30% of cases, particularly among those who have had only mild disease and or beyond six months post-initial illness.A team at the University of Cambridge and Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has received  370,000 from the National Institute for Health Research to develop a COVID-19 diagnostic test that would complement existing antibody tests and a test that could objectively diagnose and monitor long COVID.The research builds on a pilot project supported by the Addenbrooke s Charitable Trust. The team has been recruiting patients from the Long COVID Clinic established in May 2020 at Addenbrooke s Hospital, part of Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.During the pilot, the team recruited 85 patients to the Cambridge NIHR COVID BioResource, which collects blood samples from patients when they are first diagnosed and then at follow-up intervals over several months. They now hope to expand their cohort to 500 patients, recruited from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.In their initial findings, the team identified a biomarker   a biological fingerprint   in the blood of patients who had previously had COVID-19. This biomarker is a molecule known as a cytokine produced by T cells in response to infection. As with antibodies, this biomarker persists in the blood for a long time after infection. The team plans to publish their results shortly.Dr Mark Wills from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, who co-leads the team, said:  We need a reliable and objective way of saying whether someone has had COVID-19. Antibodies are one sign we look for, but not everyone makes a very strong response and this can wane over time and become undetectable. We ve identified a cytokine that is also produced in response to infection by T cells and is likely to be detectable for several months   and potentially years   following infection. We believe this will help us develop a much more reliable diagnostic for those individuals who did not get a diagnosis at the time of infection. By following patients for up to 18 months post-infection, the team hopes to address several questions, including whether immunity wanes over time. This will be an important part of helping understand whether people who have been vaccinated will need to receive boosters to keep them protected.As part of their pilot study, the team also identified a particular biomarker found in patients with long COVID. Their work suggests these patients produce a second type of cytokine, which persists in patients with long COVID compared to those that recover quickly and might be one of the drivers behind the many symptoms that patients experience. This might therefore prove to be useful for diagnosing long COVID.Dr Nyarie Sithole, also from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, who co-leads the team and helps to manage long COVID patients, said:   Because we currently have no reliable way of diagnosing long COVID, the uncertainty can cause added stress to people who are experiencing potential symptoms. If we can say to them  yes, you have a biomarker and so you have long COVID , we believe this will help allay some of their fears and anxieties. There is anecdotal evidence that patients see an improvement in symptoms of long COVID once they have been vaccinated   something that we have seen in a small number of patients in our clinic. Our study will allow us to see how this biomarker changes over a longer period of time in response to vaccination. At the moment, the team is using the tests for research purposes, but by increasing the size of their study cohort and carrying out further work, they hope to adapt and optimise the tests that can be scaled up and speeded up, able to be used by clinical diagnostic labs.As well as developing a reliable test, the researchers hope their work will help provide an in-depth understanding of how the immune system responds to coronavirus infection   and why it triggers long COVID in some people.Dr Sithole added:  One of the theories of what s driving long COVID is that it s a hyperactive immune response   in other words, the immune system switches on at the initial infection and for some reason never switches off or never goes back to the baseline. As we ll be following our patients for many months post-infection, we hope to better understand whether this is indeed the case. In addition, having a reliable biomarker could help in the development of new treatments against COVID. Clinical trials require an objective measure of whether a drug is effective. Changes in   or the disappearance of   long-COVID-related cytokine biomarkers with corresponding symptom improvement in response to drug treatment would suggest that a treatment intervention is working.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The results are published today in Nature Communications.Antibody levels were tracked using three 'assays' - tests that detect different types of antibodies that respond to different parts of the virus. The results showed that while all antibody types showed some decline between May and November, the rate of decay was different depending on the assay.The team also found cases of antibody levels increasing in some people, suggesting potential re-infections with the virus, providing a boost to the immune system.Lead author Dr Ilaria Dorigatti, from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and the Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics (J-IDEA) at Imperial, said: ""We found no evidence that antibody levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections differ significantly, suggesting that the strength of the immune response does not depend on the symptoms and the severity of the infection.""However, our study does shows that antibody levels vary, sometimes markedly, depending on the test used. This means that caution is needed when comparing estimates of infection levels in a population obtained in different parts of the world with different tests and at different times.""Professor Enrico Lavezzo, from the University of Padua, said: ""The May testing demonstrated that 3.5 percent of the Vo' population had been exposed to the virus, even though not all of these subjects were aware of their exposure given the large fraction of asymptomatic infections.""However, at the follow-up, which was performed roughly nine months after the outbreak, we found that antibodies were less abundant, so we need to continue to monitor antibody persistence for longer time spans.""The team also investigated the infection status of household members, to estimate how likely an infected member is to pass on the infection within the household. Their modelling suggests that there was a probability of about 1 in 4 that a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 passes the infection to a family member and that most transmission (79 percent) is caused by 20 percent of infections.This finding confirms that there are large differences in the number of secondary cases generated by infected people, with the majority of infections generating no further infections and a minority of the infections generating a large number of infections.The large differences in how one infected person may infect others in the population suggests that behavioural factors are key for epidemic control, and physical distancing, as well as limiting the number of contacts and mask wearing, continue to be important to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, even in highly vaccinated populations.The team's dataset, which includes the results of the two mass PCR testing campaigns conducted in February and March and the antibody survey conducted in May and then again in November, also allowed them to tease apart the impact of various control measures.They showed that, in the absence of case isolation and short lockdowns, manual contact tracing alone would not have been enough to suppress the epidemic.Project lead Professor Andrea Crisanti, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial and the Department of Molecular Medicine at the University of Padua, said: ""Our study also shows that manual contact tracing - the search for positive individuals on the basis of known and declared contacts - would have had a limited impact on the containment of the epidemic, had it not been accompanied by a mass screening.""Dr Dorigatti added: ""It is clear that the epidemic is not over, neither in Italy nor abroad. Moving forward, I think that it is of fundamental importance to continue administering first and second vaccine doses as well as to strengthen surveillance including contact tracing. Encouraging caution and limiting the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be essential.""Reference: Dorigatti I, Lavezzo E, Manuto L, et al.

Furthermore, stiffness at the tissue-level is significantly affected by the tumor stage, invasiveness, and location within the tumor due to the deposition of extracellular matrix, which influences the cellular behavior and metastatic capacity at the single-cell level as well.Several studies using the AFM-based force measurements also have shown a significant change in cell stiffness with increasing metastatic efficiency in human cancer cell lines and chemotherapy exposure in leukemia cells.In this work, these researchers quantified the drug effects on the biomechanical and biophysical properties of four cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer, PANC-1 pancreatic cancer, PC-3 prostate cancer, and U-118 MG glioblastoma cell lines.The Choi Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that they have examined changes in biomechanical parameters of cancer cells exposed to an inhibitor of actin polymerization cytochalasin D in normoxia and hypoxia.The PANC-1 cells became less stiff under increasing duration of exposure to cytochalasin D, and the decrease of stiffness was slower in hypoxia than normoxia.Also, morphology and non-specific binding force measurements of the cells exposed to cytochalasin D showed a reduction in cell height and cellular adhesion, but an increase in cellular roughness.Similar changes in biomechanical properties of other cancer cell lines treated with chemotherapeutic drugs and cytochalasin D suggest that the drug-induced cytotoxicity is partly due to dynamic changes in the cytoskeletal structure.Although it is difficult to generalize drug effects on biomechanical and biophysical parameters of cancer cells, a combination of these parameters could help identify and distinguish the drug-induced apoptotic process in normoxia and hypoxia.Reference: Alhalhooly L, Mamnoon B, Kim J, Mallik S, Choi Y.

This will allow highly precise molecular interventions in future.""The research team looked at the development of biliary tract and pancreatic cancer in mice, replacing the normal ""oncogenes"" PIK3CA and KRAS with a version containing a mutation identical with that in human cancers. Expression of these oncogenes in the common precursor cells of the extrahepatic bile duct and the pancreas led to very different outcomes. Mice with the mutated PI3K gene developed mostly biliary tract cancer, mice with the mutated KRAS gene instead developed exclusively pancreatic cancer.This was unexpected because both genes are mutated in both human cancer types. Subsequent analyses discovered the fundamental genetic processes underlying the differential sensitivity of the different tissue types towards oncogenic transformation.""Our results are an important step toward solving one of the biggest mysteries in oncology: Why do alterations of certain genes cause cancer only in specific organs?"" says Chiara Falcomat  the first author of the new publication. ""Our studies in mice revealed how genes co-operate to cause cancer in different organs. We identified main players, the order in which they occur during tumor progression, and the molecular processes how they turn normal cells into threatening cancers. Such processes are potential targets for new treatments"".In the mice, the team uncovered a stepwise process of genetic alterations, which drive the development of these cancer types. Some cooperating genetic events overactivate the PI3K signaling pathway, making them cancerous. Others disrupt regulators proteins, inactivating their ability to suppress cancer progression.""Understanding the genetic interactions in different cancer types will guide more precise therapeutic decision making in the future"" says G nter Schneider, Professor for Translational Cancer Research at the University Medical Center G ttingen.

In silico refers to trials situated in the silicon of computer chips, as opposed to ""in vitro"" or ""in vivo"" experiments, situated in test tubes or directly in living organisms.""It's not that in-silico trials should replace clinical trials,"" Layton said. ""A model is a simplification, but it can help us whittle down the drugs for clinical trials. Clinical trials are expensive and can cost human lives. Using models helps narrow the drug candidates to the ones that are best for safety and efficacy.""The researchers, one of the first groups to be working on these models, were able to capture the results of different treatments that were used on COVID-19 patients in clinical trials. Their results are remarkably consistent with live data on COVID infections and treatments.One example of a treatment used in the model was Remdesivir, a drug that was used in the World Health Organization's global ""solidarity"" trials. The simulated model and the live trial both showed the drug to be biologically effective but clinically questionable, unless administered shortly after viral infection.The model might also work for current and future variants of concern. The researchers anticipate the virus will continue to undergo mutation, which could precipitate new waves of infection.""As we learn more about different variants of concern, we can change the model's structure or parameters to simulate the interaction between the immune system and the variants,"" Sadria said.

This compares to an estimated prevalence of 0.9% in adults admitted with COVID-19.Eight (15%) children presenting with neurological features did not have COVID-19 symptoms although the virus was detected by PCR, underscoring the importance of screening children with acute neurological disorders for the virus.Ethnicity was found to be a risk factor, over two thirds of children being of Black or Asian background.For the first time, the study identified key differences between those with PIMS-TS versus those with non-PIMS-TS neurological complications. The 25 children (48%) diagnosed with PIMS-TS displayed multiple neurological features including encephalopathy, stroke, behavioural change, and hallucinations; they were more likely to require intensive care. Conversely, the non-PIMS-TS 27 (52%) children had a primary neurological disorder such as prolonged seizures, encephalitis (brain inflammation), Guillain-Barr  syndrome and psychosis. In almost half of these cases, this was a recognised post-infectious neuro-immune disorder, compared to just one child in the PIMS-TS group, suggesting that different immune mechanisms are at work.Short-term outcomes were apparently good in two thirds (65%) although a third (33%) had some degree of disability and one child died at the time of follow-up. However, the impacts on the developing brain and longer-term consequences are not yet known.First author Dr Stephen Ray, a Wellcome Trust clinical fellow and paediatrician at the University of Liverpool said:  The risk of a child being admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is small, but among those hospitalised, brain and nerve complications occur in almost 4%. Our nationwide study confirms that children with the novel post-infection hyper-inflammatory syndrome PIMS-TS can have brain and nerve problems; but we have also identified a wide spectrum of neurological disorders in children due to COVID-19 who didn t have PIMS-TS. These were often due to the child s immune response after COVID-19 infection. Joint senior-author Dr Rachel Kneen, a Consultant Paediatric Neurologist at Alder Hey Children s NHS Foundation Trust and honorary clinical Senior Lecturer at the University of Liverpool said:  Many of the children identified were very unwell. Whilst they had a low risk of death, half needed intensive care support and a third had neurological disability identified. Many were given complex medication and treatments, often aimed at controlling their own immune system. We need to follow these children up to understand the impact in the long term. Joint senior-author Dr Benedict Michael, a senior clinician scientist and MRC Fellow at the University of Liverpool said:  Now we appreciate the capacity for COVID-19 to cause a wide range of brain complications in those children who are hospitalised with this disease, with the potential to cause life-long disability, we desperately need research to understand the immune mechanisms which drive this. Most importantly- How do we identify those children at risk and how should we treat them to prevent lasting brain injury? We are so pleased that the UK government has funded our COVID-CNS study to understand exactly these questions so that we can help inform doctors to better recognise and treat these children.

These tiny, but mighty organelles play various life-sustaining roles, from powering our own cells and organs to fueling chemical and biological processes. But when they aren't working properly, a number of rare diseases can occur.Mitochondrial diseases are a group of debilitating genetic disorders that affect one in 5,000 people throughout the world, most of them being children. Along with these diseases come a variety of health concerns including, but not limited to, heart disease, developmental and cognitive disabilities, respiratory issues, poor growth, and even premature death. As of this moment, there is no cure.But recent work published in the journals Mitochondrion and BMC Molecular and Cell Biology by Aloka Abey Bandara, a research associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology in the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, and his team offers mitochondrial disease patients and their parents a glimmer of hope.Along with a team of Virginia Tech researchers across Blacksburg and Roanoke, Bandara has successfully created live cell models that mimic mitochondrial disease cells. These cells will lay the groundwork for drug studies and future studies into mitochondrial diseases.""Our cell models will allow us to see what exactly happens to the cells and its processes when a child develops mitochondrial disease. In addition to these factors, we will be able to conduct further study into the toxicity and effectiveness of novel drug candidates,"" said Bandara, who is also an affiliated faculty member of the Fralin Life Sciences Institute.Our bodies produce life-sustaining energy from the food we eat and the air we breathe. Oxygen and nutrients, like glucose, travel throughout the body's organs, tissues, and cells until they arrive at their final destination: the mitochondria. When the nutrients reach the inner membrane of the mitochondria, a unique series of protein complexes, called the electron transport chain, kicks into gear.Through a series of reactions, the electron transport chain is able to remove electrons from the nutrients and push them through the mitochondrial membrane, which forms a gradient of protons. When this happens, the body generates adenosine triphosphate, better known as ATP, a molecule that carries energy within cells.""Sometimes, you can see disruptions or mutations within the electron transport chain proteins,"" said Bandara. ""As a result, the protein complexes cannot transport electrons, and then energy production is disrupted. Almost all organs of the organism will be affected - heart, eyes, and muscles - and they will not be able to function correctly.""The electron transport chain is composed of five protein complexes, or groups of proteins. Complex I and Complex II are two protein complexes that are primarily responsible for removing electrons from the nutrients. If they fail to do their duty, the whole electron transport chain fails, and the body cannot produce ATP.Mitochondrial disease patients can have defects in either Complex I or Complex II. Patients who have Complex I disruptions typically have neurological problems, such as seizures and abnormal brain functions. Those with Complex II disruptions can develop many other diseases and are more likely to develop several cancers.Although researchers are able to pinpoint where exactly the defects are located, creating treatments for these mitochondrial diseases has been a challenge. Therapies, vitamins, and dietary adjustments have been able to help alleviate symptoms and slow down the progression of disease; but, mitochondrial disease, itself, does not have a cure. Therefore, new drugs need to be created, tested, and refined.Bandara hopes that his cell lines will not only support upcoming research, but also the patients and their families, who are experiencing the mitochondrial disease and all of its impacts firsthand.""The parents are often helpless because they cannot just go to the pharmacy and get a drug,"" said Bandara. ""Hopefully, they can see that Virginia Tech is taking huge leaps to find a cure for these diseases. Maybe they can feel that they are not alone anymore - that the universities, the government, and science are fighting with them.""In order to test drug candidates, researchers must first create cellular models, which act as artificial ""sick"" cells. Cellular models are an excellent tool for drug discovery because mitochondrial disease can be studied without actually needing to extract cells from patients.To create cells that mimic mitochondrial disease, Bandara had to ""knock-out"" portions of the genome that create the coding for Complex I and Complex II using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.First, researchers identified the portion of the genome that needed to be deleted. Then, they designed a piece of RNA that made that point its ""home base."" The RNA then ""guided"" an enzyme called Cas9 to its home base on the gene. Cas9 is then able to bind to that point and ""cut"" it.After this process was completed, Bandara ran genomic sequencing to confirm that the portion was successfully deleted from the genome. Over several months of hard work, Bandara and his team created two mutant cell lines, one with Complex I removed, and the other without Complex II.Bandara is one of the very few researchers on Virginia Tech's Blacksburg campus to use the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to treat mitochondrial disease.After the mutant cell lines were created, Bandara ran them through a disease model, where he tested the functions of the ""sick"" cell line against the ""parent"" cell line, which is composed of healthy cells. Through close analysis, Bandara confirmed that the sick cells consumed far less oxygen, grew very slowly, and did not produce enough ATP for the cells to function properly - the three trademarks of cells with mitochondrial disease.Once they confirmed that the knockout cell lines properly simulated the cellular dysfunctions of mitochondrial disease, they were able to test a newly developed drug called Idebenone. With this treatment, Bandara showed that cell growth and oxygen consumption can be restored to a certain extent.These cell lines were the product of a fruitful collaboration of experts from the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise and the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.The construction of mutant cell lines was guided and supported by David Brown, a former associate professor in the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise in the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, now the senior director of scientific and technical innovation at Stealth BioTherapeutics, a Boston-based biotechnology company.From this work, the team has received two provisional patents for their cells. One of the cell lines has already been patented and licensed to a pharmaceutical company, which will develop new therapies for individuals suffering from mitochondrial diseases.These cells have been made available for global use by interested researchers and pharmaceutical companies through Ximbio, the world's largest nonprofit specializing in life science research tools of all types.""Cell models of mitochondrial Complex I and II defects carry high societal and economic impact as models for testing drug candidates in a cost- and time-effective manner for the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction,"" said Justin Perry, a Virginia Tech graduate, and now a business development manager at Ximbio.References: 1.

Nevertheless, despite their importance, we remain largely ignorant of how cells sense and respond to these forces.Now, an international team co-led by the researcher Pere Roca-Cusachs, from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), and Isaac Almendros, a researcher at the Respiratory Diseases Networking Biomedical Research Centre (CIBERES) and IDIBAPS, both professors at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Barcelona (UB), has proved that what determines mechanical sensitivity in cells is the rate at which the force is applied, in other words, how fast the force is applied. The paper has been published in the prestigious journal Nature Communications and shows, for the first time in vivo, the predictions of the ""molecular clutch"" model.These results open the door to a better understanding of how a cancerous tumour proliferates, as well as how the heart, the vocal cords or the respiratory system respond to the constant variation of forces to which they are repeatedly exposed.","Published: July 19, 2021"

We show that you don t need chronic, lifelong chromosomal mistakes to produce tumorigenesis at a quite respectable frequency,  said Don Cleveland, Member of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, San Diego, who led the study with Floris Foijer of the University of Groningen, in The Netherlands.  A very transient exposure would likely be sufficient to drive a very substantial increase in tumorigenesis. The finding, detailed this week in the journal Genes & Development, confirms a nearly 120-year-old hypothesis by the German biologist Theodor Boveri that aneuploidy an abnormal number of chromosomes and tumorigenesis are linked. Boveri hypothesized that there would be specific combinations of gains and losses of chromosomes that could lead to cancer. We ve now tested that and shown that not only was he right, but that even a short burst of chromosome instability is enough to induce these combinations,  said Ofer Shoshani, a postdoctoral researcher in Cleveland s lab and the study s first author.In the study, Shoshani and his colleagues overexpressed the gene polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) in mice. Plk4 is a master regulator that controls the number of centrosomes present inside a cell. Centrosomes play an important role in cell division by helping separate replicated chromosomes into two daughter cells. Normally, two centrosomes are present inside a cell during division, one at each pole of the cell. However, when you overexpress Plk4, you have more than two, and this leads to chromosome missegregation, whereby the chromosomes are not being pulled correctly and the daughter cells inherit an unequal number of chromosomes,  Shoshani explained.The scientists overexpressed Plk4 in the mice for either one week, two weeks or four weeks, and found that one week was enough to cause the formation of aggressive T cell lymphomas. Whole genome sequencing of the mouse tumors revealed an increased recurrence of a particular chromosome pattern early in the tumor formation process. This  aneuploid profile  involved triple occurrences of chromosomes 4, 5, 14 and 15 (cells normally contain only two copies of each chromosome).Scientists have long known that certain cancer types are associated with specific chromosome gains for example, breast cancer often involves a gain of chromosome 1.  What our work potentially shows is that when you induce a transient pulse of chromosome instability, you accelerate the formation of such a recurrent aneuploidy profile,  said Shoshani.  We identify the profile originating very early in the formation of cancer, either at, or very close to, the formation of the cell that generates the tumor. Moreover, the researchers found that transient CIN events can drive tumorigenesis regardless of whether p53 a major tumor suppressor gene and the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer is inactivated.  This tells you that transient CINs will enhance tumorigenesis independent of whether you have other genetic issues that might predispose you to cancer,  Cleveland said.The findings could be especially relevant to cancer patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy, particularly those being treated with chemotherapeutic agents known as aneugens, which work by driving chromosome instability and aneuploidy. Our work suggests that cancer patients who undergo therapy using aneugenic drugs might develop secondary cancers down the road,  said Shoshani.  Of course, this would need to be further investigated, in both human patients and by using experimental models in the lab. This article has been republished from the following materials.

An interdisciplinary research team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has now developed a new approach: they engulf and neutralize viruses with nano-capsules tailored from genetic material using the DNA origami method. The strategy has already been tested against hepatitis and adeno-associated viruses in cell cultures. It may also prove successful against coronaviruses.There are antibiotics against dangerous bacteria, but few antidotes to treat acute viral infections. Some infections can be prevented by vaccination but developing new vaccines is a long and laborious process.Now an interdisciplinary research team from the Technical University of Munich, the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and the Brandeis University (USA) is proposing a novel strategy for the treatment of acute viral infections: The team has developed nanostructures made of DNA, the substance that makes up our genetic material, that can trap viruses and render them harmless.DNA nanostructuresEven before the new variant of the coronavirus put the world on hold, Hendrik Dietz, Professor of Biomolecular Nanotechnology at the Physics Department of the Technical University of Munich, and his team were working on the construction of virus-sized objects that assemble themselves.In 1962, the biologist Donald Caspar and the biophysicist Aaron Klug discovered the geometrical principles according to which the protein envelopes of viruses are built. Based on these geometric specifications, the team around Hendrik Dietz at the Technical University of Munich, supported by Seth Fraden and Michael Hagan from Brandeis University in the USA, developed a concept that made it possible to produce artificial hollow bodies the size of a virus.In the summer of 2019, the team asked whether such hollow bodies could also be used as a kind of  virus trap . If they were to be lined with virus-binding molecules on the inside, they should be able to bind viruses tightly and thus be able to take them out of circulation. For this, however, the hollow bodies would also have to have sufficiently large openings through which viruses can get into the shells.""None of the objects that we had built using DNA origami technology at that time would have been able to engulf a whole virus   they were simply too small,"" says Hendrik Dietz in retrospect. ""Building stable hollow bodies of this size was a huge challenge.""The kit for a virus trapStarting from the basic geometric shape of the icosahedron, an object made up of 20 triangular surfaces, the team decided to build the hollow bodies for the virus trap from three-dimensional, triangular plates.For the DNA plates to assemble into larger geometrical structures, the edges must be slightly beveled. The correct choice and positioning of binding points on the edges ensure that the panels self-assemble to the desired objects. In this way, we can now program the shape and size of the desired objects using the exact shape of the triangular plates,  says Hendrik Dietz.  We can now produce objects with up to 180 subunits and achieve yields of up to 95 percent. The route there was, however, quite rocky, with many iterations.""Viruses are reliably blockedBy varying the binding points on the edges of the triangles, the team's scientists can not only create closed hollow spheres, but also spheres with openings or half-shells. These can then be used as virus traps. In cooperation with the team of Prof. Ulrike Protzer, head of the Institute for Virology at TUM and director of the Institute for Virology at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, the team tested the virus traps on adeno-associated viruses and hepatitis B virus cores.""Even a simple half-shell of the right size shows a measurable reduction in virus activity,"" says Hendrik Dietz. ""If we put five binding sites for the virus on the inside, for example, suitable antibodies, we can already block the virus by 80 percent, if we incorporate more, we achieve complete blocking.""To prevent the DNA particles from being immediately degraded in body fluids, the team irradiated the finished building blocks with UV light and treated the outside with polyethylene glycol and oligolysine. The particles were thus stable in mouse serum for 24 hours.A universal construction principleNow the next step is to test the building blocks on living mice. ""We are very confident that this material will also be well tolerated by the human body,"" says Dietz. Bacteria have a metabolism. We can attack them in different ways,   says Prof. Ulrike Protzer.  Viruses, on the other hand, do not have their own metabolism, which is why antiviral drugs are almost always targeted against a specific enzyme in a single virus. Such a development takes time. If the idea of simply mechanically eliminating viruses can be realized, this would be widely applicable and thus an important breakthrough, especially for newly emerging viruses.The starting materials for the virus traps can be mass-produced biotechnologically at a reasonable cost. ""In addition to the proposed application as a virus trap, our programmable system also creates other opportunities,"" says Hendrik Dietz. ""It would also be conceivable to use it as a multivalent antigen carrier for vaccinations, as a DNA or RNA carrier for gene therapy or as a transport vehicle for drugs.""Reference: Sigl C, Willner EM, Engelen W, et al.

If the research is confirmed in further animal studies, and the cells play a similar role in people, they could point the way toward new therapies for pregnancies that are threatened by defects in immune tolerance.The researchers showed that pregnant mice who did not have this subset of cells, known as extrathymic Aire-expressing cells, were twice as likely to miscarry, and in many of these pregnancies fetal growth was severely restricted.""When you're pregnant, the immune system is seeing the placenta for the first time in decades - not since the mother made a placenta when she herself was a fetus,"" said Eva Gillis-Buck, MD, a UCSF surgery resident and first author of the paper in Science Immunology.""Our research suggests that this subset of immune cells is carrying out a sort of 'secondary education' - sometimes many years after the better-known population of the educator cells have carried out the primary education in the thymus - teaching T cells not to attack the fetus, the placenta and other tissues involved in pregnancy.""The immune system has to be educated not to attack one's own tissues and organs to prevent autoimmune disease. But pregnancy presents a unique challenge, since the fetus expresses proteins found in the placenta as well as proteins whose genetics are distinct from the mother.""It was a conceptual leap to link Aire-expressing cells, which are critical for preventing autoimmune disease, to pregnancy,"" said Tippi Mackenzie, MD, professor of surgery and Co-director of the UCSF Center for Maternal Fetal Precision Medicine and a senior author of the paper. ""This work hints at a mechanism for the known association between autoimmune disease and pregnancy complications.""Like the better-known educator cells in the thymus, the rare subset - originally discovered by James Gardner, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of surgery, investigator in the UCSF Diabetes Center, and a senior author of the study - is known for their ability to express a unique protein called the Autoimmune Regulator, or Aire. Aire has been extensively studied in the thymus, where it helps define the curriculum of this ""high school"" for the immune system.But the Aire-expressing cells under study reside outside the thymus in the lymph nodes and spleen, so they are called extrathymic Aire-expressing cells, or eTACs. Their role in the immune system is not fully known, although the UCSF scientists suspect they provide a mechanism for ""continuing education.""The pregnancy finding is the first evidence that eTACs play a role in the maintenance of normal immune tolerance. In the thymus, Aire-expressing cells begin interacting with other immune cells very early in life to teach them what not to attack. The thymus begins to shrink and is nearly gone by adulthood, by which time most immune cells have been educated.But as the thymus shrinks, the population of eTACs in lymph nodes and the spleen expands. The study suggests a healthy pregnancy may depend on having these cells around.To tease apart the normal role of this outlier population of Aire-expressing cells, the researchers used genetically engineered mice from the Gardner lab to delete eTACs selectively during pregnancy.""Understanding how the immune system normally gets educated to distinguish 'self' from 'non-self' is a very fundamental problem in biology,"" Gardner said. ""Once we know the basic wiring of this self-education system, we hope to do all kinds of powerful things - like modify the curriculum to improve pregnancy outcomes, prevent autoimmunity, or promote tolerance of transplanted organs.""Reference: Gillis-Buck E, Miller H, Sirota M, et al.

Further, these responses were comparable or superior to those observed in adults.  These findings are encouraging, especially because we cannot yet vaccinate children under the age of 12 against the virus,  said co-lead author Jillian Hurst, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine.  The study shows that children who ve had mild infections or even those who did not have any symptoms, develop an immune response that will likely provide some protection against future infections.  The researchers -- including senior authors Genevieve Fouda, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in the departments of Pediatrics and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University School of Medicine and Matthew Kelly, M.D., assistant professor in Pediatrics, and co-first author Carolina Garrido, Ph.D., of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute -- evaluated the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in 69 children and adolescents, with ages ranging from 2 months old to 21 years-old. The median age of participants was 11.5 years, and 51% were female. The researchers measured antibody responses among children and adolescents with asymptomatic and mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that the antibody response did not differ based on the presence of symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies remained detectable in the majority of participants up to four months after infection.  The researchers also compared the children s immune responses to those of adults. They found that all children, regardless of age group, had equivalent or slightly higher levels of antibodies than adults at two  months and four months after acute infection. Most studies of the immune responses of children to SARS-CoV-2 have focused on patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), or have assessed immunity only during acute infection,  Fouda said.  Our study provides important information that SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses, regardless of disease severity, may decline over time more slowly in children and adolescents. Study authors said the findings suggest vaccinating young children against COVID-19 could also elicit a similar or greater degree of protection than that of adults.

The study led by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign researcher Jeffrey Moore and Stanford University chemist Todd Martinez demonstrates how external mechanical forces alter atomic motions to manipulate reaction outcomes. The study findings are published in the journal Science. We think of chemical reactions as molecules moving on a surface of potential energy in the way hikers follow the contour map of mountains and valleys along a trail,  said lead author Yun Liu, a post-doctoral researcher in Moore s research group.  A mountain along a reaction path is a barrier that needs to be traversed before the molecules can descend into their final product. Therefore, the relative height of barriers control which path the molecules will most likely choose, allowing chemists to make predictions about what a particular chemical reaction will produce   an outcome called selectivity. Chemists have traditionally assumed that the jiggling of molecules   known as  molecular dynamics    is governed by a potential energy surface. Molecules transform by chemical reactions that seek the path requiring a minimum amount of energy. However, emerging evidence shows that molecules often do not have time to sample the surface, leading to deviations called nonstatistical dynamic effects, the researchers said.Nonstatistical dynamic effects are observed in some common reactions such as nitration of benzene and dehydration reactions,  Liu said.  Despite these examples, NDEs have not fully captured chemists  attention because they are difficult to measure and cannot be controlled to change the reaction outcomes   the essential pursuit of chemistry. Liu developed an experimental design using a carbon-13 isotope-labeled ring molecule with two polymer chains attached. Liu placed the polymers into a reaction vessel and applied a mechanical force via sonication, which rips the ring into two separate groups.   The ring molecule can convert to one of three different products after being ripped apart, making it a good model for investigating NDEs,  Liu said.  The 13-C label allows us to track and measure the chemical changes occurring to the ring, making it distinct from thousands of other chemical bonds in the polymer. Liu hypothesizes that with the excitation of mechanical force, the atoms heat up along specific reaction directions, rather than following the directions shaped by the potential energy surface. The researchers named this departure from the conventional concept of chemical reactions a  flyby trajectory. Using the hiking example, the hypothesis is equivalent to saying that the hiker just decided not to follow the map,  Liu said.  Instead, the hiker was excited enough to hop onto a hang-glider and just fly by between hills on their descent. As a result, the direction in which the molecules move becomes dependent on their initial jump, rather than the subsequent barrier height. Liu performed multiple experiments demonstrating the tunability of the flyby trajectory by increasing the mechanical force so that the reaction can increasingly overcome barriers. Ideally, researchers can turn an unselective reaction into a highly selective one where any side products formed are undetectable.To support the experimental finding, Stanford University graduate student Soren Holm collected 10,000,000 computed geometries to construct a theoretical model of the potential energy surface and then extracted the speed of reaction trajectories under the presence of mechanical force. We found that early trajectories do not slow down when moving past the barriers,  Liu said.  In other words, barriers are flown past rather than being surmounted, which should have slowed down the chemical reaction rate, the researchers said. Over time, the molecules cool down, and subsequent trajectories follow the minimum energy path initially predicted. Our findings will give researchers a more complete understanding of how force can alter the course of chemical reactions to increase production efficiency,  Moore said.  It s another tool in our toolbox to make the things we use every day. Reference: Liu Y, Holm S, Meisner J et al. Flyby reaction trajectories: Chemical dynamics under extrinsic force.

Caffeine is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world, with 80 per cent of adults consuming at least one caffeinated beverage per day,  Dr Schultz says. It s a common stimulant, consumed by professionals, parents, shift workers, and teenagers alike to start their day and stay alert   even the military use caffeine to help combat sleepiness.  But while coffee has its perks, it s also important to acknowledge its fallbacks   one of them being how our kidneys handle calcium. Our research found that people who consume 800 mg of caffeine over a typical working day will have a 77 per cent increase in calcium in their urine, creating a potential deficiency that could impact their bones. Osteoporosis is a chronic, painful, and debilitating disease which makes your bones less dense and more susceptible to fracture. More common in women, it occurs when bones lose calcium and other minerals faster than the body can replace them.In Australia, an estimated 924,000 people have osteoporosis.The double-blind clinical study saw participants chew caffeine or a placebo gum for five minutes at two-hour intervals over a six-hour treatment period (total caffeine 800 mg). While the primary research objective was to examine the impact of caffeine consumption on wakefulness and other factors, this sub-study aimed to evaluate the impact of caffeine consumption on the renal clearance of calcium.Co-researcher, UniSA s Dr Stephanie Reuter Lange says understanding the long-term impacts of high caffeine consumption is especially important for higher risk groups. The average daily intake of caffeine is about 200 mg   roughly two cups of coffee. While drinking eight cups of coffee may seem a lot (800 mg of caffeine), there are groups who would fall into this category,  Dr Reuter Lange says. People at risk could include teenagers who binge-consume energy drinks are at are at risk because their bones are still developing; professional athletes who use caffeine for performance enhancement; as well as post-menopausal women who often have low blood calcium levels due to hormonal changes and lack sufficient daily dietary calcium intake. Increasingly, we are also seeing high levels of caffeine among shiftworkers who need to stay alert over the night-time hours, as well as those in the military who use caffeine to combat sleep deprivation in operational settings. Caffeine in moderation certainly has its pros. But understanding how excess consumption could increase the risks of a highly preventable disease such as osteoporosis, is important. From here, researchers will explore and predict the impact of different levels of caffeine intake on short- and long-term bone health, with the aim to inform dietary guidelines in Australia.Reference: This article has been republished from the following materials.

Previous studies have demonstrated the protective effects of CO against injury in the kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and liver, among other organs. For the past five years, Wang and his collaborators have worked to design a safe way to deliver CO to human patients via prodrugs -- inactive compounds that must undergo a chemical process in the body before releasing the active pharmacological agent.Wang's team developed prodrugs that allow for oral administration of CO using two common artificial sweeteners -- saccharine (an ingredient in Sweet'N Low) and acesulfame (an ingredient in Splenda) -- as ""carrier"" molecules. They designed the molecules to release CO in the process of decomposition, which is triggered by exposure to water. These are the first examples of orally active, organic CO prodrugs using a benign carrier that is approved by the Food & Drug Administration with a demonstrated safety profile.""It's difficult to deliver a gas, much less a poisonous gas, as a therapeutic to patients, and this work represents a pivotal step forward in developing alternative delivery forms,"" said Wang, senior author of the paper and a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar. ""We wanted to work with a carrier that has a very well characterized safety profile, which confers a higher degree of certainty that it will be safe to use in a pill for human consumption.""Of the two prodrugs, the scientists tested one, CO-306, for pharmacological efficacy against acute kidney damage. The researchers administered CO-306, which uses saccharine as a carrier molecule, to mice and found it reduced biomarkers associated with kidney injury, indicating it could be developed into a viable therapy. The mouse model mimicked the mechanisms of kidney tissue damage that occur in patients with extensive muscle damage, sickle cell disease, a common type of malaria, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and severe sepsis.Wang and his collaborators at Georgia State's Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Vanderbilt University, Harvard Medical School and the University of Mississippi plan to conduct more extensive animal model studies and safety assessments on CO-306 before progressing to human clinical studies. They also plan to test CO-306 for efficacy against other types of organ injuries.Wang says CO-based therapies particularly hold promise as a method of reducing the likelihood of organ damage during transplantation and improving outcomes for transplant patients.""Science shows that exposing organs to CO gas can help preserve organs and prevent them from deteriorating during the process of transplantation,"" he said.

YAP plays an important role in the formation of malignant tumours because it is an important regulator and effector of the Hippo signaling pathway. Not only is YAP either off or on, but it has opposite pro- or anti-cancer effects in either context,  Bremner said.  Thus, YAPon cancers need YAP to grow and survive. In contrast, YAPoff cancers stop growing when we switch on YAP. Many YAPoff cancers are highly lethal. In their new research, Bremner and fellow researchers from the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, NY, show that some cancers like prostate and lung can jump from a YAPon state to a YAPoff state to resist therapeutics.When cancer cells are grown in a dish in a lab setting, they either float or stick down. The team of researchers found that YAP is the master regulator of a cell s buoyancy, where all the floating cells are YAPoff, and all the sticky cells are YAPon. Changes in adhesive behavior are well known to be associated with drug resistance, so their findings implicates YAP at the hub of this switch, explained Bremner.Joel Pearson, co-lead author and a post-doctoral fellow in the Bremner Lab at the LTRI, said therapies that tackle these cancers could have a profound effect on patient survival. The simple binary rule we uncovered may expose strategies to treat many cancer types that fall into either the YAPoff or YAPon superclasses,  Pearson said.  Moreover, since cancers jump states to evade therapy, having ways to treat either the YAPoff and YAPon state could become a general approach to stop this cancer from switching types to resist drug treatments. The researchers hope by deducing common vulnerabilities of these types of cancer, it may be possible to develop new therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcomes.The work was funded primarily by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Cancer Research Society, and the Krembil Foundation.Reference: Pearson JD, Huang K, Pacal M, et al.

For researchers trying to understand these emergent behaviors, however, the complexity can tax current computational methods.Now, a team of researchers have developed a new algorithm that can serve as a more effective way to analyze models of biological systems, which in turn allows a new path to understanding the decision-making circuits that make up these systems. The researchers add that the algorithm will help scientists study how relatively simple actions lead to complex behaviors, such as cancer growth and voting patterns.The modeling framework used consists of Boolean networks, which are a collection of nodes that are either on or off, said Jordan Rozum, doctoral candidate in physics at Penn State. For example, a Boolean network could be a network of interacting genes that are either turned on   expressed   or off in a cell. Boolean networks are a good way to capture the essence of a system,  said Rozum.  It s interesting that these very rich behaviors can emerge out of just coupling little on and off switches together   one switch is toggled and then it toggles another switch and that can lead to a big cascade of effects that then feeds back into the original switch. And we can get really interesting complex behaviors out of just the simple couplings. Boolean models describe how information propagates through the network,  said R ka Albert, distinguished professor of physics and biology in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and an affiliate of the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. Eventually, the on/off states of the nodes fall into repeating patterns, called attractors, which correspond to the stable long-term behaviors of the system, according to the researchers, who report their findings in the current issue of Science Advances.Even though these systems are based on simple actions, the complexity can scale up dramatically as nodes are added to the system, especially in the case when events in the system are not synchronous. A typical Boolean network model of a biological process with a few dozen nodes, for example, has tens of billions of states, according to the researchers. In the case of a genome, these models can have thousands of nodes, resulting in more states than there are atoms in the observable universe.The researchers use two transformations   parity and time reversal   to make the analysis of Boolean networks more efficient. The parity transformation offers a mirror image of the network, switching nodes that are on to off and vice versa, which helps identify which subnetworks have combinations of on and off values that can sustain themselves over time. Time reversal runs the dynamics of the network backward, probing which states can precede an initial input state.The team tested their methods on a collection of synthetic Boolean networks called random Boolean networks, which have been used for than 50 years as a way to model how gene regulation determines the fate of a cell. The technique allowed the team to find the number of attractors in these networks for more than 16,000 genes, which, according to the researchers, are sizes larger than ever before analyzed in such detail.According to the team, the technique could help medical researchers. For example, you might want a cancer cell to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and so you want to be able to make the system pick the decisions that lead towards that desired outcome,  said Rozum.  So, by studying where in the network these decisions are made, you can figure out what you need to do to make the system choose those options. Other possibilities exist for using the methods to study issues in the social sciences and information technology. The propagation of information would also make an interesting application,  said Albert.  For example, there are models that describe a society in which people have binary opinions on a matter. In the model people interact with each other, forming a local consensus. Our methods could be used to map the repertoire of consensus groups that are possible, including a global consensus. She added that uses could extend to any area where researchers are trying to find ways to eliminate pathological behaviors, or drive the system into more normal behaviors. To do this, the theory existed, methodologies existed, but the computational expense was a limiting factor,  said Albert.  With this algorithm, that has to a large part been eliminated. The researchers have developed a publicly available software library and the algorithms have already been used in studies carried out by her group, according to Albert.Computations for the study were performed using Penn State s Roar supercomputer.

But when fear responses are out of control, this can lead to persistent fears and anxiety disorders. In Europe, about 15 percent of the population is affected by anxiety disorders. Existing therapies remain largely unspecific or are not generally effective, because the detailed neurobiological understanding of these disorders is lacking.What was known so far is that distinct nerve cells interact together to regulate fear responses by promoting or suppressing them. Different circuits of nerve cells are involved in this process. A kind of ""tug-of-war"" takes place, with one brain circuit ""winning"" and overriding the other, depending on the context. If this system is disturbed, for example if fear reactions are no longer suppressed, this can lead to anxiety disorders.Recent studies have shown that certain groups of neurons in the amygdala are crucial for the regulation of fear responses. The amygdala is a small almond-shaped brain structure in the center of the brain that receives information about fearful stimuli and transmits it to other brain regions to generate fear responses. This causes the body to release stress hormones, change heart rate or trigger fight, flight or freezing responses.Now, a group led by Professors Stephane Ciocchi of the University of Bern and Andreas Luthi of the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel has discovered that the amygdala plays a much more active role in these processes than previously thought: Not only is the central amygdala a ""hub"" to generate fear responses, but it contains neuronal microcircuits that regulate the suppression of fear responses. In animal models, it has been shown that inhibition of these microcircuits leads to long-lasting fear behaviour. However, when they are activated, behaviour returns to normal despite previous fear responses. This shows that neurons in the central amygdala are highly adaptive and essential for suppressing fear. These results were published in the journal Nature Communications. ","Published: July 19, 2021"

Prior publications suggest that the cells that make the spinal fluid could become infected with SARS-CoV-2, but other routes of entry seemed likely.""Gleeson and colleagues, who included both neuroscientists and infectious disease specialists, confirmed that human neural cells are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, recent studies hinted that other types of brain cells might serve as a 'Trojan horse.'Pericytes are specialized cells that wrap around blood vessels -- and carry the SARS-CoV2 receptor. The researchers introduced pericytes into three-dimensional neural cell cultures -- brain organoids -- to create ""assembloids,"" a more sophisticated stem cell model of the human body. These assembloids contained many types of brain cells in addition to pericytes, and showed robust infection by SARS-CoV-2.The coronavirus was able to infect the pericytes, which served as localized factories for production of SARS-CoV-2. These locally produced SARS-CoV-2 could then spread to other cell types, leading to widespread damage. With this improved model system, they found that the supporting cells known as astrocytes were the main target of this secondary infection.The results, said Gleeson, indicate that one potential route of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain is through the blood vessels, where SARS-CoV-2 can infect pericytes, and then SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other types of brain cells.""Alternatively, the infected pericytes could lead to inflammation of the blood vessels, followed by clotting, stroke or hemorrhages, complications that are observed in many patients with SARS-CoV-2 who are hospitalized in intensive care units.""Researchers now plan to focus on developing improved assembloids that contain not just pericytes, but also blood vessels capable of pumping blood to better model the intact human brain. Through these models, Gleeson said, greater insight into infectious disease and other human brain disease could emerge.Reference: Wang L, Sievert D, Clark AE, et al.

The study, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was performed in a model of recurrent human food poisoning previously linked with the condition. The findings represent a scientific advance toward a targeted therapy to help the millions of people worldwide affected by the disorder.""Our new research demonstrates how increased activity of Neu3--an enzyme found in the gut--triggers an inflammatory cascade that leads to disease,"" says Marth. ""Prior to this study, we knew that a neuraminidase enzyme was involved, but didn't know the source of the enzyme.""This study pinpoints Neu3 as the protein that triggers onset and progression of colitis,"" adds Marth. ""In the absence of Neu3, disease onset and progression do not occur, indicating that the enzyme may be a valuable therapeutic target.""Previously, the Marth laboratory developed a unique model of colitis based on recurrent human food poisoning, which can identify environmental sources of disease. The (mouse) model reflects how humans may contract colitis following repeated, mild infections of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (ST), a common human food poisoning pathogen.""We're now looking at an intrinsic mechanism of protein aging and turnover that's being modified by a foodborne pathogen,"" says Marth. ""The pathogen targets the protein aging process in the intestinal tract, thereby diminishing the expression of a key anti-inflammatory enzyme that would normally prevent the onset of colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).""That enzyme is intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), which detoxifies bacterial toxins, and its augmentation is also the rationale for current clinical trials in the treatment of colitis and sepsis.""The problem starts when the ST pathogen is ingested and triggers our immune system to 'amp up' Neu3 neuraminidase expression,"" adds Marth. ""Increased activity of Neu3 leads to a reduced life span of IAP, and that impairs the ability to detoxify a damaging endotoxin normally found among bacteria in the gut--and this leads to chronic gut inflammation.""Inhibiting Neu3 with the antiviral drug Relenza (used to treat influenza) broke that chain, reduced inflammatory cytokine expression and prevented severe colitis. However, current neuraminidase inhibitors such as Relenza and Tamiflu are optimized for viral and bacterial neuraminidases and would need further development to be clinically effective against the human form of Neu3.""We had to increase the oral dose of Relenza well above that recommended for use in humans,"" says Marth. ""It worked without apparent side effects; however, a new generation of neuraminidase inhibitors that target the mammalian enzyme is needed. Several research groups are now focusing on developing clinically relevant inhibitors.""We were rather surprised that the culprit turned out to be Neu3, as many bacteria in the gut are capable of synthesizing their own neuraminidase enzymes,"" Marth notes. ""Based on the genetic proof in our study, inhibiting Neu3 would be expected to have a positive therapeutic impact. But there's also another option: augmenting IAP appears to be equally beneficial. Perhaps a dual approach including both oral Neu3 inhibition and oral IAP augmentation simultaneously could be even more effective at reducing inflammation and preventing the onset of colitis.""Reference: Yang WH, Westman JS, Heithoff DM, et al.

The findings appear in an upcoming issue of JASN.Despite advances in reducing the amount of lead in drinking water, low levels of contamination remain widespread throughout the United States. This may be especially dangerous for the 30-40 million Americans living with chronic kidney disease, who have heightened susceptibility to the toxic effects of lead. To examine the effects of low levels of lead contamination on individuals with advanced kidney disease, investigators analyzed health information for 597,968 patients initiating dialysis in the United States between 2005 and 2017. The team also assessed lead concentrations in community water systems in the 5-year period prior to dialysis initiation, relying on city-level data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Information System. The investigators focused on the potential effects of lead on levels of hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein in red blood cells known to be effected by lead poisoning. Individuals living in cities with detectable levels of lead in their community's water had significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations before starting dialysis and during the first month of dialysis therapy. They also were prescribed higher doses of medications to treat anemia, which occurs when red blood cell counts or hemoglobin levels are lower than normal. These associations were observed at lead levels below the Environmental Protection Agency's threshold (0.015 mg/L) that mandates regulatory action. The findings suggest that for patients with poor kidney function, there is no safe amount of lead in drinking water. ""While drinking water may seem uniformly healthy, low levels of lead contamination found in the majority of drinking water systems in the United States may have toxic effects for those with chronic kidney disease,"" said lead author John Danziger, MD, MPhil, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

The anammox bacterium and other bacteria use this enzyme to convert toxic nitrite into nitrate. Now that the working of the enzyme has become clear, new possibilities have opened for the improved deployment of the anammox bacterium for power generation from wastewater and for the production of rocket fuel. Researchers from Radboud University and the Max Planck Institutes in Heidelberg and Frankfurt published a paper on the subject in Nature Microbiology today.Nitrogen-consuming bacteria like the anammox bacterium require the nitrite oxidoreductase enzyme (NXR) to convert toxic nitrite into nitrate. The enzyme fulfils a central role in nature's nitrogen cycle. Significant amounts of ammonium end up in soil due to activities such as the use of fertilisers. The ammonium is subsequently converted into nitrate, which is water-soluble and therefore easily washes away into groundwater and surface water. This process forms an important part of the reason why too much nitrogen has such an environmental impact. ""Despite the enzyme being such a vital part of the nitrogen cycle, we knew relatively little about how it worked"", says Mike Jetten, professor of Ecological Microbiology at Radboud University. ""It took us more than ten years to map the molecular structure of this enzyme in the anammox bacterium."" ""NXR turns out to have a complex structure and contains unexpected parts"", explains Thomas Barends of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg. ""Together with our colleagues in Frankfurt, we found a building block that ensures the protein combines into long threads. We have also gained greater insight into the way proteins are able organise inside a cell in general."" The knowledge of the inner working of NXR will help in the deployment of the anammox bacterium in interesting applications. Jetten: ""Anammox requires this enzyme to grow, but it also grows slowly by nature. We might now be able to suppress the bottlenecks in the growing process, allowing for the application of the bacterium in smaller and faster installations."" Nijmegen microbiologists have long studied the properties of this unique anammox bacterium. It is the only known bacterium that is able to convert harmful ammonium into harmless nitrogen gas without requiring oxygen in the process. Since its discovery, anammox has been widely used for wastewater treatment. A year ago, the microbiologists discovered that the bacterium can help to generate power from wastewater. ""This - previously impossible - reaction was made possible by circumventing the NXR enzyme. Another point on our bucket list is to have anammox produce rocket fuel on a large scale. To achieve this, we will need to know how to circumvent the enzyme even more efficiently: this will cause the bacterium to focus less of growth and more on the synthesis of the by-product hydrazine, one of the compounds used in liquid rocket fuel.""ReferenceChicano, T.M., Dietrich, L., de Almeida, N.M. et al.

The root of this varied activity, though, is poorly understood. Now, Penn State researchers have identified one cause of the fluctuations: inherent randomness in the flow rate of red blood cells through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. According to the researchers, this randomness could have potential implications for understanding the biological build-up mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer s disease. These oxygenation fluctuations also occur in other tissues, like muscle,  said Patrick Drew, Huck Distinguished Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Neurosurgery and Biomedical Engineering. The question we had was: Are these fluctuations caused by neural activity or something else? The fluctuations resemble 1/f-like noise, a statistical pattern showing large fluctuations made up of many small fluctuations and naturally occurring in a variety of phenomena, from stock-market prices to river heights. The researchers investigated the fluctuations in mice due to their brains  similarities to those of humans, according to Drew, who also serves as associate director of the Penn State Neuroscience Institute. First, the researchers monitored the blood flow, oxygenation and electrical signals produced by brain activity   the first time the latter two had been tracked simultaneously, according to Drew   in awake mice. They collected the data as mice moved on a spherical treadmill for up to 40 minutes at a time.Next, to investigate the relationship between brain activity and oxygenation fluctuations, the researchers used pharmacological compounds to temporarily and reversibly silence neural signals in the mice s brains. Despite the silencing, the fluctuations continued, showing little correlation between neural activity and oxygenation.The passage of red blood cells, however, told a different story. Using two-photon laser scanning microscopy, an imaging technique used to visualize cells deep inside living tissue, the researchers could visualize the passage of individual red blood cells through capillaries.  It s like traffic,  Drew said.  Sometimes there are a lot of cars going by, and the traffic gets plugged up, and sometimes there aren t. And red blood cells go either way when they approach a junction, so this random flow can lead to bottlenecks and stalls in the vessel.  Importing experimental data into a statistical model allowed the researchers to run further simulations and make inferences based on massive amounts of data produced by the model. The researchers discovered that these random red blood cell stoppages contributed to the fluctuations in oxygenation, further supporting a relationship between the flow of red blood cells through capillaries and the tiny changes in oxygenation that formed larger trends.Better understanding the regulation of blood flow and subsequent transport of oxygen can help researchers improve medical technology and explore causes of diseases such as Alzheimer s, according to Drew.

There are several reasons why this is standard procedure, including consideration for the safety of the mother and child and logistical challenges associated with study follow-up.In the context of the current global pandemic, where pregnant women are at an increased risk of developing severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection, the lack of data surrounding the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in this population has been problematic. Should pregnant women choose to be vaccinated with a potentially life-saving preventative with limited data, or risk infection with SARS-CoV-2?The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines across the globe, coupled with the decision of many pregnant women to be immunized, has enabled researchers to collect and analyze real-world data.In a new retrospective observational study, researchers from Tel Aviv and the US matched 15,060 pregnant women in Israel according to age, gestational age, residential area, population subgroup, parity, and influenza immunization status, into vaccinated/unvaccinated pairs. The vaccinated women received two doses of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2. The findings   published this week in JAMA   show that vaccination with BNT162b2 in pregnant women significantly lowered the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an efficacy rate of 78%.1  Technology Networks spoke with Professor Gabriel Chodick, head of epidemiology and database analysis at the Maccabi Institute for Research, Tel Aviv, and co-author of the study, to learn more about the efficacy data. Chodick also discusses the challenges associated with conducting observational studies and what the data means for pregnant women that want to be immunized.Molly Campbell (MC): Can you discuss the challenges associated with conducting vaccine research in pregnant women, during a global pandemic?Gabriel Chodick (GC): The main challenge in any study is to ensure that the design of the study, the analysis of the data, and the interpretation of the results are done with the utmost scientific rigour to provide valid findings. This was especially important in this situation, where concerns and fears about the use of the vaccines during pregnancy were propelled by the paucity of available data on their effectiveness and safety during gestation. Given the global pandemic, an additional challenge was to execute this analysis in a timely manner to provide much needed information to help direct immunization policies and provide clinical recommendations to expectant women and their medical care team.MC: This study adopted an observational, retrospective methodology. For our readers that may be unfamiliar, can you describe why this was the most appropriate approach for this work?GC: By  observational  we mean that we did not conduct any medical interventions (so we did not randomly create an intervention group that received the vaccine and a control group that did not, like was done in the initial randomized clinical trials), but rather relied on  real-world  data on pregnant women who were or who were not vaccinated to make our inference. By retrospective we mean that we used data that were already collected as part of the national vaccination campaign in Israel, rather than collecting new data prospectively.The previously conducted clinical trials for all of the four main vaccines excluded pregnant women. Thus, very little data were available from these studies concerning the use in this population. Our approach allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines in real-world settings while providing timely clinical recommendations.MC: Can you describe how the participants were identified and recruited for the study? How representative is the sample? GC: Israel has a single-payer, universal healthcare system, where care is provided by four competing health funds. This study was conducted by KSM (Kahn-Sagol-Maccabi), the Research and Innovation Centre of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which is Israel s second largest integrated health fund. The fund provides medical services to approximately 2.5 million members that constitute a representative sample (~30%) of the general Israeli population. Maccabi maintains a computerized database of anonymized electronic health records which contain extensive longitudinal clinical and demographic information. For this study, these data were used to ascertain all female members of Maccabi who were pregnant at any time from the initiation of the national vaccination campaign in Israel in late December 2020, through to the end of the study recruitment period in late February 2021.MC: What are your key findings, and how can the results of the research be applied to the general public? GC: The analysis unequivocally indicated that women who received the Pfizer vaccine had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, no elevated risks for any pregnancy complications or adverse developmental outcomes were observed in these women compared to women who were not vaccinated during pregnancy. The results suggest that vaccination is an effective strategy for minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women, and that use of the vaccines is not associated with significant adverse side effects.MC: Can you discuss the potential sources and impact of bias in this study?GC: Perhaps the biggest threat to the validity of any observational study is a lack of exchangeability between the study groups. In other words, we must always ask ourselves whether the results we observe are indeed solely due to the difference in exposure between the groups (in this case, whether the expectant woman received the vaccine or not), or whether there are other factors that differ between the groups that drive the observed findings.Since a random allocation of treatment, as is often done in clinical trials, helps ensure that the groups are comparable, we attempted to mimic this approach by using a matched design. This essentially means that for each woman who was vaccinated, we found another woman who was not vaccinated and who also shared similar demographic and clinical characteristics with the vaccinated woman to serve as her control. This allowed us to create two study groups that were comparable, apart from their exposure to the vaccine. Still, we normally only have data on factors we know or have the ability to measure, and thus it is always possible that there are still some meaningful differences between the groups that can bias the findings. To ensure that the two study groups were indeed exchangeable, we relied on the fact that previous data suggested that no immunity develops during approximately the 10 days immediately preceding the first dose of the vaccine. Thus, if the groups were indeed comparable, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the two groups should be similar during the first 10 days after the first dose, regardless of vaccination status. This is indeed what we observed. Of course, like with any other study, it is always possible that the results are still susceptible to some residual confounding or selection effects, and thus we always want to see that the findings are replicable in other cohorts.MC: What are your next research steps?GC: Similar to the case in the non-pregnant population, we need to continue follow-up on pregnant women who received the vaccine to determine how long the immunity lasts, and whether additional booster shots are needed. This also becomes important now with the emergence of new variants for which the existing vaccines are possibly less effective. In addition, many women in our study received their vaccine in early pregnancy, and their pregnancy was still ongoing by the time we ended the analysis. While we did not observe any indication that use of the vaccine was associated with any adverse effects to the pregnant woman or her foetus, extending follow-up would allow us to verify these observations using additional data. It would also be of interest to determine if, and to what extent, immunity is passed from the pregnant mother to her new-born.Gabriel Chodick was speaking to Molly Campbell, Science Writer for Technology Networks.Reference: Goldshtein I, Nevo D, Steinberg DM, et al.

This is the conclusion reached by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). The longitudinal study recently appeared in The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry.During the Corona pandemic, walks became a popular and regular pastime. A neuroscientific study suggests that this habit has a good effect not only on our general well-being but also on our brain structure. It shows that the human brain benefits from even short stays outdoors. Until now, it was assumed that environments affect us only over longer periods of time.The researchers regularly examined six healthy, middle-aged city dwellers for six months. In total, more than 280 scans were taken of their brains using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The focus of the study was on self-reported behavior during the last 24 hours and in particular on the hours that participants spent outdoors prior to imaging. In addition, they were asked about their fluid intake, consumption of caffeinated beverages, the amount of time spent outside, and physical activity, in order to see if these factors altered the association between time spent outside and the brain. In order to be able to include seasonal differences, the duration of sunshine in the study period was also taken into account.Brain scans show that the time spent outdoors by the participants was positively related to gray matter in the right dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex, which is the superior (dorsal) and lateral part of the frontal lobe in the cerebral cortex. This part of the cortex is involved in the planning and regulation of actions as well as what is referred to as cognitive control. In addition, many psychiatric disorders are known to be associated with a reduction in gray matter in the prefrontal area of the brain.The results persisted even when the other factors that could also explain the relationship between time spent outdoors and brain structure were kept constant. The researchers performed statistical calculations in order to examine the influence of sunshine duration, number of hours of free time, physical activity, and fluid intake on the results. The calculations revealed that time spent outdoors had a positive effect on the brain regardless of the other influencing factors.""Our results show that our brain structure and mood improve when we spend time outdoors. This most likely also affects concentration, working memory, and the psyche as a whole. We are investigating this in an ongoing study. The subjects are asked to also solve cognitively challenging tasks and wear numerous sensors that measure the amount of light they are exposed to during the day, among other environmental indicators,"" says Simone K hn, head of the Lise Meitner Group for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and lead author of the study.The results therefore, support the previously assumed positive effects of walking on health and extend them by the concrete positive effects on the brain. Because most psychiatric disorders are associated with deficits in the prefrontal cortex, this is of particular importance to the field of psychiatry.""These findings provide neuroscientific support for the treatment of mental disorders. Doctors could prescribe a walk in the fresh air as part of the therapy - similar to what is customary for health cures,"" says Anna Mascherek, post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and co-author of the study.In the ongoing studies, the researchers also want to directly compare the effects of green environments vs urban spaces on the brain. In order to understand where exactly the study participants spend their time outdoors, the researchers plan to use GPS (Global Positioning System) data and include other factors that may play a role such as traffic noise and air pollution.Reference: K hn S, Mascherek A, Filevich E, et al.

One regularity that was discovered over 100 years ago is the Iambic-Trochaic Law: when every other sound is loud, we tend to hear groups of two sounds with an initial beat. When every other sound is long, we hear groups of two sounds with a final beat. But why does our rhythm perception work this way?In a recent study in Psychological Review, McGill University Professor Michael Wagner shows that the rhythm we perceive is a result of the way listeners make two separate types of decisions, one about grouping (which syllables or tones group together) and the other about prominence (which syllables or tones seem foregrounded or backgrounded). These decisions about grouping and prominence mutually inform each other.The findings may deepen our understanding of speech and language processing, with potential implications in a wide range of areas, including teaching, speech therapy, improving synthesized speech, and improving speech recognition systems.","Published: July 16, 2021"

But what does the brain do during these long hours? Using an artificial intelligence approach capable of decoding brain activity during sleep, scientists at the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, were able to glimpse what we think about when we are asleep. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), the Geneva team provides unprecedented evidence that the work of sorting out the thousands of pieces of information processed during the day takes place during deep sleep. Indeed, at this time, the brain, which no longer receives external stimuli, can evaluate all of these memories in order to retain only the most useful ones. To do so, it establishes an internal dialogue between its different regions. Moreover, associating a reward with a specific information encourages the brain to memorise it in the long term. These results, to be discovered in the journal Nature Communications, open for the first time a window on the human mind in sleep.In the absence of tools capable of translating brain activity, the content of our sleeping thoughts remains inaccessible. We however do know that sleep plays a major role in memory consolidation and emotional management: when we sleep, our brain reactivates the memory trace built during the day and helps us to regulate our emotions.  To find out which brain regions are activated during sleep, and to decipher how these regions allow us to consolidate our memory, we developed a decoder capable of deciphering the activity of the brain in deep sleep and what it corresponds to , explains Virginie Sterpenich, a researcher in the laboratory of Professor Sophie Schwartz in the Department of Basic Neurosciences at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, and the principal investigator of this study.  In particular, we wanted to see to what extent positive emotions play a role in this process. During deep sleep, the hippocampus   a structure of the temporal lobe which stores temporary traces of recent events   sends back to the cerebral cortex the information it has stored during the day. A dialogue is established which allows the consolidation of memory by replaying the events of the day and therefore reinforce the link between neurons.  ","Published: July 16, 2021"

Animals are generally unable to use this process to acquire energy, but there are a few known exceptions to this. Some sea slugs take up chloroplasts from the algae that they consume into their cells. These chloroplasts retain their ability to perform photosynthetic activity within the animal cells for several months, and thus provide them with photosynthesis-derived nutrition. This process is called ""kleptoplasty"", and it has attracted much attention due to its amazing uniqueness in making animals photosynthetic for over 50 years.A pressing question is how these sequestered chloroplasts retains their photosynthetic capability without algal nuclei. Since the genome of the algal nucleus encodes most of the proteins required for photosynthesis, chloroplasts isolated from algal cells instantly lose their photosynthetic capability. Nevertheless, algae-eating sea slugs retain this photosynthetic capability for months. There have been numerous debates about the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of sequestered chloroplasts retaining photosynthetic capabilities over the long term. A widely accepted hypothesis accounting for kleptoplasty is the horizontal gene transfer of the photosynthesis genes from algae to sea slug.A team of researchers at the National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB), in addition to collaborators from seven other Japanese institutions, have published the genome of the sea slug, Plakobranchus ocellatus type black, in eLife. ""Since the sea slug is a non-model organism, its genome analysis was very tough in comparison to model organisms such as the mouse and the fruitfly. Furthermore, there was no high-quality genetic information for them. This situation consequently hindered the verification of the hypothesis of algae-derived horizontal gene transfer,"" said Shuji Shigenobu, a genome scientist and professor at NIBB who is the corresponding author of the paper, ""But we succeeded in accurately revealing the genome information of the sea slug"". Scientists are ready to settle the arguments concerning the horizontal transfer of algal genes to the animal nucleus based on newly unveiled genome data. ""We looked at the genome very carefully, but we found no evidence of photosynthetic genes encoded on the sea slug genome, "" he said.""We are embarking upon a new challenge to answer the question: how does the sea slug retains this function without horizontal gene transfer?"", said Taro Maeda, the first and co-corresponding author of the paper. ""Our genome data also provides clues to this. We have found several candidate genes related to the long-term maintenance of photosynthetic activity. These genes related to protein metabolism, oxidative stress tolerance, and innate immunity should be subsequently highlighted in future studies.""The mechanisms underlying kleptoplasty are still elusive. Further understanding of this phenomenon may lead us to innovative biotechnologies, which, for example, could bestow photosynthetic abilities to other various animal cells in the future.Reference: Maeda T, Takahashi S, Yoshida T, et al.

Not only has it been used for producing bread and beer for thousands of years, but today it can also be engineered to produce an array of other useful compounds that form the basis of pharmaceuticals, fuels, and food additives. However, achieving optimal production of these products is difficult, requiring the complex biochemical networks inside the cell to be rewired and extended through the introduction of new enzymes and the tuning of gene expression levels.Klaudia Ciurkot, first author of the study and an EU-funded industrial PhD student based at DSM stated:  To overcome the challenges of optimising S. cerevisiae cells for bio-production, we explored the use of a less widely employed CRISPR technology based on the Cas12a protein. Unlike the Cas9 protein that is more commonly used, Cas12a can be rapidly programmed to interact with sequences that are responsible for controlling gene expression and easily targeted to many different sequences at the same time. This made it an ideal platform for carrying out the complex gene regulation often required for producing industrially relevant compounds. She went on to add:  What was particularly exciting for me was that this study is the first to demonstrate Cas12a s ability to control gene expression in S. cerevisiae and through joint research across DSM and the University of Bristol, we were able to figure out the rules for how this system is best designed and used. Thomas Gorochowski, a co-author on the work and Royal Society University Research Fellow based in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol further stated:  It is hugely exciting that Cas12a has been shown to work so well for gene regulation in the yeast S. cerevisiae, an organism that has huge industrial importance. In addition, the systematic approach we have taken to pull apart and analyse the many difficult aspects of the system, act as a firm foundation for future optimisation. In addition to analysing how the Cas12a-based system is best engineered, the scientists went on to show its use in robustly controlling the production of  -carotene   an industrially important compound used in production of food additives and nutraceuticals.Ren  Verwaal, senior author and Senior Scientist at DSM ended by stating:  By demonstrating the capabilities of this system to control the biosynthesis of  -carotene, we have opened the gates to its broader application for other key bio-based products. I cannot wait to see how our system is used to develop more sustainable production platforms for everyday products we all rely on.

The findings, which are published in Science Translational Medicine, are especially important because vestibular schwannomas are currently treated with surgery and radiation therapy (which carry risks of nerve damage), and no drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat these tumors or their associated hearing loss.""Developing effective therapeutics to preserve hearing function in patients with NF2 is an urgent unmet medical need. The greatest barrier to managing NF2-related auditory impairment is our incomplete understanding of how schwannomas cause hearing loss,"" says co-senior author Lei Xu, MD, PhD, an investigator in the Steele Laboratories for Tumor Biology within the MGH Department of Radiation Oncology. A previous report showing that scarring, or fibrosis, exists in schwannomas and correlates with hearing loss prompted the team to test whether a drug that blocks fibrosis might be effective.Losartan blocks a component of the renin-angiotensin system, which is involved not only in regulating blood pressure but also in stimulating fibrosis and inflammation. The entire class of angiotensin-targeting drugs, which includes losartan, has been shown to reduce collagen accumulation in cardiac and kidney fibrotic disease. Using a mouse model of NF2, Xu and her colleagues found that losartan treatment had several effects on vestibular schwannomas and the brain: It reduced inflammatory signaling and swelling and thus prevented hearing loss, and it increased oxygen delivery to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy (which may help lower the radiation dose needed to control tumor growth and limit radiation-associated toxicities).In preparation to translate these findings into the clinic, co-senior author Konstantina Stankovic, MD, PhD, former chief of the Division of Otology and Neurotology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, now Bertarelli Professor and Chair of the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine, examined patient samples and data. Her team found that vestibular schwannomas associated with poor hearing had more pronounced inflammatory signaling than tumors associated with good hearing. This inflammatory signaling in tumors was capable of directly damaging cochlear cells that are essential for hearing. Also, patients with vestibular schwannoma who took losartan or other drugs in its class experienced no progression in hearing loss, unlike patients on other or no antihypertensive drugs. This study illustrates the advantages offered by an integrated approach and teamwork that spans basic research, translational investigation and clinical care.The findings support the need for a prospective clinical trial of losartan in patients with NF2 and vestibular schwannomas. ""As one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for hypertension, the safety and low cost of losartan warrants rapid translation of our research to patients with vestibular schwannomas to try to prevent tumor-induced sensorineural hearing loss,"" Stankovic says.Reference: Wu L, Vasilijic S, Sun Y, et al.

But within their clans, there is order: A specific matrilineal hierarchy governs societies in this species where females are dominant to males.While researchers have intensively studied the social structure of hyenas and other animals, it's only recently that scientists have begun to investigate how this structure arises. A new study led by Penn biologists, which relies upon 27 years of detailed observations of hyena social behavior collected by researchers at Michigan State University, pulls back the curtain on how social order comes to be.Their findings show that hyenas inherit their mother's social networks, so their social connections resemble their mother's. However, offspring of higher-ranking individuals more faithfully replicate their mother's interactions, winding up with social networks that more closely resemble their mother's than do offspring of females that rank lower on the clan's social ladder. The team reported their findings in the journal Science.""We knew that the social structure of hyenas is based in part on one's rank in the agonistic hierarchy, which we know is inherited from mothers"" says Erol Ak ay, a study coauthor and associate professor in Penn's School of Arts & Sciences. ""But what we found, that affiliative, or friendly interactions, are also inherited, hadn't been shown.""""This is a very simple process of social inheritance that we show works very, very well,"" says Amiyaal Ilany, a senior lecturer at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. ""Individuals that were born to higher rank are more accurate in their inheritance, and they have good reason to do so. It fits well with what is already known about inheritance of rank. There are very strict rules about what place you sit in the hierarchy if you are a hyena.""The work builds on a theoretical model of social network inheritance Ak ay and Ilany developed in 2016. According to that simple framework, animals establish their networks by ""social inheritance,"" or copying their mother's behaviors. The model fit well with snapshots of real-world social networks from not only hyenas but also three other social species: bottle-nosed dolphins, rock hyrax, and sleepy lizards.In the new work, the team aimed to refine their model to better understand the intricacies of social inheritance in hyenas. They were fortunate to have a robust dataset collected by Ak ay and Ilany's coauthor, zoologist Kay Holekamp of Michigan State University, consisting of 27 years of detailed accounting of a clan's social interactions.""We realized we could use that dataset to directly test our model, to see if social ties are inherited or not,"" Ak ay says.Field biologists from Holekamp's research group had meticulously tracked how hyenas in a clan interacted, including who spent time with whom as well as the social rank of each member. To do so, researchers spent months getting to know each member of the clan by sight.""They are there year-round, every day, identifying individuals by their specific spot patterns and other characteristics,"" Ilany says.These observations allowed Ak ay, Ilany, and Holekamp to map out hyenas' social networks based on which individuals spent time close together.""This use of proximity to track social networks isn't possible with humans, as two strangers might randomly get into an elevator together,"" Ilany says. ""But with hyenas, if one individual gets within a few meters of another, that suggests that they have a social connection.""With this picture of each individual's social affiliations in hand, the researchers compared the social networks of mothers to their offspring. ""We developed a new metric to measure social inheritance, to track how faithfully an offspring's network reproduces its mother's network,"" Ak ay says.Hyena cubs stick close to their mothers for the first couple years of life, so the networks of mothers and their offsprings were quite similar to start. However, the researchers noticed that even as the young stopped spending so much time in close proximity to their mothers they still sustained quite similar networks, particularly for female offspring, who generally remain members of the clan for life. ""We have data in some cases showing that the network similarity between mothers and offspring, especially female offspring, was still very high after six or so years,"" says Ilany. ""You may not be seeing your mother as often, or she even may have died, but you still have similar friends.""This pattern was especially strong for the higher-ranking mothers, for whom social inheritance was the strongest in the group.""That is kind of intuitive because things like that happen in human society as well,"" Ak ay says. ""It happens so much we take it for granted. We inherit social connections, and there's a lot of social science research that shows that this has a huge influence on people's life trajectory.""Offspring of lower-ranking mothers were less likely to reproduce their mother's social networks, perhaps trying to compensate for their more lowly origins by associating with a greater variety of individuals.There is no genetic inheritance of rank or close associates in this species, so in Holekamp's opinion one of the most remarkable things about the phenomenon documented here is that the youngsters' relationships with their mothers' close associates are all learned very early in life. One explanation for why inheritance of social networks works better for high- than for low-ranking hyenas may be that low-ranking females tend to go off on their own more often to avoid competition with higher-ranking hyenas, so their cubs have fewer learning opportunities than cubs of high-ranking females.Mother-offspring pairs with more similar social networks also lived longer, the team found. This effect on survivorship may owe to the fact that offspring who spend more time with their mothers and thus replicate their social networks benefit from the increased care.Social rank also had an effect on survivorship and reproductive success.""Rank is super important,"" says Ak ay. ""If you're born to a lower-ranked mother, you are less likely to survive and to reproduce.""The researchers note that social network inheritance likely contributes to a group's stability and also has implications for how behaviors are learned and spread through groups.The study also underscores how factors other than genetics hold sway in key evolutionary outcomes, including reproductive success and overall survival. ""A lot of things that are considered by default to be genetically determined may depend on environmental and social processes,"" says Ilany.Reference: Ilany A, Holekamp KE, Ak ay E.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis has always been vital in this regard. The gold standard since the beginning of the pandemic has been the RT-PCR method; however, it is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires sophisticated equipment, and can only detect the presence of viral RNA in the samples.A team of scientists from Japan, including Professor Manabu Tokeshi of Hokkaido University's Faculty of Engineering, have developed a 20-minute test to detect and quantify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum. Their findings were published in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics.It is estimated that between 40% to 45% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic -- despite being infected, they do not develop any symptoms of the disease. Identifying individuals who may have had asymptomatic Covid-19 is important to understanding the full extent of the pandemic. RT-PCR can only detect the presence of the viral RNA in samples; individuals who have recovered from the pandemic will only have antibodies to the virus, which RT-PCR cannot detect.There are commercially available tests to detect the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; however, the majority of these tests are inaccurate. Lateral flow immunoassay is one of the most common tests for diagnosis of Covid-19 based on antibody detection. While rapid, it is a qualitative method, and cannot be used for the quantification of antibodies. Further, the method does not scale well, resulting in a low cost efficiency.The scientists developed a method of detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum using a method called non-competitive fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). This method is not just rapid, but can also be used to quantify the antibodies. FPIA has been used in the food and medical industry; the team has previously made many innovations to the method and associated equipment, including the development of a portable fluorescence polarization analyzer.FPIA requires fluorescently-labelled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (F-RBD) and human serum to be mixed together for the test. Individuals who have been infected with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 will have anti-spike protein antibodies in their serum. When these antibodies bind to F-RBD, polarised light is emitted, while F-RBD alone emits depolarized light. By measuring the degree of polarisation using a fluorescence polarization analyser, the concentration of antibodies can be determined. The scientists optimised the test and evaluated it using samples of human serum from individuals diagnosed with Covid-19 and from those who had not been infected by SARS-CoV-2.The test was demonstrated to be highly accurate, quick and easy to perform, with high throughput. This test requires about 20 minutes to complete, compared to about 2 hours for other tests; furthermore, the equipment required for the test is highly portable, weighing only 4.3 kg. Taken all together, these features make the test an excellent option for detecting and quantifying antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The test can now be used for two purposes: screening large populations to determine the exact extent of the pandemic, and from evaluating the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the antibody response.Reference: Nishiyama K, Takahashi K, Fukuyama M, et al.

Thanks to new research on slime molds, the answer may be ""yes."" Scientists from the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University have discovered that a brainless slime mold called Physarum polycephalum uses its body to sense mechanical cues in its surrounding environment, and performs computations similar to what we call ""thinking"" to decide in which direction to grow based on that information. Unlike previous studies with Physarum, these results were obtained without giving the organism any food or chemical signals to influence its behavior. The study is published in Advanced Materials.""People are becoming more interested in Physarum because it doesn't have a brain but it can still perform a lot of the behaviors that we associate with thinking, like solving mazes, learning new things, and predicting events,"" said first author Nirosha Murugan, a former member of the Allen Discovery Center who is now an Assistant Professor at Algoma University in Ontario, Canada.

The findings were published July 15, 2021 in PLOS ONE and expand upon prior research conducted at UC San Diego Health in 2020.Statins are commonly used to reduce blood cholesterol levels by blocking liver enzymes responsible for making cholesterol. They are widely prescribed: The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 93 percent of patients who use a cholesterol-lowering drug use a statin.""When faced with this virus at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a lot of speculation surrounding certain medications that affect the body's ACE2 receptor, including statins, and whether they may influence COVID-19 risk,"" said Lori Daniels, MD, lead study author, professor and director of the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit at UC San Diego Health.""At the time, we thought that statins may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection through their known anti-inflammatory effects and binding capabilities, which could potentially stop progression of the virus.""Using data from the American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry, the research team at UC San Diego applied their original findings to a much larger cohort: more than 10,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients across the United States.Specifically, researchers analyzed anonymized medical records of 10,541 patients admitted for COVID-19 over a nine-month period, January through September 2020, at 104 different hospitals.""From this data, we performed more advanced analyses as we attempted to control for coexisting medical conditions, socioeconomic status and hospital factors,"" said Daniels. ""In doing so, we confirmed our prior findings that statins are associated with a reduced risk of death from COVID-19 among patients hospitalized for COVID-19.""Daniels said it appears most of the benefit is among patients with good medical reasons to be taking statins, such as a history of cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure. According to the research team, the use of statins or an anti-hypertension medication was associated with a 32 percent lower risk of death among COVID-19 inpatients with a history of cardiovascular disease or hypertension.In the study, statistical matching techniques were used to compare outcomes for patients who used statins or an anti-hypertension medication with similar patients who did not.""We matched each patient to one or more similar patients, using hospital site, month of admission, age, race, ethnicity, gender, and a list of pre-existing conditions, in order to make the two groups as comparable as possible"" said Karen Messer, PhD, study co-author and professor of biostatistics at UC San Diego School of Medicine.The ACE2 receptor -- the regulatory target of statins -- helps control blood pressure. In 2020, it was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily uses the same receptor to enter lung cells.According to researchers, statins and anti-hypertension medications stabilize the underlying diseases for which they are prescribed, making patients more likely to recover from COVID-19.""As with any observational study, we cannot say for certain that the associations we describe between statin use and reduced severity of COVID-19 infection are definitely due to the statins themselves; however, we can now say with very strong evidence that they may play a role in substantially lowering a patient's risk of death from COVID-19,"" said Daniels. ""We hope that our research findings are an incentive for patients to continue with their medication.""The initial study included 170 anonymized medical records from patients receiving care at UC San Diego Health. Researchers found that statin use prior to hospital admission for COVID-19 resulted in a more than 50 percent reduction in risk of developing severe infection.The American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry contains de-identified health data on patients treated for COVID-19 at more than 140 participating hospitals across the country.

Key factors for a successful transit could be identified without the use of animal experiments and were published in the scientific journal ""PLoS Computational Biology"".During mating in wildlife species, males transfer millions of sperm into the female genital tract. On the way to the egg cell the sperm have to pass through the genital tract. Very few of the sperm cells actually succeed in passing through and reaching the vicinity of the egg cell. Those that do will then be conditioned for fertilisation. Mechanisms underlying sperm selection and, therefore, reproductive success are largely unknown, as their experimental study in the living organism is very difficult for both ethical and practical reasons. A deeper understanding of the factors which favour successful sperm migration and selection in the context of species-specific reproductive systems would be of great fundamental as well as of applied interest, since for threatened wildlife species this will help recognise reproductive problems and optimise assisted reproduction techniques such as artificial insemination.The scientist team developed a spatio-temporal computer simulation model of the mammalian female genital tract, in which individual sperm cells were treated as independent agents equipped with a set of biophysical characteristics specifying concrete properties and subjected to specific rules for motion and interaction with the female genital tract. The first implementation used data on bovine genital tract geometry and the biophysical properties and principles of sperm motion of bovine sperm as observed in test tubes. Thus, sperm preferentially swam against a fluid stream (positive rheotaxis) and moved along wall structures (thigmotaxis).In order to ensure that the model was reasonably realistic in depicting salient features of the interaction between sperm and the female genital tract, the simulation results were compared with published data derived from cattle. The simulation results demonstrated a close match with the observed timing and number of sperm actually reaching the entry of the oviducts.""As expected, we found that physical sperm characteristics such as velocity and directional stability are essential for successful sperm. In addition, the ability to swim against the mucus flow of cervical secretions as well as the ability of sperm to align to epithelial walls of the genital tract turned out to have a tremendous impact on the chances of a successful transit of sperm to the oviduct,"" explains Jorin Diemer, doctoral student at the Humboldt-Universit t zu Berlin. Karin M ller, leader of the andrology lab at Leibniz-IZW, concludes, ""that these identified characteristics of sperm should be considered in future attempts to condition sperm in artificial selection procedures since natural selection processes are normally bypassed in reproductive test tube technologies."" This is of particular importance because a species-specific optimal time window for sperm accumulation in the oviduct exists in relation to the timing of ovulation when the oocyte is liberated for fertilisation. ""The big advantage of our model is its flexibility, it can be extended and generalised to other systems,"" highlights Edda Klipp, leader of the Theoretical Biophysics department at Humboldt-Universit t zu Berlin. Predictions from this computer simulation system have the potential to improve assisted reproduction in endangered species, livestock and perhaps humans without using animal experiments.Reference:Diemer J, Hahn J, Goldenbogen B, M ller K, Klipp E.

While she acknowledged passports  potential to curtail the pandemic, she also asserted that the documents are unduly restrictive because they do not accommodate people who lack access to vaccines nor people who refuse vaccines based on medical, religious or philosophical grounds.Jecker proposed instead  flexible passes  that would allow those who test negative to travel and also would afford exceptions to people stating a conscientious objection to a COVID-19 vaccine. We re trying to achieve a balance between competing values and goods. It s clear that it s a public good to protect public safety during a global pandemic. The question is, how do we go about it? How do we balance this public good against other values, like being fair to everyone and respecting individual autonomy?  she asked.The paper argued that passport programs implemented for international travel would only entrench inequities that favor citizens of high- and upper-middle-income nations, whose residents have received 85% of all COVID-19 vaccine jabs to date. Most of the world doesn t have access to vaccines,  Jecker noted.  If we form an exclusive club and say (that) only people with access to vaccines can hop on a plane, who are we leaving out? Whose freedom are we curtailing and whose are we expanding? Domestic passports are  more ethically defensible  for nations to consider, Jecker wrote   but only after a country achieves widespread, equitable access to vaccines. These documents ostensibly would be presented for in-country travel as well as for access to restaurants and bars, gyms, and workplaces.Even domestic vaccine passports, however, would be vulnerable to the biases of whoever is charged with enforcement   as with a bar bouncer who decides which patrons to ask for ID and which to challenge. This could invite racial, ethnic and other profiling that is unfair to certain groups.For domestic travel, Jecker argues a  flexible pass  is a way to pursue public health without unfairly marginalizing certain groups.A flexible pass would be granted to anyone who has been vaccinated or has recently tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 or has recovered from a documented COVID-19 infection. This is more inclusive because it does not leave out people who state a conscientious objection to receiving a vaccine or those who lack vaccine access. I think that solves the issue of achieving this public good and keeping people safe, but it is fairer and respects vaccine refusers,  Jecker said.  It allows people who test negative to engage in the same activities as people who are vaccinated.  Regarding vaccine refusers, Jecker acknowledged that it s impossible to know if someone s objections are conscientious,  but we use an honor system and allow refusal because it protects people s autonomy.  She objected to identifying people who don t get vaccinated as  bad citizens,  saying it oversimplifies the diverse reasons people have for opting out.A flexible pass program also should be structured to protect pass holders against discriminatory policing and safeguard their privacy, she added. Pass policies should be updated if new scientific evidence comes to light or new ethical concerns arise post-implementation.Reference: Jecker NS.

Overall hot flashes (including mild ones) decreased by 79%.The study, called the WAVS trial--the Women's Study for the Alleviation of Vasomotor Symptoms-shows that diet changes can be much more powerful for treating hot flashes than scientists had thought. Vasomotor symptoms refer to night sweats, hot flashes, and flushes.The study used no hormone medications or extracts. Instead, the research team tested a combination of a low-fat plant-based diet plus 1/2 cup of ordinary soybeans added to a salad or soup each day.""This is a game changer for women aged 45 and over, most of whom we now know can get prompt relief from the most severe and troubling menopause symptoms without drugs,"" says lead researcher Neal Barnard, MD, president of the Physicians Committee and adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine.As many as 80% of postmenopausal women suffer from hot flashes. Heat wells up from the chest, causing flushing, sweating, and chills. At night, hot flashes interfere with sleep. Estrogen-based medications were once routinely used to treat hot flashes but have been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer and other serious problems.

And he's certainly not alone. The fear of snakes is so common it even has its own name: ophidiophobia.Kibret Mequanint doesn't particularly like the slithery reptiles either (he actually hates them too) but the Western University bioengineer and his international collaborators have found a novel use for snake venom: a body tissue 'super glue' that can stop life-threatening bleeding in seconds.Over the past 20 years, Mequanint has developed a number of biomaterials-based medical devices and therapeutic technologies - some of which are either licensed to medical companies or are in the advanced stage of preclinical testing.His latest collaborative research discovery is based on a blood-clotting enzyme called reptilase or batroxobin found in the venom of lancehead snakes (Bothrops atrox), which are amongst the most poisonous snakes in South America.Taking advantage of this clotting property, Mequanint and the international research team designed a body tissue adhesive that incorporates the special enzyme into a modified gelatin that can be packaged into a small tube for easy, and potentially life-saving, application.""During trauma, injury and emergency bleeding, this 'super glue' can be applied by simply squeezing the tube and shining a visible light, such as a laser pointer, over it for few seconds. Even a smartphone flashlight will do the job,"" said Mequanint, a Western engineering professor.Compared to clinical fibrin glue, considered the industry gold standard for clinical and field surgeons, the new tissue sealant has 10 times the adhesive strength to resist detachment or washout due to bleeding. The blood clotting time is also much shorter, cutting it in half from 90 seconds for fibrin glue to 45 seconds for the new snake venom 'super glue.'This new biotechnology translates to less blood loss and more life-saving. The super-sealant was tested in models for deep skin cuts, ruptured aortae, and severely injured livers - all considered as major bleeding situations.""We envision that this tissue 'super glue' will be used in saving lives on the battlefield, or other accidental traumas like car crashes,"" said Mequanint. ""The applicator easily fits in first aid kits too.""In addition, the new snake venom 'super glue' can be used for suture-free, surgical wound closures.Snake extract-laden hemostatic bioadhesive gel cross-linked by visible light was published today in the journal Science Advances.

The wait is now over.Researchers at the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle have largely recreated the performance achieved by DeepMind on this important task. These results will be published by the journal Science.Unlike DeepMind, the UW Medicine team has already made their method, dubbed RoseTTAFold, freely available. Scientists from around the world are now using it to build protein models to accelerate their own research. Soon after its recent upload, the program was downloaded from GitHub by over 140 independent research teams.Proteins consist of strings of amino acids that fold up into intricate microscopic shapes.These unique shapes in turn give rise to nearly every chemical process inside living organisms. By better understanding protein shapes, scientists can speed up the development of new treatments for cancer, COVID-19, and thousands of other medical disorders. It has been a busy year at the Institute for Protein Design, designing COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines and launching these into clinical trials, along with developing RoseTTAFold for high accuracy protein structure prediction. I am delighted that the scientific community is already using the RoseTTAFold server to solve outstanding biological problems,  said senior author David Baker, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, professor of biochemistry, and director of the Institute for Protein Design at UW Medicine.In the new study, a team of computational biologists led by Baker developed a software tool called RoseTTAFold that uses deep learning to quickly and accurately predict protein structures based on limited information. Without the aid of such software, it can take years of laboratory work to determine the structure of just one protein.RoseTTAFold, on the other hand, can reliably compute a protein structure in as little as 10 minutes on a single gaming computer.The team used RoseTTAFold to compute hundreds of new protein structures, including many poorly understood proteins from the human genome. They also generated structures directly relevant to human health, including for proteins associated with problematic lipid metabolism, inflammation disorders, and cancer cell growth. And they show that RoseTTAFold can be used to build models of complex biological assemblies in a fraction of the time previously required.RoseTTAFold is a  three-track  neural network, meaning it simultaneously considers patterns in protein sequences, how a protein s amino acids interact with one another, and a protein s possible three-dimensional structure. In this architecture, one-, two-, and three-dimensional information flows back and forth, allowing the network to collectively reason about the relationship between a protein s chemical parts and its folded structure. We hope this new tool will continue to benefit the entire research community,  said Minkyung Baek, a postdoctoral scholar who led the project in the Baker laboratory at UW Medicine.Reference: Baek M, DiMaio F, Anishchenko I, et al.

The results, they say, show great promise.When a beam of light is shone into the water, it excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light. The characteristics of the emitted light are like a fingerprint and can be used to identify certain contaminants, explains Nicolas Peleato, an assistant professor at UBCO's School of Engineering.""The challenge with using this fluorescence approach is that they are typically source-specific; meaning we have to calibrate for a particular water source and anticipate what specific contaminants we want to look for,"" says Peleato. ""In our latest work, we have developed a data processing technique that expands the effectiveness from one water source to others.""This means their new technique removes a lot of the guesswork at the beginning of the process. As Peleato points out, every water source has a slightly different composition of organic compounds, which can hide the contaminant signals, so calibrating for each source is crucial for detection accuracy.Using machine learning algorithms, Peleato and his graduate student Ziyu Li have devised an approach that addresses the challenge of source-specific models through mapping their similarities.According to Li, it isn't quite a one-size-fits-all method but it is close.""By establishing a process that identifies similar patterns between water sources, the fluorescence detection becomes a viable option for real-time, accurate detection of hydrocarbons and pesticides,"" explains Li.During the testing process, the researchers look for unique shapes of fluorescence signals. Each unique shape indicates the presence of impurities and helps researchers determine what the impurity is and distinguish it from other compounds.Water contaminated with hydrocarbons is known to be carcinogenic and can be dangerous, or toxic, to flora and fauna.The researchers are now turning their attention to using this new approach to detect and monitor chemicals, such as the major toxic contaminants in oil sand tailings ponds that may impact surface water and groundwater.""Building a comprehensive model that seamlessly transitions from one water source to another will speed up monitoring, and has the potential to be a game changer,"" says Peleato.Reference: Li Z, Peleato NM.

Farmers hear the term  plant biostimulant  and think they all do the same thing, and can be used in the same way at the same time. But that s not the case. There's huge confusion over what these products do, and when and how they should be used,  says Below, professor in the Department of Crop Sciences at Illinois. To quell the confusion, Below, along with doctoral student Connor Sible and research specialist Juliann Seebauer, categorized available biostimulant products into eight classes based on their modes of action. Their review, which includes summaries of product composition, mechanisms, efficacy, and application considerations, is published in the journal Agronomy. Generally, plant biostimulants enhance natural processes in plants or soil that, in turn, boost crop quality and yield through enhanced nutrient uptake, nutrient efficiency, or stress tolerance. According to the researchers  classification system, half of the products are live microorganisms, including nitrogen-fixing bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi, phosphorus-solubilizing microbes, or other beneficial microbes. The other half are chemistries or chemical byproducts from  formerly living  organisms, as Sible puts it. These include seaweed extracts, humic and fulvic acids, concentrated enzymes, and biochar. It s not always completely clear how or why biostimulants work the way they do, but Sible and Below say there s a time and a place for each. It s up to the grower to consider which biostimulant fits their goal.  When we talk to growers, that's the first thing we say. What is the problem you re having, and what is it you're trying to accomplish? Then we can suggest which product from this or that biostimulant category might be your best bet,  Below says. Sible adds,  Sometimes farmers will try these products because the sales pitch sounds good, but they won't get the response they want in the field. So they'll walk away from all biostimulants. Those kinds of poor outcomes could be prevented with more information. That's why we felt this was important. We re actively researching these products to help growers understand what they are and how they work, so they can select the right one for their production system.  Many of the products target nutrient management, with an eye toward reducing or replacing application of synthetic fertilizers. For example, soybean growers are familiar with nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, but Sible says new technologies, including gene editing, are enabling these microbes to thrive in the corn root zone as well.  We see in our research that these products can help you be more efficient with your fertilizer,  he says.  It s all about better management and stewardship of nutrients. If we can add something to our fertilizer plan to make that happen, it s a win-win.  Plant biostimulants aren t new. Specialty growers have applied nitrogen-fixing bacteria, mycorrhizal fungus, seaweed extracts, and similar products for years. But as start-up companies have scaled up production or partnered with big seed and fertilizer companies, they ve started eyeing the row crop market.  All the big companies have partnerships in the biological world now, because it's viewed as part of sustainability or regenerative ag. Some of these products purport to have soil health benefits, and that's all the rage,  Below says. Sible adds that some of the big seed companies are already coating seeds with live inoculants to give seedlings a solid start.  A lot of growers are actually using biostimulants without necessarily knowing it.  Seed coatings are only one method of application. Below says including biostimulant application with standard management practices, such as in-furrow application at seeding or during an herbicide or fungicide pass, provides a free ride for the products.  When biostimulants can go in with practices that are already being done, that makes their application cost-effective,  he says. Sible notes the average cost of biostimulants is $8 to $12 per acre, but some of the microbial products push $20 to $25. Despite the expense, Below says a lot of farmers are willing to invest this year.  Commodity prices are really quite high right now, so farmers might be thinking,  Why don't I try something I normally wouldn't try?  We just want to have them try something that has a greater likelihood to be worthwhile,  he says.ReferenceSible CN, Seebauer JR, Below FE.

They found more antibiotic resistant faecal coliforms in urban surface water compared to rural settings, consistent with reports of such bacteria in rivers across Asia. Publishing their findings in mSystems today, researchers from the University of Birmingham and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh call for further research to quantify the drivers of antibiotic resistance in surface waters in Bangladesh. Lead author Willem van Schaik, Professor of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham, commented:  The rivers and lakes of Dhaka are surrounded by highly-populated slums in which human waste is directly released into the water. The presence of human gut bacteria links to high levels of antibiotic resistance genes, suggesting that such contamination is driving the presence of these  superbugs  in surface water.  Interventions aimed at improving access to clean water, sanitation and sewerage infrastructure may thus be important to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance spreading in Bangladesh and other LMICs. While levels of antibiotic resistance genes are considerably lower in rural than in urban settings, we found that antibiotics are commonly used in fish farming and further policies need to be developed to reduce their use.  The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing infections is increasing globally, but the clinical issues, including significant morbidity and mortality, posed by these bacteria are particularly alarming in LMICs. The prevalence multidrug-resistant E. coli among healthy humans is relatively high in Bangladesh, as it is in other LMICs. Dhaka, has a population of around 16 million people, with a population density that ranks among the highest of any megacity, but less than 20% of households are directly connected to sewerage infrastructure The research team found that urban surface waters in Bangladesh are particularly rich in antibiotic resistance genes, with a higher number of them associated with plasmids indicating that they are more likely to spread through the population. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria that colonize the human gut can be passed into rivers, lakes and coastal areas through the release of untreated wastewater, the overflow of pit latrines during monsoon season or by practices such as open defecation. These contaminated environments are often used for bathing, for the washing of clothes and food preparation equipment, thus increasing the risk of human gut colonisation by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.ReferenceMcInnes RS et al.

An interdisciplinary research team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has now developed a new approach: they engulf and neutralize viruses with nano-capsules tailored from genetic material using the DNA origami method. The strategy has already been tested against hepatitis and adeno-associated viruses in cell cultures. It may also prove successful against corona viruses.There are antibiotics against dangerous bacteria, but few antidotes to treat acute viral infections. Some infections can be prevented by vaccination but developing new vaccines is a long and laborious process. Now an interdisciplinary research team from the Technical University of Munich, the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and the Brandeis University (USA) is proposing a novel strategy for the treatment of acute viral infections: The team has developed nanostructures made of DNA, the substance that makes up our genetic material, that can trap viruses and render them harmless. Even before the new variant of the corona virus put the world on hold, Hendrik Dietz, Professor of Biomolecular Nanotechnology at the Physics Department of the Technical University of Munich, and his team were working on the construction of virus-sized objects that assemble themselves. In 1962, the biologist Donald Caspar and the biophysicist Aaron Klug discovered the geometrical principles according to which the protein envelopes of viruses are built. Based on these geometric specifications, the team around Hendrik Dietz at the Technical University of Munich, supported by Seth Fraden and Michael Hagan from Brandeis University in the USA, developed a concept that made it possible to produce artificial hollow bodies the size of a virus. In the summer of 2019, the team asked whether such hollow bodies could also be used as a kind of  virus trap . If they were to be lined with virus-binding molecules on the inside, they should be able to bind viruses tightly and thus be able to take them out of circulation. For this, however, the hollow bodies would also have to have sufficiently large openings through which viruses can get into the shells. ""None of the objects that we had built using DNA origami technology at that time would have been able to engulf a whole virus   they were simply too small,"" says Hendrik Dietz in retrospect. ""Building stable hollow bodies of this size was a huge challenge.""Starting from the basic geometric shape of the icosahedron, an object made up of 20 triangular surfaces, the team decided to build the hollow bodies for the virus trap from three-dimensional, triangular plates. For the DNA plates to assemble into larger geometrical structures, the edges must be slightly beveled. The correct choice and positioning of binding points on the edges ensure that the panels self-assemble to the desired objects.  In this way, we can now program the shape and size of the desired objects using the exact shape of the triangular plates,  says Hendrik Dietz.  We can now produce objects with up to 180 subunits and achieve yields of up to 95 percent. The route there was, however, quite rocky, with many iterations."" By varying the binding points on the edges of the triangles, the team's scientists can not only create closed hollow spheres, but also spheres with openings or half-shells. These can then be used as virus traps. In cooperation with the team of Prof. Ulrike Protzer, head of the Institute for Virology at TUM and director of the Institute for Virology at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, the team tested the virus traps on adeno-associated viruses and hepatitis B virus cores. ""Even a simple half-shell of the right size shows a measurable reduction in virus activity,"" says Hendrik Dietz. ""If we put five binding sites for the virus on the inside, for example suitable antibodies, we can already block the virus by 80 percent, if we incorporate more, we achieve complete blocking."" To prevent the DNA particles from being immediately degraded in body fluids, the team irradiated the finished building blocks with UV light and treated the outside with polyethylene glycol and oligolysine. The particles were thus stable in mouse serum for 24 hours. Now the next step is to test the building blocks on living mice. ""We are very confident that this material will also be well tolerated by the human body,"" says Dietz.  Bacteria have a metabolism. We can attack them in different ways,   says Prof. Ulrike Protzer.  Viruses, on the other hand, do not have their own metabolism, which is why antiviral drugs are almost always targeted against a specific enzyme in a single virus. Such a development takes time. If the idea of simply mechanically eliminating viruses can be realized, this would be widely applicable and thus an important breakthrough, especially for newly emerging viruses. The starting materials for the virus traps can be mass-produced biotechnologically at a reasonable cost. ""In addition to the proposed application as a virus trap, our programmable system also creates other opportunities,"" says Hendrik Dietz. ""It would also be conceivable to use it as a multivalent antigen carrier for vaccinations, as a DNA or RNA carrier for gene therapy or as a transport vehicle for drugs.""ReferenceSigl C, Willner EM, Engelen W et al.

This discovery sheds light on the cellular mechanisms underlying navigation and memory in humans, as well as what parts of the brain might get disrupted during the kinds of memory impairments common in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.There are two strategies with which humans and animals navigate and orient themselves. One involves locating places, distances and directions in ""allocentric"" or other-centered frames of reference rooted in the external world. The other strategy involves ""egocentric"" frames of reference that are centered on the self.Whenever you use a mobile phone app to find driving directions, it will likely employ both these modes of navigation. When you first type in an address, it will normally show you the address on a map from an allocentric perspective, with 'north' at the top and 'south' at the bottom. When you then go to route view, it will switch to an egocentric perspective where 'ahead' is at the top and 'behind' is at the bottom.Scientists first discovered brain cells linked with allocentric frames of reference in rats in 1971 -- ""place cells"" that may, for example, indicate that one is located in the northeast corner of an area. Other allocentric spatial cell types include head-direction cells that may activate whenever one is navigating south, or border cells that may respond when a boundary is located to the west.In the past decade, researchers began investigating how rat brains mapped egocentric frames of reference. Two years ago, scientists at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, identified a brain region in rats called the postrhinal cortex in which egocentrically tuned cells are abundant. However, it remained poorly understood what brain cells formed the basis of egocentric spatial maps in humans.""In humans it is only rarely possible to directly record the activity of single neurons from the brain, due to ethical reasons,"" said Lukas Kunz, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University's Department of Biomedical Engineering and first author of the new study. ""There are techniques like fMRI or EEG, which allow us to indirectly measure neural activity from healthy human brains, but this neural activity reflects the sum activity of millions of neurons, which does not allow for direct conclusions about the working principles of single neurons.""In the new study, neuroscientists from the United States and Germany investigated 15 epilepsy patients at the University of Freiburg's Medical Center in Germany. These volunteers were implanted with electrodes to help doctors monitor their disorder.The researchers asked the volunteers to perform computer tasks that explored their ability to navigate through virtual environments and to remember where many different objects were located there. At the same time, the scientists recorded the activity of more than 1,400 single neurons in multiple brain regions across all the participants.The scientists identified more than 160 neurons that behaved like egocentric spatial cell types, activating when specific parts of the virtual environment were ahead, behind, to the left, or to the right of the patients, or when points in space were close to or far away from the patients.""We are now the first to report egocentric spatial cell types in humans,"" Kunz said. The scientists published their study, ""A neural code for egocentric spatial maps in the human medial temporal lobe,"" in the journal Neuron on July 14, 2021.These ""egocentric bearing cells"" likely encode spatial information on a mental map centered on each person. ""This is presumably important for everyday life, when humans try to orient themselves in their environments and when they navigate along routes,"" said Joshua Jacobs, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia Engineering and senior author of the study.These egocentric bearing cells were particularly ample in the parahippocampal cortex, a region located deep within the brain that prior work suggested is the human equivalent of the rodent postrhinal cortex. Egocentric bearing cells comprised about 25% of all neurons in the parahippocampal cortex. ""Previous studies had shown that patients with damage to this brain region are disoriented, presumably because their egocentric bearing cells were affected,"" Kunz said.The researchers also found these egocentric bearing cells showed increases in activity when the patients used their memory to successfully recall the locations of objects they had found in the virtual environments. ""This suggests these cells are not only relevant for navigation, but also play a role in correctly remembering past experiences,"" Kunz said.""Memories consist of multiple different elements, such as a specific event, the place where the event happened, and the time when the event happened,"" Kunz said. ""We believe that there are different neural systems for the different components of these memories. Egocentric bearing cells are presumably particularly involved in processing the spatial information of the memories.""These findings may illuminate what might go wrong in people with memory deficits, including patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. ""Their egocentric bearing cells may not function correctly, or may have been destroyed for some reason, such as a stroke, a brain tumor, or dementia,"" Jacobs said.These new findings do not answer how one might deal with such memory impairments. ""There is still a lot of research to do before memory impairments can be treated successfully,"" Kunz cautioned.In the future, the researchers want to see why exactly any given egocentric bearing cell is tuned to whatever point in space it is focused on. Currently, Kunz and his colleagues assume that multiple different spatial cues, such as objects, spatial boundaries and landmarks, combine to influence the position of these reference points. The scientists can examine the influence these cues have on the location of these reference points by removing these cues from environments during experiments.""Another important question is how egocentric bearing cells interact with allocentric spatial cell types, Kunz said. ""We currently hypothesize that egocentric bearing cells provide essential input to allocentric spatial cell types. By understanding this, future studies could explain how the tuning of allocentric spatial cell types is influenced by the functioning of egocentric bearing cells.""Reference: Kunz L, Brandt A, Reinacher PC, et al.

Humans rely heavily on sensation in their fingertips when manipulating an object. The lack of this sensation presents a unique challenge for individuals with upper limb amputations. While there are several high-tech, dexterous prosthetics available today - they all lack the sensation of ""touch."" The absence of this sensory feedback results in objects inadvertently being dropped or crushed by a prosthetic hand.To enable a more natural feeling prosthetic hand interface, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's College of Engineering and Computer Science and collaborators are the first to incorporate stretchable tactile sensors using liquid metal on the fingertips of a prosthetic hand. Encapsulated within silicone-based elastomers, this technology provides key advantages over traditional sensors, including high conductivity, compliance, flexibility and stretchability. This hierarchical multi-finger tactile sensation integration could provide a higher level of intelligence for artificial hands.For the study, published in the journal Sensors, researchers used individual fingertips on the prosthesis to distinguish between different speeds of a sliding motion along different textured surfaces. The four different textures had one variable parameter: the distance between the ridges. To detect the textures and speeds, researchers trained four machine learning algorithms. For each of the ten surfaces, 20 trials were collected to test the ability of the machine learning algorithms to distinguish between the ten different complex surfaces comprised of randomly generated permutations of four different textures.Results showed that the integration of tactile information from liquid metal sensors on four prosthetic hand fingertips simultaneously distinguished between complex, multi-textured surfaces - demonstrating a new form of hierarchical intelligence. The machine learning algorithms were able to distinguish between all the speeds with each finger with high accuracy. This new technology could improve the control of prosthetic hands and provide haptic feedback, more commonly known as the experience of touch, for amputees to reconnect a previously severed sense of touch.""Significant research has been done on tactile sensors for artificial hands, but there is still a need for advances in lightweight, low-cost, robust multimodal tactile sensors,"" said Erik Engeberg, Ph.D., senior author, an associate professor in the Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute and the FAU Institute for Sensing and Embedded Network Systems Engineering (I-SENSE), who conducted the study with first author and Ph.D. student Moaed A. Abd. ""The tactile information from all the individual fingertips in our study provided the foundation for a higher hand-level of perception enabling the distinction between ten complex, multi-textured surfaces that would not have been possible using purely local information from an individual fingertip. We believe that these tactile details could be useful in the future to afford a more realistic experience for prosthetic hand users through an advanced haptic display, which could enrich the amputee-prosthesis interface and prevent amputees from abandoning their prosthetic hand.""Researchers compared four different machine learning algorithms for their successful classification capabilities: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and neural network (NN). The time-frequency features of the liquid metal sensors were extracted to train and test the machine learning algorithms. The NN generally performed the best at the speed and texture detection with a single finger and had a 99.2 percent accuracy to distinguish between ten different multi-textured surfaces using four liquid metal sensors from four fingers simultaneously.""The loss of an upper limb can be a daunting challenge for an individual who is trying to seamlessly engage in regular activities,"" said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean, College of Engineering and Computer Science. ""Although advances in prosthetic limbs have been beneficial and allow amputees to better perform their daily duties, they do not provide them with sensory information such as touch. They also don't enable them to control the prosthetic limb naturally with their minds.

The study comprehensively characterized the antibody response to each vaccine, identifying features and functions that were elevated in survivors and that could serve as vaccine correlates of protection.The multi-year study, led by Alexander Bukreyev, PhD, of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Galveston National Laboratory looked at whether all the vaccines conferred protection and produced robust antibody responses. The team also explored 139 different immune and vaccine response parameters to see which ones were responsible for improving the ""quality of survival.""""Testing during outbreaks is difficult because of their sporadic nature, and yet much needs to be studied in order to determine the most effective vaccine for combatting this disease. Establishing the signatures of vaccine-generated immunity remains crucial for vaccine design, assessment and application,"" said Bukreyev.Research Scientist Michelle Meyer, PhD, of UTMB served as lead author of the paper, Ebola vaccine-induced protection in non-human primates correlates with antibody specificity and Fc-mediated effects, which reports the efficacy results of the vaccines in cynomolgus macaques challenged with EBOV. The five mucosal vaccines tested differed in the degree of protection against death and disease, ranging from disease-free survival to only partial protection.Meyer notes vaccines need to do more than allow for survival, with an ideal result being to arrest virus replication and abate disease. To evaluate antibody features that are relevant and potentially predictive of protection, the team employed a survival index in the analysis which incorporated several parameters of EBOV disease to allow for correlations with improved infection outcomes.""Through in-depth characterization of the antibody response, we found that even though all vaccines express the same antigen, they differed in multiple aspects, with the correlates of protection appearing to be unique to the vaccine platform. Our analysis defined RBD-specific antibodies and Fc-mediated immune functions as contributing factors to improved survival,"" said Meyer. The lack of correlation with neutralizing antibody titers suggests that the conventional means of predicting efficacy does not apply to all vaccines.During the most recent ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 300,000 people were vaccinated. Deciphering the immune responses to vaccination that correlate with protection is imperative to predict efficacy of vaccines in humans, says Meyer.Reference: Meyer M, Gunn BM, Malherbe DC, et al.

Now, imagine the same cat, but with coal-black fur. Now, imagine the cat strutting along the Great Wall of China. Doing this, a quick series of neuron activations in your brain will come up with variations of the picture presented, based on your previous knowledge of the world. In other words, as humans, it s easy to envision an object with different attributes. But, despite advances in deep neural networks that match or surpass human performance in certain tasks, computers still struggle with the very human skill of  imagination. Now, a USC research team comprising computer science Professor Laurent Itti, and PhD students Yunhao Ge, Sami Abu-El-Haija and Gan Xin, has developed an AI that uses human-like capabilities to imagine a never-before-seen object with different attributes. The paper, titled Zero-Shot Synthesis with Group-Supervised Learning, was published in the 2021 International Conference on Learning Representations on May 7. We were inspired by human visual generalization capabilities to try to simulate human imagination in machines,  said Ge, the study s lead author. Humans can separate their learned knowledge by attributes for instance, shape, pose, position, color and then recombine them to imagine a new object. Our paper attempts to simulate this process using neural networks.   This new disentanglement approach, for the first time, truly unleashes a new sense of imagination in A.I. systems, bringing them closer to humans  understanding of the world.  Laurent Itti. For instance, say you want to create an AI system that generates images of cars. Ideally, you would provide the algorithm with a few images of a car, and it would be able to generate many types of cars from Porsches to Pontiacs to pick-up trucks in any color, from multiple angles.This is one of the long-sought goals of AI: creating models that can extrapolate. This means that, given a few examples, the model should be able to extract the underlying rules and apply them to a vast range of novel examples it hasn t seen before.

Half of the melanomas spread to other organs of the body, causing death in less than a year, so new treatments to preserve vision and prevent death are an urgent need.Now a preclinical study by researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Emory University, Atlanta, offers hope -- a small molecule inhibitor has been identified that dampens the potent drivers of this tumor. In mouse models, the inhibitor, KCN1, strongly limited primary disease in the eye and metastatic tumor dissemination to the liver, and animals survived longer, without overt side effects.Thus, this class of inhibitory compounds shows promise, though the co-leaders of the research -- Erwin Van Meir, Ph.D., professor of neurosurgery at UAB, and Hans Grossniklaus, M.D., MBA, professor of ophthalmic pathology at Emory -- say the drug needs further optimization before clinical use.""Overall,"" they wrote in the paper published in the journal Oncogene, ""our preclinical studies support the further translation of the KCN1 arylsulfonamide scaffold toward a novel treatment for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma."" The uvea is the pigmented layer of the eye.Prior to this study, it was known that: 1) a hypoxia gene signature, indicative of low oxygen levels in the tumor, is associated with poor prognosis and a high metastatic rate in uveal melanoma; 2) the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, or HIF, turns on a large number of gene products with critical roles in cancer growth and metastasis; and 3) for UM specifically, HIF promotes tumor progression by regulating proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion of tumor cells, as well as promoting blood vessel growth to feed the tumor.Little was known of the role of HIF in directing pro-invasive extracellular matrix remodeling in UM. Changes in the extracellular matrix, including increased collagen deposition and reorganization of collagen fibers outside the cell, is known to aid cancer progression and tumor cell invasion. Extracellular matrix is the non-cellular component of all tissues that provides physical scaffolding for cells and has other biochemical roles.Hypoxia promotes collagen deposition, in part, because HIF increases production of two gene products, P4HA1 and P4HA2, that are part of an enzyme complex that adds hydroxyl residues to prolines in procollagen. Procollagen is a precursor protein in the complex maturation process that collagen undergoes.In their study, Van Meir, Grossniklaus and colleagues decided to evaluate the expression of the P4HA1/2 genes in relation to UM patient prognosis, and to determine whether inhibiting hypoxia-induced P4HA1/2 expression in a preclinical model of metastatic UM would yield therapeutic benefit.They found that P4HA1 and P4HA2 were induced by hypoxia in human UM cell lines, and this induction was reduced by KCN1. Comparison of 46 patients with non-metastatic UM and 46 with metastatic UM showed that P4HA1/2 were significantly overexpressed in patients with metastatic disease. Also, P4HA1/2 expression correlated with poor overall survival in UM patients. This suggests that P4HA1 and P4HA2 can serve as prognostic markers in UM, and that they may be important for malignant progression of the disease and patient survival.The researchers next turned to preclinical animal models of UM. They showed that KCN1 was abundantly taken up in the liver and the eyes after intraperitoneal injection, and it dampened tumor growth and disease burden at the primary site of the eye, as well as reduced distant metastases in the liver. KCN1 also increased survival in three different models that test the growth of human UM after injection in mice uvea. The inhibitor was most effective at reducing metastases when it was administered early.At the molecular level, treatment with KCN1 to inhibit the hypoxic induction of P4HA1/2 decreased the hydroxylation of proline amino acids in the procollagen. It also caused cleavage of the collagen and disordered the structure of collagen VI, a mature structural component of the extracellular matrix. These collagen changes correlated with a reduction in tumor cell invasion.""Our study,"" Van Meir and Grossniklaus concluded, ""suggests that KCN1 has desirable properties as a suppressor of metastasis: It is well tolerated, has excellent distribution to the eye and the liver, and is thus ideally suited for treating metastatic UM.""Reference: Kaluz S, Zhang Q, Kuranaga Y, et al.

How does one particular cell type fight against a host of different pathogens? The key to this adaptability is in alternative splicing, wherein the cell produces multiple forms of proteins for identifying different types of invading viruses and microbes, as well as destroying cancer cells. So, it is not surprising that finding ways to improve the production of T cells with enhanced pathogen recognition capacity is an actively researched area of modern science.In 2011, scientists from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) in Korea discovered a protein called NSrp70, which is abundant in motile T cells. Located in specific regions inside the cell's nucleus called nuclear speckles, NSrp70, which is short for nuclear speckle-related protein 70, is a gene regulator. Interestingly, nuclear speckles play an important role in protein production by housing mRNA splicing regulators that cut and join pre-messenger RNA fragments to produce the final messenger RNAs based on the proteins that are produced. With this knowledge, the scientists have been speculating about the possible role NSrp70 plays in the alternative splicing involved in T cell maturation and development. Now, in a new study made available online on 25 May 2021 and published in Volume 49 Issue 10 of the journal Nucleic Acids Research, scientists from GIST led by Professor Chang-Duk Jun report their findings on the role of this protein and its encoding gene within a physiological environment. Explaining their motivation for the research, Prof. Jun says, ""Ever since we discovered and presented NSrp70 to the academic world, we have been exploring its functions and mechanisms of action."" In experiments with mice, the scientists were able to analyze the function of the protein using a technique known as conditional gene knockout, whereby they inactivated the gene coding for NSrp70 and produced cell samples that lacked the protein. By comparing these cell samples with regular cells, they determined the effects caused by the absence of the protein. They report that NSrp70 is expressed very early in the cell cycle and plays an important role in T cell development. Specifically, the absence of the protein induced uncontrolled cell growth and death in double positive thymocytes that are T cell precursors. This impeded their progression to single positive thymocytes stymying the formation of mature T cells. NSrp70-deficient mice had a noticeably reduced lymphocyte count in peripheral tissues, and, thus, resulted in unchecked tumor growth, further attesting to the role NSrp70 plays in cancer development. Prof. Jun sums up the findings emphatically, ""Our study revealed that NSrp70 is an important regulator of T cell proliferation. This finding can help us mass-produce specific T cells for cell therapy or use mass-produced T cells to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells through gene therapy."" The world welcomes such critical findings on nuclear speckles and constituent proteins with eager anticipation!ReferenceKim C-H, Park S-M, Lee S, et al.

Chow Endowed Professor of Drug Discovery and Development and the senior author of the paper in eLife. ""The discovery has important implications for scientists trying to understand how both phytochemicals (a type of plant compound, such as flavonoids) and medicines are metabolized in the body.""The new information could help chemists develop better drugs and clinicians to fine-tune medication dosing, especially when dealing with polypharmacy, where a patient takes multiple drugs at the same time.Scientists have long recognized that bile acid is produced in the liver and released into the intestines and is then recycled back through the liver for reuse as the bile. Some medications that are metabolized in the liver also go through this process, known as enterohepatic recycling (EHR). This can extend the life of drugs in the body, which may affect how well they work and whether they cause side effects.""The liver has long been considered the most important organ for drug metabolism,"" said lead author Yifan Tu, who conducted the study while he was doing his doctoral work at the UH College of Pharmacy. ""But we've shown that the intestines also play a major role in drug metabolism.""In their experiments, the team administered 16 different types of flavonoids or drugs directly to the liver or intestines and then tracked what happened to the treatments. They found that some drugs and compounds were metabolized in the intestines and the metabolites were then transported to the liver before being cycled back into the intestines.""In this process, the liver acts only as a recycling organ, which is rare, since the liver is known to be the metabolic 'superstar' organ in humans,"" said Tu, who is now a postdoctoral fellow at the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim in Connecticut.The team has called this new mechanism 'hepatic enteric recycling' (HER). They found that, in this process, the roles of the liver and intestines are reversed. ""This may explain why some drugs or plant compounds have larger effects on the intestine than anticipated and could help scientists understand how intestinal diseases may alter drug metabolism in the body,"" said Tu.""We hope our findings will be useful for medicinal chemists to design new drugs tailored to treat intestinal, especially colonic diseases,"" said Hu.Reference: Tu Y, Wang L, Rong Y, et al.

Using a pioneering imaging technique, Cornell University researchers obtained a high-resolution snapshot of how ligands, molecules that bind to other molecules or metals, interact with the surface of nanoparticles. In doing so, they made an unexpected breakthrough discovery. They determined that by varying the concentration of an individual ligand they could control the shape of the particle it attached too. This approach could result in an array of daily applications, including developing chemical sensors that are sensitive at a very low level to a specific chemical in the environment. ""Professor Peng Chen's work allows for deep insights into molecular adsorption processes, which is important to understand for designing molecular sensors, catalysts, and schemes to clean up micro-pollutants in the environment,"" said Dr. James Parker, program manager, U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory. ""This research is also important for designing and engineering stimuli-responsive materials with specialized function that could not be found in regular, bulk materials."" The research, published in Nature Communications, studied interactions of ligands and gained new understanding of the strength, or affinity of ligand adsorption as well as how multiple ligands cooperate, or don't, with each other. ""When the molecule adsorbs on the surface of a nanoscale material, it also actually protects the surface and makes it more stable,"" said Dr. Peng Chen, the Peter J.W. Debye Professor of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell University, who led the research. ""This can be utilized to control how nanoscale particles grow and become their eventual shape. And we found we can do this with just one ligand. You don't do any other trick. You just decrease the concentration or increase the concentration, and you can change the shape."" Understanding how ligands interact with the surface of nanoparticles has been a challenge to study. Adsorbed ligands are difficult to identify because there are other molecules in the mix, and nanoparticle surfaces are uneven and multifaceted, which means they require incredibly high spatial resolution to be scrutinized. A nanoparticle's size and surface structures, or facets, are intrinsically tied to the particle's potential applications. The larger the particle, the more atoms fit inside it, while smaller particles have less available space internally but a greater surface volume ratio for atoms to sit atop, where they can be utilized for processes such as catalysis and adsorption. The different types of structures the atoms and molecules form on these surface facets are directly correlated with the particle's shape. Army-funded research identifies a new chemistry approach that could remove micropollutants from the environment. Scientists have used several imaging methods to survey these particles, but until now, they haven't been able to obtain nanometer resolution to really explore the nooks and crannies of the multiple surface facets and quantify the affinity, or strength, of a ligand's adsorption. The research team was able to do just that by employing a method of their own devising called COMPetition Enabled Imaging Technique with Super-Resolution or COMPEITS. The process works by introducing a molecule that reacts with the particle surface and generates a fluorescent reaction. A nonfluorescent molecule is then sent to bind to the surface, where its reaction competes with the fluorescent signal. The resulting decrease in fluorescence, essentially creating a negative image, can then be measured and mapped with super high resolution. Using COMPEITS on a gold nanoparticle, the team was able to quantify the strength of ligand adsorption, and they discovered ligand behavior can be very diverse. Ligands, it turns out, are fair-weather friends of a sort, at some sites they cooperate to help each other adsorb, but at other sites they can impair each other's efforts. The researchers also discovered that sometimes this positive and negative cooperativity exists at the same site. In addition, the researchers learned that the surface density of adsorbed ligands can determine which facet is dominant. This crossover inspired the team to vary the concentrations of individual ligands as a way to tune the shape of the particle itself. ""For us, this has opened more possibilities,"" Chen said. ""For example, one way to remove micropollutants, such as pesticides, from the environment is to adsorb micro-portions on the surface of some adsorbent particle. After it is adsorbed on the surface of the particle, if the particle is a catalyst, it can catalyze the destruction of the micropollutants.""ReferenceYe R, Zhao M, Mao X, et al.

A single human can house 100 trillion microbes, creating a single microbiome that serves an ecosystem of microbes.Microbes connect and transform in myriad ways, creating and combining and separating microbiomes anew. How can we begin to parse out how microbiomes differ, how they are similar, how they evolved and how they may change in the future?An international team of researchers may have the answer. They published a scale-free, fully connected search-based network to explore the connectedness of microbiomes across the world on July 13 in mSystems.""The microbiome composition, a fundamental feature of all microbiota -- microbes sharing a particular characteristic such as site or geological period -- is shaped by a plethora of environmental factors,"" said co-first author JING Gongchao, a researcher in the Single-Cell Center in Qingdao Institute of BioEnergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). ""However, it remains unclear whether and how compositional changes at the 'community-to-community' level among microbiomes are linked to the origin and evolution of global microbiome diversity.""To better understand how the vast number of varying microbe species evolved, JING and ZHANG Yufeng, a graduate student from Qingdao University, built a global ""microbiome transition network"" (MTN) that connects, based on their composition similarities, 177,022 microbiomes from 20 diverse ecosystems that include the plethora of ecological niches on human body and in the environment.They used the Microbiome Search Engine (MSE), a software developed by the team. MSE can construct the global transition network of microbiomes under three hours, and return the closest neighbors of a query microbiome in less than 0.5 second.Interestingly, the global MTN is scale-free, which is similar to the Internet or the social network among human individuals. In this kind of networks, most nodes are each connected to a small number of other nodes, yet a small portion of nodes are connected to many other nodes. Such network structure ensures a strong degree of tolerance of the network against accidental perturbation.""We drew the first global microbiome transition roadmap to illustrate the potential yet most likely paths to explain the evolution process of global microbiomes,"" explained SU Xiaoquan, a professor at Qingdao University and one senior author of the study, noting that the roadmap traces high similarities between microbiomes. ""Although the compositions are distinct by habitat, each microbiome is, on average, only six ""relatives"" (or seven ""steps"") from any other microbiome on Earth, indicating the inherent homology and common origin of the microbiomes at the global scale.""On the other hand, information from the global MTN can indicate important information, such as evolvement or interaction of microbiomes. For example, the roadmap revealed that, the oceans are the most likely microbiomes that interact with beach sands and marine fishes, while soil and fresh water are the gateway of microbial exchange between the environment and plants or humans.With the rapid change in climate as well as civilization on Earth, numerous microbiomes are disappearing, and emerging, every day. Although only a tiny proportion of them were recorded via metagenome sequencing, to construct and update the global MTN can be a ""mission impossible"", without powerful search engines and standardized databases for microbiomes such as those in MSE.""Such search-based global microbiome networks, reconstructed within hours on just one computing mode via MSE, provide a readily expanded reference for tracing the origin and evolution of existing microbiomes, and perhaps for guiding the design of new microbiomes"" said XU Jian, Director of Single-Cell Center at QIBEBT and the other senior author of the study.Reference: Jing G, Zhang Y, Liu L, et al.

The study appears July 14, 2021, in the Journal of Adolescent Health.While data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that very few 18 to 29-year-olds die of COVID-19 relative to older adults, this age group accounts for more than 20 percent of all COVID-19 cases to date. Furthermore, previous research by lead author Sally Adams, PhD, RN, of the UCSF National Adolescent and Young Adult Health Information Center, found that as many as one in three young adults is at risk of severe COVID. Long COVID  May Impact Young Adults Even With Mild Symptoms Young adults who have had COVID, regardless of symptoms, may be vulnerable to long-term complications and debilitating symptoms that may include respiratory difficulties, loss of smell and brain fog, often referred to as  long COVID.  Estimates range from 10 to 50 percent for long COVID symptoms, which is a serious concern for young adults given their high infection rates and low vaccination rates,  Adams said. Prompt vaccinations could help limit the further development of virulent variants and infection rates among the vulnerable and unvaccinated,  she added.Among the unvaccinated respondents who said they would definitely not or probably not get the vaccine, more than half said they were concerned about possible side effects. Half said they planned to wait and see if the vaccine was safe and may get it later. Also, within this group, a third said that they do not trust the vaccine, compared to fewer than one in 10 of those who said that they probably would get vaccinated.  The recent spate of heart inflammation cases in teens and young adults following the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines may have amplified many people s fears, said senior author Charles Irwin Jr., MD, director of the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospitals. It s important to note that the rate of heart inflammation in young people who have been vaccinated is only slightly higher than in young people who have not been vaccinated. In most cases, symptoms are mild and resolve with minimal treatment,  said Irwin.  As a result, the majority of providers support the CDC and other advisory bodies that continue to recommend the vaccine for everyone age 12 or older. The researchers recommend that young adults  concerns about vaccine safety and side effects are addressed via public education campaigns.  Education and public health messaging encouraging young adult vaccination is needed, ideally harnessing social media and key influencers,  Irwin said,  including clinicians who have a key role in reducing vaccine hesitancy in youth and adult patients.

The nasal passage also shows the highest expression of ACE2, a protein that has been widely linked with increased susceptibility to COVID-19. Now, scientists from Japan have found that nasal inflammation can influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. They also identified the use of short chain fatty acids as a potential COVID-19 management strategy.Humans are no stranger to coronavirus (CoV) pandemics. Just like SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), another member of the coronavirus family SARS-CoV caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic across parts of Asia in 2003. But, its spread was contained way faster than COVID-19. So, what makes SARS-CoV-2 so contagious?Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses bear  spike proteins  which get inside our cells by binding to a protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is found in our cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has been found to have a higher binding affinity (10 to 20 times that of SARS-CoV) to ACE2, thus establishing a link between the pathogen and the protein.Interestingly, recent studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 who have rhinosinusitis (i.e., inflammation of the nose) have a low risk of hospitalization. Moreover, the expression of ACE2 was reduced in patients with rhinosinusitis. Coincidentally, another study has shown that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by bacteria in the gut have beneficial effects in allergy and viral infections. These separate findings prompted an investigation of the effect that SCFAs in the nasal cavity against SARS-CoV-2 infection by scientists from the University of Fukui, Japan, led by Dr. Tetsuji Takabayashi.In a new study published in the American Journal of Rhinology & Allergy, the scientists attempted to understand the effect of SCFAs on ACE2 expression in the nasal passage, and the potential impact on COVID-19 infection.  This is the first report that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) effectively reduce the ACE2 levels in human airway epithelial cells,  remarks Dr. Takabayashi.To understand the status of ACE2 expression in patients with allergies, the researchers studied the levels of ACE2 in the inner lining of the nose in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis induced by Japanese cedar pollen (SAR-JCP) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Using techniques like real time-PCR to quantify the expression of ACE2, the researchers found that there was no increase in ACE2 expression in in patients with SAR-JCP, whereas it was decreased in patients with CRS.To better understand the effect of SCFAs on ACE2 expression, the researchers cultured nasal epithelial cells and exposed them to either SFCA and double-stranded RNA (similar to the nuclear material found in some viruses and known to enhance ACE2 expression). Upon examining the expression of ACE2, the researchers saw that the SFCAs had suppressed ACE2 expression in the presence of the RNA as well.These results suggest that SFCAs has potential therapeutic applications against COVID-19. Dr. Takabayashi explains,  The nasal mucosa exhibits the highest ACE2 expression among human organs and hence is a prominent target of original infection. Therefore, the development of strategies to downregulate ACE2 expression in nasal epithelial cells could reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and be useful as a novel therapeutic approach. The team s timely findings will certainly aid in our fight against COVID-19.Reference: Takabayashi T, Yoshida K, Imoto Y, Schleimer RP, Fujieda S.

Several large producers, including Humm and Brew Dr., are based in Oregon. Kombucha is produced by fermenting sugared tea using a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, commonly referred to as SCOBY, and adding flavorings to enhance the taste. But little is known about what microorganisms in the SCOBY contribute to fermentation, which presents a challenge to kombucha brewers, especially those working on a commercial scale.  Without having a baseline of which organisms are commonly most important, there are too many variables to try and think about when producing kombucha,  said Chris Curtin, an assistant professor of fermentation microbiology at Oregon State.  Now with this research we can say there are four main types of SCOBY. If we want to understand what contributes to differences in kombucha flavors we can narrow that variable to four types as opposed to, say, hundreds of types.  Curtin and Keisha Harrison, a doctoral student in Curtin s lab, recently published a paper in the journal Microorganisms about their kombucha microorganism research, which began in 2017 when Harrison joined the lab. Harrison gave a presentation about the research at KombuchaKon, an annual technical meeting for the kombucha brewing industry. Her talk caught the attention of representatives from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., who were looking to launch a line of hard kombucha, Curtin said. Sierra Nevada launched that line, known as Strainge Beast, in 2020, and recently expanded it with three new flavors. The line uses a proprietary SCOBY culture developed with the Oregon State team, drawing upon results from the recently published paper. Curtin and Harrison s research follows work by other scientists who have uncovered the microbial communities that contribute to fermentation in other foods and beverages, such as wine, cheese and some types of beer. Past efforts to understand the microbial composition of kombucha have yielded inconclusive results. In the recently published paper, Curtin and Harrison begin to change that. They used high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches to evaluate the microorganisms in 103 SCOBY used by kombucha brewers, primarily in North America. Only a few studies have applied these techniques with kombucha, and none at this scale. The major finding was that there are essentially only four main types of SCOBY. Interestingly, each type consisted of very different combinations of yeast and bacteria working together. This contrasts with other fermented beverages, where a single organism consistently becomes dominant, as is the case for beer, wine and cider.  This is the first comprehensive picture of SCOBY microbial community ecology,  Harrison said.  Further research is necessary to relate the microbial community composition of kombucha SCOBY to acidity, flavor and aroma of finished products. That work can now draw upon what we have discovered with the results in this paper. ReferenceHarrison K, Curtin C.

Forensic anthropology is a science, and we need to use terms consistently,  says Ann Ross, corresponding author of the study and a professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University.  Our study both highlights our discipline s challenges in discussing issues of ancestral origin consistently, and suggests that focusing on population affinity would be a way forward. Race is a social construct   there s no scientific basis for it. Population affinity, in the context of forensic anthropology, is determined by the skeletal characteristics associated with groups of people. Those characteristics are shaped by historic events and forces such as gene flow, migration, and so on. What s more, these population groups can be very fluid.In practical terms, that this means that race can be wildly misleading in a forensic context. For example, a missing person may have been listed as Black on their driver s license because of their skin color. But their skeletal remains may not indicate they were of African descent, because their bone structure may reflect other aspects of their ancestry. Like many disciplines, forensic anthropology has been coming to terms with issues regarding race,  Ross says.  Some people in the discipline want to do away completely with assessing an individual s place of origin. Others say that conventional approaches still have value in helping to identify human remains. In this paper, we are recommending a third path. This study is focused on finding ways to evaluate human variation that give us valuable information in forensic and anthropological contexts, but that avoid clinging to the use of outdated defaults such as race. In one part of the study, the researchers looked at all of the papers published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences between 2009 and 2019 that referenced ancestry, race or related terms. The goal of this content analysis was to determine if the terms were being used consistently within the field. And they were not. The Journal of Forensic Sciences is the flagship journal for forensic sciences in the U.S., and even there we found inconsistencies in how our field uses these terms,  Ross says.  Inconsistent terminology opens the door to confusion, misunderstanding and misuse within the discipline. In a second part of the study, the researchers used geometric morphometric data and spatial analysis methods to evaluate the validity of terms such as  European  or  African  to describe the ancestral origin of human remains.Altogether, the researchers evaluated nine datasets, comprising data on 397 people. The datasets were of human remains collected in Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Panama, Puerto Rico, Peru, Spain and a population of enslaved Africans that had been buried in Cuba. All of the remains, except for those of the enslaved Africans, were from the 20th or 21st centuries. Regarding the data we have on the remains of enslaved Africans, we want to acknowledge the value that data collected from such samples can contribute to discussions of human variation, while also noting that the history and ethics of human skeletal collections, in general, is often dubious,  Ross says.  Such body harvesting all too often occurred under the umbrella of scientific racism, without the permission of the deceased or next of kin, and disproportionately targeted marginalized populations. In their review of recent papers, the researchers found that forensics experts often still referred to remains as being of African, Asian or European origin. But our analysis of these nine datasets shows that this approach is wrong, because it s not that simple,  Ross says. Let s use Panama as an example,  says Ross, who is from Panama.  There have been huge movements of people into this area from all over the world over the past 500 years: indigenous peoples who predate colonialism, colonizers from Europe, slaves from Africa, immigrants from Asia. The contemporary remains we see in Panama reflect all of those influences. Ross also noted that the analysis of the nine datasets also highlighted a flaw in the contemporary idea of  clines.  The idea of clines is basically that, while there are changes from one group of people to another, populations who are geographically close to each other are more similar than populations that are geographically distant. However, the researchers found that this assumption can be misleading.For example, Panama and Colombia share a border, but very different historical forces have acted on Panama and Colombia in recent centuries   so the skeletal characteristics of remains from those two countries are much less similar than one would anticipate. All of this is important for multiple reasons, such as taking meaningful steps to reduce racism in our field, and ensuring that we are communicating clearly with each other within the discipline,  Ross says.  It is also important because marginalized people are most often the people whose remains go unidentified. Labeling them as  Hispanic  or  Black  is misleading. We, as forensic anthropologists, need to change the way we think about origin. We need to begin thinking about physical markers in the context of population affinity and how we can use that to both communicate clearly and to help understand who we are seeing when we work with unidentified remains. We need to ensure that we are not contributing   even inadvertently   to structural inequities and racism. This also means that we are faced with a wide range of new research questions. As a field, much of our work has focused on looking at data from the remains of historic populations. I think we need to begin doing more work that can help us better understand the ways in which historical events have helped to shape the skeletal characteristics of modern populations.

NRXN1 is a protein-coding gene at the synapse, a cellular junction that connects two nerve cells to communicate efficiently.Both the research with human-derived and engineered human neurons also found an increase in the levels of CASK, an NRXN1-binding protein, which were associated with changes in gene expression.""Losing one copy of this neurexin 1 gene somehow contributes to the etiology or the disease mechanism in these schizophrenia patients,"" says molecular neuroscientist ChangHui Pak, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and lead author of the research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""It causes a deficit in neural communication.""Pak is quick to add that although this single-gene mutation puts people at risk for schizophrenia, autism, Tourette syndrome and other neuropsychiatric disorders, ""at the end of the day, we don't know what causes schizophrenia. This variant gives us insight into what cellular pathways would be perturbed among people with schizophrenia and a lead to study this biology.""When she conducted most of the research, Pak was working in the Stanford University lab of Thomas S dhof, a neuroscientist who shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for helping to lay the molecular basis for brain chemistry, including neurotransmitter release.The research team obtained cell specimens from schizophrenia patients with an NRXN1 deletion who donated samples to a national biorepository for genetic studies of psychiatric disorders. Pak and colleagues converted the participants' specimens into stem cells and then turned them into functional neurons to study. ""We're rewinding these cells back, almost like a time machine - what did these patients' brains look like early on,"" Pak explains.Labs at Stanford, Rutgers University and FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics were independently involved in the generation and analysis of neurons. For comparison with the human-derived neurons, Pak and team also created human neurons from embryonic stem cells, engineering them to have one less copy of the NRXN1 gene. With engineered human neurons, they had previously noted the neurotransmitter impairment and were interested in whether they would have the same findings with patient-derived neurons.""It was good to see the consistent biological finding that indeed the neurexin 1 deletion in these patients actually does mess up their neuronal synaptic communication, and secondly that this is reproducible across different sites whoever does the experiment,"" Pak says.Notably, the researchers did not see the same decrease in neurotransmitter release and other effects in engineered mouse neurons with analogous NRXN1 deletion. ""What this suggests is there is a human-specific component to this phenotype. The human neurons are particularly vulnerable to this genetic insult, compared to other organisms, adding to the value of studying human mutations in human cellular systems,"" Pak says.Being able to reproduce the results is key to the development of drugs that can better treat schizophrenia. ""Everything was done blindly and at different sites. We wanted to not only learn about the biology but also be at the top of our game to ensure rigor and reproducibility of these findings,"" Pak says. ""We showed the field how this can be done.""Pak and her team are now continuing the research in the Pak Lab, supported by a five-year, $2.25 million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. The scientists are using the latest stem cell and neuroscience methodologies to explore the molecular basis of synaptic dysfunction in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.Reference: Pak C, Danko T, Mirabella VR, et al.

""By looking at this big picture, we were able to predict the mutational nature of SARS-CoV-2.""That gets into these questions of: Are vaccines going to be effective long term? Which variants are going to sneak by? Do we need that booster shot? Are vaccinated people going to be infected a second time?""The genetic code of a virus determines its ability to infect cells and direct them to churn out more copies of itself. That code consists of fundamental compounds, or nucleotides, with mutations occurring wherever those nucleotides get added, subtracted or swapped for one another. Many mutations have little or no effect, in the same way that trying to hack an intricate password by changing just one character will likely fail.But given enough chances, a virus will eventually happen upon a mutation or mutations that change the assembly of its structural joints, or amino acids, enough to help it better invade cells and replicate -- advantages that help it outcompete other strains. In some cases, a new strain can also evade the immune responses stirred by existing vaccines, necessitating the development of new vaccines to protect against it.LaTourrette and her adviser, Hernan Garcia-Ruiz, were busy comparing mutational patterns across viruses that invade a different biological kingdom -- plants -- when the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic struck. To do it, the researchers were analyzing segments of sequenced DNA from parallel locations on the genomes of all viruses in a genus. They were hunting specifically for single-point mutations: segments in which just one nucleotide had changed. By pinpointing them, the team was sussing out whether certain mutations pop up across related plant viruses, then tracing those mutations to functional amino acid changes in the viruses.""A lot of times, researchers have a specific plant virus they study,"" LaTourrette said. ""They know it really well. But our question was: Big picture, what is the genus doing? We know that variation isn't random. It accumulates in specific areas of the genome, and those areas are (sometimes) consistent across the genus. Those tend to be areas important for things like host adaptation -- basically, areas that are going to need to keep changing in order to keep co-evolving with their host.""So when COVID-19 happened, we thought, well, we can download the (betacoronavirus) sequences and run them through the pipeline and see where the variation is occurring.""When they did, LaTourrette and her colleagues found that the so-called spike protein, which protrudes from betacoronaviruses and keys their entry into host cells by binding with receptors on the surface, mutates rapidly across all known betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.Despite accounting for just 17% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the ""hyper-variable"" spike protein has so far accumulated roughly 50% of the virus's total mutations, the researchers discovered. Those mutations are emerging in the same regions of the genome, and even the same sub-units of the spike protein, as they have in every other betacoronavirus to date.""All of our analyses showed that that's really where the variation is happening,"" LaTourrette said. ""It didn't matter when we looked at it, what variant we looked at -- the spike protein was key.""The team also concluded, as other virologists have, that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is disordered --that while its amino acids assemble into the same general architecture, that architecture has what LaTourrette called ""some wiggle room"" to shift into slightly different configurations. That's bad news, she said, given that its structural flexibility likely gives it some functional wiggle room, too.""Humans may have slightly different cell receptors, person to person,"" LaTourrette said. ""So then you have to have a (spike protein) receptor that can accommodate those little shifts. If it were very ordered, and it couldn't shift, then maybe it couldn't infect everyone. But by having that flexibility, it's a much better virus.""Basically, this area is hyper-variable, and it's flexible. So it's the double whammy.""Those qualities will continue to make SARS-CoV-2 a formidable foe that requires vigilance to stave off for the foreseeable future, LaTourrette said. But knowing its strengths, and that the evolutionary history of other betacoronaviruses might serve as a reasonable preview of that future, should help virologists and vaccinologists strategize accordingly.Vaccines may have to continue targeting the distinctive spike protein as SARS-CoV-2 evolves, but consulting the mutational patterns of betacoronaviruses could help researchers forecast which domains of the protein are most and least likely to mutate. And that could make a moving target much easier to hit, LaTourrette said.""If you close your eyes when you're throwing a dart at a dartboard, it could go anywhere,"" she said. ""But by looking at the other (betacoronavirus) species, you have an idea of where it's likely to land. And you're more likely to be hitting that bull's-eye.""Though LaTourrette has already returned to the kingdom of plants, she said the opportunity to adapt her work to such a pressing purpose proved gratifying at a time when gratification was in short supply.""For us, getting to (transition) from plants to coronaviruses was a really positive way of showing that you can take your science and your knowledge, and you can apply it to the benefit of society,"" LaTourrette said. ""We've seen some really great examples in the past year-and-a-half of groups making that shift.""Even though this is a very difficult time, and there's a lot of hardship, I think it's really positive to see scientists come together and be able to contribute to a cause together.""LaTourrette and Garcia-Ruiz, an associate professor of plant pathology at the Nebraska Center for Virology, conducted the research with recent master's graduate Natalie Holste, doctoral student Rosalba Rodriguez-Pe a and Raquel Arruda Leme, a visiting researcher from Brazil.Reference: LaTourrette K, Holste NM, Rodriguez-Pe a R, Leme RA, Garcia-Ruiz H.

The study is believed to be the first to examine mental health issues in a large population of coal miners in the United States. Based on the troubling results, the researchers are calling for more mental health resources and treatment for current and former miners. They also are urging further study of potential contributors to the problem, including social determinants of health, substance use and workplace safety. Although coal mining is on the decline, the rates of black lung in Southwest Virginia continue to increase. Coal miners in Central Appalachia face disparities in health related to a range of complex social, economic, occupational and behavioral factors,  said researcher Dr. Drew Harris, a pulmonary medicine expert at UVA Health.  This study highlights the unrecognized crisis of mental illness in miners that warrants urgent attention, resources and expanded care.Miners  Mental HealthHarris serves as the medical director of the Black Lung Clinic at Southwest Virginia s Stone Mountain Health Services, the only federally funded black lung clinic in Virginia. Black lung is a progressive lung illness caused by inhaling toxic coal and rock dust within coal mines. The dust literally blackens the insides of the lungs and leaves patients struggling to breathe. This devastating disease has few treatment options and is increasingly being diagnosed in Central Appalachian coal miners: Out of more than 1,400 coal miners X-rayed in the last year at Stone Mountain, more than 15% had progressive massive fibrosis, the most severe form of black lung.To gauge the mental wellbeing of black-lung patients, Harris and his colleagues reviewed data collected at the clinic since 2018 assessing patients for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.More than 2,800 miners voluntarily completed a mental-health survey. The average age was 66; 99.6% were white; and 99.7% were male.Of the participants:   These rates of mental illness far exceeded those documented in coal mining populations internationally,  the researchers write in a new scientific paper outlining their findings. Rates skewed highest among sicker patients who required supplemental oxygen to help them breathe. Among that group, 47.7% reported anxiety, 48.5% reported depression and 15.9% reported considering suicide. The researchers note that depression and other mental health issues not only affect patients  quality of life, but can reduce the likelihood they will stick with their medications. The rates of mental illness identified in this large population of U.S. coal miners is shocking,  Harris said.  Improved screening and treatment of mental illness in this population is an urgent, unmet need that warrants urgent action. Reference: Harris D, McMurry T, Caughron A, et al.

The findings add to our understanding of social biases and could help with developing ways to promote cooperation outside of an individual's social group.""Humans, as well as many other creatures, are biased toward helping other members of their social groups over individuals they view as outsiders, and this can have a negative impact in diverse societies where different groups need to cooperate in order to thrive,"" says first author Inbal Ben-Ami Bartal, a faculty member at the Sagol School of Neuroscience and the Psychology Department at Tel-Aviv University, Israel. ""Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying these biases is essential to finding ways to eliminate them.""To explore this further, Bartal and a multinational team of colleagues placed rats in a situation where either a cage mate of the same type of rat, or a different type of rat they had never met, was trapped. In the experiments, most rats learned to free their cage mate, but few rescued the stranger.The team then examined the brain activity associated with these behaviours to understand why the rats were biased towards helping their cage mates. They found that some regions of the brain are activated in response to the distress of either a cage mate or an unfamiliar rat, meaning that rats sense the distress of another animal whether or not they know them. But additional brain regions associated with reward seeking and positive social experiences were turned on only when a cage mate was in distress. ""This brain activity in the rats that helped their fellow group members suggests an empathetic response to their distress,"" Bartal says.Previous studies in humans have also suggested that empathy towards fellow group members drives the desire to help them but not strangers. The current findings suggest that similar brain activity may drive these social biases in rats and potentially other mammals.""We've provided the first evidence for a common biological mechanism driving empathic helping behaviours in humans and rats in response to the distress of friends,"" concludes senior author Daniela Kaufer, Professor at the Department of Integrative Biology and the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, US.

A University of Arizona Health Sciences-led study recently identified a specific bacteria family and uncovered how it contributes to bacterial vaginosis, paving the way for new insights into disease prevention and treatment.Led by Melissa Herbst-Kralovetz, PhD, a member of the BIO5 Institute and associate professor of basic medical sciences at the College of Medicine - Phoenix, researchers found that members of the Veillonellaceae bacteria family contribute to an increase in inflammation and cell death, and alter the acidity of the cervical microenvironment. These changes support bacterial vaginosis and create favorable conditions for subsequent gynecological diseases, such as sexually transmitted infections and cancer.""Bacterial vaginosis is an enigma,"" said Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz, who is also director of the Women's Health Research Program. ""We know many factors contribute to this disease, but little is known about the functional impact of the major players and how they're changing the local landscape.""The paper, ""Veillonellaceae family members uniquely alter the cervical metabolic microenvironment in a human three-dimensional epithelial model,"" published July 6 in the journal npj Biofilms and Microbiomes, found that Veillonellaceae family members contribute to disease by altering inflammation and metabolism in the cervicovaginal region.The female reproductive tract is typically colonized by bacteria that promote health, such as Lactobacillus. While these bacteria are considered friendly, an imbalance can lead to the creation of a biofilm - a consortium of many different harmful microbes - that promotes disease.Last year, Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz and colleagues described a hypothetical model in which the interactions between microbes and human cells alter the vaginal microenvironment and ultimately influence the balance between health and disease. This study is the first to define a definitive role for this bacterial family in bacterial vaginosis.Using a 3D human model, Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz's group evaluated the effects of three bacterium - Veillonella atypica, Veillonella montpellierensis, and Megasphaera micronuciformis - on the cervical microenvironment.They found that two species - V. atypica and V. montpellierensis - decreased lactate, an acid typically produced by beneficial bacteria that provides protection from harmful infections. These two species also increased substances that play a role in bacterial vaginosis-associated vaginal odor.They also found that M. micronuciformis further drives disease progression by increasing inflammation and promoting cell death through the production of certain fat molecules.Insights from this study lay the foundation for polymicrobial, or ""multi-bug"" studies, which can determine the complex interaction effects of multiple bacterial species on female reproductive health.""Using this study and our 3D model as a foundation, we hope to determine if and how other species are altering the environment to contribute to bacterial vaginosis,"" Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz said. ""We have found that different species have distinct contributions, so we also hope to categorize a variety of bacterial vaginosis -associated microbes based on their unique effects on the female reproductive tract.""Ultimately, Dr. Herbst-Kralovetz says this study and others like it can help to inform treatment and intervention strategies.""It is important to know who the major players are, but also how they're influencing physiological processes and disease, so we can develop targeted strategies to treat bacterial vaginosis and prevent subsequent gynecological infections and cancer,"" she said.Reference: Salliss ME, Maarsingh JD, Garza C,  aniewski P, Herbst-Kralovetz MM.

Boys with a gut bacterial composition that was high in the bacteria Bacteroidetes at one year of age were found to have more advanced cognition and language skills one year later. The finding was specific to male children.""It's well known that female children score higher (at early ages), especially in cognition and language,"" said Anita Kozyrskyj, a professor of pediatrics at the U of A and principal investigator of the SyMBIOTA (Synergy in Microbiota) laboratory. ""But when it comes to gut microbial composition, it was the male infants where we saw this obvious connection between the Bacteroidetes and the improved scores.""""The differences between male and female gut microbiota are very subtle, but we do know from CHILD Cohort Study data that girls at early ages are more likely to have more of these Bacteroidetes. So perhaps most girls have a sufficient number of Bacteroidetes and that's why they have improved scores over boys,"" added Kozyrskyj.The researchers, led by Kozyrskyj and associate professor of pediatrics Piush Mandhane, studied bacteria found in fecal samples from the infants and identified three different groups exhibiting similar dominant clusters of bacteria. They then evaluated the infants on a variety of neural developmental scales. Of those groups, only the male infants with Bacteroidetes-dominant bacteria showed signs of enhanced neurodevelopment.The research replicates similar findings from a U.S. study that also showed an association between Bacteroidetes and neural development.According to Kozyrskyj, Bacteroidetes are one of a very few bacteria that produce metabolites called sphingolipids, which are instrumental for the formation and structure of neurons in the brain.""It makes sense that if you have more of these microbes and they produce more sphingolipids, then you should see some improvement in terms of the formation of neuron connections in our brain and improved scores in cognition and language,"" she said.According to Kozyrskyj, caesarean birth is one factor that can significantly deplete Bacteroidetes. Factors that positively influence gut microbiota composition in infants include breastfeeding, having a high-fibre diet, living with a dog and being exposed to nature and green spaces.While the findings don't necessarily mean children with a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes will remain behind their peers in later childhood or adulthood, the researchers believe the study offers early promise as a way to potentially identify children at risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.The team will continue to follow the infants participating in CHILD to determine whether the findings can be predictive of autism or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Moving forward, the researchers are also examining several other factors that may have an impact on neurodevelopment in infants, including stress and gut colonization by the bacterium Clostridium difficile.""Over the first one to two years of life, your brain is very malleable,"" said Kozyrskyj. ""Now we're seeing a connection between its malleability and gut microbiota, and I think that is very important.""Reference:Tamana SK, Tun HM, Konya T, et al.

The study led by Ashutosh Mangalam, PhD, UI associate professor of pathology, shows that a diet rich in isoflavone, a phytoestrogen or plant-based compound that resembles estrogen, protects against multiple sclerosis-like symptoms in a mouse model of the disease. Importantly, the isoflavone diet was only protective when the mice had gut microbes capable of breaking down the isoflavones. The findings were published July 9 in Science Advances. ""Interestingly, previous human studies have demonstrated that patients with multiple sclerosis lack these bacteria compared to individuals without MS,"" Mangalam says. ""Our new study provides evidence that the combination of dietary isoflavones and these isoflavone metabolizing gut bacteria may serve as a potential treatment for MS."" Isoflavones are found in soybeans, peanuts, chickpeas and other legumes. The study also found that mice fed the isoflavone diet have a microbiome that is similar to the microbiome found in healthy people and includes the bacteria which can metabolize isoflavones. Conversely, a diet lacking isoflavones promotes a microbiome in mice which is similar to one observed in patients with MS and lacks beneficial bacteria that can metabolize isoflavone. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the brain and spinal cord where the immune system attacks the protective coating surrounding nerve fibers. The symptoms of this disease include muscles weakness, balance issues, and problems with vision and thinking. While there are treatments that slow down the disease, there is currently no cure for MS. Although the exact cause of MS is unknown, a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors are thought to initiate the disease. Recently, the gut microbiome--the trillions of gut bacteria the live inside human intestines--has emerged as a potential environmental factor that contributes to MS. In prior work, Mangalam and colleagues demonstrated that there are significant differences between the gut microbes of patients with MS and people without MS. Specifically, patients with MS lacked bacteria that are able to metabolize isoflavones. Although role of gut microbiome in human diseases such as MS is being appreciated, the mechanism through which these gut bacteria might influence the disease is poorly understood. In the current study, Mangalam's team, including first author Samantha Jensen, a UI graduate student in immunology, found that the bacteria that are lacking in patients with MS are able to suppress inflammation in a mouse model of MS. The team compared the effects of an isoflavone diet and an isoflavone-free diet on disease in the mouse model of MS. They found that the isoflavone diet led to disease protection. However, when the team placed the mice on the isoflavone diet but removed the isoflavone-metabolizing gut bacteria, the isoflavone diet was no longer able to protect against MS-like symptoms. When the bacteria were reintroduced, the protective effect of the isoflavone diet was restored. Furthermore, the team was able to show that a specific isoflavone metabolite called equol, which is produced by the gut bacteria from isoflavone, is also able to provide protection against disease. ""This study suggests that an isoflavone diet may be protective so long as the isoflavone metabolizing gut bacteria are present in the intestines,"" say Mangalam, who also is a member of the Iowa Neuroscience institute and Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center.

This review, published in the Journal of Huntington s Disease, brings together and recaps data from major published mass spectrometry studies undertaken in HD research over the last 20 years, identifying important changes that occur in HD. The authors encourage researchers to make greater use of these studies to accelerate the development of new treatments.HD is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by the aberrant expression of mutant Huntingtin (HTT) protein containing an expanded polyglutamine tract. Mass spectrometry is a technique that has existed for over a century to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, however, proteins in complex mixtures such as tissues were not commonly analyzed until more modern ionization methods became available. The authors have explained mass spectrometry in terms understandable for most biologists. Although these studies have yielded copious, useful data, researchers in the HD field have been unaware of just how many such studies have been performed.  There are several advantages of using mass spectrometry,  explained Kimberly B. Kegel-Gleason, PhD, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MIND), Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.  First, it is objective   scientists don t need to have a preformed idea or candidate proteins in mind, which frees the experiment of our preconceptions and allows us to identify changes that we might not have thought of. Second, recent advances in the hardware have made it easier to detect many proteins, including those at very low levels in a mixed sample. Finally, expanded gene databases provided by whole genome sequencing now allow accurate  annotation  or identification of the proteins of interest.  HTT is now known to have a wide variety of post translational modifications (PTMs). In the early 2000s, mass spectrometry was used to identify Hap40 as part of protein complex with HTT. It was also used to investigate the difference in wild-type and HD proteomes (a proteome is the set of expressed proteins in a given type of cell, tissue, or organism). Following this study, several other investigators performed whole proteome studies in both human and mouse HD models. Many researchers have taken this a step further to investigate the HTT interactome (protein protein interaction network) using mass spectrometry, and also examined HTT itself to identifying novel PTMs. Notable among the studies reviewed are 15 proteome studies that sought to determine changes in expression levels (asking the question how much protein is there?) and five Interactome studies that looked at changes in how HTT interacts with other proteins (asking the question does HTT interact more or less with proteins?). These studies compared brain tissue from animal models and autopsy tissue from patients with HD compared to controls. Importantly, three studies used cerebral spinal fluid from controls and patients with HD in an effort to identify biomarkers for disease progression. They also highlight four studies that identified posttranslational modifications (molecular markers) on the Huntingtin protein.  Top-down mass spectrometry studies on the HTT protein are producing extremely interesting information about phosphorylation status and other modifications of HTT,  noted co-author Connor Seeley, BS, Laboratory of Cellular Neurobiology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.  Correlating these HTT proteoforms with functions should be fruitful in identifying mechanisms of pathology that can be targeted for intervention.   To date, despite the large number of published works, there has not been a similar comprehensive review focused on results from HD mass spectrometry studies,  commented Dr. Kegel-Gleason.  A substantial investment of research dollars was used to obtain these important data, yet often the greater community does not know how to interpret the findings or is unaware of how much data exist.  We encourage researchers to use this resource of assembled studies to streamline their own research to accelerate our identification of treatments. Of special interest is validating biomarkers in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). HD researchers should continue to mine data from these compiled works to support their findings. Finally, additional studies comparing control and HD CSF are warranted to discover and develop novel biomarkers for clinical applications.  HD is a fatal genetic neurodegenerative disease that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. An estimated 250,000 people in the United States are either diagnosed with, or at risk for, the disease. Symptoms include personality changes, mood swings and depression, forgetfulness and impaired judgment, unsteady gait, and involuntary movements (chorea). Every child of an HD parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene. Patients usually survive 10 20 years after diagnosis.ReferenceSeeley C, Kegel-Gleason KB.

But a recent paper by a team of researchers led by NanoImaging Services shows how microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) is growing to obtain the structures of potential pharmaceuticals.Three-dimensional crystal structures that show the relative positions of atoms, bonds and intramolecular interactions are needed to understand stability, reactivity, solubility and, ultimately, suitability for pharmaceutical use. Pharmaceutical researchers usually use X-ray diffraction (XRD) - with single-crystal XRD preferred - to solve crystal structures. But XRD usually requires large (100  m or larger), well-ordered crystals and several thousand known active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are available only as crystalline powders that do not readily form large crystals.""Growing large crystals is a huge bottleneck for those interested in determining crystal structures,"" said author Dr. Jessica Bruhn, Scientific Group Leader - MicroED at NanoImaging Services. ""MicroED can work with crystals of almost any size as it is generally fairly straightforward to break large crystals into a size suitable for MicroED.""Developments in automated data collection and data processing have led to increased interest in electron diffraction as an XRD alternative. Electron diffraction is like XRD, except that it uses a beam of electrons rather than X-rays to obtain structures. Since electrons readily interact with matter, MicroED can solve high-resolution crystal structures from sub-micron-sized crystals. It is especially exciting for small-molecule drugs, many of which readily form microcrystals, and the approach helps with the drug discovery phase when sample quantities are extremely limited. In the development phase, researchers can use it to determine structures of reaction products and by-products, which can help guide synthesis strategies and inform production decisions.""Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is faster, cheaper and easier to access compared to electron diffraction today,"" said Bruhn. ""However, I do expect to see electron diffraction determining more and more structures inaccessible to X-rays, such as those of transient polymorphs, helping to expand the breadth of crystal structures that can be determined.""Polymorphs are crystalline structures with the same chemical composition but different molecular packings with different lattice properties, like diamond and graphite. Most active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are thought to exist in more than one polymorphic form, which can give rise to drastically different drug properties. Successful drug formulation requires selecting the optimal polymorph, and that requires easily solving structures. In addition, most drug substances being developed today exhibit poor solubility. Determining the structures of the many different forms an API can adopt (including polymorphs, co-crystals, hydrates, solvates, etc.) helps researchers better engineer optimal crystal forms with good pharmacokinetic properties.In developing their MicroED pipeline, the researchers explored the prevalence of MicroED data available, including data stored in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). The CSD houses small-molecule organic and metal-organic experimental crystal structures with entries enriched and annotated by experts. About 98% of the structures in the CSD are from laboratory X-ray diffractometers, but the CSD houses a growing number of 3D electron diffraction datasets, including those solved by MicroED. Currently, there are over 100 unique datasets determined using electron diffraction in the CSD's June 2021 web and desktop offerings. In the past three years, the number of electron structures in the CSD has been increasing more rapidly, and the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) is committed to supporting scientists worldwide who are depositing and sharing their MicroED data globally.Suzanna Ward is the Head of Database at the CCDC.""Electron diffraction is truly one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving areas of structural science,"" Ward said. ""Recent publications already show how it could help to speed up the development of new drugs, and we are eagerly anticipating how it might impact the volume and breadth of data we are able to share through the CSD. I think we have an interesting journey ahead of us, and it will be intriguing to see how 3D electron diffraction will be utilized in both industry and academia in the coming years.""Reference: Bruhn JF, Scapin G, Cheng A, et al.

Beautifying to most, but for some they are equivalent to rashes, irritation and reduced quality of life. Together with hay fever and food allergies, allergic contact dermatitis due to exposure to e.g. nickel and perfume ingredients represents the majority of allergic reactions seen among Danes.Traditionally, researchers have distinguished between immediate and delayed allergic reactions, depending on which parts of the immune system that is responsible for the reaction. E.g., hay fever and food allergies are 'immediate' forms that cause immediate symptoms, whereas it can take days before the skin reacts to things like nickel and perfume. But now a new study conducted by the LEO Foundation Skin Immunology Research Center at the University of Copenhagen changes this understanding. 'Some patients develop allergic contact dermatitis at a much earlier stage than described by text books. The aim of the study was therefore to try to determine why some react to contact allergens much faster than prescribed. It turns out that when a part of the skin is exposed to the allergen for the first time, the cells within that specific skin area will develop local memory towards the contact allergen. And then when the same area is re-exposed to the allergen at a later point in time, the patient will develop a clear reaction within only 12 hours', explains PhD Student and first author of the study Anders Boutrup Funch. It is the T cells in the body that are responsible for delayed allergic reactions - also known as type 4 allergic reactions. But in the new study conducted on mice the researchers have shown that the T cells are capable of building a sophisticated memory that enables them to respond much faster than previously assumed. This gives us a more complex picture of contact allergy. 'We point to a need for clarification of this disease. Type 4 reactions should be subcategorised, giving us both the classic delayed reaction - that is, where the patient reacts 24-72 hours after exposure - and an immediate reaction, where the patient develops symptoms much faster. Based on these results, we may have to change the text books on contact allergy. At any case, we will need to add a chapter', says the main author of the study, Professor Charlotte Menn  Bonefeld. The study also reveals that activation of the memory T cells following exposure to an allergen leads to massive recruitment of the most abundant type of white blood cells in the body - the so-called neutrophils - to the affected part of the skin. Normally, neutrophil recruitment is used to fight infections, as these cells are capable of effectively eliminating microorganisms. At the same time, they cause intense infection and local tissue damage, which is what the patients experience as a rash. Neutrophil recruitment is not seen in connection with delayed reactions to contact allergens. The next step in the research is to test the study results on humans. Once a person has developed contact allergy, they are likely to suffer from it for the rest of their lives. Therefore, the researchers behind the study hope the new knowledge may improve contact allergy patients' chances of getting treatment in the future. 'First and foremost, we need to tell the world that we have new knowledge which should change our understanding of the disease', Anders Boutrup Funch concludes.ReferenceFunch AB, Mraz V, Gadsb ll A-S , et al.

This is to ensure the drugs kill off any remaining bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Visiting Scientist Raffaella Sordella investigated a similar problem that occurs in some lung cancers.Approximately 15% of non-small cell lung cancers have a mutation in a growth receptor called EGFR, causing tumor cells to grow uncontrollably. Researchers developed an effective drug that inhibits EGFR and kills cancer cells, but the tumor grows back later. Sordella wanted to understand the molecular mechanisms behind this relapse and how to prevent it.Sordella and her team discovered that a small percentage of drug-resistant cancer cells were already present before treatment. Instead of relying on EGFR, these cells are dependent on another gene (AXL) for survival. Furthermore, they observed that the cells could transition between these drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ""states."" When patients finish EGFR treatment, random modifications constantly occur in the remaining cells, causing both types of cells to grow back.Sordella and her team worked with clinicians at Northwell Health and former CSHL Professor Gregory Hannon, now at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute. Hannon's research focuses on microRNA, a molecule that regulates cells by managing transcribed (copied) genes. Sordella explains:""The genome is like a library. So when you have to do a recipe to bake something, you go there, you transcribe your recipe, you take it out from the library, you go in the kitchen. What these microRNAs do, they intercept all the recipes that are getting out from your library. And then, they decide whether this is a recipe that the cell should care about or not. So they are what they call 'gatekeepers' of a cell state.""The researchers discovered that a certain microRNA called miR335 determines the ""state"" of the cancer cell. If the cancer cell loses miR335, a cascade of events is triggered that allows cells to use the alternative AXL pathway; the cells are not killed by drugs that target EGFR. These drug-resistant cells survive and eventually, the tumor grows back.Understanding how resistance arises in lung cancer is key to figuring out how to eliminate a tumor. Sordella hopes that these findings could help develop treatments to wipe out both AXL- and EGFR-dependent cells from the start.Reference: Safaric Tepes P, Pal D, Lindsted T, et al.

Publishing their findings in the journal Limnology and Oceanography the authors analysed how biofouling   the accumulation of algae on the surface of microplastics, impacts the vertical movement of buoyant particles. The researchers found that particle properties are the biggest factor in determining the period and characteristics of the repetitive vertical movement below the surface, while the algal population dynamics determine the maximum depth reached. Their findings also show that the smallest particles are extremely sensitive to algal cell attachment and growth, suggesting they are always submerged at depths surrounding the base of the euphotic zone, the layer closer to the surface that receives enough light to support photosynthesis, or could become trapped in large algal colonies. In general, the results suggest that a higher concentration of biofouled microplastic is expected to be found subsurface, close to the euphotic zone depth rather than at the ocean s surface.Microplastics (fragments with a diameter smaller than 5mm) make up 90% of the plastic debris found at the ocean surface and the amount of plastic entering our ocean is significantly larger than the estimates of floating plastic on the surface of the ocean. However, it is not exactly known what happens to these particles once they enter the ocean, and 99% of microplastics within our ocean are considered missing. This new model has the potential to understand the distribution of fouled plastics in the ocean and therefore the ecological impact, particularly in areas of high concentration. Dr Kreczak, EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow at Newcastle University s School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, said:  Mathematical modelling has been extremely beneficial in identifying hot-spots for marine plastic pollution on the ocean surface. I hope this research can be a constructive step in understanding the impact plastic pollution has below the surface and aid in the effort towards a more sustainable ocean.  Co-Author Dr Andrew Baggaley, Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, added:  This is an exciting first step in our project to develop a comprehensive modelling framework to understand the transport of microplastic particles and their distribution in the oceans.  Future research by the team will focus on the fluid motion in the ocean mixed layer, to allow for even more complete assessment of microplastic vertical distributions in the ocean.

In addition, the plasma levels of a lower molecular mass (70 kDa) ACE2 fragment, generated as a result of interaction with the virus, are increased.These abnormal levels of ACE2 and truncated ACE2 (70 kDa fragment) return to normal after the patients' recovery. This suggests that both forms of ACE2 present in plasma could be used as a good biomarker of the evolution of coronavirus infection. In addition, truncated ACE2 levels served to discriminate between patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those infected with influenza A virus.""In this work we have studied the plasma levels of the coronavirus receptor, the ACE2 protein, and we have been able to determine that there are different forms of the protein in plasma, and that part of the soluble ACE2 are proteolytic fragments of the ACE2 receptor, generated subsequently to interaction with the virus. The full-length protein is also found in plasma, which provides information about tissue affection during infection,"" explains Javier S ez-Valero, who led the study.Although the main research line of S ez-Valero's group is Alzheimer's Disease, the ""similarities"" of ACE2 to core proteins of Alzheimer's disease pathology, such as beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), also cell membrane resident proteins, led this expert to think that perhaps ACE2 could be present in plasma, providing information on its interaction with the coronavirus.""Our approach to this research line was the possibility that soluble ACE2 protein can serve as a read-out during infection with COVID-19. This hypothesis originates from our expertise in Alzheimer's disease. In this neurodegenerative disease we investigate proteins, such as APP, that are present in the cerebrospinal fluid. APP is also a membrane protein that is processed by the same molecular tools as ACE2, enzymes called secretases, which process several membrane proteins into different fragments. This phenomenon was the clue that led us to think that ACE2 protein fragments, but also the full-length protein, are present in plasma. Thus, we have the possibility of investigating this protein as a possible biomarker,"" explains S ez-Valero.TRIAL PARTICIPANTSSamples and patient data included in this study were provided by the ISABIAL Biobank, integrated in the Spanish National Biobank Network and the Valencian Biobank Network. Fifty-nine patients with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs were included, of whom 24 were women and 35 men, with a mean age of 64 years. All were hospitalized 7 to 9 days after symptom onset. Of these, 48 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients suffered a moderate presentation of COVID-19, and 11 were considered severe as they suffered respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or intensive care unit treatment.Two additional groups were also analyzed, one of 17 participants (9 women and 8 men), which included people aged 34 to 85 years with influenza A virus pneumonia. The other group consisted of 26 disease-free controls (14 women and 12 men) aged 34-85 years. For the ""influenza A group"", samples were also taken in the acute phase, before specific hospital treatment.The ACE2 species in human plasma were identified by immunoprecipitation and western blotting, a technique that allows the detection of a specific protein in a blood or tissue sample, where there is a complex mixture of forms of the protein. Until now, plasma analyses carried out for the coronavirus had mostly used another technique called ELISA, which does not allow the different forms of the proteins to be determined.Changes in truncated and full-length ACE2 species were also examined in serum samples from humanized K18-hACE2 mice inoculated with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. These humanized mice carry the human gene that produces the ACE2 protein, allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection, which does not occur naturally due to lack of recognition of murine ACE2 by the virus.The alterations in the forms of ACE2 present in plasma following SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in this study justify, according to the researchers, further investigation of their potential as biomarkers of the disease process, and also for assessing the efficacy of vaccination. The next step will be to investigate what happens to these proteins in asymptomatic PCR-positive or vaccinated individuals.Reference: Garc a-Ayll n M-S, Moreno-P rez O, Garc a-Arriaza J, et al.

Their protocol has exhibited promising accuracy and may become a useful tool for the design and discovery of cyclic peptide drugs, which could help us reach new therapeutic targets inside cells beyond the capabilities of conventional small-molecule drugs or antibody-based drugs.Cyclic peptide drugs have attracted the attention of major pharmaceutical companies around the world as promising alternatives to conventional small molecule-based drugs. Through proper design, cyclic peptides can be tailored to reach specific targets inside cells, such as protein-protein interactions, which are beyond the scope of small molecules. Unfortunately, it has proven notoriously difficult to design cyclic peptides with high cell-membrane permeability--that is, cyclic peptides that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer that delimits the inside and outside of a cell.In an effort to resolve this bottleneck, scientists at the Middle Molecule IT-based Drug Discovery Laboratory (MIDL) have been working on a computational method for predicting cell-membrane permeability. Established in September 2017, MIDL is one of the ""Research Initiatives"" at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) that goes beyond the boundaries of departments. Under the support of the Program for Building Regional Innovation Ecosystems of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), MIDL has been working with the city of Kawasaki to industrialize a framework for discovering middle molecule-based drugs--cyclic peptide drugs and nucleic acid drugs larger than conventional small-molecule drugs but smaller than antibody-based drugs--by combining computational drug design and chemical synthesis technology.In a recent study published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, Professor Yutaka Akiyama and colleagues from MIDL and Tokyo Tech have developed a protocol for predicting the cell-membrane permeability of cyclic peptides using molecular dynamics simulations. Such simulations constitute a widely accepted computational approach for predicting and reproducing the dynamics of atoms and molecules by sequentially solving Newton's laws of motion at short time intervals. However, even a single simulation for predicting the permeability of a cyclic peptide with only eight amino acids takes a tremendous amount of time and resources. ""Our study marks the first time comprehensive simulations were performed for as many as 156 different cyclic peptides,"" highlights Prof. Akiyama, ""The simulation of each cyclic peptide using the protocol we developed took about 70 hours per peptide using 28 GPUs on the TSUBAME 3.0 supercomputer at Tokyo Tech.""The researchers verified the predicted permeability values with experimentally derived ones and confirmed an acceptable correlation coefficient of R = 0.63 under the best conditions, showcasing the potential of their protocol. Moreover, after a detailed analysis of the peptide conformation and energy values obtained from the trajectory data, Prof. Akiyama's team found that the strength of the electrostatic interactions between the atoms constituting the cyclic peptide and the surrounding media, namely lipid membrane and water molecules, are strongly related to the membrane permeability value. The simulations also revealed the way in which peptides permeate through the membrane by changing their orientation and conformation according to their surroundings (Figure). ""Our results shed some light on the mechanisms of cell-membrane permeability and provide a guideline for designing molecules that can get inside cells more efficiently. This will greatly contribute to the development of next-generation peptide drugs,"" remarks Prof. Masatake Sugita, the first author of the study.The researchers are already working on a more advanced simulation protocol that will enable more accurate predictions. They are also trying to incorporate artificial intelligence into the picture by adopting deep learning techniques, which could increase both accuracy and speed. Considering that cyclic peptides could unlock many therapeutic targets for diseases that are difficult to treat, let us hope that scientists at MIDL and Tokyo Tech succeed in their endeavors!This research achievement will be featured in the supplementary cover of the journal issue in which this manuscript will be published.Reference: Sugita M, Sugiyama S, Fujie T, et al. large-scale membrane permeability prediction of cyclic peptides crossing a lipid bilayer based on enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations.

Looking to shed new light on the dynamics of the eggs prior to fertilization and embryo transport preceding implantation, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and Stevens Institute of Technology developed a novel imaging approach that has allowed them to see eggs and embryos as they move along the fallopian tube in a live animal.Published in the journal Cell Reports, the researchers' observations revealed that eggs and embryos go through an unexpected journey that is more dynamic and complex than previously thought. The findings have important implications for studies of fertilization, embryogenesis and in vitro fertilization.""In this study, we developed and combined intravital window and optical coherence tomography to have visual access to eggs and embryos as they are transported through the mouse oviduct,"" said corresponding author Dr. Irina Larina, associate professor of molecular physiology at Baylor. ""No one had seen eggs and embryos moving in the fallopian tube in live organisms before.""The researchers discovered several unexpected findings. The expectation was that murine eggs and embryos after fertilization would move very slowly through roughly a 1 inch-long fallopian tube over the course of about three days. The accepted idea was that hair-like structures called cilia, which line internal surface of the fallopian tube, mediated the movement of the cells.""Surprisingly, we found that eggs and embryos move along the fallopian tube by combining different types of movements, showing a dynamic process that is more complex than it had been thought until now,"" said first author, Dr. Shang Wang, assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology.Depending on the location along the fallopian tube, the cells were observed sometimes moving in fast circular movements or oscillating, moving back-and-forth over long distances or fast forward. The orchestration of these different movements involves the participation of cilia, muscle contractions and peristaltic movements, processes that are differentially regulated by hormones and other factors.""Our findings provide a better understanding of this important step in mammalian reproduction and support reevaluating previous knowledge about how it happens,"" Larina said. ""In addition, our observations imply that perturbing one or more of the different movements along the tube could lead to reproductive disorders.""""Applying our imaging approach can lead to exciting discoveries that we hope can advance our understanding of disordered human reproductive conditions associated with the fallopian tube, as well as improvements in in vitro fertilization,"" Wang said.Reference: Wang S, Larina IV.

As the COVID-19 vaccination schemes commenced across the world and pregnant or lactating women became eligible for immunization, they faced a tough decision: take a potentially life-saving vaccine in the complete absence of data, or risk becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that pregnant or breastfeeding women may receive the vaccine if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization, recently reassured that there is no risk here because none of the vaccines that are being used contain live virus: ""There's no risk of transmission through the breast milk. In fact, the antibodies that the mother has can go through the breast milk to the babe and may only serve to protect the baby a little.""Nonetheless, some pregnant and lactating women have decided against immunization, citing the lack of available data as their reasoning.

The mutations appear to enable RNA-mediated epigenetic gene silencing in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.The findings, published in PLOS Genetics, suggest that genetic changes usually precede RNA-mediated epigenetic gene silencing in fission yeast.

Compared to average growth charts of children across the country, established in the 1970s, a child s numbers can confirm typical development or provide a diagnostic baseline to assess deviations from the curve. Yet, the brain, of vital importance to the child s development, is merely hinted at in these measurements. Head circumference may indicate a head growth issue, which could be further investigated to determine if there is an issue with brain size or extra fluid. But now, in the age of noninvasive brain scanning such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), could researchers develop normalized growth curve charts for the brain? That was the question Steven Schiff, Brush Chair Professor of Engineering at Penn State, and his multi-institution research team set out to answer. They published their results today (July 9) in the Journal of Neurosurgery, Pediatrics.  Brain size research also has a very unfortunate history, as it was often used to attempt to scientifically prove one gender or race or culture of people as better than another,  said Schiff, also a professor of engineering science and mechanics in the College of Engineering and of neurosurgery in the College of Medicine.  In this paper, we discuss the research going back about 150 years and then look at what the data of a contemporary cohort really tells us.  The researchers analyzed 1,067 brain scans of 505 healthy children, ages 13 days to 18 years old, from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pediatric MRI Repository. To ensure a representative sample population across sex, race, socioeconomic status and geographic location, the MRI scans were taken sequentially over several years at hospitals and medical schools in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. To ensure calibrated results, one person was established as a control and scanned at each site.  The study of brain size and growth has a long and contentious history   even in the era of MRI, studies defining normal brain volume growth patterns often include small sample sizes, limited algorithm technology, incomplete coverage of the pediatric age range and other issues,  said first author Mallory R. Peterson, a Penn State student who is pursuing both a doctorate in engineering science and mechanics in the College of Engineering and a medical degree in the College of Medicine. She earned her bachelor of science degree in biomedical engineering from Penn State in 2016.  These studies have not addressed the relationship between brain growth and cerebrospinal fluid in depth, either. In this paper, we resolve both of these issues.  The first startling finding, according to Schiff and Peterson, was the difference in brain volume between male and female children. Even after adjusting for body size, males exhibited larger overall brain volume.  Clearly, sex-based differences do not account for intelligence   we have known that for a long time, and this does not suggest differently,  Schiff said.  The important thing here is that there is a difference in how the brains of male and female children grow. When you re diagnosing or treating a child, we need to know when a child s brain isn t growing normally. The second finding was one of striking similarity rather than differences.  Regardless of the sex or the size of the child, we unexpectedly found that the ratio between the size of the child s brain and the volume of fluid within the head   cerebrospinal fluid   was universal,  Schiff said.  This fluid floats and protects the brain, serving a variety of functions as it flows through the brain. Although we have not recognized this tight normal ratio before, this relationship of fluid to brain is exactly what we try to regulate when we treat children for excess fluid in conditions of hydrocephalus.  The researchers plan to continue studying the ratio and its potential functions, as well as underlying mechanisms, in children and across the life span.  The apparent universal nature of the age-dependent brain-cerebrospinal fluid ratio, regardless of sex or body size, suggests that the role of this ratio offers novel ways to characterize conditions affecting the childhood brain,  Peterson said.The researchers also settled a longstanding controversy in terms of the temporal lobe, according to Schiff. After two years of age, the left side of this brain structure   where language function is typically localized   was clearly larger than the right side throughout childhood. A portion of the temporal lobe called the hippocampus, which can be a cause of epilepsy, was larger on the right than the left as it grew during childhood.  These normal growth curves for these critical structures often involved in epilepsy will help us determine when these structures are damaged and smaller than normal for age,  said Schiff.This approach to normal brain growth during childhood could help researchers understand normal from excessive volume loss throughout the later lifespan, according to Schiff.   Brain volume peaks at puberty,  Schiff said.  It then decreases as we age, and it decreases more rapidly in people with certain types of dementia. If we can better understand both brain growth and the ratio of brain to fluid at every age, we can not only improve how we diagnose clinical conditions, but also how we treat them.

This reaction occurs in two steps, the first of which involves capturing light energy and producing oxygen. This step takes place in a cell organelle in the plant cells called the chloroplast: specifically, in the membranes of one of its components, the thylakoid. The thylakoid membrane is unique to oxygen?producing organisms like plants and cyanobacteria, and its role has been known for over 200 years. Yet, even today in the technology age, the precise mechanisms that that shape this structure are unknown to us.""Now, Prof. Sakamoto and an international team of scientists have answered part of this question by focusing on a membrane remodeling protein, called VIPP1, which has been found to be involved in maintaining the integrity of the thylakoid membrane. Using high resolution imaging via cryo-electron microscopy, they've elucidated the mechanism by which this protein protects thylakoid membrane integrity. Their findings are published in the journal Cell.Speaking of his motivation for being part of this study, Prof. Sakamoto says, ""Chloroplasts in land plants are thought to have been derived from the endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria in plants 1.5 billion years ago. I was very fascinated by this during my college years and decided to study such organelles containing multiple membranes and their own DNA, like mitochondria and chloroplasts. In my laboratory, I have been working on VIPP1 since 2006, and have reported several of its important characteristics.""In this study, what the scientists observed was remarkable. Three VIPP1 monomers 'flex and interweave' in a specific formation to create a nucleotide binding pocket. Nucleotide binding to specific layers of such interwoven monomers cause layer stacking that results in basketlike structures of different symmetries. A part of the monomer is an amphiphilic--structure containing both water?attracting and water?repelling portions--helix. Within the basket structure, these helices are oriented such that their hydrophilic (water?attracting) portions face the outside of the basket and their hydrophobic (water?repelling) portions face the inside of the basket. The hydrophobic portions are also lipid (fat) attracting. Thylakoid membranes, like most cell membranes, are lipid membranes. The hydrophobic interior of the basket structure binds to the membrane and remodels it by increasing its curvature.In their experiments, when the scientists added mutations to prevent the hydrophobic surfaces from forming, stress on the membrane from high intensity light caused the thylakoid membrane to swell up and get damaged. This damage did not occur in membranes which had access to VIPP1 oligomers with hydrophobic surfaces.Dr. Sakamoto explains the importance of these results in the field of research: ""Our study reports that the membrane?remodeling protein VIPP1 plays a critical role in maintaining thylakoid membranes. This protein appears to share a common structure with ESCRT?III, which is important in membrane remodeling in humans and yeast, indicating that the mechanism at play here is a common mechanism regulating membrane integrity."" Further referring to more tangible potential practical applications, he says: ""Thylakoid is key to photosynthesis. Understanding its structure in detail can help crop production and thus food security. For instance, improving thylakoid membrane longevity can improve crop productivity."" And of course, all things considered, this finding resolves a long?standing mystery in the biology underlying photosynthesis.Reference: Gupta TK, Klumpe S, Gries K, et al.

Its size and efficient use of water and light give it tremendous potential for the production of renewable value-added bioproducts and biofuels.But the highly complex sugarcane genome poses challenges for conventional breeding, requiring more than a decade of trials for the development of an improved cultivar.Two recently published innovations by University of Florida researchers at the Department of Energy's Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI) demonstrated the first successful precision breeding of sugarcane by using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing -- a far more targeted and efficient way to develop new varieties.CRISPR/Cas9 allows scientists to introduce precision changes in almost any gene and, depending on the selected approach, to turn the gene off or replace it with a superior version. The latter is technically more challenging and has rarely been reported for crops so far.In the first report, researchers demonstrated the ability to turn off variable numbers of copies of the magnesium chelatase gene, a key enzyme for chlorophyll biosynthesis in sugarcane, producing rapidly identifiable plants with light green to yellow leaves. Light green plants did not show growth reduction and may require less nitrogen fertilizer to produce the same amount of biomass. That study, published in Frontiers in Genome Editing, was led by CABBI researchers Fredy Altpeter, Professor of Agronomy at the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS), and Ayman Eid, a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Altpeter's lab.The second study, also published in Frontiers in Genome Editing, achieved efficient and reproducible gene targeting in sugarcane, demonstrating the precise substitution of multiple copies of the target gene with a superior version, conferring herbicide resistance. Scientists co-introduced a repair template together with the gene-editing tool to direct the plant's own DNA repair process so that one or two of the thousands of building blocks of the gene, called nucleotides, were precisely replaced in the targeted location. The result was that the gene product was still fully functional and could no longer be inhibited by the herbicide. That study was led by Altpeter and former CABBI Postdoc Mehmet Tufan Oz.Altpeter's lab, part of CABBI's groundbreaking project to develop new oil-rich sugarcane varieties, has pioneered research with sugarcane genome editing using the TALEN gene-editing system. But the two recent publications are the first to successfully demonstrate CRISPR gene-editing in sugarcane as well as gene targeting for precision nucleotide substitution in sugarcane using any genome-editing tool.""Now we have very effective tools to modify sugarcane into a crop with higher productivity or improved sustainability,"" Altpeter said. ""It's important since sugarcane is the ideal crop to fuel the emerging bioeconomy.""Sugarcane is a hybrid of two kinds of parent plants, so it has multiple sets of chromosomes rather than just two, as with humans or ""diploid"" plants. That creates genetic redundancy -- with many sets of genes doing the same job -- which may contribute to the plant's productivity: If one set breaks, there's a backup. But it makes sugarcane extremely difficult to modify. Crop scientists have to target all the genes and copies that govern a particular trait in order to make improvements.With conventional breeding, two types of sugarcane are cross-bred to reshuffle the genetic information present in each parent in the hope of enhancing a desirable trait such as disease resistance. The problem is that genes are transferred from the parents to offspring in blocks, and desirable traits are often linked with deleterious genetic material. This means scientists often have to do multiple rounds of backcrossing and screen thousands of plants to restore the elite background, or underlying plant characteristics, in addition to improving one trait they re attempting to modify. The process is more time-consuming and costly in plants with complex genomes like sugarcane.Precise gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 offer a much more targeted path to crop improvement because it avoids the reshuffling of genetic information and simply changes inferior gene versions into superior ones. Given the sugarcane genome's complexity, Altpeter and his team focused initially on genes that control noticeable traits -- leaf color and herbicide resistance -- so they could determine if the edits worked.Beyond providing an easily identifiable phenotype, the targeted genes may prove useful in future research. Changing the chlorophyll content of sugarcane has the potential to increase canopy level photosynthesis or reduce the requirement for nitrogen fertilizer, based on previous plant modeling. Sugarcane is a tall, dense plant, with the top leaves getting lots of sun and shading lower foliage. If the upper leaves have less chlorophyll, sunlight can penetrate deeper into the plant, increasing its biomass with the same amount of light and less fertilizer. Herbicide resistance is not only an agronomically desirable trait to facilitate weed management; it will also facilitate future gene-editing efforts by enabling suppression of non-edited plant cells.At CABBI, Altpeter and his team are already applying the results to develop improved sugarcane lines. Sugarcane has many different gene targets that can translate into more biomass or the production of lipids or specialty fatty acids -- all of which would advance CABBI's goals to produce fuels and other products from plants to replace petroleum. Because the crop is already harvested and processed for sugar extraction, the basic infrastructure to process its raw material into a product on a shelf is essentially in place.""Adding value streams is relatively inexpensive compared to other crop alternatives,"" Altpeter said.Reference: Oz MT, Altpeter A, Karan R, Merotto A, Altpeter F.

Researchers found that those who grew up in areas with higher levels of atmospheric lead had less adaptive personalities in adulthood -- lower levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness and higher levels of neuroticism.""Links between lead exposure and personality traits are quite impactful, because we take our personalities with us everywhere,"" said Ted Schwaba, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychology at UT Austin. ""Even a small negative effect of lead on personality traits, when you aggregate it across millions of people and all the daily decisions and behaviors that our personality influences, can have really massive effects on well-being, productivity and longevity.""In the study, researchers linked historical atmospheric lead data from the Environmental Protection Agency to online personality questionnaire responses from people who grew up in the sampled locations. Results showed that adults who were raised in U.S. counties with higher levels of atmospheric lead were less agreeable and conscientious and, among adults in their 20s and 30s, more neurotic than those who had less lead exposure during childhood.""These three traits -- conscientiousness, agreeableness and low neuroticism -- make up a large part of what we would consider a mature, psychologically healthy personality and are strong predictors of our success or failure in relationships and at work,"" Schwaba said. ""Normally, across the lifespan, people become more conscientious and agreeable, and less neurotic.""To further test whether lead exposure causes these differences, the researchers examined the effects of the 1970 Clean Air Act, finding that people born after atmospheric lead levels began to decline in their counties had more mature, psychologically healthy personalities in adulthood than those born before their counties phased out lead-based products.To ensure these findings weren't simply reflecting cohort effects -- characteristics resulting from shared historical or social experiences -- researchers replicated their study in Europe, where lead was phased out later than in the U.S. There, they found that people who grew up in areas with more atmospheric lead were also less agreeable and more neurotic in adulthood, although the findings regarding conscientiousness did not replicate.""For a long time, we've known lead exposure is harmful, but each new wave of research seems to identify new ways in which lead exposure harms society,"" Schwaba said. ""Though there's much less lead in the atmosphere today, lead remains in pipes, the topsoil and groundwater. And these sources of lead exposure tend to disproportionately harm people of color -- Black children are twice as likely to have high levels of lead in their blood as white children. From an economic standpoint, from a social justice standpoint, or really any way you look at it, it's incredibly important to limit lead exposure as much as possible.""Reference: Schwaba T, Bleidorn W, Hopwood CJ, et al.

Tested in tobacco plants, the technique showed that it could reduce harmful chemical compounds, including some that are carcinogenic. The findings could be used to improve the health benefits of crops.""A number of techniques can be used to successfully reduce specific chemical compounds, or alkaloids, in plants such as tobacco, but research has shown that some of these techniques can increase other harmful chemical compounds while reducing the target compound,  said De-Yu Xie, professor of plant and microbial biology at NC State and the corresponding author of a paper describing the research.  Our technology reduced a number of harmful compounds   including the addictive nicotine, the carcinogenic N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), and other tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs)   simultaneously without detrimental effects to the plant. The technique uses transcription factors and regulatory elements as molecular tools for new regulation designs. Regulatory elements are short, non-coding DNA fragments that control the transcription of nearby coding genes. Transcription factors are proteins that help turn certain genes on or off by binding to regulatory elements. Xie hypothesized that these could be useful molecular tools to design new regulations for engineering new plant traits. Two Arabidopsis transcription factors in particular, PAP1 and TT8, are known to regulate the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, or classes of nutraceutical compounds with antioxidant properties. Xie further hypothesized that these proteins could be used as molecular tools to help repress a number of harmful chemical compound levels, such as nicotine. PAP1 regulates pigmentation, so tobacco plants with our overexpressed PAP1 genes are red,  Xie said.  We screened plant DNAs and found that tobacco has PAP1- and TT8-favored regulatory elements near JAZ genes, which repress nicotine biosynthesis. We then proposed that these elements were appropriate tools for a test. In all, we found four JAZ genes activated in red tobacco plants with a designed PAP1 and TT8 cassette overexpressed. Xie and his colleagues tested the hypothesis by examining tobacco plants in the greenhouse and in the field and showed the reductions of harmful chemical compounds and nicotine in both types of experiments. NNN levels were reduced from 63 to 79% in leaves from tobacco plants that had PAP1 and TT8 overexpressed, for example. Overall, four carcinogenic TSNAs were significantly reduced by the technique.Xie believes that the technique holds the potential to be used in other crop plants to promote other beneficial traits and make some foods healthier.

However, this risk was not significant among older adults with dentures, suggesting that timely treatment with dentures may protect against cognitive decline.About one in six adults aged 65 or older have lost all of their teeth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior studies show a connection between tooth loss and diminished cognitive function, with researchers offering a range of possible explanations for this link. For one, missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing, which may contribute to nutritional deficiencies or promote changes in the brain. A growing body of research also points to a connection between gum disease a leading cause of tooth loss and cognitive decline. In addition, tooth loss may reflect life-long socioeconomic disadvantages that are also risk factors for cognitive decline. Given the staggering number of people diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease and dementia each year, and the opportunity to improve oral health across the lifespan, it s important to gain a deeper understanding of the connection between poor oral health and cognitive decline,  said Bei Wu, PhD, Dean's Professor in Global Health at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing and co-director of the NYU Aging Incubator, as well as the study s senior author.Wu and her colleagues conducted a meta-analysis using longitudinal studies of tooth loss and cognitive impairment. The 14 studies included in their analysis involved a total of 34,074 adults and 4,689 cases of people with diminished cognitive function.The researchers found that adults with more tooth loss had a 1.48 times higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and 1.28 times higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia, even after controlling for other factors.However, adults missing teeth were more likely to have cognitive impairment if they did not have dentures (23.8 percent) compared to those with dentures (16.9 percent); further analysis revealed that the association between tooth loss and cognitive impairment was not significant when participants had dentures.The researchers also conducted an analysis using a subset of eight studies to determine if there was a  dose-response  association between tooth loss and cognitive impairment in other words, if a greater number of missing teeth was linked to a higher risk for cognitive decline. Their findings confirmed this relationship: each additional missing tooth was associated with a 1.4 percent increased risk of cognitive impairment and 1.1 percent increased risk of being diagnosed with dementia. This  dose-response  relationship between the number of missing teeth and risk of diminished cognitive function substantially strengthens the evidence linking tooth loss to cognitive impairment, and provides some evidence that tooth loss may actually predict cognitive decline,  said Xiang Qi, a doctoral candidate from NYU Meyers. Our findings underscore the importance of maintaining good oral health and its role in helping to preserve cognitive function,  said Wu.Reference: Qi X, Zhu Z, Plassman BL, Wu B.

Our closest relatives, the chimpanzees, can't do it. And the dogs' closest relative, the wolf, can't either, according to a new Duke University-led study published July 12 in the journal Current Biology.More than 14,000 years of hanging out with us has done a curious thing to the minds of dogs. They have what are known as ""theory of mind"" abilities, or mental skills allowing them to infer what humans are thinking and feeling in some situations.The study, a comparison of 44 dog and 37 wolf puppies who were between 5 and 18 weeks old, supports the idea that domestication changed not just how dogs look, but their minds as well.At the Wildlife Science Center in Minnesota, wolf puppies were first genetically tested to make sure they were not wolf - dog hybrids. The wolf puppies were then raised with plenty of human interaction. They were fed by hand, slept in their caretakers' beds each night, and received nearly round-the-clock human care from just days after birth. In contrast, the dog puppies from Canine Companions for Independence lived with their mother and littermates and had less human contact.Then the canines were tested. In one test, the researchers hid a treat in one of two bowls, then gave each dog or wolf puppy a clue to help them find the food. In some trials, the researchers pointed and gazed in the direction the food was hidden. In others, they placed a small wooden block beside the right spot -- a gesture the puppies had never seen before -- to show them where the treat was hidden.The results were striking. Even with no specific training, dog puppies as young as eight weeks old understood where to go, and were twice as likely to get it right as wolf puppies the same age who had spent far more time around people.Seventeen out of 31 dog puppies consistently went to the right bowl. In contrast, none out of 26 human-reared wolf pups did better than a random guess. Control trials showed the puppies weren't simply sniffing out the food.Even more impressive, many of the dog puppies got it right on their first trial. Absolutely no training necessary. They just get it.It's not about which species is ""smarter,"" said first author Hannah Salomons, a doctoral student in Brian Hare's lab at Duke. Dog puppies and wolf puppies proved equally adept in tests of other cognitive abilities, such as memory, or motor impulse control, which involved making a detour around transparent obstacles to get food.It was only when it came to the puppies' people-reading skills that the differences became clear.""There's lots of different ways to be smart,"" Salomons said. ""Animals evolve cognition in a way that will help them succeed in whatever environment they're living in.""Other tests showed that dog puppies were also 30 times more likely than wolf pups to approach a stranger.""With the dog puppies we worked with, if you walk into their enclosure they gather around and want to climb on you and lick your face, whereas most of the wolf puppies run to the corner and hide,"" Salomons said.And when presented with food inside a container that was sealed so they could no longer retrieve it, the wolf pups generally tried to solve the problem on their own, whereas the dog puppies spent more time turning to people for help, looking them in the eye as if to say: ""I'm stuck can you fix this?""Senior author Brian Hare says the research offers some of the strongest evidence yet of what's become known as the ""domestication hypothesis.""Somewhere between 12,000 and 40,000 years ago, long before dogs learned to fetch, they shared an ancestor with wolves. How such feared and loathed predators transformed into man's best friend is still a bit of a mystery. But one theory is that, when humans and wolves first met, only the friendliest wolves would have been tolerated and gotten close enough to scavenge on the human's leftovers instead of running away. Whereas the shyer, surlier wolves might go hungry, the friendlier ones would survive and pass on the genes that made them less fearful or aggressive toward humans.The theory is that this continued generation after generation, until the wolf's descendants became masters at gauging the intentions of people they interact with by deciphering their gestures and social cues.""This study really solidifies the evidence that the social genius of dogs is a product of domestication,"" said Hare, professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke.It's this ability that makes dogs such great service animals, Hare said. ""It is something they are really born prepared to do.""Much like human infants, dog puppies intuitively understand that when a person points, they're trying to tell them something, whereas wolf puppies don't.""We think it indicates a really important element of social cognition, which is that others are trying to help you,"" Hare said.""Dogs are born with this innate ability to understand that we're communicating with them and we're trying to cooperate with them,"" Salomons said.Reference: Salomons H, Smith KCM, Callahan-Beckel M, et al.

The amount of recovered sequences from environmental sediments, however, is generally low, which difficults the analyses to be performed with these sequences. A study led by Ron Pinhasi and Pere Gelabert of the University of Vienna and published in Current Biology successfully retrieved three mammalian environmental genomes from a single soil sample of 25,000 years bp obtained from the cave of Satsurblia in the Caucasus (Georgia).The cave of Satsurblia was inhabited by humans in different periods of the Paleolithic: Up to date a single human individual dated from 15,000 years ago has been sequenced from that site.  No other human remains have been discovered in the older layers of the cave. The innovative approach used by the international team led by Prof. Ron Pinhasi and Pere Gelabert with Susanna Sawyer of the University of Vienna in collaboration with Pontus Skoglund and Anders Bergstr m of the Francis Crick Institute in London permits the identification of DNA in samples of environmental material, by applying extensive sequencing and huge data analysis resources. This technique has allowed the recovery of an environmental human genome from the BIII layer of the cave, which is dated before the Ice Age, about 25,000 years ago. This new approach has evidenced the feasibility of recovering human environmental genomes in the absence of skeletal remains. The analysis of the genetic material has revealed that the SAT29 human environmental genome represents a human extinct lineage that  contributed to the present day West-Eurasian populations. To validate the results, the researchers compared the recovered genome with the genetic sequences obtained from bone remains of the nearby cave of Dzudzuana, obtaining definitive evidence  of genetic similarities. This fact validate the results and excludes the possibility of modern contamination of the samples. Along with the identified human genome, other genomes such as wolf and bison have also been recovered from  the environmental samples. The sequences have been used to reconstruct the wolf and bison Caucasian population history and will help better understand the population dynamics of these species. The team now plans to perform further analyses of soil samples from  the cave of Satsurbia with the objective of revealing interactions between extinct fauna and humans and the effect of climatic changes on mammalian populations.

In the process, the scientists fingered a bloodborne substance whose abundance may accelerate cardiovascular aging. The story of the clock's creation will be published July 12 in Nature Aging. ""Every year, the calendar tells us we're a year older,"" said David Furman, PhD, the study's senior author. ""But not all humans age biologically at the same rate. You see this in the clinic -- some older people are extremely disease-prone, while others are the picture of health."" This divergence, Furman said, traces in large part to differing rates at which people's immune systems decline. The immune system -- a carefully coordinated collection of cells, substances and strategies with which evolution has equipped us to deal with threats such as injuries or invasions by microbial pathogens -- excels at mounting a quick, intense, localized, short-term, resist-and-repair response called acute inflammation. This ""good inflammation"" typically does its job, then wanes within days. (An example is that red, swollen finger you see when you have a splinter, and the rapid healing that follows.) As we grow older, a low-grade, constant, bodywide ""bad inflammation"" begins to kick in. This systemic and chronic inflammation causes organ damage and promotes vulnerability to a who's who of diseases spanning virtually every organ system in the body and including cancer, heart attacks, strokes, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity. To date, there have been no metrics for accurately assessing individuals' inflammatory status in a way that could predict these clinical problems and point to ways of addressing them or staving them off, Furman said. But now, he said, the study has produced a single-number quantitative measure that appears to do just that. Furman directs the Stanford 1000 Immunomes Project and is a visiting scholar at Stanford's Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection. In addition, he's an associate professor at the Novato, California-based Buck Institute for Research on Aging and director of the Artificial Intelligence Platform at the same institute. Lead authors of the study are Nazish Sayed, MD, PhD, assistant professor of vascular surgery at Stanford, and Yingxiang Huang, PhD, senior data scientist at the Buck Institute.For the 1000 Immunomes Project, blood samples were drawn from 1,001 healthy people ages 8-96 between 2009 and 2016. The samples were subjected to a barrage of analytical procedures determining levels of immune-signaling proteins called cytokines, the activation status of numerous immune-cell types in responses to various stimuli, and the overall activity levels of thousands of genes in each of those cells. The new study employed artificial intelligence to boil all this data down to a composite the researchers refer to as an inflammatory clock. The strongest predictors of inflammatory age, they found, were a set of about 50 immune-signaling proteins called cytokines. Levels of those, massaged by a complex algorithm, were sufficient to generate a single-number inflammatory score that tracked well with a person's immunological response and the likelihood of incurring any of a variety of aging-related diseases. In 2017, the scientists assessed nearly 30 1000 Immunomes Project participants ages 65 or older whose blood had been drawn in 2010. They measured the participants' speed at getting up from a chair and walking a fixed distance and, through a questionnaire, their ability to live independently (""Can you walk by yourself?"" ""Do you need help getting dressed?""). Inflammatory age proved superior to chronological age in predicting frailty seven years later. Next, Furman and his colleagues obtained blood samples from an ongoing study of exceptionally long-lived people in Bologna, Italy, and compared the inflammatory ages of 29 such people (all but one a centenarian) with those of 18 50- to 79-year-olds. The older people had inflammatory ages averaging 40 years less than their calendar age. One, a 105-year-old man, had an inflammatory age of 25, Furman said. To further assess inflammatory age's effect on mortality, Furman's team turned to the Framingham Study, which has been tracking health outcomes in thousands of individuals since 1948. The Framingham study lacked sufficient data on bloodborne-protein levels, but the genes whose activity levels largely dictate the production of the inflammatory clock's cytokines are well known. The researchers measured those cytokine-encoding genes' activity levels in Framingham subjects' cells. This proxy for cytokine levels significantly correlated with all-cause mortality among the Framingham participants.The scientists observed that blood levels of one substance, CXCL9, contributed more powerfully than any other clock component to the inflammatory-age score. They found that levels of CXCL9, a cytokine secreted by certain immune cells to attract other immune cells to a site of an infection, begin to rise precipitously after age 60, on average. Among a new cohort of 97 25- to 90-year-old individuals selected from the 1000 Immunomes Project for their apparently excellent health, with no signs of any disease, the investigators looked for subtle signs of cardiovascular deterioration. Using a sensitive test of arterial stiffness, which conveys heightened risk for strokes, heart attacks and kidney failure, they tied high inflammatory-age scores -- and high CXCL9 levels -- to unexpected arterial stiffness and another portent of untoward cardiac consequences: excessive thickness of the wall of the heart's main pumping station, the left ventricle. CXCL9 has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. A series of experiments in laboratory dishware showed that CXCL9 is secreted not only by immune cells but by endothelial cells -- the main components of blood-vessel walls. The researchers showed that advanced age both correlates with a significant increase in endothelial cells' CXCL9 levels and diminishes endothelial cells' ability to form microvascular networks, to dilate and to contract. But in laboratory experiments conducted on tissue from mice and on human cells, reducing CXCL9 levels restored youthful endothelial-cell function, suggesting that CXCL9 directly contributes to those cells' dysfunction and that inhibiting it could prove effective in reducing susceptible individuals' risk of cardiovascular disease.

Crucially, pushed waves are known to retain genetic diversity for much longer than their pulled counterparts, and these results have confirmed that this is also the case in viral expansions. This new understanding suggests that viral expansions might be much more adaptable than previously thought and could help to build better models to predict the evolution of viruses in infected organisms. ""Pushed expansions are normally observed in populations that display cooperative behaviour, like herds of animals. Yet, no cooperation among these viruses is known to occur,"" explained first author Michael Hunter from Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. ""Here, we have used a model ecosystem of a bacteria-infecting virus, phage T7, and its host, E. coli, to demonstrate that pushed waves occur in viral expansions even if no explicit cooperation among the viral particles exists. ""Our observations show that the transition from pulled to pushed expansions spontaneously arises from the feedback between virus and host dynamics, whereby the viral dispersal depends on the host density, which, in turn, is continuously modified by the virus as the expansion advances."" The team uncovered two independent physical mechanisms that contribute to this virus-host feedback and determine the parameters that can affect the transition between the different types of expansions. The first mechanism stems from volume-excluded interactions between virus and host in crowded environments, as host cells represent physical obstacles that impede viral diffusion. The second arises from the viral incubation period during which the virus is trapped inside the host cell and is unable to diffuse. ""Our results point to the phage-bacteria system as a highly controllable platform to experimentally investigate the dynamics of expanding populations with density-dependent dispersal,"" said senior author Dr Diana Fusco, also from the Cavendish Laboratory. ""Beyond phages, our findings show that viral expansions can retain genetic diversity much longer than previously thought, suggesting that viral populations expanding in an infected organism may be very adaptable to changes in the environment. This realization will help in building better models for viral growth and evolution in infected tissues and organisms.""ReferenceHunter M, Krishnan N, Liu T, M bius W, Fusco D.

Platanias from The Northwestern University as well as The Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center said, ""Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the second most common form of leukemia in adults, and has a very poor overall survival rate.""Therefore, there continues to be a need for new therapeutic modalities, including approaches targeting negative-feedback signaling pathways that may be activated in response to antileukemic treatments, leading to resistance.The pro-neoplastic activity of eIF4E is associated with its phosphorylation/activation by MNK1/2 on serine 209 and correlates with enhanced mRNA translation, as well as nuclear export of mRNAs involved in tumorigenesis and cell cycle control.Several studies have shown that pharmacological targeting of MNK1/2 results in inhibitory activity against AML cells in pre-clinical models.As a result, the full therapeutic potential of MNK1/2 inhibition for the treatment of AML has not been fully assessed.The authors demonstrate that Tomivosertib suppresses eIF4E phosphorylation in AML cells and decreases leukemic cell survival and proliferation.The Platanias Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output, ""Viewed altogether, these studies indicate that MNK1/2 inhibition would most likely be a successful strategy in only a subset of AML patients. In future studies it will be crucial to ascertain what pathways are responsible for sensitivity to MNK inhibitors. These studies will help to identify potential regulatory programs through which MNK1/2 modulates cell signaling pathways critical for leukemic cell survival and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions for AML.""Reference: Suarez M, Blyth GT, Mina AA, et al.

They are also very difficult to treat, since the brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier.The blood-brain barrier works as a border wall between the blood and the brain, allowing just certain molecules to enter the brain. And whereas water and oxygen can get through, as can other substances such as alcohol and coffee. But it does block more than 99 percent of potentially neuroprotective compounds from reaching their targets in the brain.Now, in a study conducted in living, including awake mice, a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen provides direct insight on how to trick the blood-brain barrier's impermeable walls to allow drug delivery to the brain.They investigated so-called nanoparticle liposome drug carriers and delivered them past the blood-brain barrier while tracking and monitoring them all the way through the system.""Before this study, the community had no insight what was happening in the blood-brain barrier in the living brain, and why some nanoparticles crossed and others wouldn't. In this regard, the blood-brain barrier was a 'black-box' where the events between drug administration and detection in the brain remaind obscures. It was even doubted whether nanoparticle entry to the brain was possible at all. With our paper, we now provide a direct proof of nanoparticle entry to the brain and describe why, when, and where it happens,"" explains Assistant Professor Krzysztof Kucharz from the Department of Neuroscience.The researchers, aided by colleagues at the Technical University of Denmark and Aalborg University, used two-photon imaging to deconstruct the blood-brain barrier in order to understand how the nanoparticle drug carriers travel past the blood-brain barrier in a living organism.""We monitored the nanoparticles entry to the brain at each step of the process, providing valuable knowledge for the future drug design. Specifically, we show which vascular segments are the most efficient to target with nanoparticles to allow their entry to the brain. And because we were able to monitor the drug carriers at the level of a single nanoparticles, we now provide a novel platform to develop more efficient and safer therapeutic approaches,"" says Krzysztof Kucharz.The study, released in Nature Communications, shows that nanoparticles targeted to the brain are picked up in the capillaries and venules by endothelial cells, which are the cells in the blood-brain barrier that allow or reject access of molecules to our brain tissue.""Analogically to the mythical Trojan horse they are recognized by endothelium and transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. These nanoparticles have a cargo space that can be loaded with various neuroprotective drugs to treat many neurodegenerative diseases. This approach is currently tested in many clinical and preclinical trials in brain cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, the levels of nanoparticle transport into the brain are still low and need to improve to reach clinical significance. Therefore, there is a great need to optimize nanoparticle drug delivery and to do so, it is crucial to understand how nanoparticles interact with the blood-brain barrier. This is where we came into play."", says Krzysztof Kucharz.The researchers used a two-photon imaging approach to study nanoparticles allowed them to open the blood-brain barrier ""black box"" and get a full picture of nanoparticles route across the blood-brain barrier. They tagged the particles with fluorescent molecules, which allowed the microscopy of nanocarriers in the living, intact brain at the resolution level of a single nanoparticle.Now, they could observe how nanoparticles circulate in the bloodstream, how they associate over time to the endothelium, how many are taken up by the endothelium, how many are left behind, what happens to them once inside the blood-brain barrier and where the nanoparticles exit to the brain. Then, they observed that brain vessels handle the nanoparticles differently, allowing or rejecting access of nanoparticles to the brain tissue depending on the vessel type.""Although the anatomy and function of the endothelium differ between different vessel types, this principal feature of the brain had so far been overlooked in drug delivery studies, and whether or how it impacted drug delivery had been unknown,"" says Krzysztof Kucharz.They show that nanoparticles can enter the brain mainly at big vessels, i.e. venules, which are surrounded by so-called perivascular space, and not, as previously believed small and numerous capillaries. The perivascular space surrounds venules making nanoparticles easier to exit the endothelium and progress further into the brain, but it is absent in capillaries.""Our results challenge the assumed view that capillaries constitute the main locus for nanoparticle transport to the brain. Instead, venules should be targeted for efficient nanoparticle drug delivery to the brain"", says Krzysztof Kucharz.The methodological platform developed by authors may constitute an excellent platform to fine-tune nanoparticle formulations for increased transport to the brain and provide valuable information for the future design of novel drug delivery systems. This will hopefully provide a great leap forward to efficiently treat brain disorders.Reference: Kucharz K, Kristensen K, Johnsen KB, et al.

""Ultimately, these developmental similarities are a legacy of shared evolutionary history. This demonstrates how the story of evolutionary developmental biology, or 'evo devo,' also extends to what we call the 'epigenetic level'--or how genes are regulated.""In the study, PhD student Haoze (Vincent) Yu, postdoctoral scholar Litao Tao, and their colleagues identified a shared mechanism involved in gene regulation or epigenetics, that enables stem cells and progenitor cells to differentiate into more specialized hair cells and Merkel cells.In order to begin the process of differentiation, the right parts of a stem cell's DNA need to be taken out of storage. Each human cell can store around six feet of DNA in its nucleus, because this DNA is wound around tiny ""spools"" made up of proteins called histones. These spools of DNA and histone protein are further packed together to form what are known are nucleosomes, which are stacked to create chromatin, which is the material that makes up the chromosomes.When DNA is wound tightly into this storage configuration, the chromatin is closed and inaccessible to the protein ATOH1. This protein is a ""master regulator"" that can activate a network of differentiation genes in the DNA within the chromatin--but not without first gaining access.To this end, ATOH1 stimulates the production of a second protein known as POU4F3, an aptly named ""pioneer factor"" with the ability to venture into new frontiers by binding to closed and inaccessible chromatin. After POU4F3 blazes a trail by binding to the closed chromatin, ATOH1 is able to move forward with engaging and activating the network of genes that drives differentiation into hair cells and Merkel cells.Strikingly, there is significant overlap in the specific regions of chromatin that POU4F3 makes accessible to ATOH1 in hair cells and Merkel cells.""It's remarkable that these two cell types, which are both involved in sensing mechanical stimuli but derive from distinct parts of the embryo, both rely on the same ATOH1/POU4F3 mechanism in order to differentiate,"" said Segil. ""Our study suggests that this mechanism is extremely ancient, and emerged before hair cells and Merkel cells diverged from a common evolutionary ancestor--an 'ur-mechanoreceptor' cell type.""

In addition to contributing significantly to population growth, unintended pregnancies can have pronounced adverse effects on maternal physical, mental and economic wellbeing.BUSM researchers and ZabBio (San Diego, Calif.) have developed an anti-sperm monoclonal antibody, the Human Contraception Antibody (HCA), which they found to be safe and possess potent sperm agglutination (clumping) and immobilization activity in laboratory tests. HCA appears to be suitable for contraceptive use and could be administered vaginally in a dissolvable film for a woman-controlled, on-demand method birth control method,  explains senior author Deborah Anderson, PhD, professor of Medicine.To evaluate its suitability as a topical contraceptive, the researchers tested HCA over a wide range of concentrations and under different physiologically relevant conditions in vitro. Specifically, HCA was mixed with sperm from normal, healthy volunteers and then tested. Within 15 seconds, sperm became immobilized and firmly stuck together. The researchers also found that HCA did not to cause vaginal inflammation in lab tissue culture tests.Due to its effectiveness and safety profile, HCA may address current gaps in the contraception field.  HCA could be used by women who do not use currently available contraception methods and may have a significant impact on global health,  said Anderson.

The researchers hope that adoption of metabolomics to screen for inborn errors of metabolism will result in a more rapid, more efficient and less expensive diagnostic journey for individuals and families with rare metabolic disorders.""Currently, newborn screening is conducted in every infant born in the U.S. to check for serious but rare health conditions at birth. Screening includes blood, hearing and heart tests,"" said corresponding author Dr. Sarah Elsea, professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor and senior director of biochemical genetics at Baylor Genetics. ""While newborn screening in general has improved in the last 10 years, clinically screening for inborn errors of metabolism has not changed substantially in the last 40 to 50 years.""Inborn errors of metabolism include conditions that disrupt the normal processes the body uses to transform food into energy and can result in serious conditions. Having an early diagnosis can lead to early treatment, when available. For instance, newborn screening looks for signs of conditions such as phenylketonuria, the body's inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine, which results in its accumulation. Buildup of phenylalanine can irreparably harm the nervous system, but early intervention may help manage the condition.""We developed a clinical test - untargeted metabolomics profiling - that looks at a broader range of metabolic compounds in the blood, therefore screening for many more disorders than the currently used approach,"" said Elsea, a member of Baylor's Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center and Center for Drug Discovery. ""In the current study, we compared the standard approach and untargeted metabolomics on their effectiveness identifying metabolic conditions.""The researchers compared the results of applying the two approaches to 4,464 clinical samples received from 1,483 unrelated families. They found that the traditional standard analysis has a positive rate of diagnosis of about 1%. However, using the untargeted metabolomics analysis the researchers were able to confirm a positive rate of diagnosis of 7%.""This is a substantial increase in the ability to diagnose these conditions,"" Elsea said. ""We are now able to identify in one blood sample more conditions than ever before.""""In addition, our analysis of many metabolic compounds in a single blood sample reduces the need of having to take more samples to do further testing looking for specific conditions. This includes taking samples of cerebrospinal fluid, which involves a more invasive procedure than drawing a blood sample,"" said co-author Dr. V. Reid Sutton, professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor, medical director of the biochemical genetics laboratory at Baylor Genetics and director of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Service at Texas Children's Hospital.This screening approach offers the critical advantages of reducing the time to having a diagnosis and starting treatment, if available.Using untargeted metabolomics in combination with genetic screening enables researchers and physicians not only to confirm a diagnosis with high degree of confidence, but also to rule out potential conditions. The novel, broader screening approach identifies severe forms of diseases and also mild forms that may not quite fit the characteristics observed in the more severe cases.""We are finding individuals with milder forms of a disease are more common in our populations than those with severe forms,"" Elsea said.

But now, researchers from Japan have identified a new type of light with reduced consequences for physiological changes during sleep.In a study published in June 2021 in Scientific Reports, researchers from University of Tsukuba compared the effects of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which have been widely adopted for their energy-saving properties, with organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) on physical processes that occur during sleep.Polychromatic white LEDs emit a large amount of blue light, which has been linked with many negative health effects, including metabolic health. In contrast, OLEDs emit polychromatic white light that contains less blue light. However, the impact of LED and OLED exposure at night has not been compared in terms of changes in energy metabolism during sleep, something the researchers at University of Tsukuba aimed to address.""Energy metabolism is an important physiological process that is altered by light exposure,"" says senior author of the study Professor Kumpei Tokuyama. ""We hypothesized that compared with LEDs, OLED exposure would have a reduced effect on sleep architecture and energy metabolism, similar to that of dim light.""To test this hypothesis, the researchers exposed 10 male participants to LED, OLED, or dim light for 4 hours before they slept in a metabolic chamber. The researchers then measured energy expenditure, core body temperature, fat oxidation, and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin--which is a measure of melatonin levels--during sleep. The participants had not recently traveled or participated in shift work.""The results confirmed part of our hypothesis,"" explains Professor Tokuyama. ""Although no effect on sleep architecture was observed, energy expenditure and core body temperature during sleep were significantly decreased after OLED exposure. Furthermore, fat oxidation during sleep was significantly lower after exposure to LED compared with OLED.""In addition, fat oxidation during sleep was positively correlated with 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels following exposure to OLED, suggesting that the effect of melatonin activity on energy metabolism varies depending on the type of light exposure.""Thus, light exposure at night is related to fat oxidation and body temperature during sleep. Our findings suggest that specific types of light exposure may influence weight gain, along with other physiological changes,"" says Professor Tokuyama.Many occupations and activities involve exposure to artificial light before sleep. New information about the effects of different kinds of light on physical processes may facilitate the selection of alternative light sources to mitigate the negative consequences of light exposure at night. Furthermore, these findings advance our knowledge regarding the role of light in energy metabolism during sleep.Reference: Ishihara A, Park I, Suzuki Y, et al.

Newborn infants are particularly susceptible to this type of infection; they develop meningitis 30 times more often than the general population. Group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteria are the most common cause of neonatal meningitis, but they are rarely responsible for disease in adults. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with Inserm, Universit  de Paris and Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital (AP-HP), set out to explain neonatal susceptibility to GBS meningitis. In a mouse model, they demonstrated that the immaturity of both the gut microbiota and epithelial barriers such as the gut and choroid plexus play a role in the susceptibility of newborn infants to bacterial meningitis caused by GBS. The findings were published in the journal Cell Reports on June 29, 2021.Newborn infants are more likely to develop bacterial meningitis than children and adults. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the pathogen responsible for a significant proportion of cases of neonatal meningitis. In most instances, infection is preceded by bacterial colonization of the gut. The commensal bacterial gut flora (known as the microbiota) plays a key physiological role, as it is involved in digestion, offers protection from gut pathogens and contributes to tissue differentiation and immune development. Newborns have no gut microbiota; it gradually develops in the first few weeks after birth.In a new study, scientists from the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with Inserm, Universit  de Paris and Necker-Enfants malades Hospital (AP-HP), demonstrated in a mouse model that the immaturity of the gut microbiota in neonates is involved in neonatal susceptibility to meningitis caused by GBS. In the absence of a mature microbiota, the bacteria can extensively colonize the gut. In the absence of a mature microbiota, the barrier function of blood vessels in the gut that the bacteria must cross to reach the brain through the bloodstream is also less effective, and the immune system is unable to control infection.Unexpectedly, the scientists also demonstrated that, independently of the microbiota, the epithelial barriers formed by the gut and the choroid plexus (the interface between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid that irrigates the brain) are not entirely mature in newborns, which facilitates bacterial access to the brain. The signaling pathway known as the Wnt pathway, which is involved in tissue growth and differentiation, is more active in newborns, resulting in a less effective barrier function at the gut and choroid plexus levels in neonates.""In this study, we show how two factors associated with infancy - the immaturity of the gut microbiota and the growth of gut and choroidal epithelial tissues - play a role in the susceptibility of newborn infants to meningitis caused by GBS, at all stages of infection from gut colonization to dissemination in the brain,"" explains Marc Lecuit (university professor/hospital practitioner, Universit  de Paris and Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital), head of the Biology of Infection Unit at the Institut Pasteur and Inserm and last author of the study.The results of this research illustrate the importance of the microbiota and its critical role in protecting against infection.Reference: Travier L, Alonso M, Andronico A, et al.

New crops such as energycane can produce several times more fuel per acre than soybeans. Yet, challenges remain in processing the crops to extract fuel efficiently. Four new studies from the University of Illinois explore chemical-free pretreatment methods, development of high-throughput phenotyping methods, and commercial-scale techno-economic feasibility of producing fuel from energycane in various scenarios. The studies are part of the ROGUE (Renewable Oil Generated with Ultra-productive Energycane) project at U of I. ROGUE focuses on bioengineering accumulation of triacylglycerides (TAGs) in the leaves and stems of energycane, enabling the production of much more industrial vegetable oil per acre than previously possible.  The productivity of these non-food crops is very high per unit of land. Soybean is the traditional crop used for biodiesel, but we can get higher yield, more oil, and subsequently more biofuel from lipid-producing energycane,  says Vijay Singh, Founder professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE) at U of I and co-author on all four papers. Biofuel production from crops involves breaking down the cellulosic material and extracting the oil in a series of steps, explains study co-author Deepak Kumar, assistant professor in the Chemical Engineering Department at State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) and adjunct research scientist at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at U of I.  The first step is to extract the juice. That leaves bagasse, a lignocellulosic material you can process to produce sugars and subsequently ferment to bioethanol,  Kumar says.  One of the critical things in processing any lignocellulosic biomass is a pretreatment step. You need to break the recalcitrant structure of the material, so enzymes can access the cellulose,  he adds.  Because energycane is a relatively new crop, there are very few studies on the pretreatment and breakdown of this bagasse to produce sugars, and to convert those sugars into biofuels.  The pretreatment process also yields some unwanted compounds, which inhibit enzymes that convert the sugar into biofuels. The U of I researchers investigated the best pretreatment methods to maximize the breakdown while minimizing the production of inhibitors. Typically, the pretreatment process uses chemicals such as sulfuric acid to break down the biomass at high temperature and pressure.  We use a chemical-free method, which makes it more environmentally friendly,  Kumar explains.  Furthermore, harsh chemicals may alter the oil structure or quality in the biomass.  The researchers tested their method using nine different combinations of temperature and time intervals. They were able to achieve more than 90% cellulose conversion at the optimal conditions, which is equivalent to results from chemical pretreatment methods. The second study built on those results to further investigate the relationship between temperature, inhibitor production, and sugar recovery.  We pretreated the lignocellulosic biomass over a range of different temperatures to optimize the condition for minimal inhibitor generation without affecting the sugar recovery. Then we added cryogenic grinding to the process,  says Shraddha Maitra, postdoctoral research associate in ABE and lead author on the study.  In cryogenic grinding, you treat the bagasse with liquid nitrogen, which makes it very brittle, so upon grinding the biomass fractures easily to release the sugars. This further increased sugar recovery, mainly xylose, by about 10% compared to other refining processes,  Maitra explains. Other industries use similar methods, for example for spices and essential oils, where it is important to preserve the qualities of the product. But applying them to biofuel production is new. In a third study, Maitra and her co-authors investigated time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology to determine the stability and recovery of lipids by monitoring changes in total, bound, and free lipids after various physical and chemical feedstock preprocessing procedures. The research team s fourth study investigated the commercial-scale techno-economic feasibility of engineered energycane-based biorefinery. They used computer modeling to simulate the production process under two different scenarios to determine capital investment, production costs, and output compared with soybean-based biodiesel.  Although the capital investment is higher compared to soybean biodiesel, production costs are lower (66 to 90 cents per liter) than for soybean (91 cents per liter). For the first scenario, processing energycane had overall slightly lower profitability than soybean biodiesel, but yields five times as much biodiesel per unit of land,  says Kumar, the lead author on the study.  Energycane is attractive in its ability to grow across a much wider geography of the U.S. south east than sugarcane. This is a region with much underutilized land, yet capable of rain-fed agriculture,  says ROGUE Director Steve Long, Ikenberry Endowed Chair of Plant Biology and Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois.  As a perennial, energycane is suitable for land that might be damaged by annual crop cultivation. Our research shows the potential to produce a remarkable 7.5 barrels of diesel per acre of land annually. Together with co-products, this would be considerably more profitable than most current land use, while having the potential to contribute greatly to the national U.S. goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This proves how valuable it is to build on the successes already achieved in bioengineering energycane to accumulate oils that are easily converted into biodiesel and biojet,  Long states.ReferencesKumar D et al.

AMF take carbon from plants and provide nitrogen and other useful soil nutrients that plants need in order to grow and develop.In the study, researchers set up plots of soybeans with increased air temperatures of about 3 degrees Celsius, plots with higher levels of ozone, plots with higher levels of both warming and ozone, and control plots with no modifications. The resulting experiments showed that warming and increased ozone levels make soybean roots thinner as they save resources to get the nutrients they need.Soybean cultivars are often sensitive to ozone, Hu said. Ozone levels have been somewhat stable or even declining in some parts of the United States over the past decade but have risen dramatically in areas of rapid industrialization, like India and China, for example.""Ozone and warming have been shown to be very stressful to a lot of crops - not just soybeans - and a lot of grasses and tree species,"" Hu said. ""Ozone and warming make the plants weak. Plants try to maximize nutrient uptake, so their roots become thinner and longer as they need to exploit the sufficient volume of soil for resources. This weakness results in a reduction of AMF and faster root and fungal hyphal turnovers, which stimulates decomposition and makes carbon sequestration more difficult. These cascading events may have profound effects underground, although the plant shoots appear normal in some cases.""Hu said he was surprised that the plant shoots weren't greatly affected by the stresses of warming and ozone; the biomass of plant leaves in both control and experimental plots was about the same.Perhaps even more surprisingly, Hu said that more warming and ozone changed the type of AMF that colonize soybean plants.The study showed that levels of an AMF species called Glomus decreased with more warming and ozone, while a species called Paraglomus increased.""Glomus protects organic carbon from microbial decomposition while Paraglomus is more efficient at absorbing nutrients,"" Hu said. ""We didn't expect these communities to shift in this way.""Hu plans to continue to study the systems surrounding carbon sequestration in soil as well as other greenhouse gas emissions from soil, like nitrous oxide, or N2O.Reference: Qiu Y, Guo L, Xu X, et al.

However, the pathogen Salmonella enterica, which grows and reproduces inside our cells, has evolved ways to detoxify such hostile compartments, turning them into a comfortable home where Salmonella can survive and thrive.A team of scientists led by EMBL group leader Nassos Typas has uncovered new details of Salmonella s survival strategies. The researchers analysed protein interactions in Salmonella-infected cells to identify the diverse biological processes of the host cell that the bacterium uses. Salmonella targets and modifies cellular protein machineries and pathways, in which multiple proteins work together, with the help of so-called effector proteins, which it injects into host cells. Altogether, Salmonella is known to release more than 30 effector proteins into infected cells to hijack nutrients and protect itself. However, the functions of many of these proteins, and which host cell proteins they interact with, are largely unknown. To find these enigmatic protein interactions, the EMBL scientists genetically engineered 32 Salmonella strains by adding identification tags to individual Salmonella proteins   earmarking one protein in each bacterial strain. The identification tags act like a handle the scientists can grab in their experiments. This approach of modifying the effector proteins directly in their host is a breakthrough. It enables researchers to capture the bacterial proteins after they have been secreted into infected cells, and to pull them out along with any host cell proteins that are bound to them. These interacting proteins are then identified using a technique called mass spectrometry.  The new approach has many benefits over previous experimental strategies. In particular, it characterises the whole set of host pathogen protein protein interactions in cells infected with a live pathogen, closely resembling what occurs in a host organism upon Salmonella infection,  says Joel Selkrig, a scientist in the Typas group  and one of the two lead authors of the study. Using their novel approach, the EMBL scientists identified 421 previously unknown interactions between Salmonella proteins and host cell proteins   along with 25 interactions that had been described before.  We found that multiple Salmonella effectors physically interact with several proteins that the host cell uses to transport cholesterol. This way, cholesterol trafficking can be hijacked for Salmonella s own purposes,  says Philipp Walch, who recently completed his PhD at EMBL Heidelberg and shares first authorship of the study with Joel. Cholesterol is an essential component of the biological membranes that surround our cells and the structures within them. Salmonella uses cholesterol to modify the composition of the membrane sacs that surround it, potentially making the membrane more rigid and reinforcing the barrier that separates Salmonella from cellular detection and defence systems, which are present in the host cell s cytoplasm. The scientists also found new clues to how two other survival strategies work. One of these strategies is to remodel the network of protein fibres that are used to transport material within the cell. Another strategy involves interfering with the function of a host cell protein that mediates contacts between membranes to facilitate the exchange of lipids and small molecules. Both strategies may help Salmonella to strengthen its protective membrane shield and avoid detection by the host cell s defence systems.ReferenceWalch P, Selkrig J, Knodler LA, et al.

Some are essential for survival while some play an important role by engaging with the innate immune response of the host.The growing list of enzymes responsible for building lipoproteins includes the recently discovered Lit (lipoprotein intramolecular transacylase), which creates a specific lipoprotein that ""cools the immune response"" - raising the likelihood that Lit enables the bacteria to gain a foothold in the host by stealth.With a view to understanding how Lit functions at the molecular level, the Trinity-led team has just produced Lit's all-important, high-resolution crystal structure from Bacillus cereus - a common bacteria found in soil and food.Combined with other analytical techniques, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics approaches, the team now has a detailed understanding of how it functions.Professor Martin Caffrey, Fellow Emeritus (Trinity and TBSI), is the senior author of the research. Underlining its significance and potential societal impact, he said:""We believe Lit is very likely a virulence factor, negatively impacting host immune response to infection. As such, it could well turn out to be an important target for the development of critically needed antibiotics against which resistance is much less likely to evolve. And it is no exaggeration to say that antibiotic resistance poses a genuine, growing threat to our society.""With a high-resolution crystal structure and a strong foundation for understanding how it functions in bacterial cells, we are in a similar position to where we were four years ago when we published similar work concerning a related lipoprotein processing enzyme, known as lipoprotein signal peptidase II (or LspA). LspA is currently under intense scrutiny as an antibiotic target by several research groups - including ours in TBSI - and by a number of pharmaceutical companies.""Reference: Olatunji S, Bowen K, Huang CY, et al.

A new study published in  Annals of Behavioral Medicine  looked at the consequences of sleeping fewer than six hours for eight consecutive nights   the minimum duration of sleep that experts say is necessary to support optimal health in average adults.Lead author Soomi Lee, assistant professor in the School of Aging Studies at the University of South Florida, found the biggest jump in symptoms appeared after just one night of sleep loss. The number of mental and physical problems steadily got worse, peaking on day three. At that point, research shows the human body got relatively used to repeated sleep loss. But that all changed on day six, when participants reported that the severity of physical symptoms was at its worst. Many of us think that we can pay our sleep debt on weekends and be more productive on weekdays,  Lee said.  However, results from this study show that having just one night of sleep loss can significantly impair your daily functioning. Data provided by the Midlife in the United States study included nearly 2,000 middle-aged adults who were relatively healthy and well-educated. Among them, 42% had at least one night of sleep loss, sleeping 1   fewer hours than their typical routines. They recorded their mental and physical behaviors in a diary for eight consecutive days, allowing researchers to review how sleep loss causes wear and tear on the body. Participants reported a pile-up of angry, nervous, lonely, irritable and frustrated feelings as a result of sleep loss. They also experienced more physical symptoms, such as upper respiratory issues, aches, gastrointestinal problems and other health concerns. These negative feelings and symptoms were continuously elevated throughout consecutive sleep loss days and didn t return to baseline levels unless they had a night sleep of more than six hours.About one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than six hours per night. Lee says once that becomes a habit, it s increasingly difficult for your body to fully recover from lack of sleep, continuing the vicious cycle of worsening daily well-being, which could impact one professionally. A previous study led by Lee found losing just 16 minutes of sleep could impact job performance. Her previous findings also show that minor sleep loss can decrease daily mindfulness, which is a critical recourse for managing stress and maintaining healthy routines.Lee says the best way to maintain a strong daily performance is to set aside more than six hours to sleep every night.Reference: Lee S.

An international team investigated how many bird species can taste sweet and how far back that ability evolved. Their work was published today in the journal Science. The researchers offered two species of songbirds a choice between sugar water and plain water nectar-taking honeyeaters, as well as canaries, a grain-eating bird not known for consuming sweet foods. They also examined taste receptor responses sampled from a variety of other species. Regardless of whether their main diet consisted of seeds, grains, or insects, songbird taste receptors responded to sugars. ""This was a clear hint that we should concentrate on a range of songbirds, not only the nectar-specialized ones, when searching for the origins of avian sweet taste,"" explains senior author Maude Baldwin at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany. Baldwin led this study with Yasuka Toda from Meiji University in Japan. Sugar is a vital carbohydrate providing lots of energy and may have had far-reaching effects on songbird evolution. Though it is thought that most bird lineages can't taste sweetness at all, the scientists now believe that songbirds, which account for more than 40% of the world's bird species, can actually taste sweet, and that sugary food sources may have contributed to their success. Baldwin and Toda dug down to the molecular level to understand the modifications to the ""umami"" taste receptor that enabled sweet perception among songbirds. ""Because sugar detection is complex, we needed to analyze more than one hundred receptor variants to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the sugar responses,"" says Toda. These exact changes coincide only slightly with those seen in the distantly-related hummingbirds, even though similar areas of the receptor are modified. Though songbirds evolved similar workarounds to taste sweetness, they did so at different times, in different places, and in slightly different ways an example of ""convergent evolution."" Some songbirds, such as honeyeaters, sunbirds, honeycreepers, and flowerpiercers are now just as dependent on nectar as the hummingbirds. ""This study fundamentally changes the way we think about the sensory perceptions of nearly half the world's birds,"" says study co-author Eliot Miller at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. ""It demonstrates that most songbirds definitely can taste sweet and got there by following nearly the same evolutionary path that hummingbirds did it s a neat story about how convergence happens."" Exploring the songbird family tree, the researchers conclude that songbirds evolved to sense sweetness approximately 30 million years ago, before the early ancestors of songbirds left Australia, where all songbirds originated. Even after songbirds radiated across the world, they kept their ability to taste sugar. Researchers in Japan, Germany, the United States, Hong Kong, and Australia participated in this study. Future studies will explore how sweet perception has coevolved with other physiological traits, such as changes in digestion and metabolism, across bird evolution.ReferenceToda Y, Ko M-C, Liang Q, et al.

But what about professional singers? How well do they evaluate their own abilities? And what role does this self-assessment play in becoming a better musician? A research team from the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt, New York University, and the University of Hamburg has now investigated these questions scientifically in a study of professional singers.The study participants, all female sopranos, were each recorded singing  Happy Birthday  in a studio. They were then asked to listen to all of the recordings and rate the pitch accuracy of both their own vocal performances and those of their colleagues. In Western culture, pitch accuracy i.e., singing in tune is associated with acoustic characteristics that can be quantified and thus serves as an objective measure of proficiency.The research team derived a statistical model from the participants  evaluations of others. Using this, they were able to determine how well a singer rated others as well as her own performance.  The results show that the singers were surprisingly inaccurate in their self-assessment. Most overestimated their own performance,  ~ lead author Pauline Larrouy-Maestri of the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics.  In addition, the researchers observed a correlation between singing competence and self-assessment ability: the better the singer (in terms of pitch-accuracy) the better they evaluated themselves. This outcome is surprising since experts in a certain domain usually tend to underestimate their abilities in this domain.The study, the findings of which have just appeared in the Journal of Voice, thus not only underscores the fact that even professional singers do not necessarily evaluate their own vocal performance correctly. But it also suggests that self-evaluation itself may be a key factor in the development of exceptional musical skills.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

So, we asked whether liposome accumulation in tumors depends on which fluorescent label you use,"" Simberg explains. ""It's the first finding of its kind, showing that different lipids have different abilities to accumulate in tumors."" - Dmitri Simberg, PhD To accomplish this, they made liposomes containing two different classes of fluorescent lipids in the same liposome: indocarbocyanine lipids (ICLs) and fluorescent phospholipids (FPLs). Then they injected them into breast cancer and brain cancer mouse models and used fluorescent microscopy and imaging to compare how much of each label accumulated in the tumors.Both types of fluorescent labels initially accumulated in the tumor blood vessels. However, over time, the ICLs continued to accumulate, spreading over a significantly larger tumor area and reaching immune and tumor cells, while the FPLs quickly degraded and disappeared from the tumors.""What we found is that even when injected into the same liposome, ICLs showed remarkable accumulation and extravasation (infiltrating the tumors), while FPLs, though a very similar type of fluorescent group, did not show much extravasation and essentially disappeared,"" Simberg says.""It's the first finding of its kind, showing that different lipids have different abilities to accumulate in tumors,"" he adds.Results could lead to improved liposomal drug deliveryThe team's findings open the door to improved cancer drug-delivery systems.""There is a lot of interest in using lipids as a kind of shuttle to get the drugs into tumors,"" Simberg says. ""It's an exciting opportunity to enhance drug delivery in different tumors, particularly glioma, a type of brain tumor that's especially difficult to penetrate.""Although a lot of labs make liposomes and nanoparticles, there has not been much mechanistic understanding of exactly how they interact with tumors and how they cross the endothelial barrier.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/experiences-can-cause-inheritable-changes-to-an-animals-biology-350744,Experiences Can Cause Inheritable Changes to an Animal s Biology Research suggests that epigenetic changes resulting from environmental stimuli in one generation can have lasting effects on future generations   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Evidence suggests that what happens in one generation diet, toxin exposure, trauma, fear can have lasting effects on future generations. Scientists believe these effects result from epigenetic changes that occur in response to the environment and turn genes on or off without altering the genome or DNA sequence.But how these changes are passed down through generations has not been understood, in part, because scientists have not had a simple way to study the phenomenon. A new study by researchers at the University of Maryland provides a potential tool for unraveling the mystery of how experiences can cause inheritable changes to an animal s biology. By mating nematode worms, they produced permanent epigenetic changes that lasted for more than 300 generations. The research was published on July 9, 2021, in the journal Nature Communications. There's a lot of interest in heritable epigenetics,  said Antony Jose, associate professor of cell biology and molecular genetics at UMD and senior author of the study.  But getting clear answers is difficult. For instance, if I m on some diet today, how does that affect my children and grandchildren and so on? No one knows, because so many different variables are involved. But we ve found this very simple method, through mating, to turn off a single gene for multiple generations. And that gives us a huge opportunity to study how these stable epigenetic changes occur. In the new study, Jose and his team found while breeding nematode worms that some matings led to epigenetic changes in offspring that continued to be passed down through as many generations as the scientists continued to breed them. This discovery will enable scientists to explore how epigenetic changes are passed to future generations and what characteristics make genes susceptible to permanent epigenetic changes.Jose and his team began this work in 2013, while working with nematode worms, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a species often used as a model for understanding animal biology. The scientists noticed that worms bred to carry a gene they called T, which produces fluorescent proteins, sometimes glowed and sometimes didn t. This was puzzling because the glowers and the non-glowers had nearly identical DNA. Everything began when we stumbled upon a rare gene that underwent permanent change for hundreds of generations just by mating. We could have easily missed it,  said Sindhuja Devanapally (Ph.D.  18, biological sciences), a co-lead author of the study who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University.To understand the phenomenon better, the researchers conducted breeding experiments in which only the mother or the father carried the fluorescent gene. The team expected that no matter which parent carried the gene, the offspring would glow. Instead, they found that when the mother carried the fluorescent gene, the offspring always glowed, meaning the gene was always turned on. But when the father carried the gene, the offspring usually weakly glowed or did not glow at all. We found that there are these RNA-based signals controlling gene expression,  Jose said.  Some of these signals silence the gene and some of them are protective signals that prevent silencing. These signals are duking it out as the offspring develop. When the gene comes from the mother, the protective signal always wins, but when the gene comes from the father, the silencing signal almost always wins. When the silencing signal wins, the gene is silenced for good, or for at least 300 generations, which is how long Jose and his colleagues followed their laboratory-bred worms. Previous examples of epigenetic changes were more complex or they did not last more than a couple of generations. The researchers don t yet know why the silencing signal only wins some of the time, but this new finding puts them in a much better position to explore the details of epigenetic inheritance than ever before. While we ve found a set of genes that can be silenced almost permanently, most other genes are not affected the same way,  said the study s other co-lead author, Pravrutha Raman (Ph.D.  19, biological sciences), who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.  After silencing, they bounce back and become expressed in future generations. With their new findings, the researchers now believe some genes could be more vulnerable to permanent epigenetic change while other genes recover within a few generations. Although studies in worms are not the same as in humans, the research provides a window into biological processes that are likely shared, at least in part, by all animals. The two big advantages we now have from this work are that this long-lasting epigenetic change is easy to induce through mating, and that it occurs at the level of a single gene,  Jose said.  Now we can manipulate this gene and control everything about it, which will allow us to determine what characteristics make a gene susceptible or resistant to heritable epigenetic change. Jose and his colleagues expect that future studies may one day help scientists identify human genes that are vulnerable to long-lasting epigenetic changes.Reference: Devanapally S, Raman P, Chey M, et al.

These drugs do not come without side effects, such as lack of immediate therapeutic action, the need for daily doses and the danger of becoming addicted to some of these drugs. That is why scientists continue to work on new therapies to treat depression.In 2019, an international group of researchers co-led by Dr Yousef Tizabe from the Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C., and Professor Jos  Aguilera from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Institut de Neuroci ncies at the Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona (UAB), observed that a non-toxic derivative of the tetanus neurotoxin (Hc-TeTx), which causes tetanus infections, improved depression symptoms in rat animal models. ""One intramuscular dosis of Hc-TeTx made depression symptoms disappear in less than 24 hours, and its effects lasted two weeks"", explains Aguilera. Based on these findings, scientists began to work on discovering the mechanism through which this substance produces these effects. In a recent study coordinated by Professor Aguilera and conducted in collaboration with the research group led by Dr Thomas Scior of the Benem rita Universidad Aut noma de Puebla (BUAP) in Mexico, researchers demonstrated that Hc-TeTx is capable of inhibiting the transport of serotonin within the central nervous system, by binding to neurotrophin receptors, proteins that induce the survival of neurons. These results, published in the journal Molecules, suggest that the drug may not only serve in treating depression, but also be useful in treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).According to researchers, the advantages of introducing Hc-TeTx as a new drug are evident. A biweekly or monthly dosis would allow medical professionals to control the progress. Since it is a recombinant product, there would be no problems with drug safety, production or high costs. Furthermore, in neurodegenerative cases, Hc-TeTx would stop the development of the pathology and at the same time eliminate any disease-related depressions.Researchers recently patented the therapeutic use of Hc-TeTx for the treatment of depression, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and are now looking for investors to be able to conduct clinical trials on humans. ""This is an important advance in science, and even more so now when in addition to the high incidence in depression and alterations in behaviours, we see mental alterations as a result of COVID-19 and the negative environments of stress, self-isolation or fear"", Aguilera concludes.Reference: Candalija A, Scior T, Rackwitz H-R, Ruiz-Castelan JE, Martinez-Laguna Y, Aguilera J.

There is a high risk of kidney cancer returning, following surgery to remove tumours, but there is currently no treatment to help prevent this.The KEYNOTE study involved just under 1000 patients with kidney cancer who had undergone surgery. Half of them were given the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab, or pembro, and the other half a placebo.Pembro is used to treat a number of cancers, including late-stage kidney cancer, where the disease has spread to other organs. The international trial across 20 countries was the first time the drug had been used with patients at an early stage of the disease.The team found that over two years, patients on pembro were a third less likely to see their disease return than those on the placebo. Follow-up with patients is continuing, to determine the impact of the treatment on survival rates over a five-year period.The study also showed that the side effects from the drug were similar to those normally expected with a cancer treatment.Co-investigator on the study, Professor Thomas Powles of Barts Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""This early data from the trial is very promising, with a clear reduction in the disease recurring in patients on pembro. There are signs as well that the drug may improve survival rates, but we can't be sure of that for another few years. We're hopeful that this trial, when complete, will provide a strong case for this drug to be approved for use by the medicines regulator."" ","Published: July 12, 2021"

The scientists suggest this could one day be exploited in the development of new antiviral treatments.On infecting a host, a virus enters cells in order to replicate. For most cells in mammals the first line of protection are proteins, called interferons. Stem cells, however, lack the ability to trigger an interferon response and there has been uncertainty about how they protect themselves.In their study, published in Science, the scientists analysed genetic material from mouse stem cells and found it contains instructions to build a protein, named antiviral Dicer (aviD), which cuts up viral RNA and so prevents RNA viruses from replicating. This form of protection is called RNA interference, which is the method also used by cells in plants and invertebrates.Caetano Reis e Sousa, author and group leader of the Immunobiology Laboratory at the Crick says, ""It's fascinating to learn how stem cells protect themselves against RNA viruses. The fact this protection is also what plants and invertebrates use suggests it might be something that goes far back in mammalian history, right up to when the evolutionary tree spilt. For some reason, while all mammalian cells possess the innate ability to trigger this process, it seems to only be relied upon by stem cells.""By learning more about this process, and uncovering the secrets of our immune system we are hoping to open up new possibilities for drug development as we strive to harness our body's natural ability to fight infection.""In laboratory experiments which exposed engineered human cells to SARS-CoV-2, the virus infected three times fewer stem cells when aviD was present in the cells compared to when the researchers removed this protein.The scientists also grew mini brain organoids from mouse embryonic stem cells and found that, when infected with Zika virus, the organoids with aviD grew more quickly and less viral material was produced than in organoids without this protein. Similarly, when organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2, there were fewer infected stem cells in the organoids with aviD.Enzo Poirier, author and postdoc in the Immunobiology Laboratory at the Crick says, ""Why stem cells use this different mechanism of defence remains a mystery. It might be that the interferon process would cause too much harm to stem cells, so mammals, including humans, have evolved to shield these precious cells from this damage. There is still a lot of uncertainty about how these cells are protected from viruses, which we're excited to explore further.""The researchers will continue this work, creating a mouse model which allows them to further study the effects and importance of aviD in mammalian stem cells.Reference: Poirier EZ, Buck MD, Chakravarty P, et al.

The treatment delivers beta radiation directly to tumour cells, is well tolerated by patients and keeps them alive for longer than standard care, found a phase 3 trial to be presented at the European Association of Urology congress, EAU21, today.Despite progress in medicine in recent years, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains untreatable and fatal. The new treatment, known as Lu-PSMA-617, takes a new approach, targeting a molecule called PSMA, which is known to be increased on the surfaces of the tumour cells, destroying them and their surrounding microenvironment.Professor Johann de Bono, Professor of Experimental Cancer Medicine at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and Professor Ken Herrmann, Director of the Clinic for Nuclear Medicine at University Hospital Essen, Germany, and an international team of researchers set out to see whether Lu-PSMA-617 was more effective than standard care and recruited 831 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer between June 2018 and October 2019. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the treatment plus standard care or standard care alone.They report that the treatment significantly improved survival of patients by an average of four months, compared with standard treatment. Median survival time was 15.3 for the treatment group and 11.3 months for those receiving standard care. Progression-free survival, or the time before a patient s tumour became worse, was also longer with the treatment: a median of 8.7 months compared with 3.4 months for those with standard care.The trial also compared side effects, finding that health-related quality of life was not negatively affected, and the team concludes that it is an effective and safe medicine that can improve standard of care for patients with this advanced prostate cancer.Professor Ken Herrmann says:  This is a completely new therapeutic concept; a precision medicine that delivers radiation directly to a high incidence tumour. The treatment was well tolerated by patients and they had an average of four months  longer survival with good quality of life. Lu-PSMA-617 can improve the lives of many men with advanced prostate cancer and their families. Professor Johann de Bono says:  Our findings show that this potent radioactive medicine can deliver radiation precisely to cancer cells and destroy them, extending patients  lives. I hope men whose tumours have high levels of PSMA can soon benefit from this highly innovative treatment. Currently, the treatment is being appraised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in the NHS in England and Wales. Using the PSMA molecule to directly target prostate cancer cells is the beginning of a new era of precision medicine in urology diagnostics as well as therapy , says Professor Peter Albers, Head of the Department of Urology, Dusseldorf University, and Chair of the Scientific Office of the EAU.  LU-PSMA-617 was tested in so-called end-stage disease and still showed superiority and this paves the way for studies to treat patients in earlier stages. We have seen similar success in the diagnostic setting, using this molecule to improve the way we stage tumours. This targeted approach will revolutionise the way we approach the treatment of men with prostate cancer in the future.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

The mechanisms involved in maintaining this integrity remain unknown. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur and the CNRS today revealed a new process which allows eliminated cells to temporarily protect their neighbors from cell death, thereby maintaining tissue integrity. This protective mechanism is vital, and if disrupted can lead to a temporary loss of connectivity. The scientists observed that when the mechanism is deactivated, the simultaneous elimination of several neighboring cells compromises tissue integrity. This lack of integrity could be responsible for chronic inflammation. Human epithelia are tissues found in several parts of the body (such as the epidermis and internal mucosa). They are composed of layers of contiguous cells that serve as a physical and chemical barrier. This role is constantly being put to the test by both the outside environment and their own renewal. Tissue renewal involves the formation of new cells by cell division and the elimination of dead cells. The mechanisms that regulate the ability of epithelia to maintain their integrity in contexts involving large numbers of eliminated cells remain poorly understood, despite the fact that this situation occurs regularly during embryogenesis or the maintenance of adult tissues. For example, more than ten billion cells can be eliminated every day in an adult intestine. How are these eliminations orchestrated to maintain tissue integrity and connectivity?Scientists from the Institut Pasteur and the CNRS set out to identify the mechanisms involved in epithelial integrity and the conditions that can affect epithelial connectivity by using Drosophila (or vinegar flies), an organism studied in the laboratory with a similar epithelial architecture to humans.Using protein-sensitive fluorescent markers, the research team revealed that when a cell dies, the EGFR-ERK pathway - a cell activation signaling pathway known for its involvement in the regulation of cell survival - is temporarily activated in the neighboring cells. The scientists observed that the activation of the EGFR-ERK pathway protected neighboring cells from cell death for approximately one hour, thereby preventing the simultaneous elimination of a group of cells. ""We already knew that this pathway plays a key role in regulating cell survival in epithelial tissue, but we were surprised to observe such protective dynamics between cells,"" comments Romain Levayer, Head of the Cell Death and Epithelial Homeostasis Unit at the Institut Pasteur and last author of the study.The scientists' research also shows that inhibiting this protective mechanism has a drastic effect on epithelial tissue: cell elimination becomes random and neighboring cells can be eliminated simultaneously, leading to repeated losses of connectivity. The elimination of groups of neighboring cells is never observed in epithelial tissue in normal conditions, when the EGFR-ERK pathway is not deliberately inhibited, even if a large number of cells are eliminated.By using a new optogenetic tool that can control cell death in time and space and bypass the protective mechanism, the scientists confirmed that epithelial integrity was compromised when neighboring cells were eliminated simultaneously. ""Surprisingly, epithelial tissue is highly sensitive to the spatial distribution of eliminated cells. Although it can withstand the elimination of a large number of cells, epithelial integrity is affected if just three neighboring cells are eliminated simultaneously,"" explains L o Valon, a scientist in the Cell Death and Epithelial Homeostasis Unit at the Institut Pasteur and first author of the study.The scientists' observations confirm that tissues need to develop mechanisms preventing the elimination of neighboring groups of cells. ""These observations are important as they illustrate the incredible self-organizing ability of biological tissues, a property that enables them to withstand stressful conditions. So there is no need for a conductor to orchestrate where and when the cells should die; everything is based on highly local communications between neighboring cells,"" adds Romain Levayer.This process seems to have been conserved during evolution. The same protective mechanism based on local EGFR-ERK activation was discovered independently in human cell lines by the research group led by Olivier Pertz at the University of Bern in Switzerland (the results are published in the same journal). The results of the other study suggest that the protective mechanism is conserved between species separated by hundreds of millions of years, indicating that it is a relatively universal mechanism.Future research will reveal whether disruption to this cell death coordination mechanism and repeated loss of connectivity in epithelial tissue could be one of the roots of chronic inflammation, a phenomenon responsible for various diseases that are currently among the leading causes of death worldwide.Reference: Valon L, Davidovi  A, Levillayer F, et al.

""Obviously, you're going to be a better hand-writer if you practice it. But since people are handwriting less then maybe who cares? The real question is: Are there other benefits to handwriting that have to do with reading and spelling and understanding? We find there most definitely are.""The work appears in the journal Psychological Science.Rapp and lead author Robert Wiley, a former Johns Hopkins University PhD student who is now a professor at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, conducted an experiment in which 42 people were taught the Arabic alphabet, split into three groups of learners: writers, typers, and video watchers.Everyone learned the letters one at a time by watching videos of them being written along with hearing names and sounds. After being introduced to each letter, the three groups would attempt to learn what they just saw and heard in different ways. The video group got an on-screen flash of a letter and had to say if it was the same letter they'd just seen. The typers would have to find the letter on the keyboard. The writers had to copy the letter with pen and paper.At the end, after as many as six sessions, everyone could recognize the letters and made few mistakes when tested. But the writing group reached this level of proficiency faster than the other groups a few of them in just two sessions.Next the researchers wanted to determine to what extent, if at all, the groups could generalize this new knowledge. In other words, they could all recognize the letters, but could anyone really use them like a pro, by writing with them, using them to spell new words, and using them to read unfamiliar words?The writing group was better decisively in all of those things.""The main lesson is that even though they were all good at recognizing letters, the writing training was the best at every other measure. And they required less time to get there,"" Wiley said.The writing group ended up with more of the skills needed for expert adult-level reading and spelling. Wiley and Rapp say it's because handwriting reinforces the visual and aural lessons. The advantage has nothing to do with penmanship it's that the simple act of writing by hand provides a perceptual-motor experience that unifies what is being learned about the letters (their shapes, their sounds, and their motor plans), which in turn creates richer knowledge and fuller, true learning, the team says.""With writing, you're getting a stronger representation in your mind that lets you scaffold toward these other types of tasks that don't in any way involve handwriting,"" Wiley said.Although the participants in the study were adults, Wiley and Rapp expect they'd see the same results in children. The findings have implications for classrooms, where pencils and notebooks have taken a backseat in recent years to tablets and laptops, and teaching cursive handwriting is all but extinct.The findings also suggest that adults trying to learn a language with a different alphabet should supplement what they're learning through apps or tapes with good old-fashioned paperwork.Wiley, for one, is making sure the kids in his life are stocked up on writing supplies.""I have three nieces and a nephew right now and my siblings ask me should we get them crayons and pens? I say yes, let them just play with the letters and start writing them and write them all the time. I bought them all finger paint for Christmas and told them let's do letters.""Reference: Wiley RW, Rapp B. The effects of handwriting experience on literacy learning.

He added it will have both diagnostic and therapeutic implications.Nazy is the scientific director of the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory and an associate professor of medicine for the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster.The COVID-19 vaccines using adenoviral vectors, such as those from AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson, are associated with the VITT clotting disorder caused by unusual antibodies to blood platelets that are triggered by the vaccine.The study shows, at a molecular level, how those unusual antibodies stick to components from blood platelets causing them to trigger clot formation.""The antibodies stick to the platelet protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4) in a very unique and specific orientation, which allows them to align with other antibodies and platelets in the precise formation that leads to a self-perpetuating vicious cycle of clotting events,"" said Nazy.""These disease-causing aggregates quickly activate platelets, creating a highly intense clotting environment in patients,"" he added.The dangerous reaction to the adenovirus vector vaccines has been found to occur in one in 60,000 of people receiving the vaccine in Canada.""The intention of our study was to better understand how the severe clots which characterize VITT develop,"" said Donald Arnold, study co-investigator and co-medical director of the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory.""A basic principle of medical care is to understand how the disorder happens and, in doing so, develop better treatments.""John Kelton, co-investigator of the study and co-medical director of the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory, added: ""We believe that this study is important because it clarifies how the clotting ensues, and because we have been able to identify the molecules involved.""The next step is to develop a rapid diagnostic and accurate test to diagnose VITT. Our major interest is now to move upstream from how the clots happen to preventing them from occurring.""Current rapid tests yield false-negative results, and testing relies on more time-consuming tests to confirm VITT. This study now explains why the rapid tests frequently fail and allows for new strategies to improve diagnostic testing.The investigators altered the molecular composition of the PF4 protein and, using this technology, were able to identify the binding region on the protein.Reference: Huynh A, Kelton JG, Arnold DM, Daka M, Nazy I.

It's no one's favorite experience, but the puff is non-invasive and harmless.Scientists use a similar method to test learning and memory in animals and humans. Like Pavlov's classic experiments linking a neutral stimulus with a physiological response, the eyeblink test pairs a light or sound with a quick puff of air to the eye. With repetition, the animal learns to close its eye, or blink, in response to the light or sound only. It's called associative learning, and the response is ruled by a brain region known as the cerebellum.While the eyeblink test has been around since 1922, it had never been attempted in pigs until now. In a new study in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, researchers prove the eyeblink test works in 3-week-old pigs, a model species for nutritional neuroscience research in human infants.""The idea is, if we can improve structural development in the brain through nutritional interventions, it should take pigs fewer trials to learn the rule. We're in the process of assessing the nutrition piece now, but we had to get the test to work first,"" says Ryan Dilger, professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois and co-author on the study.Dilger specializes in the effects of nutrition on the developing brain, with much of his work feeding directly into the infant formula industry. He uses neonatal pigs because, unlike rodents, their brain anatomy and structure, gut physiology, and nutritional requirements are strikingly similar to human infants.Dilger's team typically studies pig brain response to new ingredients through magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, which focuses on the structure and size of various brain regions. They also rely on well-validated behavioral tasks, such as novel object recognition, that reflect activity in the hippocampus and striatum, some of the brain regions related to learning and memory.But Dilger wanted a tool to specifically assess cognitive processing in the cerebellum. That's when he turned to Henk-Jan Boele and Sebastiaan Koekkoek, eyeblink specialists and neuroscientists at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands.Although humans and all sorts of animals have undergone the eyeblink test, the behavioral paradigm had never been validated for pigs.""For human and mouse eyeblink conditioning, we use completely different systems,"" says Boele, a postdoctoral researcher with dual appointments at Erasmus and Princeton University. ""Humans are easy to instruct, usually are very cooperative, and sit still during the experiment, which makes it easy to deliver the puff and measure the eyelid. Mice are mostly head-fixed during the experiment, which makes it easy to deliver the air puff and measure the eyelid. Pigs, instead, were a challenge because we did not want to fixate their head. It was really difficult to reliably deliver the air puff and measure the eyelid responses.""We tried video cameras, diodes, and all kinds of things, to capture the blink. And we had to use a piece of equipment to deliver the air puff that was very close to the eye to avoid any delays. We need really sharp, short puffs that are not invasive for the animal but are still very precisely timed. So that was a challenge,"" he says.The solution was taping a short piece of air tubing next to one eye, and pasting magnetic sensors on the forehead and eyelid to record the blink. The system measured the eyeblink down to the millisecond.And yes, Boele puffed himself in the eye to test out the system. It worked. ""Oh yes, I blinked,"" he laughs.To ensure the pigs had free head movement but didn't get up and run around, the researchers placed them in a custom-built sound-dampening box fitted with a pig-sized hammock.It was apparently very comfy.Sangyun Joung, a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at Illinois and co-author on the study, says, ""Each pig had five days of training to habituate them to the hammock and the testing environment. By day three, they were very relaxed, to the point where some of them were literally falling asleep. That was a little challenge for us during the analysis, because that definitely influenced their responses. But it also told us this whole behavior paradigm is not stressful for them. For us, it was interesting and frustrating at the same time.""Once the pigs were used to the setup, the real work began. The pigs did a series of eight tests in a row. The first was the air puff only, to measure the eyeblink reflex. The next six tests paired a small blue LED light with the air puff. The light came on for half a second, 500 milliseconds, and right at the end, with the light still on, the air puff was delivered. That last part, with both the light on and the air puffing, lasted a tiny 50 milliseconds. The final test was the light only - no puff.The researchers repeated each set of eight tests five times on each of five consecutive days. The time between tests varied a bit to keep the pigs guessing.""It wasn't just on and off, once per second. The system waits until the eye is in a stable place, and then repeats the test at random times so the pigs can't anticipate the puff,"" Dilger says.But they did learn, over the course of the five-day experiment, to anticipate the puff. Pretty soon, pigs were closing their eyes at exactly the 500-millisecond mark during the eighth trial - the one with a light but no puff.""The timing is perfect. If you look at the conditioned eyelid responses, you can see that the eyelid is closed exactly at the moment the puff would have been delivered,"" Boele says. ""Just perfect motor timing, down to the millisecond. That's beautiful.""The research team learned something else about pigs they hadn't known before.""We learned that pigs can just close one eye at a time; they can wink. We weren't sure about that, actually,"" Dilger says. ""But because they are pigs, they will frustrate you all day long. Some pigs would just lay there with their one eye closed, which meant we couldn't use that that particular subject. They're smart creatures.""The eyeblink test specifically targets activity in the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible for making quick, unconscious predictions. These predictions relate to motor responses, such as where to step while you're walking; and cognitive processes, such as predicting what someone is going to say next in a conversation.""The cerebellum is making short-term predictions all the time, continuously. It's essential to interact with our environment. When we think about learning and memory, often we think about really complex cognitive things, but most of our daily life behavior is just smooth, automatic interactions with our environment,"" Boele says. ""In eyeblink conditioning, your cerebellum basically solves the problem for you. You don't have to think about it. It's making this short-term prediction, and that's what we are studying.""Pigs are born with a more developed cerebellum than human babies. That's clear from eyeblink conditioning tests Boele has done with six-to-eight-month-old infants; they don't typically learn the task at that age.Unlike humans, pigs need to be able to make motor and cognitive predictions right away, since they can get up and walk around minutes after birth. When Dilger studies the pig cerebellum using MRI, which focuses mostly on structure, he typically doesn't see much change due to nutritional interventions. That's because the cerebellum is more developed at birth in the pig, which makes them a precocial species. But nutritional changes might alter the functioning of the brain region. That is what the eyeblink test will tell him in future studies.""Often, function follows structure, but not always. Having a nutritional deficiency may show a deficit in eyeblink conditioning, this associative learning task,"" he says. ""We want to be able to use a nutritional intervention as a relatively non-invasive way of understanding cerebellar development here.""Reference: Boele H-J, Joung S, Fil JE, et al.

Now, a research team led by Leonor Saude, group leader at Instituto de Medicina Molecular Joao Lobo Antunes (iMM; Portugal) and Professor at Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, have shown that the administration of drugs that target specific cellular components of this scar, improve functional recovery after injury. The results now published in the scientific journal Cell Reports* set the basis for a new promising therapeutic strategy not only for spinal cord injuries, but potentially for other organs that lack regenerative competence.This study was performed at iMM with collaboration from researchers at CEDOC NOVA Medical School and was funded by ""la Caixa"" Foundation - CaixaResearch Call and Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal).Leonor Saude and her team have been studying spinal cord injury using two different models: the zebrafish, where there is spinal injury recovery, and mammals that show poor recovery. The dense scar that forms at the lesion site has been of particular interest. In mammals, upon spinal cord injury, researchers observed that cells start to accumulate at the lesion periphery. But not any cells: ""These cells are known as senescent cells. They have specific features and markers and are what we can call ""zombie cells"", where growth and division is interrupted, but where the normal cell death program is not activated"", explains Leonor Saude.""While in zebrafish, the accumulation of these cells at the injury periphery is cleared out over time, in mammals, these cells persist and are important components of the dense scar observed. Because senescent cells have specific molecular markers, there are specific drugs that could be tested in this context"", says Diogo Paramos-de-Carvalho, first author of the study. ""With the administration of different senolytic drugs, that specifically target these senescent cells, we have observed a progressive decrease of these cells, a decrease in the scar extension and lower levels of inflammation due to a decreased secretion of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory factors. The observed changes at the molecular level underlie the improved locomotor, sensory and bladder functions that we have also found"", explains Isaura Martins, also first author of the study.""Although we are still far from healing spinal cord injuries in humans, we are learning more about the molecular signatures of these lesions and these new promising results can open new therapeutic strategies that can be applied not only to spinal cord injuries but in other conditions that lack regenerative competence"", says Leonor Saude.Reference: Paramos-de-Carvalho D, Martins I, Crist v o AM, et al.

People affected by Tourette syndrome can often suppress these tics for some time before the urges become overwhelming, and researchers have long wondered at the neural underpinnings of the suppression effort.Now, in a new study using a non-invasive technique to measure brain activity called high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG), researchers at Yale School of Medicine have assessed the impact of tic suppression on functional connectivity between brain regions.The study appears in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, published by Elsevier.""Tic suppression is an important feature of Tourette syndrome. Understanding how someone may temporarily gain control over their tics may inform several research areas in Tourette syndrome. Yet, brain correlates of tic suppression have not been studied extensively, especially in children,"" said Denis Sukhodolsky, PhD, senior author of the study, and Associate Professor at the Yale Child Study Center at the Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.Cameron Carter, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, said of the study, ""Understanding brain mechanisms associated with successful coping in disorders such as Tourette syndrome opens up opportunities for developing targeted treatments to enhance the innate self-control that normally emerges as the brain matures.""The team led by Dr. Sukhodolsky recorded the brain activity of 72 children, aged 8 to 16 years old, with Tourette syndrome using hdEEG, while they were ticcing freely and while they were suppressing their tics. The researchers then assessed connectivity between the different regions in the brain.The authors found that connectivity between multiple brain regions was increased while children suppressed their tics. ""Some of these regions are part of the default mode network, an array of brain regions engaged during internal thought processes such as daydreaming,"" explained first author Simon Morand-Beaulieu, PhD.Additionally, the researchers reported that functional brain connectivity during tic suppression was positively correlated with age, suggesting that the brain networks of tic suppression undergo developmental changes in response to the experience of tics. ""This increase in functional connectivity as children mature is consistent with increasing tic suppression capacities developing into adolescence as well as a better awareness of the sensory phenomena accompanying tics,"" said Dr. Morand-Beaulieu.The study highlights the brain mechanism involved in a temporary decrease in tic frequency, which could have therapeutic implications. ""It will be important to assess whether the same mechanism plays a role in a more structured intervention to decrease tic severity, such as behavioral therapy for Tourette syndrome,"" said Dr. Sukhodolsky.Reference: Morand-Beaulieu S, Wu J, Mayes LC, et al.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/are-biomaterial-vaccines-on-the-horizon-350702,Are Biomaterial Vaccines on the Horizon  Researchers have developed a biomaterial based infection vaccine  ciVAX  that can reprogram the immune system to take action against pathogens  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Current clinical interventions for infectious diseases are facing increasing challenges due to the ever-rising number of drug-resistant microbial infections, epidemic outbreaks of pathogenic bacteria, and the continued possibility of new biothreats that might emerge in the future. Effective vaccines could act as a bulwark to prevent many bacterial infections and some of their most severe consequences, including sepsis. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (DCD), ""each year, at least 1.7 million adults in America develop sepsis. Nearly 270,000 Americans die as a result of sepsis [and] 1 in 3 patients who dies in a hospital has sepsis."" However, for the most common bacterial pathogens that cause sepsis and many other diseases, still no vaccines are available.Now, as reported in Nature Biomedical Engineering, a multi-disciplinary team of researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School for Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) developed a biomaterial-based infection vaccine (ciVAX) approach as a solution that could be broadly applied to this pervasive problem. ciVAX vaccines combine two technologies that are currently in clinical development for other applications, and that together enable the capture of immunogenic antigens from a broad spectrum of pathogens and their incorporation into immune cell-recruiting biomaterial scaffolds. Injected or implanted under the skin, ciVAX vaccines then reprogram the immune system to take action against pathogens.""The protective powers of the vaccines that we have designed and tested so far and the immune responses they stimulated are extremely encouraging, and open up a wide range of potential vaccine applications ranging from sepsis prophylaxis to rapid measures against future pandemic threats and biothreats, as well as new solutions to some of the challenges in veterinary medicine,"" said corresponding author David Mooney, Ph.D, who is a Founding Core Faculty member at the Wyss Institute and leads the Institute's Immuno-Materials Platform. He also the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.In their study, the researchers successfully tested ciVAX technology as a protective measure against the most common causes of sepsis, including Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli strains. Highlighting the technology's potential, they found that a prophylactic ciVAX vaccine, protected all vaccinated mice against a lethal attack with an antibiotic-resistant E. coli strain, while only 9% of unvaccinated control animals survived. In a pig model of septic shock induced by a different human E. coli isolate, a ciVAX vaccine prevented the development of sepsis in all four animals, while four unvaccinated animals developed severe and sudden sepsis within 12 hours. Finally, using an approach that mimicked a ring vaccination protocol in human or animal populations, a CiVax vaccine, when loaded with pathogen-derived material isolated from animals infected with one lethal E.coli strain, was able to cross-protect animals against a different lethal E. coli strain.""Our method captures the majority of glycoprotein (and glycolipid) antigens from the pathogens, and presents these in their native form to the immune system, giving us access to a much larger spectrum of potential antigens than vaccines consisting of single or mixtures of recombinant antigens,"" said co-first author and Wyss Lead Senior Staff Scientist Michael Super, Ph.D. ""ciVAX vaccines against known pathogens can be fabricated and stored, but additionally, all components except the bacterial antigens can be pre-assembled from shelf-stable cGMP products. The complete vaccines can then be assembled in less than an hour once the antigens are available, which gives this technology unique advantages over other vaccine approaches when rapid responses are called for."" Super conceived the ciVAX concept with co-first author Edward Doherty, who as a former Lead Senior Staff Scientist worked with Mooney on the Wyss' Immuno-Material platform on biomaterials-based vaccines for cancer applications.Super and Wyss Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who also authored the study, previously developed the pathogen capture technology used in ciVAX, which is based on a native human pathogen-binding opsonin - Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) - that they fused to the Fc portion of an Immunoglobulin to generate FcMBL. Recombinant FcMBL binds to more than 120 different pathogen species and toxins, including bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. In earlier efforts, the team applied FcMBL to multiple diagnostic problems, and the technology is currently being tested in a clinical trial by the Wyss startup BOA Biomedical as part of a new sepsis treatment.The second technology component of ciVAX component, the biomaterials-based vaccine technology, was developed as a conceptually new type of cancer immunotherapy by Mooney and his group at the Wyss Institute and SEAS, together with clinical collaborators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Validated in a clinical trial in human cancer patients, a specifically designed cancer vaccine stimulated significant anti-tumor immune responses. Novartis is currently working to commercialize the vaccine technology for certain cancer applications, and a related biomaterials-based vaccine approach is being pursued by the Wyss startup Attivare Therapeutics, with Doherty and former Wyss researchers Benjamin Seiler and Fernanda Langellotto, Ph.D., who also co-authored this study, as founding members.To assemble ciVAX vaccines, the team used FcMBL on magnetic beads to capture inactivated bacterial carbohydrate-containing molecules, known as Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), from the pathogen of choice, and then simply mixed the complexes with particles of mesoporous silica (MPS) and immune cell-recruiting and activating factors. Under the skin, MPS forms a permeable, biodegradable scaffold that recruits dendritic cells (DCs) of the immune system, reprograms them to present fragments of the captured PAMPs, and releases them again. The DCs then migrate to nearby draining lymph nodes where they orchestrate a broad immune response against the bacterial pathogen. The team found that ciVAX vaccines rapidly enhanced the accumulation and activation of DCs at injection sites and the numbers of DCs, antibody-producing B cells, and different T cell types in draining lymph nodes, and thereby engineered effective pathogen-directed immune responses.""Beyond the potential of reducing the risk for sepsis in and out of hospitals, our ciVAX vaccine technology has the potential to save the lives of many individuals threatened by a multitude of pathogens, in addition to potentially preventing the spread of infections in animal populations or livestock before they reach humans. It is a terrific example how Wyss researchers from different disciplines and experiences self-assemble around medical problems that urgently need to be solved to create powerful new approaches,"" said Ingber who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at HMS and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A.

However, this heritability changes over time, across seasons and with age. The team also found that several of the microbiome traits heritable in baboons are also heritable in humans.""The environment plays a bigger role in shaping the microbiome than your genes, but what this study does is move us away from the idea that genes play very little role in the microbiome to the idea that genes play a pervasive, if small, role,"" said Elizabeth Archie, professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and a principal investigator on the study who is also affiliated with the Eck Institute for Global Health and the Environmental Change Initiative.The gut microbiome performs several jobs. In addition to helping with food digestion, it creates essential vitamins and assists with training the immune system. This new research is the first to show a definitive connection with heritability.Previous studies on the gut microbiome in humans showed only 5 to 13 percent of microbes were heritable, but Archie and the research team hypothesized the low number resulted from a ""snapshot"" approach to studying the gut microbiome: All prior studies only measured microbiomes at one point in time.In their study, the researchers used fecal samples from 585 wild Amboseli baboons, typically with more than 20 samples per animal. Microbiome profiles from the samples showed variations in the baboons' diets between wet and dry seasons. Collected samples included detailed information about the host, including known descendants, data on environmental conditions, social behavior, demography and group-level diet at the time of collection.The research team found that 97 percent of microbiome traits, including overall diversity and the abundance of individual microbes, were significantly heritable. However, the percentage of heritability appears much lower -- down to only 5 percent -- when samples are tested from only a single point in time, as is done in humans. This emphasizes the significance of studying samples from the same host over time.""This really suggests that in human work, part of the reason researchers haven't found that heritability is because in humans they don't have a decade and half of fecal samples in the freezer, and they don't have all the initial host (individual) information they need to tease these details out,"" said Archie.The team did find evidence that environmental factors influence trait heritability in the gut microbiome. Microbiome heritability was typically 48 percent higher in the dry season than in the wet, which may be explained by the baboons' more diverse diet during the rainy season. Heritability also increased with age, according to the study.Because the research also showed the significant impact of environment on the gut microbiomes in baboons, their findings agreed with previous studies showing that environmental effects on the variation in the gut microbiome play a larger role than additive genetic effects. Combined with their discovery of the genetic component, the team plans to refine its understanding of the environmental factors involved.But knowing that genes in the gut microbiome are heritable opens the door to identifying microbes in the future that are shaped by genetics. In the future, therapies could be tailored for people based on the genetic makeup of their gut microbiome.The Amboseli Baboon Project, started in 1971, is one of the longest-running studies of wild primates in the world. Focused on the savannah baboon, the project is located in the Amboseli ecosystem of East Africa, north of Mount Kilimanjaro. Research teams have tracked hundreds of baboons in several social groups over the course of their entire lives. Researchers currently monitor around 300 animals, but have accumulated life history information on more than 1,500 animals.Reference: Grieneisen L, Dasari M, Gould TJ, et al.

As variable as the cases, so too are the composition of biological matrices in addition to how to identify drugs or other compounds in biological samples. This has provided a vast array of sample preparation approaches that scientist have in their 'toolbox.' ""Our work highlights the variability in sample types that toxicological analysis encompasses as well as vast array of sample preparation techniques that are currently available,"" said corresponding author Sabra R. Botch-Jones, MS, MS, MA, assistant professor of anatomy and neurobiology at BUSM.According to the researchers, the choice of biological matrix is dependent on the anticipated answer the toxicologist is trying to get. Is suspected drug use recent? If so, a blood or oral fluid sample may be best to assess the drugs present and how much is in the sample. In cases of driving while impaired, it is essential to obtain a sample that is appropriate to assess if the drug effected the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. When drugs are used, the human body will break down, or metabolize, the drug and eventually excrete it. Drugs and their metabolites may be excreted or removed from the body over a course of hours and even days. For example, if there has been a delay in obtaining a sample or reporting a crime in which drugs are suspected, a urine sample may be best. If extensive amounts of time have elapsed, a hair sample may be a viable option to determine exposure to a suspected drug or other compound.As with the instrumentation, sample preparation tools have also advanced over time. Solid phase and, more recently supported liquid extraction, allows the unwanted materials in the biological sample to be retained on a solid surface composed of natural materials such as silica or diatomaceous earth. These extraction tools can provide clean extracts containing the drugs of interest and help to recover a large variety of drugs, which can aid in laboratory efficiency when dealing with poly-drug cases.""Researchers have a number of biological samples to choose from when trying to identify what substances may be in the human body, however it important that they choose the right one to help answer their research question. As equally important is the choice of how to prepare the sample for analysis. This work provides an overview of the routine biological samples, their components, and ways to process them for downstream analysis,"" explains Botch-Jones.Reference: Jones S, McGowan C, Boyle S, Ke Y, Chan CHM, Hwang H.

The 15 existing drugs identified by the researchers have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other purposes, providing the possibility of clinical trials that could begin sooner than is typical, according to the researchers.In addition, the experiments yielded seven drugs that may be useful for treating faulty proteins linked to Parkinson's disease, six for stroke and one for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The new study, funded by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is published July 8 in the journal Nature Neuroscience.Scientists have worked for decades to develop treatments for Alzheimer's by targeting genes rooted in the disease process but have had little success. That approach has led to several dead ends because many of those genes don't fundamentally alter proteins at work in the brain. The new study takes a different approach, by focusing on proteins in the brain, and other tissues, whose function has been altered.""In this study, we used human samples and the latest technologies to better understand the biology of Alzheimer's disease,"" said principal investigator Carlos Cruchaga, PhD, the Reuben Morriss III Professor of Neurology and a professor of psychiatry. ""Using Alzheimer's disease samples, we've been able to identify new genes, druggable targets and FDA-approved compounds that interact with those targets to potentially slow or reverse the progress of Alzheimer's.""The scientists focused on protein levels in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma of people with and without Alzheimer's disease. Some of the proteins were made by genes previously linked to Alzheimer's risk, while others were made by genes not previously connected to the disease. After identifying the proteins, the researchers compared their results to several databases of existing drugs that affect those proteins.""They are FDA-approved, and all of the safety data on the drugs is available,"" said Cruchaga, . ""With what is already known about the safety of these drugs, we may be able to jump directly to clinical trials.""Cruchaga said the team's focus on protein levels in key tissues has certain advantages over prior efforts to identify genes linked to Alzheimer's.""The classic genetic studies of Alzheimer's have attempted to correlate genetic mutations with disease, but we know that genes carry the instructions to build proteins and that diseases such as Alzheimer's occur when those protein levels get too high or too low,"" Cruchaga explained. ""To understand the biology of Alzheimer's disease, we should look at proteins rather than only at genes.""As an example, Cruchaga pointed to the APOE gene, which was first linked to Alzheimer's risk decades ago. But even after all this time, it still has not clear how that gene contributes to the disease.""In this study, we were able to see that APOE alters levels of several proteins in brain tissue and CSF,"" Cruchaga said. ""We also saw changes in proteins linked to another gene called TREM2 that was associated with Alzheimer's risk more recently. Understanding how the protein levels are affected by these risk genes is helping us to identify pathways that lead to disease.""Past research has helped identify about 50 genetic signals linked to Alzheimer's, but only a handful of the genes responsible for those signals have been found. Cruchaga said that focusing on protein levels in tissue may help reveal what's happening with the other 40-plus genetic signals that appear to be connected to Alzheimer's risk.The researchers analyzed proteins and genes from brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma from samples gathered from 1,537 people in the U.S. The samples are stored at the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University. Half of the samples came from people with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease; the other half came from study participants who are considered cognitively normal.The researchers measured protein levels in the samples from the brain, CSF and plasma. Using statistical techniques, they then connected the protein levels to disease. There were 274 proteins linked to disease in study subjects' CSF, 127 in blood plasma and 32 in brain tissue.They applied those findings and machine learning techniques to distinguish among the protein differences and zero in on some of the proteins that contribute to damage that leads to Alzheimer's.""We have targets -- although I'm not saying all of these targets are going to work or that all of the compounds we identified are going to stop the progress of the disease -- but we have a real hypothesis,"" Cruchaga said. ""And we expect it may be possible to move from these genetic studies into real clinical trials quickly. That's a big jump.""Reference: Yang C, Farias FHG, Ibanez L, et al.

It is one of very few archaeological sites dated to 250,000 to 350,000 in southern Africa, a time period associated with the earliest appearance of communities with the genetic signatures of Homo sapiens.This new research supports other evidence, from fossil animal bones, that past communities in the region lived among grazing herds of wildebeest, zebra, small antelope, hippos, baboons and extinct species of Megalotragus priscus and Equus capensis, and hunted these alongside other carnivores, hyena and lions.After this period of equitable climate and environment the eggshell evidence - and previous finds from the site - suggests after 200,000 years ago cooler and wetter climates gave way to increasing aridity. A process of changing wet and dry climates recognised as driving the turnover and evolution of species, including Homo sapiens.The study, published in the South African Archaeological Bulletin, shows that extracting isotopic data from ostrich eggshells, which are commonly found on archaeological sites in southern Africa, is a viable option for open-air sites greater than 200,000 years old. The technique which involves grinding a small part of the eggshell, to a powder allows experts to analyse and date the shell, which in turn gives a fix on the climate and environment in the past.Using eggshell to investigate past climates is possible as ostriches eat the freshest leaves of shrubs and grasses available in their environment, meaning eggshell composition reflects their diet. As eggs are laid in the breeding season across a short window, the information found in ostrich eggshell provides a picture of the prevailing environment and climate for a precise period in time.Bundu Farm, where the eggshell was recovered is a remote farm 50km from the nearest small town, sitting within a dry semi-desert environment, which supports a small flock of sheep. The site was first excavated in the late 1990's the site with material stored at the McGregor Museum, Kimberley (MMK). The study helps fill a gap in our knowledge for this part of South Africa and firmly puts the Bundu Farm site on the map.Philip Kiberd, who led the study, said: ""This part of South Africa is now extremely arid, but thousands of years ago it would have been Eden-like landscape with lakes and rivers and abundant species of flora and fauna. Our analysis of the ostrich eggshell helps us to better understand the environments in which our ancestors were evolving and provides an important context in which to interpret the behaviours and adaptations of people in the past and how this ultimately led to the evolution of our species'.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The research team suggested the strategy for virtual screening with greatly reduced false positives by incorporating pre-docking filtering based on shape similarity and post-docking filtering based on interaction similarity. This strategy will help develop therapeutic medications for COVID-19 and other antiviral diseases more rapidly. This study was reported at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).Researchers screened 6,218 drugs from a collection of FDA-approved drugs or those under clinical trial and identified 38 potential repurposed drugs for COVID-19 with this strategy. Among them, seven compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells. Three of these drugs, emodin, omipalisib, and tipifarnib, showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in human lung cells, Calu-3.Drug repurposing is a practical strategy for developing antiviral drugs in a short period of time, especially during a global pandemic. In many instances, drug repurposing starts with the virtual screening of approved drugs. However, the actual hit rate of virtual screening is low and most of the predicted drug candidates are false positives.The research group developed effective filtering algorithms before and after the docking simulations to improve the hit rates. In the pre-docking filtering process, compounds with similar shapes to the known active compounds for each target protein were selected and used for docking simulations. In the post-docking filtering process, the chemicals identified through their docking simulations were evaluated considering the docking energy and the similarity of the protein-ligand interactions with the known active compounds.The experimental results showed that the virtual screening strategy reached a high hit rate of 18.4%, leading to the identification of seven potential drugs out of the 38 drugs initially selected.""We plan to conduct further preclinical trials for optimizing drug concentrations as one of the three candidates didn't resolve the toxicity issues in preclinical trials,"" said Woo Dae Jang, one of the researchers from KAIST.""The most important part of this research is that we developed a platform technology that can rapidly identify novel compounds for COVID-19 treatment.

In addition, the team looked at modifications of the medication called hymecromone, deeming them promising for anti-fibrotic drugs, too. Published in Glycobiology, the study also sheds light on the possible mechanism of action of the investigated compounds, all of which inhibit the synthesis of hyaluronic acid.Hyaluronic acid is an important biological compound that is a key component of the connective tissue enveloping the cells of all other tissue types in animals. Among other things, it is involved in wound repair. The human body is 0.02% HA by weight.HA is used in medicine and cosmetology   in skin care products, wrinkle fillers, eye drops, and injections for joint problems. In the body, HA is naturally produced by an enzyme called hyaluronic acid synthase, or HAS. ","Published: July 9, 2021"

They harbor diverse microbial communities thought to make up 80 percent of the ecosystem s biomass. Many of the microbial species, families and taxa are unknown to science. The cultivation strategy was developed by a team of KAUST researchers, including Fatmah Sefrji and Ramona Marasco.  Red Sea mangroves are particularly interesting because they represent an extreme and unique version of mangrove environments that are exposed to stressful conditions, including high temperatures, salinity and oligotrophy,  says Sefrji.  These environmental stresses exert a strong selective force on the mangrove s microbial communities and so favor the presence of unique species and families.  The team s key challenge was to recreate the mangrove environment in the lab so that they could grow the bacteria in their natural setting. They moved portions of the mangrove sediment and seawater to lab-based growth chambers because in artificial media, it is nearly impossible to reproduce all the molecules, such as nutrients and vitamins, and the molecular cross-communication that are necessary for healthy microbial growth.  It is difficult to successfully cultivate so-called  microbial dark matter  the environmental microorganisms that are unknown to science and have never been cultured before,  says Marasco.  There are so many molecules and parameters important for the growth of a given microbial species from a particular setting.  Once the growth chambers were set up, the team cultivated the resident microbial communities by feeding them regularly with nutrients taken from the natural mangrove environment. They then analyzed the genotypes and phenotypes of selected bacterial isolates, discovering a series of new species, and even taxa. Two papers highlight the first two organisms new to science, the bacterium Mangrovivirga cuniculi (new family Mangrovivirgaceae) and a new bacterial strain called Kaustia mangrovi.  Both organisms grow in the presence of relatively high salinity and temperature and in the pH range typical of mangrove sediment on the Red Sea,  says Sefrji.  Despite their similar physiology, each bacterial isolate showed unique physical and biochemical characteristics, confirmed also by the analysis of their genomes.  The researchers hope the identification of these organisms will contribute to a wider understanding of mangroves and provide insight into effective ways of protecting these unique ecosystems, particularly in light of climate change. The ability to cultivate Red Sea mangrove bacteria at scale could have significant implications, and not just for mangroves themselves.  Cultivating members of a microbial community adapted to the variable and harsh conditions of the Red Sea may represent an important source of metabolites and enzymes for future biotechnological applications,  says Marasco.  For example, bacteria that promote plant growth could boost mangrove seedling establishment, while others could confer salt tolerance to cereal crops. We are actively characterizing our novel strains for such capacities. ReferenceSefrji F et al.

That is one of the findings of TecnATox (Centre for Environmental, Food and Toxicological Technology), a joint research group from the URV and the Pere Virgili Health Research Institute (IISPV), which has analysed the presence of arsenic and various heavy metals in sushi. The consumption of sushi has increased significantly since the start of the 21st century, as has the number of restaurants offering it throughout the region. Although eating fish is recommended because of its high nutritional value, it can also lead to exposure to contaminants, such as heavy metals. Likewise, rice is a food that provides many nutrients and fibre and is low in fat, but it too can be source of pollutants such as arsenic.The research group analysed the concentrations of various toxic elements (cadmium, nickel, lead, mercury, inorganic arsenic and methylmercury) and iodine in a hundred pieces of sushi, specifically those known as sashimi (raw fish), maki (a seaweed roll stuffed with rice, raw fish or other ingredients) an nigiri (balls of rice with fish or seafood on top). The researchers also calculated dietary exposure to all of these contaminants in various population groups (infants, adolescents and adults) and evaluated the risks to health. The main results show a significantly higher concentration of inorganic arsenic in maki and nigiri, compared to sashimi, a finding associated with the presence of rice. They also show higher levels of mercury and methylmercury in sushi that contains tuna due to the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of this metal. The research group also wanted to determine how consumption of this foodstuff varied in different groups of the population. They examined an average intake of 8 pieces of sushi in adults and adolescents and an average intake of 3 pieces in infants and found an increase in exposure to nickel and lead, although this remained within safe established levels.  The most worrying finding concerns methylmercury, a highly neurotoxic compound, for which there was an estimated exposure of 0.242  g per kg of bodyweight in adolescents, a value higher than the safe daily limit established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) , explained Montse Marqu s, one of the researchers who worked on the study. By the same token, although not as high as in adolescents, the exposure levels calculated for adults and infants also suggest a relatively high intake of methylmercury. Finally, the results were analysed as a whole to determine which combinations of sushi do not represent a risk.  We recommend that people combine 8 pieces of salmon-based maki, nigiri or sashimi or maki containing unagi (eel) and limit their consumption of any type of sushi containing tuna , warned Marqu s. The researchers stressed that the amounts of sushi analysed constitute only one of the five recommended meals a day. This means that the consumption of other foods throughout the day may also lead to exposure to certain toxic elements, such as arsenic (present in rice and rice-based foods), mercury (present in tuna and swordfish) or nickel (present in vegetables, pulses and cereals). Due to its nutritional benefits, the researchers still recommend the consumption of sushi, but they also stress the need to do so in moderation in order to minimise the intake of certain food toxins.ReferenceGonz lez N, Correig E, Marmelo I, et al.

Today, it also increasingly focuses on the value of live whales for planetary health. A new workshop report confirms the great ecological value of whales to help mitigate climate change, transport nutrients, enhance marine productivity, and promote biodiversity in marine ecosystems.The world s leading experts gathered for a three-day workshop in April that was co-hosted by the IWC and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The meeting came in response to a 2016 IWC resolution, introduced by the government of Chile, to compile scientific information about the ecological roles of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). The workshop discussions focused on a number of primary ecosystem functions of cetaceans: nutrient transport both in the water column and between their foraging and breeding grounds, the impact of  whale falls  (when whales die and sink to the seafloor) on biodiversity and carbon storage, and the role of cetaceans as predators and prey. A series of expert presentations provided compelling evidence of the multi-faceted and beneficial impacts of cetaceans on marine ecosystems, such as their contribution to ocean productivity through their excrement (which can impact fishing yields) and their large bodies acting as carbon sinks (which can contribute to combating climate change). ""It is meaningful that the commission embraced the principles of the resolution that we proposed in 2016 for the protection of these marine mammals,  said Jose Fernandez, Chilean commissioner to the IWC.  It is a strong recognition   of a permanent and visionary nature   about the need and obligation of our society to strengthen an ethical imperative. Its effects will translate into an instrument of enormous effectiveness for the protection and sustainable use of marine resources and ocean ecosystems, as well as to tackle the harmful effects of climate change.   Scientific evidence demonstrating the valuable role of cetaceans as ecosystem engineers, including their ability to sequester carbon and enhance biodiversity, is expanding each day,  said Dr. Joe Roman, a conservation biologist at the Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont and the lead author of a primary report prepared for the workshop.  It is critical that the IWC and its members consider this evidence as part of their ongoing efforts to manage and recover cetacean populations.  The workshop highlighted how commercial whaling has contributed to the slaughter of nearly 3 million whales in the 20th century alone, significantly diminishing the animals  ability to mitigate climate change. As some whale populations have recovered following decades of protection, they have resumed their role in helping fix and store carbon. However, that beneficial role continues to be hindered by other threats to cetaceans, particularly bycatch in fishing gear.  Commercial whaling not only caused the extinction or near extinction of several whale populations, but it also resulted in the catastrophic loss of their ecosystem benefits,  said Sue Fisher, marine animal consultant for the Animal Welfare Institute.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past and, for the sake of the whales and ocean health, end commercial whaling once and for all.   As the world grapples with the dire consequences of climate change, it is imperative that all solutions   large and small   are considered to mitigate these threats,  said Steven Lutz, senior program officer and blue carbon lead at GRID-Arendal, a United Nations Environment Programme partner based in Norway.  Protecting cetaceans is essential to promoting oceanic blue carbon as a nature-based solution to our changing climate, and it s time for the governments of the world to recognize this important value at the United Nations climate change conference in November.   The decimation of cetacean populations over the last 200 years has knocked the marine ecosystem out of balance,  said Astrid Fuchs, policy manager at Whale and Dolphin Conservation.  We now know that by helping whale and dolphin populations recover, they can help to heal the ocean as part of a nature-based solution to climate and ecological emergencies. For this to happen, the IWC and its member countries must urgently strengthen protections for cetaceans, reducing the risks from bycatch, whaling, pollution and ship strikes, and creating safe places for them to live and breed.   During the last five decades (i.e., within a whale species  life expectancy), humans have come to learn about their intelligence, social complexities, and whale culture. Now, science reveals more and more about their important role for a healthy ocean and nature-based solution to climate change,  said Fabienne McLellan, co-director of international relations at OceanCare focusing to end direct hunts.  While whales became THE symbol for the environmental movement in the 1970s, they should be truly treated as THE symbol for our ocean as our life-support system. We need to protect them with all our efforts, as our life depends on them. ReferenceIWC. Report of the IWC-CMS Workshop on Cetacean Ecosystem Functioning, virtual 19-21 April 2021. IWC; 2021.

In mammals, every cell expresses two of its forms, beta-actin and gamma-nonmuscle-actin. Despite having distinct roles, the two forms are nearly identical, sharing 99% of their amino acid sequence.Research by Anna Kashina of Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine and colleagues has shown that, contrary to scientific dogma, it's not the slight differences in amino acid sequence that govern these proteins' discrete functions in the cell. Rather, their nucleotide sequences--the ""letters"" that make up their DNA coding sequence, which differ by roughly 13% between the two forms--are responsible for their individual roles in organisms' survival and cell migration.And in a new study the researchers offer an explanation for why: Beta-actin mRNA is translated into protein faster than gamma-actin. Both forms help cells move, but beta-actin's faster rate seems to cause cell to affix to a substrate more strongly, slowing down cell movement.""On a global, philosophical level, this expands our understanding of genetic code,"" says Kashina, a professor of biochemistry at Penn Vet and the senior author on the study, which was published in the journal eLife. ""We used to believe that the role of the nucleotides was to encode amino acids, but now we see that, actually, proteins with the same amino acid sequence have different translation rates, and that makes a difference in their function.""Kashina uses the term ""silent code"" to refer to the influence of these nucleotide differences. In earlier work, her team showed that, in mice, editing the amino acid sequence but maintaining the silent nucleotide code could cause gamma-actin to behave like beta-actin in the body. Normally, mice lacking beta-actin would die before birth, but the researchers showed that performing gene editing to the beta-actin gene so it had the same amino acid sequence as gamma-actin kept mice alive thanks to the nucleotide differences.A finding from an earlier paper, also published in eLife, motivated the new work. In that earlier study the researchers found that beta-actin RNA had a much higher density of ribosomes than that of gamma-actin. Ribosomes are crucial to the synthesis of protein from RNA, leading the scientists to hypothesize that this difference in protein translation rate could be responsible for the different functions between gamma and beta-actin.To test their idea, they used cell lines to express only the coding sections of beta- and gamma-actin in mouse cells, as well as their edited versions: the beta-actin that had been edited to have the same amino acid sequence as gamma-actin and vice versa for gamma-actin.When put to the test in a wound-healing experiment, the researchers found that the nucleotide sequence was paramount in determining the speed at which actin facilitated cell movement. Cells expressing only the typical beta-actin migrated at typical rates, but gamma-actin-expressing cells moved twice as fast. The cells containing edited versions of actin proved that this difference is nucleotide-sequence dependent. Beta-actin edited to have the amino acid sequence of gamma moved like gamma-actin-expressing cells, and those with gamma-actin edited to have the amino acid sequence of beta-actin moved at the rate of beta-actin-expressing cells.These results surprised the researchers since they expected the higher density of ribosomes in beta-actin mRNA could support faster translation and thus faster movement. And, indeed, when they measured the rate of translation on a single-molecule level, they found that translation occurs about twice as fast for beta-actin as for gamma-actin.""We expected that faster translation would mean faster movement,"" Kashina says, ""and that's not what we found. It took us a long time to explain why.""What they eventually discovered, was that although the subunits of beta-actin could be supplied faster than those of gamma-actin, that speed worked to the detriment of cell migration speed.""We found that the faster you supply it, the better the cell attaches to the substrate,"" Kashina says. ""It creates proper traction, which is essential for normal migration. And if you don't supply it fast enough the cell can't attach properly and starts sliding. So that explained our seemingly counterintuitive results.""Kashina and colleagues plan to continue to probe the role of the nucleotide sequence, including why evolutionary forces led to the production of such similar forms of actin and whether the ""silent code"" is at work in other proteins.""We think this is part of a bigger story,"" Kashina says. ""We believe actins are not the only proteins that behave this way. There are a number of protein families in the human genome that contain highly similar proteins encoded by different genes. This silent code could be at play in those families as well.""Reference: Vedula P, Kurosaka S, MacTaggart B, et al.

Playing back past events in our minds, however, is not like playing back a video recording. Recollections of locations, dates, and companions can become muddled with the passage of time. If a suspect's memories are out of line with documented events, a once-plausible alibi can crumble and may be seen as evidence of guilt.To put people's memories of past whereabouts to the test, a team of researchers tracked the locations of 51 volunteers for one month and found that their recollections were wrong approximately 36% of the time.""This is the first study to examine memory for where an event happened,"" said Simon J. Dennis, director of the Complex Human Data Hub at the University of Melbourne's School of Psychological Sciences and lead author of the study, which was published in the journal Psychological Science. ""We were able to use experience-sampling methods to actually examine people's memories and analyze what is affecting memory error in their everyday life.""In the study, an app on the participants' smartphones continuously (and securely) recorded their locations and surroundings via GPS. The app also made sound recordings of the environment every 10 minutes. Participants had the freedom to turn off the app or to delete events--a mechanism designed to protect privacy.At the end of the month, the participants received a memory test in which they were given a time and date and then asked to select one of four markers on Google Maps to show where they had been at that moment.The results revealed that participants tended to confuse days across weeks. They also often confused weeks in general and hours across days. The participants had the poorest recall when memories of one event become entwined with memories of a similar experience, such as filling up a car with gas at a different location of the same gas-station chain.Additionally, the researchers found that people tended to confuse places they had visited at similar times or locations, such as multiple bars visited in one evening. People also made mistakes--although less frequently--when events involved similar sounds or movement patterns, such as when they had walked through town on different days while listening to their favorite music.""This has implications for alibi generation, as jurors tend to assume that a suspect who is wrong is lying,"" said Dennis.

But fellas, if we told you there was one drastic step you could take to increase your lifespan, would you do it?In a study published today in eLife , University of Otago researchers along with collaborators from the United States, have shown that castration of male sheep delays aging of DNA compared to intact males, and that it also drives feminine characteristics of DNA and the chemical tags it holds, known as DNA methylation.""Both farmers and scientists have known for some time that castrated male sheep live on average much longer than their intact counterparts; however, this is the first time anyone has looked at DNA to see if it also ages slower,"" says first-author of the study, University of Otago Anatomy PhD student Victoria Sugrue.In order to do this, the researchers first had to generate an 'epigenetic clock' from large numbers of sheep so they could measure DNA aging. They then looked at the epigenetic clock of castrated and intact males and found their 'ticking rate' is different; meaning that the longer lives of castrated sheep, or 'wethers' as they are referred to by farmers, is reflected in their DNA.Underpinning this study is the rapid development of tools to study DNA aging. Recently it has become possible to estimate the age of humans and other mammals using only DNA and epigenetic clocks.Inventor of the epigenetic clock and study co-author, Professor Steve Horvath, from the University of California in Los Angeles explains; ""We developed a way to measure biological age in a broad range of mammals - we have looked at over 200 species so far and discovered surprising commonality in which animals age. But the sheep study was unique in that it specifically isolated the effects of male hormones on aging.""Dr Tim Hore, research team co-leader and Senior Lecturer at Otago's Department of Anatomy, says the study's findings provide new avenues to understand the mechanism of male-accelerated aging.""We found that males and females have very different patterns of DNA aging in sheep; and that despite being male, the castrates (wethers) had very feminine characteristics at specific DNA sites.

Now, in a paper published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine have announced another accidentally discovered, potentially game-changing treatment   one that may provide an alternative immune-based solution to the danger of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.And like Fleming s surprise finding, the bacterium of note is once again S. aureus  but this time, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the life-threatening strain unharmed by methicillin and other antibiotics, and better known by its acronym, MRSA.The paper s senior author, Lloyd Miller, M.D., Ph.D., former professor of dermatology, infectious diseases and orthopaedic surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and now with Janssen Research and Development, says the research team was originally intending to study the mechanisms behind MRSA skin infections in mice with and without the ability to manufacture interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 ). This protein, transformed into its active form by enzymes called caspases, enhances protective immunity by helping immune cells called neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages fight bacterial infections. We gave the mice a blocker of all caspases [pancaspase inhibitor], a compound known as Q-VD-OPH, thinking it would leave both sets of mice more vulnerable to MRSA infection,  Miller says.  To our surprise, blocking caspases had the opposite effect, resulting in a rapid and remarkable clearing of the MRSA bacteria by keeping the immune cells alive and boosting their protective function. Sensing they might have accidentally uncovered a means of fighting bacterial  superbugs,  Miller and his colleagues conducted their latest study to confirm the unexpected finding was not a fluke.The results were encouraging. A single oral dose of Q-VD-OPH decreased the size of MRSA skin lesions and rapidly cleared the bacteria compared with vehicle-treated [given the carrier solution without Q-VD-OPH] and untreated mice,  says study lead author Martin Alphonse, Ph.D., a dermatology postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  And surprisingly, the treatment worked whether IL-1  was present or not   and without administering any antibiotics. The researchers, says Alphonse, found that the pancaspase inhibitor reduces apoptosis   one of three main methods the body uses to remove worn-out or damaged cells   of neutrophils and monocytes, leaving them in plentiful numbers and better able to remove MRSA bacteria. It s like a fire department where older firetrucks are kept operating to help put out blazes, when otherwise, they would have been taken out of service,  says Miller.The researchers also saw enhanced necroptosis   a second controlled cell death process similar to apoptosis   of macrophages, which are mature monocytes. The destruction of macrophages by necroptosis releases large amount of tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, a protein that triggers bacteria-fighting immune cells to swarm into an infected area of skin,  says Alphonse.Finally, the researchers tested whether Q-VD-OPH in mice could have broader activity against two other dangerous skin bacteria, Streptococcus pyogenes (the cause of multiple diseases, including scarlet fever, necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (often a threat to hospitalized patients on ventilators, with catheters or suffering wounds from surgery or burns). The targeting of the body s immune system against bacteria via pancaspase inhibition   referred to as  host-directed immunotherapy    proved just as successful as it had been for MRSA. It was an accidental finding by Alexander Fleming that led to the golden age of antibiotics, but now that s nearing the end because of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,  says Miller.  It seems fitting that another surprise in the lab could be the start of a second golden age, the use of host-directed immunotherapy.

The study is the first to use polysomnography techniques, which measure brain activity, to assess how school-based mindfulness training changes children s sleep. The curriculum taught children how to relax and manage stress by focusing their attention on the present, but it did not instruct them on how to get more sleep. The children who received the curriculum slept, on average, 74 minutes more per night than they had before the intervention,  said the study s senior author, Ruth O Hara, PhD, a sleep expert and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford.  That s a huge change. Rapid eye movement sleep, which includes dreaming and helps consolidate memories, also lengthened in children who learned the techniques. They gained almost a half an hour of REM sleep,  said O Hara, the Lowell W. and Josephine Q. Berry Professor.  That s really quite striking. There is theoretical, animal and human evidence to suggest it s a very important phase of sleep for neuronal development and for the development of cognitive and emotional function.

Poor self-control may not be the only factor behind your choice, new research suggests. That's because our brains process taste information first, before factoring in health information, according to new research from Duke University.""We spend billions of dollars every year on diet products, yet most people fail when they attempt to diet,"" said study co-author Scott Huettel, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke. ""Taste seems to have an advantage that sets us up for failure.""""For many individuals, health information enters the decision process too late (relative to taste information) to drive choices toward the healthier option.""The new paper, which appears July 5 in Nature Human Behaviour, describes the advantage taste has over healthfulness in the decision-making process.""We've always assumed people make unhealthy choices because that's their preference or because they aren't good at self-control,"" said study co-author Nicolette Sullivan. ""It turns out it's not just a matter of self-control. Health is slower for your brain to estimate - it takes longer for you to include that information into the process of choosing between options.""The research was undertaken when Sullivan was a postdoctoral associate at Duke. She is now an assistant professor of marketing at the London School of Economics and Political Science.For the study, Sullivan and Huettel recruited 79 young adults of a median age of 24.4 years. Study participants were asked to fast for four hours before the experiment to ensure they arrived hungry.Participants were asked to rate snack foods on their tastiness, healthfulness and desirability. They were then presented with pairs of foods and asked to choose between them - and the researchers timed their choices.At the end of the experiment, participants were offered one of the foods they had chosen.Study participants registered taste information early in their decision process - taking about 400 milliseconds on average to incorporate taste information. Participants took twice as long to incorporate information about a snack's healthfulness into their decisions.That may not sound like much time. In many cases though, it's enough to alter the choice we make.""Not every decision is made quickly - house purchases, going to college - people take time to make those choices,"" Huettel said. ""But many decisions we make in the world are fast - people reach for something in the grocery store or click on something online.""The authors say their findings could apply to other choices, not just food. For instance, some financial decisions, such as saving and spending choices, may also be affected by how - and when - the brain processes different types of information.Meanwhile, all is not lost in the war against junk food cravings.Half of study participants received a blurb before the experiment, stressing the importance of eating healthy. Those participants were less likely to choose an unhealthy snack.The authors also identified something simple that can help people with their food choices: slowing down the decision-making process.When study participants took longer to consider their options, they tended to pick healthier ones.""There may be ways to set up environments so people have an easier time making healthy choices,"" Huettel said.

All three of these viral diseases are spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Lancet Planetary Health published the research, led by Gonzalo Vazquez-Prokopec, associate professor in Emory University s Department of Environmental Sciences. The study provides a risk-stratification method to more effectively guide the control of diseases spread by Aedes aegypti.  Our results can help public health officials to do targeted, proactive interventions for emerging Aedes-borne diseases,  Vazquez-Prokopec says.  We re providing them with statistical frameworks in the form of maps to guide their actions.  The study encompassed data for 2008 through 2020 from cities in southern Mexico with a high burden of dengue fever cases during that period, along with cases of the more recently emerged diseases of Zika and chikungunya. The cities included Acapulco, Merida, Veracruz, Cancun, Tapachula, Villahermosa, Campeche, Iguala and Coatzacoalcos. The results found a 62 percent overlap of hot spots for dengue and Zika and 53 percent overlap for cases of dengue and chikungunya. In addition, dengue hot spots between 2008 and 2016 were significantly associated with dengue hotspots detected between 2017 and 2020 in five of the nine cities. The work builds on a previous study of the spatial-temporal overlap of the three diseases, focused on Merida, a city of one million located in the Yucatan Peninsula. That study showed that nearly half of Merida s dengue cases from 2008 to 2015 were clustered in 27 percent of the city. These dengue hot spots contained 75 percent of the first chikungunya cases reported during the outbreak of that disease in 2015 and 100 percent of the first Zika cases reported during the Zika outbreak of 2016.  In this latest paper, we ve expanded our analysis in scope and geography and shown that the findings are consistent across these nine cities of different sizes and in different regions,  Vazquez-Prokopec says.  We ve confirmed that dengue, Zika and chikungunya outbreaks tend to concentrate in small areas of a city, and that these hot spots are predictive of where future cases will concentrate.  Mosquito control efforts generally involve outdoor spraying that covers broad swaths of a city, but the Aedes aegypti mosquito has adapted to live inside houses. Work by Vazquez-Prokopec and collaborators has shown that the best way to control these mosquitos and the diseases they spread is by spraying a long-lasting pesticide indoors   on the ceilings, along the bases of walls, and in other areas of homes where the mosquitos tend to cluster. This approach   known as targeted indoor residual spraying   is too expensive and time-consuming to apply across a city. The statistical framework in the current paper, however, allows public health officials to concentrate their efforts on previous hot spots for Aedes-borne diseases to better control   and even prevent   outbreaks.  The ultimate goal is to give public health officials the power to harness big data and do more effective and efficient mosquito control   even before an epidemic begins,  Vazquez-Prokopec says. Vazquez-Prokopec is currently leading a consortium in a randomized clinical trial in Merida to test targeted indoor residual spraying as an intervention against Aedes-borne diseases. The five-year trial, launched in 2020, is funded by a $6.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. Dengue fever is sometimes called  break-bone fever  due to the excruciating pain that is among its symptoms. More than one third of the world s population lives in areas at high risk for infection with the dengue virus, a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics. Dengue is endemic through most of Mexico, where between 75,000 and 355,000 cases occur annually, translating into an economic cost of between about U.S. $150 million and $257 million annually. Chikungunya is rarely fatal but the symptoms can be severe and debilitating. Zika can cause symptoms similar to those of dengue and chikungunya, such as joint pains and fever. While Zika tends to be less debilitating, or even asymptomatic, if a pregnant woman contracts the virus it can have a catastrophic impact on her unborn child, including severe brain defects.

We ve created a wearable sensor that monitors plant stress and disease in a noninvasive way by measuring the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants,  says Qingshan Wei, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work. Wei is an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at NC State. Current methods of testing for plant stress or disease involve taking plant tissue samples and conducting an assay in a lab. However, this only gives growers one measurement, and there is a time lag between when growers take a sample and when they get the test results. Plants emit different combinations of VOCs under different circumstances. By targeting VOCs that are relevant to specific diseases or plant stress, the sensors can alert users to specific problems.  Our technology monitors VOC emissions from the plant continuously, without harming the plant,  Wei says.  The prototype we ve demonstrated stores this monitoring data, but future versions will transmit the data wirelessly. What we ve developed allows growers to identify problems in the field   they wouldn t have to wait to receive test results from a lab.  The rectangular patches are 30 millimeters long and consist of a flexible material containing graphene-based sensors and flexible silver nanowires. The sensors are coated with various chemical ligands that respond to the presence of specific VOCs, allowing the system to detect and measure VOCs in gases emitted by the plant s leaves. The researchers tested a prototype of the device on tomato plants. The prototype was set up to monitor for two types of stress: physical damage to the plant and infection by P. infestans, the pathogen that causes late blight disease in tomatoes. The system detected VOC changes associated with the physical damage within one to three hours, depending on how close the damage was to the site of the patch. Detecting the presence of P. infestans took longer. The technology didn t pick up changes in VOC emissions until three to four days after researchers inoculated the tomato plants.  This is not markedly faster than the appearance of visual symptoms of late blight disease,  Wei says.  However, the monitoring system means growers don t have to rely on detecting minute visual symptoms. Continuous monitoring would allow growers to identify plant diseases as quickly as possible, helping them limit the spread of the disease.   Our prototypes can already detect 13 different plant VOCs with high accuracy, allowing users to develop a customized sensor array that focuses on the stresses and diseases that a grower thinks are most relevant,  says Yong Zhu, co-corresponding author of the paper and Andrew A. Adams Distinguished Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at NC State.  It s also important to note that the materials are fairly low cost,  Zhu says.  If the manufacturing was scaled up, we think this technology would be affordable. We re trying to develop a practical solution to a real-world problem, and we know cost is an important consideration.  The researchers are currently working to develop a next-generation patch that can monitor for temperature, humidity and other environmental variables as well as VOCs. And while the prototypes were battery-powered and stored the data on-site, the researchers plan for future versions to be solar powered and capable of wireless data transfer.ReferenceLi Z, Liu Y, Hossain O, et al.

In a study published in mBio, the team reported how a protein of the Ebola virus, VP24, interacts with the double-layered membrane of the cell nucleus (known as the nuclear envelope), leading to significant damage to cells along with virus replication and the propagation of disease. The Ebola virus is extremely skilled at dodging the body s immune defenses, and in our study we characterize an important way in which that evasion occurs through disruption of the nuclear envelope, mediated by the VP24 protein,  says co-senior author Adolfo Garc a-Sastre, PhD, Professor of Microbiology, and Director of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  That disruption is quite dramatic and replicates rare, genetic diseases known as laminopathies, which can result in severe muscular, cardiovascular, and neuronal complications.  After first appearing in 1976 in Africa, the Ebola virus has triggered a number of outbreaks on that continent, the most serious from 2014 to 2016 in West Africa, with a 50 percent mortality rate among its victims. The virus, which causes severe hemorrhagic fever, is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads through human-to-human transmission. In their laboratory work much of it conducted with research partners from CIMUS at the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela in Spain, and the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany investigators identified the cellular membrane components that interact with VP24 to prompt nuclear membrane disruption. These components are emerin and the inner membrane constituents lamin A/C and lamin B. Specifically, the VP24 protein decreases interaction of lamin A/C and emerin, compromising the integrity of the nuclear membrane, which, in turn, results in leakage of DNA and the loss of function by the body s disease-fighting cells. The researchers further showed that VP24 disrupts signaling pathways that are meant to activate the immune system s defenses against viral invaders like Ebola. The biological consequence of this is even greater interference with the normal physiology of cells, including antiviral immunity.  We believe our discovery of the novel activities of the Ebola VP24 protein and the severe damage it causes to infected cells will help to promote further research into effective ways to treat and prevent the spread of deadly viruses, perhaps through a new inhibitor,  says Dr. Garc a-Sastre, who has spent the past 25 years focused on the molecular biology of rare and common viruses.  Indeed, that research will hopefully identify even more precisely the molecular mechanisms by which viruses like Ebola invade the body and find ways to cleverly avoid its immune defenses.

These interactions underpin every function of a healthy body, with any slight change in these interactions resulting in disease.A handful of drugs have been designed that can break apart these interactions, and this serves to disrupt the progress of the disease. However, in some diseases, the problem is caused by protein interactions not happening, or not happening in the right way. So new drugs that work by  gluing  these proteins together would be highly effective, but finding them is not straightforward.In this study, published in Chemical Science, researchers in the University of Birmingham s School of Biosciences have designed a system that uses mass spectrometry to measure the precise mass of a pair of proteins, plus the  glue , to identify which  glue  is the strongest and thus will likely be the most successful in treating the disease.Lead author Dr Aneika Leney said:  A healthy body depends very much on the cells  proteins being able to signal effectively. Any wrong signal can lead to disease and that could be the wrong proteins sticking together   or proteins not joining up as they should. We want a drug that corrects for this. Our methods provides a  snapshot  of what is happening to the proteins when we add a potential drug so we can see quickly whether the  glue  is working The team worked with chemical biologists at the University of Leicester to test the method on therapeutic compounds being studied by co-lead author Dr Richard Doveston and his team.Dr Doveston says: Looking for molecules that act as glues is not easy because things are complicated by having two proteins in the mix. At the early stage of development we often just want to find molecules that are good starting points for development, so they might not be that good as glues at this stage. The current high-throughput screening methods available to us are usually not very effective in this context. The mass spectrometry method is great because we can learn so much from the data and it can be gathered relatively easily and quickly.Because the glue compounds are highly specific to the identified proteins, interactions with other proteins are rare, so the therapy is unlikely to produce any unlooked-for effects. Dr Leney adds:  We hope our approach will be taken up by pharmaceutical companies and used to rapidly screen and test promising drug compounds that can bind proteins together to deliver a therapeutic benefit.

In the study, the scientists successfully measured the shape distributions of EVs derived from liver, breast, and colorectal cancer cells, showing that the shape distributions differ from one another. The findings were recently published in the journal Analytical Chemistry.Early detection of cancerous tumors in the body is essential for effective treatments. However, it is difficult to detect all types of tumors at an early stage, because detection methods differ among types of cancer, and some of the methods require painful medical procedures. It is thus vital to find methods that are painless and can detect multiple types of cancer.Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are biological particles with a diameter of about 100 nanometers (nm) that are secreted from various cells and exist in body fluids like blood and urine. Notably, EVs contain biological molecules that carry information about the cells of the secretion sources. In addition, genetic materials contained in EVs are involved in communications among cells. This suggests that analyzing biological molecules in EVs present in body fluids could help to detect and identify some kinds of cancerous tumors in the body.Previous studies had observed images of various shapes of EVs with electron microscopes. However, no technology existed to investigate the shapes of EVs distributed in body fluids, mainly because of difficulties in measuring the shape of nanomaterials in solution. In this context, a team of researchers from Kyushu University, Nagoya University, Osaka University, and Tokyo Medical University tried to investigate the shape of individual EVs in a fluid using a device that they had developed, which can analyze the shape of single particles in solution by measuring the change of ionic current flowing through pores of 200 nm in diameter when particles pass through there.Using the device, the team successfully measured the shape of EVs derived from cultured liver, breast, and colon cancer cells, as well as from cultured normal breast cells, and found that their shape distributions differ from each other. For example, EVs derived from liver cancer cells include a mix of spherical particles and oval (like rugby balls) particles, whereas EVs from breast cancer cells consist solely of spherical particles.The team then compared shape distributions of EVs in blood samples from breast cancer patients and non-cancerous individuals. The results showed that the shape distributions of EVs from the two groups differ from each other, indicating that measuring shape distributions of EVs in blood could distinguish patients with breast cancer from non-cancerous individuals.""In this study, we found that measuring shape distributions of EVs in body fluids could identify the type of cancer,"" said Associate Professor Takao Yasui at the Nagoya University Graduate School of Engineering, one of the authors of the study.The researchers note that measuring a greater variety of types of EVs will provide them with a more accurate idea of potential EV shape distributions as an index for cancer detection, screening, and diagnosis.Reference: Ryuzaki S, Yasui T, Tsutsui M, et al.

The researchers say that by identifying and treating the mutation known to cause Huntington s disease with this type of gene therapy, before a patient starts showing symptoms, it may slow progression of the disease. The findings of the study were published in the journal Brain. What s exciting about this study is the opportunity to identify a reliable biomarker that can track the potential success of genetic therapies before patients start manifesting symptoms,  says Wenzhen Duan, M.D., Ph.D., director of the translational neurobiology laboratory and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Such a biomarker could facilitate the development of new treatments, and help us determine the best time to begin them. Huntington s disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a single defective gene, dubbed  huntingtin,  on human chromosome 4. The gene is passed on from parents to children   if one parent has the mutation, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting it. Huntington s disease has no cure and can lead to emotional disturbances, loss of intellectual abilities and uncontrolled movements. Thanks to genetic testing, people can know if they have the disease long before symptoms arise, which typically happens in their 40s or 50s.For the study, Duan and her team collaborated with colleagues from Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, who developed a novel method to more precisely measure the blood volume in the brain by using advanced functional MRI scans. With the scans, they can map the trajectory of blood flow in small blood vessels called arterioles in the brains of mice engineered to carry the human huntingtin gene mutation that mirror the early stages of Huntington s disease in humans.Duan notes that there are many known metabolic changes in the brains of people with Huntington s disease, and those changes initiate a brain blood volume response in the disease s early stages. Blood volume is a key marker for oxygen supply to brain cells, which in turn supplies energy for the neurons to function. But with Huntington s disease, the brain s arteriolar blood volume is dramatically diminished, which makes the neurons deteriorate because of lack of oxygen as the disease progresses.In a series of experiments, the researchers suppressed the mutation in the huntingtin gene in mice, using a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR   a tool for editing genomes that allows the alteration of a DNA sequence to modify gene function. Then, they used the MRI scanning technique and other tests to track the brain function over time both of mice with the huntingtin mutation, in which they edited out the faulty gene sequence, and a control group of mice in which the faulty gene was unedited.The experiments assessed abnormalities in the trajectory of arteriolar blood volumes in mouse brains with the Huntington s disease mutation at 3, 6 and 9 months of age (pre-symptom stage, beginning of symptoms and post-symptom stage, respectively). The researchers looked at whether suppression of the mutant huntingtin gene in the neurons could normalize altered arteriolar blood volumes in the pre-symptom stage, and whether reduced expression of the huntingtin gene at the pre-symptom stage could delay or even prevent development of symptoms. Overall, our data suggest that the cerebral arteriolar blood volume measure may be a promising noninvasive biomarker for testing new therapies in patients with Huntington s who are yet to show symptoms of the disease,  says Duan.  Introducing treatment in this early stage may have long-lasting benefits. When the researchers mapped the trajectory of cerebral blood volume and conducted an assortment of brain and motor tests in the mice at 3 months of age, and compared the test to those of the control group, they observed no significant differences except in cerebral blood volumes. However, Huntington s symptoms in the mice with the huntingtin gene started at 6 months of age and progressively worsened at 9 months, suggesting that altered cerebral blood volume occurs before motor symptoms and atrophy of the brain cells   typical traits of the disease.The cerebral blood volume changes were also found to be similar to those observed in patients with Huntington s disease before they start manifesting symptoms, which declines with the start of symptoms and while the disease progresses over time.The researchers also analyzed the structure of the arteriole blood vessels in the brains of mice with the mutant huntingtin gene at 3 and at 9 months of age and found no differences in the numbers of vessel segments in the pre-symptom stage. However, they observed that smaller blood vessels had an increased density and reduced diameter, which may be a vascular response to compensate for the impaired neuronal brain function. This might suggest, the researchers conclude, that impaired vascular structure leads to lowered arteriole blood volumes and possibly compromised ability to compensate for the loss in the symptom stage.Considering that Huntington s disease symptoms depend not only on brain cell loss but also on how neurons deteriorate, the researchers set out to determine if suppressing the huntingtin gene during the pre-symptom stage in mice could delay or even prevent disease progression. To do that, the researchers introduced the altered huntingtin gene to the neurons in mice at 2 months of age and evaluated the outcomes at 3 months of age (when no atrophy or motor deficits were present).Remarkably, the researchers say, the cerebral arteriolar blood volume in mice with the altered huntingtin gene was This suggests that the altered cerebral blood volume during the pre-symptom stage in mice is most likely due to neuronal changes in either activity or metabolism. Our findings demonstrate that significant changes in arteriolar cerebral blood volumes occur before neurons start to degenerate and symptoms begin, further supporting the idea that altered cerebrovascular function is an early stage symptom in Huntington s disease,  says Duan. She explains that these changes also indicate there s a pre-symptom therapeutic window in which to test interventions. While no animal model replicates all the symptoms of human Huntington s disease, this research offers an alternative system to study functional changes in the pre-symptom stage, she says.In a new study on mice, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers report that using MRI scans to measure blood volume in the brain can serve as a noninvasive way to potentially track the progress of gene editing therapies for early-stage Huntington s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that attacks brain cells.

In 2020, it was responsible for an estimated 12% of male cancer deaths in Australia.*How it works*For the study, published in Nature's Scientific Reports, researchers from RMIT and St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne studied CT scans of asymptomatic patients, with and without prostate cancer.The team trained the AI software to look for features of disease in a variety of scans and where exactly to look for them, avoiding the need to manually crop the images.The AI performed better than radiologists who viewed the same images, detecting cancerous growths in just seconds.What's more, the AI improved with each scan, learning and adapting to read images from different machines to spot even the smallest irregularities.RMIT's Head of Artificial Intelligence, Professor John Thangarajah, said the study demonstrated how AI can and should be used to create public good.""Our health sector needs smarter solutions and AI can help, but we're only scratching the surface,"" he said.""There's a lot of good that artificial intelligence can bring to the world, which is our focus at RMIT, and this study forms a big part of that.""Dr Mark Page, Head of CT in Diagnostic Imaging at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, said early intervention for prostate cancer was key to a better health outcome.""Australia doesn't have a screening program for prostate cancer but armed with this technology, we hope to catch cases early in patients who are scanned for other reasons,"" he said.""For example, emergency patients who have CT scans could be simultaneously screened for prostate cancer.""If we can detect it earlier and refer them to specialist care faster, this could make a significant difference to their prognosis.""The technology can be applied at scale, potentially integrating with a variety of diagnostic imaging equipment like MRI and DEXA machines - pending further research.""It was excellent to tap into the AI expertise at RMIT and we look forward to future possibilities for analysing more radiology scans,"" Page said.The multi-disciplinary team, including researchers from RMIT's School of Engineering and School of Computing Technologies, is looking for interested commercial partners to develop software to further integrate the AI technology with hospital equipment for possible clinical trials.Reference: Korevaar, S, Tennakoon R, Page M, et al.

Most of the time, we tune out inconsequential cues the buzz of a fly, the soft rustle of leaves in the tree and pay attention to important ones the sound of a car horn, a bang on the door. This allows us to function, navigate and, indeed, survive in the world around us.The brain s remarkable ability to sift through this ceaseless flow of information is enabled by an intricate neural network made up of billions of synapses, specialized junctions that regulate signal transmission between and across cells. Some of these junctions inhibit signal transmission, others accelerate it a millisecond-by-millisecond balancing act which ensures that our brains function with maximum efficiency.Now a new study by researchers at Harvard Medical School and at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard shows that this delicate equilibrium between inhibition and excitation is maintained, at least in part, by a highly specialized subset of microglia the brain s resident immune cells, known for their role in fighting infection and cleanup of cellular debris.The research, conducted in mice and published July 6 in Cell, reveals for the first time that this cadre of specialized immune cells is finely attuned to detecting and engaging exclusively with inhibitory synapses, the junctions that slow down the flow of information from cell to cell. We found that specialized immune and neuronal cells engage in important communication during early brain development and form interactions critical to the establishment of balanced brain wiring,  said study first author Emilia Favuzzi, research fellow in neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS and a postdoctoral scholar at the Broad. Our observations suggest that microglia engage in an act of intricate interplay with specific types of synapses, homing in on them and sculpting the nervous system in a synapse-by-synapse manner,  said study senior investigator Gordon Fishell, professor of neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS and group leader in the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad.  This is the first time we have shown that certain types of microglia are recruited to certain types of synapses and engage with them in a very specific way. Moreover, the research showed, these cells interact with inhibitory synapses through direct physical contact, a first-of-a-kind observation enabled by advanced imaging techniques that allowed the researchers to observe in real time how cells in the brains of mice engage with one another.The contact, the experiments showed, occurs via a GABA receptor that resides on the surface of microglia and renders these cells exquisitely attuned to GABA-emitting inhibitory synapses. GABA is the brain s main inhibitory neurotransmitter and acts as a brake on cell-to-cell signaling. GABA, the research showed, appears to act as a come-hither signal to a specific subset of microglia, inviting these cells to feast on inhibitory, GABA-releasing synapses.Furthermore, the experiments revealed the process occurs via a three-step engagement movement, recognition, and ingestion. The work showed that GABA-sensitive microglia engulf inhibitory synapses in much the same way these cells act to devour pathogens or cellular trash.The insights, the researchers said, could hold important clues for new therapeutic approaches for conditions in which the brain s neural wiring goes awry. Such defects can disrupt the fine equilibrium between excitation and inhibition and lead to serious functional aberrations in sensory perceptions from sensory overstimulation, at one extreme, to sensory blunting, at the other. Such sensory disruptions are often seen in conditions such as autism-spectrum disorders, ADHD, or schizophrenia. In the not-too-distant future we can look for ways to selectively toggle or tweak the balance between excitatory and inhibitory connections in the brain through the recruitment of specialized microglia tasked with remodeling and pruning specific synapses,  Favuzzi added.","Published: July 7, 2021"

Some have even seen an imagined Jesus in cheese on toast.Until now scientists haven't understood exactly what the brain is doing when it processes visual signals and interprets them as representations of the human face.Neuroscientists at the University of Sydney now say how our brains identify and analyse real human faces is conducted by the same cognitive processes that identify illusory faces.""From an evolutionary perspective, it seems that the benefit of never missing a face far outweighs the errors where inanimate objects are seen as faces,"" said Professor David Alais lead author of the study from the School of Psychology.""There is a great benefit in detecting faces quickly,"" he said, ""but the system plays 'fast and loose' by applying a crude template of two eyes over a nose and mouth. Lots of things can satisfy that template and thus trigger a face detection response.""This facial recognition response happens lightning fast in the brain: within a few hundred milliseconds.""We know these objects are not truly faces, yet the perception of a face lingers,"" Professor Alais said. ""We end up with something strange: a parallel experience that it is both a compelling face and an object. Two things at once. The first impression of a face does not give way to the second perception of an object.""This error is known as ""face pareidolia"". It is such a common occurrence that we accept the notion of detecting faces in objects as 'normal' - but humans do not experience this cognitive process as strongly for other phenomena.The brain has evolved specialised neural mechanisms to rapidly detect faces and it exploits the common facial structure as a short-cut for rapid detection.""Pareidolia faces are not discarded as false detections but undergo facial expression analysis in the same way as real faces,"" Professor Alais said.Not only do we imagine faces, we analyse them and give them emotional attributes.The findings are published today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.The researchers say this expression analysis of inanimate objects is because as deeply social beings, simply detecting a face isn't enough.""We need to read the identity of the face and discern its expression. Are they a friend or a foe? Are they happy, sad, angry, pained?"" Professor Alais said.'Tinder-like' visual biasWhat the study examined was whether once a pareidolia face is detected, it is subsequently analysed for facial expression, or discarded from face processing as a false detection.The research shows that once a false face is retained by the brain it is analysed for its facial expression in the same way that a real face is.""We showed this by presenting sequences of faces and having participants rate each face's expression on a scale ranging from angry to happy,"" Professor Alais said.What was intriguing is that a known bias in judging human faces persisted with analysis of inanimate imagined faces.A previous study undertaken by Professor Alais showed that in a Tinder-like situation of judging face after face, a bias is observed whereby the assessment of the current face is influenced by our assessment of the previous face.The scientists tested this by mixing up real faces with pareidolia faces - and the result was the same.""This 'cross-over' condition is important as it shows the same underlying facial expression process is involved regardless of image type,"" Professor Alais said.""This means that seeing faces in clouds is more than a child's fantasy,"" he said.""When objects look compellingly face-like, it is more than an interpretation: they really are driving your brain's face detection network.

As we age, our brains typically undergo a slow process of atrophy, causing less robust communication between various brain regions, which leads to declining memory and other cognitive functions. But a rare group of older individuals called ""superagers"" have been shown to learn and recall novel information as well as a 25-year-old. Investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have now identified the brain activity that underlies superagers' superior memory. ""This is the first time we have images of the function of superagers' brains as they actively learn and remember new information,"" says Alexandra Touroutoglou, PhD, director of Imaging Operations at MGH's Frontotemporal Disorders Unit and senior author of the paper published in Cerebral Cortex.In 2016, Touroutoglou and her fellow researchers identified a group of adults older than 65 with remarkable performance on memory tests. The superagers are participants in an ongoing longitudinal study of aging at MGH led by Bradford Dickerson, MD, director of the Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at MGH, and Lisa Feldman Barrett, PhD, a research scientist in Psychiatry at MGH. ""Using MRI, we found that the structure of superagers' brains and the connectivity of their neural networks more closely resemble the brains of young adults; superagers had avoided the brain atrophy typically seen in older adults,"" says Touroutoglou.In the new study, the investigators gave 40 adults with a mean age of 67 a very challenging memory test while their brains were imaged using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which, unlike typical MRI, shows the activity of different brain areas during tasks. Forty-one young adults (mean age of 25) also took the same memory test while their brains were imaged. The participants first viewed 80 pictures of faces or scenes that were each paired with an adjective, such as a cityscape paired with the word ""industrial"" or a male face paired with the word ""average."" Their first task was to determine whether the word matched the image, a process called encoding. After 10 minutes, participants were presented with the 80 image-word pairs they had just learned, an additional 40 pairs of new words and images, and 40 rearranged pairs consisting of words and images they had previously seen. Their second task was to recall whether they had previously seen each specific word-picture pair, or whether they were looking at a new or rearranged pair.While the participants were in the scanner, the researchers paid close attention to the visual cortex, which is the area of the brain that processes what you see and is particularly sensitive to aging. ""In the visual cortex, there are populations of neurons that are selectively involved in processing different categories of images, such as faces, houses or scenes,"" says lead author Yuta Katsumi, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Psychiatry at MGH. ""This selective function of each group of neurons makes them more efficient at processing what you see and creating a distinct memory of those images, which can then easily be retrieved.""During aging, this selectivity, called neural differentiation, diminishes and the group of neurons that once responded primarily to faces now activates for other images. The brain now has difficulty creating unique neural activation patterns for different types of images, which means it is making less distinctive mental representations of what the person is seeing. That's one reason older individuals have trouble remembering when they may have seen a television show, read an article, or eaten a specific meal.But in the fMRI study, the superagers' memory performance was indistinguishable from the 25-year-olds', and their brains' visual cortex maintained youthful activity patterns. ""The superagers had maintained the same high level of neural differentiation, or selectivity, as a young adult,"" says Katsumi. ""Their brains enabled them to create distinct representations of the different categories of visual information so that they could accurately remember the image-word pairs.""An important question that researchers still must answer is whether ""superagers' brains were always more efficient than their peers, or whether, over time, they developed mechanisms to compensate for the decline of the aging brain,"" says Touroutoglou.Previous studies have shown that training can increase the selectivity of brain regions, which may be a potential intervention to delay or prevent the decline in neural differentiation in normal aging adults and make their brains more like those of superagers. Currently the researchers are conducting a clinical trial to evaluate whether noninvasive electromagnetic stimulation, which delivers an electrical current to targeted areas of the brain, can improve memory in older adults. The researchers also plan to study different brain regions to further understand how superagers learn and remember, and they will examine lifestyle and other factors that might contribute to superagers' amazing memory.Reference: Katsumi Y, Andreano JM, Barrett LF, Dickerson BC, Touroutoglou A.

Tsai s lab has shown that lingering DSBs are associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and that repair mechanisms can falter. We wanted to understand exactly how widespread and extensive this natural activity is in the brain upon memory formation because that can give us insight into how genomic instability could undermine brain health down the road,  said Tsai, who is also a professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a leader of MIT s Aging Brain Initiative.  Clearly memory formation is an urgent priority for healthy brain function but these new results showing that several types of brain cells break their DNA in so many places to quickly express genes is still striking.

It was found that diclofenac is a reversible tyrosinase inhibitor (a decrease in the analytical signal is observed), which makes it possible to determine it using appropriate biosensors modified with nanomaterials in the concentration range from 10 pM to 1  M with CH 5 pM. Modification with composites of CNT / Au NPs and fullerene C60 / Au NPs made it possible to improve the analytical characteristics of the developed biosensors, in particular, to expand the range of determined concentrations and reduce CH compared to the unmodified analogue.Kinetic studies of the reaction of enzymatic conversion of phenol showed that noncompetitive inhibition is observed  in the presence of diclofenac on a tyrosinase biosensor. The content of this drug in food is strictly regulated by European Union regulations, according to which the MPC for diclofenac in milk is 0.1  g / l. In this case, diclofenac was not detected in four studied milk samples with 1.5% fat content. To assess the correctness of the results obtained for the determination of diclofenac using the developed biosensors, the method of fluorescence polarization was used. The results show that the developed tyrosinase biosensor modified with CNT/Au NPs is not inferior in its analytical capabilities to known analogs, and in some cases even surpasses them and can be used for milk quality control. Currently, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used as analgesics and anti-inflammatory treatment in diseases of the musculoskeletal system. Drugs of this class have a wide range of side effects, which, according to statistics, manifest in 10% of patients. NSAIDs are used in veterinary medicine to treat cattle and, therefore, can be found in dairy products. With that in mind, the content of NSAIDs in food should be strictly controlled. Diclofenac is one of the widely used medications of this class. Since the presence of diclofenac in baby food is unacceptable, and its content in food products is subject to strict control, the determination of the content of this drug in food products, such as dairy, meat, and processed products, is very important. Recently, information about the content of diclofenac in seawater and wastewater has become increasingly common, so monitoring the content of the drug in them is also an important task. Further improvement of biosensor devices with the involvement of modern ideas about the role of the surface in the mechanism of analytical response will be very useful both for solving specific problems and for the development of the theory of biosensorics in general.ReferenceBeilinson RM, Yavisheva AA, Medyantseva EP, Budnikov HC.

By simulating the amount of virus in the upper respiratory specimens, the team found that virus-producing cells died at different rates, classifying patients into those with rapid, medium or slow virus decay.In observational studies, physicians assess whether and when patients should receive antiviral treatment based on their symptoms, as opposed to randomization where patients are blindly assigned to treatment and control groups. Since slow decay may be associated with more severe disease, observational studies may have been limited to certain patients, failing to capture the spectrum of viral dynamics and confounding the results.""We found that for successful clinical trials, randomization is important because [differences in virus decay rates] can affect the effects of antivirals, "" Iwanami explains.Aside from randomization, the researchers also found that timing could impact the efficacy of potential drug candidates. Regardless of virus decay group, their simulations showed that initiating treatment five days after symptom onset masked drug efficacy. Meanwhile, administering antivirals within the first day of symptom onset improved outcomes across the board.To mimic randomized controlled trials--considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions--the researchers added hypothetical drugs with high SARS-CoV-2 inhibition rates into their model. As patients in past studies were often recruited without considering treatment timing, the team's model revealed that these clinical trials would have needed to enroll over 10,000 participants per group to provide statistically significant data on drug efficacy--a practical challenge in terms of patient recruitment and resource availability.In contrast, if patients are recruited early and treated within a day of symptom onset, the team found that the required sample size would drop to just 584 participants per group for an antiviral with 95 percent inhibition, and 458 per group for 99 percent inhibition. Ultimately, their findings highlight the importance of randomization as well as prompt patient recruitment and treatment initiation in evaluating COVID-19 drug candidates.""We could apply this process to other clinical trials or diseases. This model on clinical design can accelerate drug repositioning or new drug development, "" says Iwanami, adding that trials following these recommendations are now underway.Reference: Iwanami S, Ejima K, Kim KS, et al.

A team of researchers from ITQB NOVA has now taken a crucial step to clarify the dynamics of carriage of this bacterium in adults.This bacterium, also known as pneumococcus, can asymptomatically colonize the human upper respiratory tract. Colonization not only precedes diseases but is also essential for transmission. Even though pneumococcal disease is most common among children and the elderly, it is relatively rare among active healthy adults. Now, researchers have discovered that, contrary to expectations, in this age group acquisition of pneumococcus is frequent and carriage can last several months.In the work published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, the team led by Raquel S -Le o followed for six months 87 healthy adults aged 25-50 in Portugal. Nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and saliva samples were collected periodically, and screened using molecular methods, such as real-time PCR, for the presence of pneumococcus. The use of qPCR enables high sensitivity in samples where pneumococci are at low density. ""Sampling of multiple sites using a high-sensitive method together with repeated sampling of subjects allowed us to increase the chance of detecting carriage events"", explains S nia Almeida, first author of the study developed during her PhD.Researchers concluded that colonization among healthy adults was relatively frequent. In fact it was estimated that ""the risk of an adult being colonized with pneumococci at least once during a period of one year was 57.5%"", says Ana Cristina Paulo, second author of this study. Moreover, it was estimated that the median duration of carriage was almost two months, which is higher than previous studies had reported. Strikingly, some adults carried pneumococcus for more than 6 months - the duration of the study. Adults who lived with children showed a higher risk of acquiring pneumococcus. However, the duration of carriage in adults did not depend on regular contact with kids.The research suggests that some adults can act as reservoirs of pneumococci. Therefore, the scale of herd immunity potentially attainable through children's vaccination, which protects the community from infectious diseases, may vary. ""These outcomes are central when designing strategies to prevent pneumococcal disease in adults. By understanding this dynamic, we can contribute to public health decisions"", adds Raquel S -Le o.The team of ITQB NOVA's Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology of Human Pathogens developed this study in collaboration with ITQB NOVA PI Herm nia de Lencastre and the pneumologist Filipe Froes. The S -Le o Lab researches how human interventions, such as the use of antibiotics and vaccines, impact on the nasopharyngeal microbiota, with special interest on Streptococcus pneumoniae.Reference: Almeida ST, Paulo AC, Froes F, de Lencastre H, S -Le o R.

Meat-substitute manufacturers have gone to great lengths to make the plant-based product as meaty as possible, including adding leghemoglobin, an iron-carrying molecule from soy, and red beet, berries and carrot extracts to simulate bloodiness. The texture of near-meat is thickened by adding indigestible fibers like methyl cellulose. And to bring the plant-based meat alternatives up to the protein levels of meat, they use isolated plant proteins from soy, peas, and other plant sources. Some meat-substitutes also add vitamin B12 and zinc to further replicate meat s nutrition. However, many other components of nutrition do not appear on the labels, and that s where the products differ widely from meat, according to the study, which appears this week in Scientific Reports. The metabolites that the scientists measured are building blocks of the body s biochemistry, crucial to the conversion of energy, signaling between cells, building structures and tearing them down, and a host of other functions. There are expected to be more than 100,000 of these molecules in biology and about half of the metabolites circulating in human blood are estimated to be derived from our diets.  To consumers reading nutritional labels, they may appear nutritionally interchangeable,  said Stephan van Vliet, a postdoctoral researcher at the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute who led the research.  But if you peek behind the curtain using metabolomics and look at expanded nutritional profiles, we found that there are large differences between meat and a plant-based meat alternative.  The Duke Molecular Physiology Institute s metabolomics core lab compared 18 samples of a popular plant-based meat alternative to 18 grass-fed ground beef samples from a ranch in Idaho. The analysis of 36 carefully cooked patties found that 171 out of the 190 metabolites they measured varied between beef and the plant-based meat substitute. The beef contained 22 metabolites that the plant substitute did not. The plant-based substitute contained 31 metabolites that meat did not. The greatest distinctions occurred in amino acids, dipeptides, vitamins, phenols, and types of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids found in these products. Several metabolites known to be important to human health were found either exclusively or in greater quantities in beef, including creatine, spermine, anserine, cysteamine, glucosamine, squalene, and the omega-3 fatty acid DHA.  These nutrients have potentially important physiological, anti-inflammatory, and or immunomodulatory roles,  the authors said in the paper.  These nutrients are important for our brain and other organs including our muscles  van Vliet said.  But some people on vegan diets (no animal products), can live healthy lives   that s very clear.  Besides, the plant-based meat alternative contained several beneficial metabolites not found in beef such as phytosterols and phenols.  It is important for consumers to understand that these products should not be viewed as nutritionally interchangeable, but that s not to say that one is better than the other,  said van Vliet, a self-described omnivore who enjoys a plant-heavy diet but also eats meat.  Plant and animal foods can be complementary, because they provide different nutrients.  He said more research is needed to determine whether there are short-term or long-term effects of the presence or absence of particular metabolites in meat and plant-based meat alternatives.Referencevan Vliet S, Bain JR, Muehlbauer MJ, et al.

The work is part of one Nobel laureate's quest to find virtually all such variations in mammals.""This study identifies 101 novel gene candidates with greater than 95% chance of being required for immunity,"" says Bruce Beutler, M.D., director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense (CGHD) and corresponding author of the study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""Many of these candidates we have already verified by re-creating the mutations or knocking out the genes."" Lead author Darui Xu, a computational biologist at CGHD, wrote the software.""We've developed software called Candidate Explorer (CE) that uses a machine-learning algorithm to identify chemically induced mutations likely to cause traits related to immunity. The software determines the probability that any mutation we've induced will be verified as causative after further testing,"" Beutler says. His discovery of an important family of receptors that allow mammals to quickly sense infection and trigger an inflammatory response led to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.""The purpose of CE is to help researchers predict whether a mutation associated with a phenotype (trait or function) is a truly causative mutation. CE has already helped us to identify hundreds of genes with novel functions in immunity. This will improve our understanding of the immune system so that we can find new ways to keep it robust, and also know the reason it sometimes falters,"" says Beutler, Regental Professor, and professor of immunology and internal medicine at UT Southwestern.""CE provides a score that tells us the likelihood that a particular mutation-phenotype association will be verified for cause and effect if we re-create the mutation or knock out the gene,"" he says.CE examines 67 features of the primary genetic mapping data to arrive at an estimate of the likelihood of causation. For some mutations, causation is very clear; for others, less so. Over time, the program ""learns"" from experiments in which researchers re-create the mutation in a fresh pedigree and verify or exclude the hypothesis of causation. All mutations are made available to the scientific community through a public repository, and the data supporting causation are viewable within the Candidate Explorer program on the CGHD website, Mutagenetix.The team used CE to evaluate about 87,000 mutation/trait associations that passed the initial statistical threshold for candidacy. The traits examined were flow cytometry data collected on circulating immune cells of third-generation mutant mice. In this screen, Candidate Explorer ranked a total of 2,336 mutations in 1,279 genes as good or excellent candidates for causation of traits, the team reports.Beutler adds that this work is part of a research program he set out on nearly a decade ago to identify every mutation that may affect the mouse immune system.""We've now worked through about 60% of the genome and have identified thousands of genes - hundreds of them novel - that participate in immunity in the mouse,"" he says. ""The vast majority of these also contribute to human immunity.""Beutler adds that the mouse and human genome are very similar in size and content of genes.

In these therapies, anti-cancer cells are processed and injected into patients. A new study by the Shin Kaneko Laboratory shows how iPS cells can be used to prepare even more potent adoptive cell transfer therapies for colorectal cancers.In typical adoptive cell transfer therapies, the anti-cancer cells are taken directly from the patient. In all cases of cancer, the patient produces tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that recognize and kill cancer cells. The problem is that the number of these lymphocytes is not high enough to stop the cancer from spreading.CiRA Prof. Shin Kaneko explains that because of the recognition, most adoptive cell transfer therapies use these cells.""The cells are collected and expanded, but the cells lose their potency. The ideal cells for the therapy would have juvenile properties. This means longer persistency and more proliferation. But these conditions are difficult to manufacture if using patient cells,"" he said.Kaneko added that along with these properties is that the lymphocytes target the cancer cells with high specificity. That is, they kill cancer cells but no healthy cells in the patient. iPS cells can provide the juvenile properties, but only certain iPS cells can also provide the specificity.""Our hypothesis was that we could maintain the cancer specificity if we programmed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Other reprogrammed cells would not have specificity,"" said Takeshi Ito, the first author of the study.Unlike other iPS cells, those made from reprogrammed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes carried the surface receptors needed to recognize the cancer cells. To test their hypothesis, the researchers collected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes sensitive for colorectal cancers. These cells were then reprogrammed into iPS cells and then differentiated back into tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.Notably, in contrast to the original tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, those differentiated from iPS cells showed longer telomeres and persistency and more proliferation, resulting in superior cytotoxicity against the cancer cells.""In adoptive cell transfer therapies, patient cells are safest but not always effective at killing the cancer. We are developing safe adoptive cell transfer therapies with iPS cells that have a higher killing effect,"" said Kaneko.Reference: Ito T, Kawai Y, Yasui Y, et al.

A new epidemiological study by the open access publisher Frontiers is the first to show that the risk of developing dysmenorrhea increases by more than 30 times for women and girls who are exposed long-term to air pollutants such as carbon and nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter.Dysmenorrhea, that is, frequent severe and painful cramps during menstruation from abnormal contractions of the uterus, is the most common of all gynecological disorders. It affects between 16-91% of girls and women of reproductive age, of whom 2-29% have symptoms severe enough to restrict their daily activity. Now, for the first time, researchers from China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan have shown that long-term exposure to air pollutants such as nitrogen and carbon oxides and fine particulate matter greatly raises the risk of developing dysmenorrhea. Based on long-term data on air quality and public health from national databases, they show that the risk to develop dysmenorrhea over a period of 13 years (2000-2013) was up to 33 times higher among Taiwanese women and girls who lived in areas with the highest levels of air pollutants compared to their peers exposed to lower levels of pollutants. These results were recently published in the open access journal Frontiers in Public Health.Dysmenorrhea can be due to hormonal imbalances or to underlying gynecological conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, or tumors in the pelvic cavity. Symptoms are often life-long: they include cramps and pain in the lower abdomen, pain in the lower back and legs, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fainting, weakness, fatigue, and headaches. In addition to reducing quality of life, dysmenorrhea also has a major socioeconomic impact, as females with dysmenorrhea may be temporarily unable to work, attend school, or engage in leisure activities. Dysmenorrhea has no known cure, but its symptoms may be managed with anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives.  Research has already shown that women who smoke or drink alcohol during their periods, or who are overweight, or have their first period very young, run a greater risk of dysmenorrhea. Women who have never been pregnant are likewise known to be at greater risk. But here we demonstrate for the first time another important risk factor for developing dysmenorrhea: air quality, in particular long-term exposure to pollution. We don t yet know the underlying mechanism, but emotional stress in women exposed to air pollutants, or higher average levels of the hormone-like prostaglandins in their body, might be part of the answer,  says one of the authors, Prof Chung Y. Hsu at the College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. The authors, led by Prof Chia-Hung Kao, the Director of the department of nuclear medicine and the Center for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at China Medical University, studied anonymized health measures from a total of 296,078 women and girls (approximately 1.3% of the total population) between 16-55 years old. These data came from Taiwan s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database starting 2000 (LHID 2000), a representative subsample from Taiwan s nation-wide health insurance database. The study sample exclusively included women and girls without any recorded history of dysmenorrhea before 2000. The authors looked for a long-term association between the risk of dysmenorrhea and air quality, in particular the mean exposure over the years to air pollutants   nitrogen oxide (NOx), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and particles smaller than 2.5  m in diameter ( PM2.5 )   obtained from the  Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Database  (TAQMD) of the Environmental Protection Agency.They found that from 2000- to 2013, 4.2% of women and girls in the studied sample were diagnosed with dysmenorrhea for the first time. As was expected from previous studies, younger women, women of lower incomes, and living in more urbanized areas tended to have a higher risk of developing dysmenorrhea over the study period. But importantly, the  hazard ratio  (that is, the age- and year-specific risk) of developing dysmenorrhea increased by 16.7 to 33.1 fold for women and girls from the 25% of areas with the highest yearly exposure to air pollutants, compared to those from the 25% of areas with the lowest exposure. NOx, NO, NO2, CO, and PM2.5 levels each contributed separately to the increased risk, but the greatest individual effect was from long-term exposure to high PM2.5.  Our results study demonstrate the major impact of the quality of air on human health in general, here specifically on the risk of dysmenorrhea in women and girls. This is a clear illustration of the need to for actions by governmental agencies and citizens to reduce air pollution, in order to improve human health,  concludes Prof Hsu.ReferenceLin S-Y, Yang Y-C, Lin C-C, et al.

These can help track resistance to medication that affects over a third of patients. The paper was published in the journal Biomolecules.Studies suggest that up to 34% of people living with schizophrenia can be resistant to two or more antipsychotic medications used to treat the disorder. Individual responses vary greatly, and there are no satisfactory biomarkers of treatment response yet, which can often turn finding the right medication into a painful and protracted guessing game.Recently researchers have turned to studying lipids and the important function they are now known to play in both the properties and functionality of the brain, such as membrane fluidity and permeability, retrograde signaling, neural plasticity, and neurotransmitter release modulation. ""Lipidomics is a growing field, and a lot remains unknown about lipid metabolism and its alteration in disease, which makes lipidomics a promising field for new discoveries,"" the paper's lead author, Anna Tkachev of the Skoltech Center for Neurobiology and Brain Restoration (CNBR), says.Anna Tkachev and her colleagues measured the blood lipid abundances for 322 blood plasma lipids in 92 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and undergoing treatment in a hospital. They studied the associations between symptom improvement and individual changes in blood plasma lipid levels by collecting blood plasma at two distinct time points: at the beginning and at the end of a hospital stay that lasted for 37 days on average.Doctors used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to assess the condition of the patients; a higher score corresponds to more severe symptoms, so researchers were looking for a drop in PANSS score over time. All but one patient showed improvement, but the extent was different. ""We found that, for patients with the least improvement in symptom severity, 22 lipids, including 20 triglyceride species, were increased at the second time point, while patients with most improvement did not demonstrate the same increase in lipid levels,"" the authors write.Anna Tkachev notes that a lot remains uncertain about the role of lipids in disease, and the role of lipids in schizophrenia in particular. ""Typically, in a clinical setting, only total triglycerides are measured in the blood. In our study, we assessed lipids at a more detailed level of individual triglyceride species. The lipids we find significant in our study (shorter chain triglycerides) are not among the most abundant triglycerides, and any variation in their levels would probably remain undetected at the level of total triglyceride measurement. Because many studies in the past have focused on total triglyceride levels and not detailed level of individual lipid species, it is difficult to say for now what these alterations signify,"" she says.The lipids the team found seem to be related to metabolic alterations: they have been reported to be affected in diabetes and non-alcohol fatty liver disease. ""Metabolic abnormalities are, unfortunately, common in patients suffering from schizophrenia, and managing these metabolic abnormalities is an important part of managing the psychiatric disorder. However, there seems to be a complex interplay between metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric health. The role these metabolic abnormalities play in schizophrenia is not well understood, and the cause-effect relationship between the two is unclear as well,"" Tkachev explains.Since the researchers were looking at individual changes in lipid levels and not the levels of lipids at baseline, their results cannot be used for a predictive model of treatment response. ""Our results show that different levels of symptom improvement are associated with different alterations in lipid levels. Rather than providing a predictive biomarker, we hope that our results can help further the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease manifestation and treatment response,"" Tkachev says.Reference: Tkachev A, Stekolshchikova E, Anikanov N, et al.

Because the property is important in designing drugs that bind correctly to their targets, the ability to achieve 100% correct chirality is highly desired, Gao said.""It's important because if a pharmaceutical drug has the wrong stereochemistry (chirality in three dimensions), it could become a poison to humans, even if the planar chemical structure is the same,"" she said.Like ""left"" or ""right"" orientation in chiral objects, what's known as a 3S or 3R orientation is determined by a molecule's stereocenter, a one-atom connection between parts of a molecule, Gao said.But while nature handles the process with ease, selectively synthesizing stereocenters has been a challenge for chemists. The entire mechanism behind nature's ability to control whether a molecule has a 3S or 3R orientation has been hidden from view until now.Understanding how it works in fungi and analyzing its structure could give scientists, particularly those who design drugs, a new chemical synthesis tool.The focus of the study, a bioactive natural product known as 21R-citrinadin A, discovered in 2004 in a marine-derived fungal strain of Penicillium citrinum, is toxic to leukemia in mice and human lung cancer cells.""21R-citrinadin A is a very complicated molecule, with eight stereocenters,"" Gao said. ""In a way, the paper emphasizes how nature uses enzymes to synthesize a complex molecule with such a precision. Eight different stereocenters are a lot to control.""She said the molecule incorporates a ""very intriguing"" 3S spirooxindole ring. ""Nature produces several other chemicals with a similar spirooxindole pharmacophore,"" Gao said. ""However, we became very curious that some of them contain a 3R spirooxindole ring, the opposite of 3S in citrinadins.""All the genes responsible for expressing this small molecule are clustered together in these fungi, so first we found the gene cluster and looked at each gene individually to see which one could be the most important to catalyze the specific chemical transformations,"" she said.""Once we find it, we can take that gene outside of the fungus, put it back into a user-friendly host, E. coli, and then use protein purification technology to isolate and test its function in a test tube,"" Gao said. ""By doing everything outside of the fungus, we can be sure there's only one enzyme that performs this one function.""The modified E. coli express CtdE protein in bulk. When subsequently used in chemical transformations, CtdE catalyzed the desired 3S stereoselectivity across the board. ""A spirooxindole is hard to synthesize already,"" she said. ""Our goal was to understand the mechanism of how the enzyme controls this specific 3S stereochemistry.""Bioinformatic analysis, X-ray crystallography and experiments confirmed that CtdE is solely responsible for catalyzing 3S stereoselectivity, Gao said. (Another enzyme, PhqK, was already known to catalyze 3R orientation.) ""Having a set of two enzymes that give precise control over stereochemistry will eventually improve the synthesis in pharmaceutical production,"" she said.Gao noted that because CtdE works at room temperature, it will help keep chemistry ""green"" as well. ""Hopefully, these biocatalysts will catalyze chemical reactions in a more environmentally friendly way,"" she said.Reference: Liu Z, Zhao F, Zhao B, et al.

For those few vaccinated people who do still get an infection, or  breakthrough  cases, the study suggests that vaccines reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and shorten its duration. Researchers say these results are among the first to show that mRNA vaccination benefits even those individuals who experience breakthrough infections. One of the unique things about this study is that it measured the secondary benefits of the vaccine,  says Sarang Yoon, D.O., a study co-author, assistant professor at the University of Utah Rocky Mountain Center for Occupational and Environmental Health (RMCOEH), and principal investigator of the RECOVER (Research on the Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Essential Response Personnel) study in Utah.The study, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine, builds on preliminary data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March.The study was designed to measure the risks and rates of infection among those on the front lines of the pandemic. We gave these vaccines to some of the highest risk groups in this country doctors, nurses, and first responders,  Yoon says.  These are the people who are getting exposure to the virus day in and day out, and the vaccine protected them against getting the disease. Those who unfortunately got COVID-19 despite being vaccinated were still better off than those who didn t. The study found that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were: The HEROES-RECOVER network recruited 3,975 participants at eight sites. In addition to Salt Lake City, sites included Miami, Florida; Temple, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Duluth, Minnesota; and Phoenix and Tucson, as well as other areas in Arizona. Participants submitted samples for COVID-19 testing on a weekly basis for 17 weeks between Dec. 13, 2020 and April 10, 2021. Participants also reported weekly whether they had COVID-19-like symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and loss of taste and smell.Only 204 (5%) of the participants eventually tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Of these, 156 were unvaccinated, 32 had an indeterminate vaccine status, and 16 were fully or partially vaccinated. The fully or partially vaccinated participants who developed breakthrough had milder symptoms than those who were unvaccinated: These findings also suggest that fully or partially vaccinated individuals who get COVID-19 might be less likely to spread the virus to others. The researchers found that infected study participants who had been fully or partially vaccinated when infected had 40% less detectable virus in the nose and did so for six fewer days compared to those who were unvaccinated.Overall, the researchers conclude the study s findings support the CDC s recommendation to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible. I hope these findings reassure the public that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe and protect us from this severe disease,  Yoon says. The RECOVER study is ongoing, and results from future phases will help determine how long COVID-19 vaccines protect against infection and the real-world effectiveness of newer vaccines. A new study will test the same questions in children 12 and older who are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. The research will also investigate how well COVID-19 vaccines protect against new variants now circulating in the U.S., including the highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.

The device is shown to accurately identify tissues and surgical margins directly in patients and differentiate healthy and cancerous tissue from banked pancreas samples. At about 15 seconds per analysis, the method is more than 100 times as fast as the current gold standard diagnostic, Frozen Section Analysis. The ability to accurately identify margins between healthy and cancerous tissue in pancreatic cancer surgeries can give patients the greatest chance of survival.The results, by a team from The University of Texas at Austin and Baylor College of Medicine, are published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.""These results show the technology works in the clinic for surgical guidance,"" said Livia Schiavinato Eberlin, an assistant professor of chemistry at UT Austin who leads the team that invented the pen, in collaboration with James Suliburk, head of endocrine surgery at Baylor. ""Surgeons can easily integrate the MasSpec Pen into their workflow, and the initial data really supports the diagnostic accuracy we were expecting to achieve.""The most common type of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, spreads rapidly and is highly lethal, with a five-year survival rate of 9% for all stages. The most effective treatment option is surgical removal of the tumor.Cancer surgeons face a dilemma: It's often difficult to tell good tissue from bad. If any cancerous tissue is left behind, there's a risk the tumor will regrow, potentially requiring the patient to undergo additional rounds of surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, and decreasing the chances of survival. On the other hand, removing too much healthy tissue, especially from vital organs, can also compromise a patient's health. Determining the margin between healthy and cancerous tissue is critical to a successful surgery.For this study, the investigators first used the MasSpec Pen to analyze 157 banked human pancreatic tissues to develop and evaluate the technology in the laboratory for pancreatic cancer. Then, the investigators moved the system to the operating room at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, which is affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine, where the surgeons tested the technology in 18 pancreatic surgeries. The pen has been tested in more than 150 human surgeries to date, including for breast and thyroid, and results of those additional tests will be submitted for publication soon.Mary King, a graduate student and the study's first author, and other members of the Eberlin research group operated the mass spectrometer during surgery.A typical surgery to remove a pancreatic tumor can take from 6 to 12 hours.""Surgery of the pancreas is a very complex and detailed surgery that requires numerous intraoperative decisions over several hours that can have long-lasting effects on oncologic outcomes for patients with pancreas cancer,"" said George Van Buren, M.D., associate professor of surgery at Baylor and one of the surgeons who performed operations during the experiment. ""The MasSpec Pen technology opens the door for real-time, precision medicine to be performed in the operating room at a level that has never been seen before.""These are the first published results of intraoperative use of the MasSpec Pen, in other words, on intact or just-removed tissue from patients during surgery. Preclinical research published about the technology in 2017 led to widespread enthusiasm and interest, including from writers in Hollywood who adapted the idea for a segment on the television program ""Grey's Anatomy.""The researchers plan eventually to submit the design to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval as a medical device.Reference: King ME, Zhang J, Lin JQ, et al.

If it occurs too much, it can cause degenerative diseases. Too little, and cells can become tumours. Mitochondria, the power plants of cells, play a role in this programmed cell death. Scientists from the University of Groningen (the Netherlands) and the University of Pittsburgh (U.S.) have obtained new insights in how mitochondria receive the signal to self-destruct. Their results were published in the Journal of Molecular Biology.How does a cell kill itself? The details of this process are still unclear. Patrick van der Wel, associate professor of Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy at the University of Groningen, is working together with colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh to see how cell death is initiated on a molecular level. 'The membranes of mitochondria play a key role', he explains. Cardiolipin, a special type of membrane lipid, acts as an important signal. 'If it gets reshuffled inside the membrane and oxidized, this can trigger cell death.'UnfoldingAnother factor is the small protein cytochrome c. This plays an important role in energy production by mitochondria, but it can also bind to cardiolipin. 'We believe it may control oxidation of the cardiolipin, which is part of the initiation process for programmed cell death', explains Van der Wel. It was previously thought that the unfolding of cytochrome c on the cell membrane was important, as this allows it to oxidize cardiolipin, a step that triggers cell death. However, in a previous paper, Van der Wel and his U.S. colleagues published evidence that cytochrome c is not unfolded.'In our new study, we have looked in even more detail at the interaction between cytochrome c and the mitochondrial membrane', says Van der Wel. They used solid-state NMR to detect the position and the status of all 105 amino acids in the protein. The NMR signals of two connected carbon atoms in an amino acid depend on how they interact with other atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the measured spectrum of the carbon atoms can show in which amino acid they are located. Such information can be used to get an idea of the protein's structure, even if it is not well ordered.Discrepancy'Furthermore, with this technique, an amino acid is only visible in a fixed part of the protein structure. If it is in an unfolded part, it can move more freely and becomes invisible.' Thus, solid-state NMR spectroscopy can show which parts of the protein are folded or unfolded. 'What we saw is that cytochrome c is not fully unfolded when attached to the cardiolipins in the mitochondrial membrane.'Proteins fold in a particular order: the first fold induces a second, third, and so on. 'These steps are called foldons. What we saw in our experiments is that when binding to the membrane, different foldons in cytochrome c unfold at different stages. And some parts do not unfold at all.' This finding explains the discrepancy between the results of Van der Wel and his colleagues and those of previous papers: these studies were too coarse-grained to be able to clearly see which parts of cytochrome c were still folded.DrugsThese results are interesting, as they provide fundamental insight into how programmed cell death is regulated at the molecular level. 'They add to our previous idea that oxidation of cardiolipin by cytochrome c is a very well-controlled, specific process.' Furthermore, knowing which parts of the protein unfold means that it will be possible to develop drugs that stabilize or destabilize them. Such drugs could be used as regulators that could increase or reduce programmed cell death. Van der Wel: 'We would like to use our data to construct a realistic computer model for this protein interaction so that it is possible to design these drugs in silico.'Reference: Li M, Sun W, Tyurin VA, et al.

The discovery could help expedite such research by helping them more accurately identify children with severe malaria. It also reinforces the importance of the World Health Organization's recommendation that all children being treated for severe malaria also receive antibiotics to ensure any misdiagnosed children receive life-saving care.Diagnosing severe malaria in children in Africa is challenging because the parasites that cause malaria can be found in both healthy and severely ill children. This makes it difficult to tell if the parasites or some other condition is causing illness. In fact, many children diagnosed with severe malaria may have other life-threatening infections. In addition to potentially delaying life-saving antibiotic care, misdiagnosis can skew the results of studies of new treatments for malaria because children misdiagnosed with malaria will not respond, which could make drugs that work look ineffective.""Inaccuracy in the diagnosis of severe malaria negatively impacts clinical studies, especially those trying to understand which genes may make people more vulnerable to severe disease, or which treatments are most effective,"" says co-first author James Watson, Senior Scientist at the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) in Bangkok, Thailand. ""We wanted to know whether complete blood count data, notably platelet counts and white blood cell counts, could help make the diagnosis of malaria more accurate.""Watson, along with co-first author Carolyne Ndila, a researcher at The Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP), in Kilifi, Kenya, and their colleagues developed a statistical model that could distinguish between severe malaria and other severe illnesses that can be mistaken as severe malaria. To develop the model they included data from over 1,500 children and adults diagnosed with severe malaria in Thailand and Bangladesh. In these countries, people are rarely misdiagnosed with severe malaria because it is much less common for healthy people to have malaria parasites in their blood.They applied this model, which relied on platelet and white blood cell counts, to a large cohort of Kenyan children diagnosed with severe malaria. Based on their analysis, they estimate that in approximately one-third of the children, severe malaria was in fact a misdiagnosis.""Our results support the current guideline that all children with suspected malaria should be given both antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics, as many of the misdiagnosed children will likely have had bacterial sepsis, a severe blood infection,"" Ndila says.Using their new model to reanalyse data from clinical studies that looked for potential genetic factors that protect against severe malaria, the team also found that people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency probably have some protection from malaria. This benefit was likely obscured in previous studies by the high rate of misdiagnoses.""We hope our new model can be used by other scientists and clinicians to improve the accuracy of diagnosis in children suspected of having severe malaria,"" concludes senior author Nicholas White, Professor of Tropical Medicine at Mahidol University.

Symptoms indicative of COVID-19 infection, including fever, were confirmed by a positive swab test.He was given remdesivir and plasma containing antibodies to SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 infection ( convalescent plasma ): so far, there s little evidence that either of these treatments noticeably speeds up recovery from the infection. Unexpectedly, two days after the transplant, his COVID-19 symptoms cleared up without further worsening of his pneumonia.The second case involved a 19-year-old with a form of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) who was being treated with immune suppressant drugs. He was admitted to hospital because of recurrent C difficile infection.He was treated with antibiotics and given a stool transplant to prevent further recurrence. Fifteen hours later, he developed suspected COVID-19 infection, which was confirmed by a positive swab test.Subsequently, other than two isolated episodes of fever, his COVID-19 symptoms cleared up without being given any specific treatment for them.The stool samples used for the transplant were tested for SARS-CoV2 as were both patients on admission. All the tests came back negative. Our main conclusion from these cases is that [stool transplant] appears safe and of comparable efficacy in treating recurrent [C difficile infection] in patients with coexisting COVID-19.  A further more speculative question is whether [it] may impact the clinical course of COVID-19,  they write. Both patients had risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, yet both patients experienced only mild disease,   with one possible explanation being that [stool transplant] mitigated more adverse outcomes, potentially through impacting microbiome-immune interactions,  they suggest.These patients represent just two cases, making it hard to draw definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of stool transplant to treat COVID-19 infection. But these findings echo those of two similar published cases, say the authors. These data let us speculate that gut microbiome manipulation may merit further exploration as an immunomodulatory strategy in COVID-19,  they write.As such, they plan a clinical trial to find out if stool transplant added to standard COVID-19 treatment might help stop the infection in its tracks.Reference: Bili ski J, Winter K, Jasi ski M, et al.

These findings hold implications for the timing of events in experimental or clinical settings, and suggest new directions for mood interventions tailored to individual patients.People routinely report on their moods during everyday activities and when they interact with clinicians providing mental health care. It is commonly believed that the most recent experiences during a task or interaction with someone else may have the strongest effect on how an individual feels at a given time. But in a series of experiments, researchers show that early experiences can have a more significant impact on someone s mood. The research team included first author and Postdoctoral Research Fellow Hanna Keren and colleagues at the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, US.To address the question of how the timing of an event can impact our current mood, Keren and colleagues began with a computational modelling approach. They developed a novel Primacy model, based on the concept that experiences occurring early in an interaction or game prevail over more recent ones in affecting our mood. They then pitted this model against a Recency model, based on the idea that more recent experiences have a stronger effect on mood. They showed that the Primacy model accounts more for self-reported mood when compared to the Recency and other computational models.They also examined their models in relation to the moods of people of different ages, as well as healthy and depressed participants. To do this, they recruited a group of adult volunteers to participate in an online gambling game with small monetary rewards based on their success in the game. They invited the volunteers to report their moods using a sliding scale at several points during the game. In a second set of experiments, they recruited a group of adolescent volunteers to play a similar game in the laboratory while measuring these participants  brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. They also collected data on whether the participants had depression, as this can also impact an individual s current mood.The researchers found that early events during the game had the greatest impact on mood in both the adolescent and adult groups. This was also true for individuals with and without depression. Their imaging data also suggested that earlier experiences in the game  switched on  parts of the frontal brain associated with moods, rather than later events. These results provided evidence for the neural encoding of the team s Primacy, but not Recency model.Altogether, the findings raise some important questions, such as why adverse experiences early in a task or interaction may have lasting effects on an individual s mood. Future studies assessing the impact of events on mood over longer time periods might help answer these questions.In the meantime, Keren and the team suggest their current work may have implications for the way clinicians providing mental health care interact with patients or assess the effectiveness of their treatment, as the timing of good and bad experiences may affect how patients feel about their treatment.Reference: Keren H, Zheng C, Jangraw DC, et al.

The locating system allows police or security services to match soil remnants found on personal items to regional soil samples, to either implicate or eliminate presence at a crime scene. The work is presented as a Keynote Lecture at the Goldschmidt Geochemistry Conference, after recent publication.Dr Patrice de Caritat, Principal Research Scientist at Geoscience Australia, Australia's public sector geoscience organisation, said: ""We've done the first trials to see if geochemical analysis could narrow down a search area. We took a 260 km2 area of North Canberra and divided it into cells (squares) of 1 km x 1 km, and sampled the soil in each cell. We were then given 3 samples from within the survey area, and asked to identify which grid cells they came from. This was a 'blind' experiment, in other words we did not know where the samples came from until the end of the experiment. For comparison, Manhattan Island is around 60 km2, so that shows that we looked at a pretty big area"". Using these methods, they were able to eliminate 60% of the territory under investigation. Dr de Caritat said ""Much of forensics is about elimination, so being able to rule out 60% of an area is a substantial contribution toward successfully locating a sample. You can reduce the time, risk and investment of the ongoing investigation. The more parameters we look at, the more accurate the system is. We have reached 90% detection in some cases, although we think that would involve too many factors for real-world crime detection"". The team used a range of analytical instrumentation - Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy, X-Ray Fluorescence, Magnetic Susceptibility and Mass Spectrometry to compare the 3 blind samples to the previously collected samples. Dr de Caritat, who is also Adjunct Professor at the National Centre for Forensic Studies at the University of Canberra, said: ""This shows that our systems work, and that we have a potential new tool for criminal and intelligence investigations. It's the next stage which is potentially most interesting. Most developed countries have existing soil databases, used for such things as mineral exploration or land use decision support. We're plugging our methods into these databases to see if we can locate samples from the database information, rather than needing to collect samples specifically for each investigation. Conventional soil analysis has already been used in Australia to identify and prosecute criminals. For example, soil analysis was used to identify the movements of a man who carried out a sexual assault on a young girl in Adelaide. There are several such examples. We now want to take this further"". Dr de Caritat worked with the Australian Federal Police in 2017-18, where he helped them develop their capability to analyse soils for forensic location. He said: ""Geoscience Australia is now working with the Australian Federal Police, the University of Adelaide, Flinders University and the University of Canberra on a Defence Department project to incorporate environmental DNA (e.g. from local plants) and X-Ray Diffraction mineralogy into the soil and dust location system"". Commenting, Professor Jennifer McKinley (Queen's University, Belfast) said 'The breakthrough in Dr de Caritat's work is that it integrates robust compositional data analysis of the multivariate geochemical data into forensic geoscience and applies this in an innovative way to forensic soil provenance'.ReferencesPresented at the Goldschmidt Geochemistry Conference.Caritat P de, Simpson T, Woods B. 2019.

The team found that deficiencies in key genes involved in the pathology triggers neural stem cells to generate less neurons by producing more astrocytes--the brain's maintenance cells.The researchers hope that the molecular pathology they identified, as reported in the journal Cell Reports, can lead to potential therapeutic targets for Rett syndrome in the future.Rett syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in cognition and coordination--with varying severity--and occurs in roughly one in every 10,000 to 15,000 female births. However, it is difficult to initially identify because children appear to develop normally in the first 6-18 months.""Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in a single gene called methyl-CpG binding protein 2, or MeCP2. The gene was identified over two decades ago and much has been uncovered since, but exactly how the mutations cause the pathology remains elusive,"" explains first author Hideyuki Nakashima of Kyushu University's Faculty of Medical SciencesIn their past research, the team had identified that MeCP2 acts as a regulator for the processing of specific microRNAs to control the functions of neurons. So, they went back to investigate if that pathway was also involved in the differentiation of neural stem cells.Compared to messenger RNA, the final template transcribed from DNA that is used by a cell to synthesize proteins, microRNAs--or miRNAs--are much smaller and act to regulate messenger RNA to make sure the cell is making the correct amount of the desired protein.""Through our investigation, we found several microRNAs associated with MeCP2, but only one affected the differentiation of neural stem cells: a microRNA called miR-199a,"" says Nakashima. ""In fact, when either MeCP2 or miR-199a are disrupted, we found that it increased the production of cells called astrocytes.""Astrocytes are like the support cells of your brain. While neurons fire off the electrical signals, astrocytes are there to help maintain everything else. During development, astrocytes and neurons are generated from the same type of stem cells, known as neural stem cells, where their production is carefully controlled. However, dysfunction in MeCP2 or miR-199a causes these stem cells to produce more astrocytes than neurons.""Further analysis showed that miR-199a targets the protein Smad1, a transcription factor critical for proper cellular development. Smad1 functions downstream of a pathway called BMP signaling, which is known to inhibit the production of neurons and facilitate the generation of astrocytes,"" states Nakashima.To investigate the process further, the team established a brain organoid culture--a 3D culture of neural stem cells that can mimic aspects of brain development--from iPS cells derived from patients with Rett syndrome. When they inhibited BMP, short for bone morphogenetic protein, the team was able to reduce abnormal neural stem cell differentiation.""Our findings have given us valuable insight into the role of MeCP2, miR-199a, and BMP signaling in the pathology of Rett syndrome,"" concludes Kinichi Nakashima, who headed the team. ""Further investigation is needed, but we hope this can lead to clinical treatments for Rett syndrome symptoms.""Reference: Nakashima H, Tsujimura K, Irie K, et al.

Corey T. Watson, Ph.D., assistant professor in the University of Louisville Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, is leading a call to actively diversify the genetic resources he and fellow immunogenomics researchers use in their work to advance genomic medicine more equitably.Watson, along with UofL post-doctoral fellow Oscar Rodriguez, Ph.D., and visiting fellow Yana Safonova, Ph.D., are part of an international group of researchers who say the narrow studies limit their ability to identify variation in human adaptive immune responses across populations.""We need to better understand how genetics influences immune system function by studying population cohorts that better represent the diversity observed across the globe if we are to fully understand disease susceptibility, as well as design more tailored treatments and preventative measures,"" Watson said.In an article published in Nature Methods, Diversity in immunogenomics: the value and the challenge, the group advocates for resources used in immunogenomics research to actively include and specifically identify additional populations and minority groups. They say such diversity will make their research more relevant and help in understanding population and ancestry-specific gene-associated disease, leading to improvements in patient care.""As scientists, we have a say in which populations are investigated. Therefore, it is critical for us to be actively inclusive of individuals representative of the world we live in. This is especially critical for genes that are as diverse and clinically relevant as those that encode antibodies and T cell receptors,"" Rodriguez said.Watson's research focuses on immune function and molecular genetics. His team is studying a specific area of the genetic code that controls antibody function to better understand how differences in an individual's genes determine their susceptibility to certain diseases or immune responses to vaccines.In collaboration with Melissa Smith, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, the team is conducting the largest sequencing efforts of the antibody gene regions in humans and in animal models, Watson said.""Specifically in humans, we are working to build catalogs of genetic variation in samples from multiple ethnic backgrounds and are engaged in projects that seek to understand how this genetic variation influences the immune response in infection, vaccination and other disease contexts,"" he said.Watson is involved in efforts to improve the resources and data standards for antibody and T cell receptor genes for immunogenomics researchers around the world.The article in Nature Methods was co-authored by researchers from the United States, Canada, Norway, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Israel, South Africa, Nigeria, Chile, Peru, China, Japan, Taiwan and French Polynesia with expertise in biomedical and translational research, population and public health genetics, health disparities and computational biology as well as immunogenomics.Reference: Peng K, Safonova Y, Shugay M, et al.

The task of AID is to strengthen the human immune response, while APOBECs are able to block the virus. A MedUni Vienna research team comprising Anastasia Meshcheryakova, Diana Mechtcheriakova and Peter Pietschmann from the Institute of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research has now addressed the potential interrelations between AID/APOBECs and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, particularly in connection with the course of COVID-19 in different patients. This could provide a starting point for future clinical strategies to improve and strengthen individual antiviral response. The defence mechanisms associated with AID/APOBECs in response to the coronavirus were assessed on the basis of integrative data mining and gene expression analyses, as part of a study conducted with international partners. It was found that members of the APOBEC family are preferentially expressed in a particular type of cell or tissue: ""However, this does not mean that a particular cell type only expresses a particular member of the APOBEC family but that each cell type exhibits its own characteristic APOBEC repertoire,"" explains Diana Mechtcheriakova.What is completely new is that the researchers found that APOBEC4 is highly expressed in cells and tissues that are points of attack for SARS-CoV-2. These include epithelial cells in the bronchi, in the lungs, in the trachea and in the nose. It was also found that there is an extremely high level of expression of both molecules (one of the members of the APOBEC family and ACE2, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2), in the gastrointestinal tract, in the heart and in the testis. ""Based on this knowledge, the clinical challenge in the future will be to characterise the antiviral cell status attributed to AID/APOBECs specific to patients and/or patient groups and to correlate the cell-type-specific AID/APOBEC gene expression signature with the organs affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19,"" explains Mechtcheriakova. A particular role in this process is attributed to AID, since it co-determines the strength of an adaptive immune response. ""The AID-driven, highly coordinated sequence of events, which all occur in specialised immunological lymphoid structures with germinal centres, results in the production of high-affinity antibodies by plasma cells or memory B cells. These antibodies are directed against the pathogen causing the disease, such as SARS-CoV-2, either in the course of infection or of an immune response to a vaccine,"" explains Anastasia Meshcheryakova. The role of these complex lymphoid structures and of AID is of great importance for our further understanding of the pathobiology of COVID-19, and consequently for the development of new therapeutic approaches. The results of the study have now been published in the journal ""Frontiers in Immunology .

What kills these patients in the end doesn't seem to be the virus itself, but an over-reaction of their immune system that leads to massive inflammation and tissue damage.By studying a type of immune cells called T cells, a team of Gladstone scientists has uncovered fundamental differences between patients who overcome severe COVID-19 and those who succumb to it. The team, working together with researchers from UC San Francisco and Emory University, also found that dying patients harbor relatively large numbers of T cells able to infiltrate the lung, which may contribute to the extensive lung deterioration that is a hallmark of fatal COVID-19.The findings, published in the scientific journal Cell Reports, could pave the way for new treatments. Currently, patients who are hospitalized for severe COVID-19 mostly receive dexamethasone, a drug used to reduce inflammation.""Dexamethasone has been a life saver for many patients,"" says Gladstone Associate Investigator Nadia Roan, PhD, a senior and corresponding author of the study. ""But it is not always sufficient.

We were thrilled because the current treatment options for people with sleep apnoea are limited and can be a painful journey for many,"" he said.These new findings allow researchers to further refine these types of medications so that they have even greater benefit than what has currently been found.""Next, we will look at the effects of these and similar medications over the longer term. We will assess whether we can harness the benefits of one drug without needing to use them both.""Equally, we will test whether these treatments can be combined with other existing medications to see if we can improve their efficacy even more,"" said Professor Eckert.Until now, the main therapy for sleep apnoea involves wearing a mask to bed, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Therapy (CPAP), which benefits millions.However, many people find it uncomfortable and half the people that try it find it hard to tolerate. Plus, the efficacy of second line therapies, such as mouthguards fitted by dentists, can be unpredictable and expensive.Reference: Lim R, Messineo L, Grunstein RR, Carberry JC, Eckert DJ.

Now, scientists from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea have proposed a reaction for the highly selective production of 1-butanol, a valuable alternative fuel, by electrochemical reduction using copper phosphide electrodes. Their findings offer a new insight on the use of Cu-based electrocatalysts for the electroreduction of CO2.Human activities like the burning of coal and fossil fuels have caused CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere, which has significantly affected the Earth s climate. As a result, several scientists are looking for ways to convert CO2 into other valuable organic products, such as 1-butanol, which has shown promise as an alternative fuel for vehicles. This could help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. One method of obtaining useful compounds is by the electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR). Researchers have developed metal-based catalysts that can fulfill this task. However, there is a caveat: most of these catalysts are expensive and produce a variety of products during the reaction, which can be difficult to separate. To solve this problem, a team of researchers led by Prof. Dr. Jaeyoung Lee and comprising Mr. Minjun Choi, Dr. Jin Won Kim, and Prof. Sungyool Bong from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea came up with a procedure that directly generates 1-butanol with the help of copper phosphide (CuP2) without first undergoing CO dimerization.  We are trying to develop a Cu-based electrode for electrochemical conversion of CO2 that avoids *CO dimerization and can help us increase the selectivity of the product so that additional power consumption from separation processes can be avoided,  explains Mr. Minjun Choi, a Ph.D. student at the university and the paper s first author. Their research has recently been published in volume 6 (issue 6) of the journal ACS Energy Letters on 11 June 2021 and has been available online since 11 May 2021. Even though numerous copper-based electrocatalysts exist today, this is among the first instances in which CuP2 has been used to develop an electrocatalyst that is highly product-selective. It induces a C-C coupling reaction and circumvents the formation of CO, which is known to be a critical intermediate for Cu-based systems. The researchers confirmed this by using surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to show that their CuP2 electrocatalyst yielded the desired product, 1-butanol, with a remarkably high Faradaic efficiency of >3%. The team is excited about the implications of their findings.  Our goal is to design new electrodes that are stackable, that can increase production rates, and that can promote conversion efficiency so that we can make our goal of converting and using CO2 as a fuel in reality,"" concludes Prof. Lee.ReferenceChoi M et al.

Plants utilize sunlight to grow through the process of photosynthesis where light energy is converted to chemical energy in chloroplasts, the powerhouses of plant cells. Therefore, the amount and quality of light perceived by chloroplasts through light absorbing pigments, such as chlorophyll, is a defining factor in plant growth and health. A substantial amount of the chemical compounds produced during the conversion of light energy to chemical energy, termed photoassimilates (mainly sugars), is translocated to the plant root compartment and invested in the surrounding soil to sustain microbial growth. Consequently, roots harbour complex microbial communities of bacteria and filamentous eukaryotes (i.e., fungi and oomycetes), and the composition of these communities profoundly influences plant performance. However, the extent to which plants can take advantage of belowground microbes to orchestrate aboveground stress responses remains largely unexplored. Now, in a new study published in Nature Plants, St phane Hacquard and his colleagues from the Department of Plant-Microbe Interactions at the MPIPZ in Cologne, Germany, shed light on these aboveground-belowground connections.To tackle this question, the first author of the study Shiji Hou performed experiments where the aboveground light conditions and the belowground microbial conditions could be controlled. By comparing the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana (Thale Cress) grown in the absence of root microbes (i.e., germ-free) to those colonized by a complex community of 183 bacteria, 24 fungi and 7 oomycetes, the researchers observed that the presence of microbes rescued the plant growth-deficiency observed under low light conditions. Inoculation experiments with leaf pathogens further indicated that plants colonized by microbes were also more resistant to aboveground leaf pathogens than germ-free control plants, indicating that the presence of root microbes can promote both plant growth and defense under low light.By comparing growth and defense responses of colonized plants between the two light conditions, the scientists observed that investment in growth under low light conditions came at the cost of defense, since microbiota-induced defense responses were reduced and plants were more susceptible to leaf pathogens under low light. Based on this observation, the authors of the study then hypothesized that when light conditions are suboptimal, plants favor microbe-induced growth over microbe-induced defense responses. To test this hypothesis, the researchers screened different A. thaliana mutants to identify those that failed to invest in growth under low light. Consistent with their hypothesis, the identified mutants were better at resisting leaf pathogens instead. Furthermore, the scientists found that the presence of the host transcription factor MYC2 was crucial to tip the balance in favor of microbiota-induced growth instead of microbiota-induced defense under low light conditions.The researchers then went on to investigate whether the make-up of the microbial community belowground could explain aboveground investment in growth at the expense of defense under low light. To do this, they analyzed the composition of the root microbiota across the different A. thaliana mutants and observed that the bacterial community composition was markedly different depending on whether the different plants invested in growth under low light. This experiment led to the identification of 67 bacterial strains that were predicted to be associated with plant growth rescue under low light. To test a potential causal link, the researchers prepared three different bacterial communities composed of either: 1) all 183 strains, 2) the 183 strains lacking the 67 strains predicted to be important for growth rescue or 3) the 67 strains alone. Remarkably, A. thaliana wild-type plants colonized with the 67-member community invested in growth under low light, whereas those colonized by the community lacking these bacterial strains did not, instead favoring better resistance to leaf infection by pathogens.In the words of study lead St phane Hacquard: ""Our results suggest that plant growth and defense responses are engaged in different feedback loops with the root microbiota depending on aboveground light conditions. It is likely that light-induced change in root exudation profiles is an important mechanism that stimulates the growth of particular beneficial bacterial root commensals that boost plant growth, in the expense of defense responses under low light"". The observation that microbiota-root-shoot-circuits exist in plants is reminiscent of recent results obtained in the context of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in animals, where a direct link between gut commensals and brain functions was uncovered. The results suggest that bacterial root and gut commensals have important functions in modulating stress responses not only locally, but also in distant host organs.These findings have important applications for utilizing belowground microbes to promote aboveground stress responses in plants. By applying the knowledge gained in this study it would now be conceivable to design synthetic microbial communities with modular functions that could be used to promote plant resistance to particular biotic or abiotic stresses, and ultimately promote plant health in nature.Reference: Hou S, Thiergart T, Vannier N, et al.

In a review of evidence, the researchers point to four factors.Professor Rook added: ""So cleaning the home is good, and personal cleanliness is good, but, as explained in some detail in the paper, to prevent spread of infection it needs to be targeted to hands and surfaces most often involved in infection transmission.

And damage to the membrane can be life threatening. The interior of cells is fluid, and if a hole is made in the membrane, the cell simply floats out and dies - a bit like a hole in a water balloon.Therefore, damage to the cell membrane must be repaired quickly, and now research from a team of Danish researchers shows that cancer cells use a technique called macropinocytosis. The technique, which is already a known tool for cells in other contexts, consists in the cancer cells pulling the intact cell membrane in over the damaged area and sealing the hole in a matter of minutes. Next, the damaged part of the cell membrane is separated into small spheres and transported to the cells' 'stomach' - the so-called lysosomes, where they are broken down.In the laboratory, the researchers damaged the membrane of the cancer cells using a laser that shoots small holes in the membrane and triggers macropinocytosis. Here they can see that if the process is inhibited with substances blocking the formation of the small membrane spheres, the cancer cell can no longer repair the damage and dies.""Our research provides very basic knowledge about how cancer cells survive. In our experiments, we have also shown that cancer cells die if the process is inhibited, and this points towards macropinocytosis as a target for future treatment. It is a long-term perspective, but it is interesting,"" says group leader Jesper Nylandsted from the Danish Cancer Society's Research Center and the University of Copenhagen, who has headed the new research and who for many years has investigated how cancer cells repair their membranes.

Importantly, CPAP loss-associated EMT features and invasiveness of multiple OSCC cells were attenuated upon depletion of EGFR in them.On the other hand, they found that CPAP protein levels were higher in EGF treated OSCC cells as well as in oral cancer tissues, suggesting that the frequently reported aberrant centriolar features of tumors are potentially a consequence, but not the cause, of tumor progression.Overall, these novel observations show that, in addition to its known indispensable role in centrosome biogenesis, CPAP also plays a vital role in suppressing tumorigenesis in OSCC by facilitating EGFR homeostasis.Dr. Radhika Gudi and Dr. Chenthamarakshan Vasu from The Medical University of South Carolina said, ""Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents the sixth most common cancer with more than 600,000 new patients diagnosed worldwide and it is linked to more than 300,000 deaths every year.""EGFR is significantly altered in OSCC and its prolonged signaling is mitogenic, driving uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells.Despite these advances in the understanding of EGFR signaling, the regulatory mechanisms underlying EGFR signaling and their effects on cancer initiation, progression and metastasis are not fully understood.Recent studies have shown that microtubule inhibition causes EGFR inactivation or increases the sensitivity to EGFR targeting drugs in various cancers including OSCC.Microtubules and microtubule-organizing centers have multiple roles in cellular functions including homeostasis of cell signaling, formation of cilia, cytoskeletal actin organization, and centrosome/centriole duplication and normal cell division.Paradoxically, however, they show not only that EGFR signaling, which is known to contribute to EMT, upregulates the cellular levels of CPAP in OSCC cells, but also detected higher CPAP protein levels in OSCC tumors.The Gudi/Vasu Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that while it has been reported before that EGF stimulation endows OSCC cells with stem cell-like properties, increased invasiveness, and tumorigenic properties, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of EGF induced EMT and tumorigenicity were not known.Hence, this study does begin to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which centrosome/MTOC associated proteins are involved in preventing tumorigenesis.Nevertheless, additional studies are needed in the future to address the mechanism by which CPAP suppresses EGFR dependent EMT and tumorigenesis.Reference: Gudi RR, Janakiraman H, Howe PH, Palanisamy V, Vasu C.

One reason it is so difficult to treat brain tumors is that the immune system, which is designed to find and destroy foreign cells, including cancer cells, has difficulty accessing the tumor due to the barriers that exist around the brain. In order for immune cells called killer T cells to fight a growing tumor, they must first be activated against the tumor in our lymph nodes, then move to the tumor and kill the cancer cells. Due to the barriers around the brain, it is difficult for the immune cells to get through.In the research article now published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers describe their discovery that there are lymph node-like structures in the brain as well, where killer T cells could be activated.""It was very exciting to find lymph node-like structures in glioma patients for the first time.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, enters the host cells through interaction between the virus s spike protein and the extracellular receptor binding domain of ACE2. The viral entry into the cells is completed by various proteases, which allow the viral and cell membranes to fuse together. While it is known that the upper respiratory tract becomes compromised in the early infection, the exact types of the cells that the virus infects at the earliest stage have not yet been identified.Led by Director KOH Gou Young, scientists from the Center for Vascular Research within the Institute for Basic Science, South Korea, have recently uncovered the processes involved in the earliest stages of COVID-19 infection. The group accomplished this by combining immunofluorescence staining (IFS) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the molecules that are involved in the viral entry process. Through this, Koh and his colleagues identified the exact target of the coronavirus at the cellular level by comparing the results of the subjects infected with COVID-19 with those of healthy controls.The researchers first looked for the presence of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN, which are the predominant SARS-CoV-2 entry-related molecules, on the surfaces of various types of cells in the nasal epithelium. It was found that these proteins were present in high quantities on ciliated cells. Moreover, the apical (upper) sides of these cells showed higher levels of these molecules in comparison to the basal (bottom) side. The levels of these proteins were highest in fully differentiated multiciliated cells. On the other hand, viral entry proteins were not found in the undifferentiated epithelial cells or secretory cells such as the goblet cells.Next, the researchers further studied these nasal epithelial cells using scRNA-seq and visualized the cells into different clusters using UMAP. Samples were collected from 4 patients on the first day of their COVID-19 diagnosis, which were compared against 2 samples from healthy donors. It was found that the fraction of multicilial cells was greatly reduced in the samples from infected patients, while there was an increase in the secretory cells and differentiating cells. This hinted that multicilial cells were the first to be attacked and killed off by the virus, which are then replaced by the latter types of cells.The study also measured the level of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA transcripts within the various types of cells. Among all the epithelial cells in COVID-19 infected patients, 38% of the cells were labeled as SARS-CoV-2hi cells. Up to 75% of the detected genes in these cells were of viral origin, compared to less than 1% for other clusters of cells. This means that these cells serve as the main factories for the mass production of SARS-CoV-2 viruses. While it was not possible to directly identify these cells through RNA seq due to the fact that they primarily produce viral mRNA, the researchers employed pseudo-time-trajectory analysis to predict their differentiation paths. The differentiation trajectory showed that SARS-CoV-2hi cells likely originated from ciliated cells. Further IFS analysis on the infected patients  samples conclusively determined that up to 85% of SARS-CoV-2 factories were in fact multiciliated cells.This study was able to determine that multiciliated cells in the nasal epithelium are the first cells that are targeted in the early COVID-19 infection. This implies that targeting these cells using specific treatments, such as through nasal sprays, can be an ideal strategy to curb COVID-19 infection in the early stages.Reference: Ahn JH, Kim J, Hong SP, et al.

The shape memory means this structure is retained when the scaffold is implanted into tissues, and this supports the infiltration of cells into the scaffold while encouraging tissue regeneration and revascularisation.""The scaffolds were created using 3D printing resin 'inks' developed during a major programme of biomaterials research led by Professor Andrew Dove at the University of Birmingham and Warwick University. The resins are being commercialised under the tradename 4Degra  by 4D Biomaterials, a spinout from University of Birmingham Enterprise and Warwick Innovations that was launched in May 2020.The scaffolds showed several major advantages over current approaches used to fill soft tissue voids that remain after trauma or surgery, including sufficient elasticity to conform to irregular spaces, the ability to undergo compression of up to 85% before returning to their original geometry, compatibility with tissues, and non-toxic biodegradation.The paper describes several compositions for the 4Degra  resins that enable materials of a wide range of strengths to be manufactured. All of the compositions include a photoinitiator and a photoinhibitor to ensure the resins rapidly turn into gel on exposure to light in the visible spectrum to enable their 3D printing into a range of scaffold geometries.The researchers showed that the materials were non toxic to cells and they also performed mechanical testing to ensure the scaffolds could regain their shape, geometry and pore size after compression, and performed tests that showed the scaffolds can fill an irregular shaped void in alginate gel which was used as a mimic of soft tissue.Laboratory studies demonstrated that the scaffold degrades by surface erosion into non-acidic products, which means the scaffold structure allows for slow, continuous tissue infiltration.The findings were confirmed in a mouse model that simulates implantation into adipose (fat) tissue. These studies showed infiltration of adipocytes and fibroblasts and vascularisation at two months, and a tissue arrangement and macrophage presence that was indicative of normal tissue restoration rather than damaged, scarred tissue or an inflammatory response.At four months, the researchers found small, mature blood vessels in the surrounding tissue. The scaffolds also demonstrated excellent biocompatibility. The collagen capsule formed around implants was less than 200  m thick, which is well below the 500  m threshold used for biocompatibility in other studies, and there was no calcification or necrosis.Also at four months, 80% of the scaffold was still present, demonstrating the slow degradation predicted by the laboratory studies, and indicating the scaffolds would provide support for more than a year, allowing sufficient time for mature tissue ingrowth. The controls, which used poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) as a comparator, did not show a significant reduction over the four month period.Professor Dove comments: ""3D printed materials have received a lot of attention in the tissue engineering world. However void-filling materials to provide mechanical support, biocompatibility, and surface erosion characteristics that ensure consistent tissue support during the healing process, and this means a fourth dimension (time) needs to be considered in material design.""We have demonstrated that it's possible to produce highly porous scaffolds with shape memory, and our processes and materials will enable production of self-fitting scaffolds that take on soft tissue void geometry in a minimally invasive surgery without deforming or applying pressure to the surrounding tissues. Over time, the scaffold erodes with minimal swelling, allowing slow continuous tissue infiltration without mechanical degradation.""4D Biomaterials has made fast progress in scaling up production of the 4Degra  resin-inks at its laboratory in MediCity, Nottingham (UK) and is now offering technical grade material for commercial supply to 3D printing companies and medical device manufacturers.CEO Phil Smith said ""We are looking to collaborate with innovative companies in Europe and North America to develop a new generation of 3D-printed medical devices that translate the unique advantages of the 4Degra  resin-ink platform into improved treatment outcomes for patients"". With the first customer shipments dispatched and a funding round about to close, Phil added ""We will be making further announcements shortly.""Reference: Weems AC, Arno MC, Yu W, Huckstepp RTR, Dove AP. 4D polycarbonates via stereolithography as scaffolds for soft tissue repair.

""It's a very well-known concept that dopamine is involved in learning. But the knowledge about dopamine in areas related to sensory processing in the brain is limited. We wanted to understand whether dopamine was playing a role in how this brain region learns new sounds or changes with sounds.""Studying vocal learning in songbirds provides insight into how spoken language is learned, adds behavioral neuroscientist Remage-Healey, professor of psychological and brain sciences. ""It's not just the songbird that comes up with this strategy of binding sounds and meaning using dopamine. There's something parallel here that we  - as humans - are interested in.""The research team conducted a range of experiments in vitro and in vivo, poking neurons under the microscope and in the brains of live birds that were watching videos and hearing sounds. Ultimately, the scientists obtained anatomical, behavioral and physiological evidence to support their hypothesis about the role of dopamine.Using antibodies, the researchers showed that dopamine receptors are present in many types of neurons in the songbird auditory brain  - they can be inhibitory or excitatory and may also contain an enzyme that produces estrogens. ""Dr. Remage-Healey's research has shown that in the auditory brain of songbirds of both sexes, neurons produce estrogen in social situations, like when listening to birdsong or seeing another bird. We think that dopamine and estrogens might be working together in the sound learning process, but this work focused on dopamine because there was still so much we didn't know about how dopamine affected the songbird brain,"" explains Macedo-Lima, now a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland.Macedo-Lima developed a test, similar to the well-known Pavlov's dog experiment, in which the birds sat alone in a chamber and were presented with a random sound followed immediately by a silent video of other birds. ""We wanted to focus on the association between a meaningless sound - a tone - and the behaviorally relevant thing, which is another bird on video,"" he says.The researchers looked at the birds' auditory brain regions after this sound-video pairing, using a gene marker known to be expressed when a neuron goes through change or plasticity. ""We found this very interesting increase in this gene expression in the left hemisphere, the ventral part of the auditory region, in dopamine receptor-expressing neurons, reflecting the learning process, and paralleling human brain lateralization for speech learning,"" Macedo-Lima says.To show the effect of dopamine on the basic signaling of neurons, the researchers used a whole cell patch clamp technique, controlling and measuring the currents the neurons received. They found in a dish that dopamine activation decreases inhibition and increases excitation.""This one modulator is tuning the system in a way that ramps down the stop signals and ramps up the go signals,"" Remage-Healey explains. ""That's a simple yet powerful control mechanism for how animals are potentially encoding sound. It's a neurochemical lever that can change how stimuli are registered and passed on in this part of the brain.""The team then painlessly probed the brain cells of live birds. ""What happened when we delivered dopamine was exactly as we were predicting from the whole cell data,"" Macedo-Lima says. ""We saw that inhibitory neurons fired less when we delivered the dopamine agonist, while the excitatory neurons fired more.""The same effect occurred when the birds were played birdsong from other songbirds - the excitatory neurons responded more and the inhibitory neurons responded less when dopamine activation occurred. ""We were happy to replicate what we saw in a dish in a live animal listening to actual relevant sounds,"" Macedo-Lima says.Dopamine activation also made these neurons unable to adapt to new songs presented to the animal, which strongly corroborates the hypothesis of dopamine's role in sensory learning. ""We currently don't know how dopamine affects sensory learning in most animals,"" Macedo-Lima says, ""but this research gives many clues about how this mechanism could work across vertebrates that need to learn complex sounds, such as humans.""Reference: Macedo-Lima M, Boyd HM, Remage-Healey L.

The molecule, known as DAF, increases disease severity in mice upon infection with Influenza A virus, the most prevalent cause of the seasonal flu. Understanding this novel virulence mechanism of influenza and identifying the intrinsic factors that determine disease severity opens new possibilities for finding therapeutic targets for resilience to viral infections.The seasonal flu kills up to 600 000 people a year worldwide and has a century-long history of pandemics. Examples include the Spanish flu in the late 1910's or the H1N1 in 2009, which together claimed more than 50 million lives. ""The way the stage is set tells us that it is not a matter of if but rather of when there will be a next pandemic. And preparing ourselves for that demands intensive fundamental research and constant accumulation of knowledge about these viruses and the diseases they cause"", says Maria Jo o Amorim, IGC principal investigator and leader of the team that conducted the study.When a virus like influenza enters our lungs, it is quickly faced with cocktails of molecules that recognize it and alert the host of its presence. Signals flow back and activate the immune response, calling in an army of cells and inflammation sidekicks. Any exaggeration can destabilize the equilibrium needed to clear the virus and spare our tissues from damage. For most people, clearance arrives a few days after infection and leaves very few traces. But for some, influenza infection entails severe complications, resulting from an exacerbated response that damages the lungs.""We found that DAF, which stands for decay accelerating factor, aggravates influenza A infection and increases damage to the lungs in mice. This virulence mechanism of influenza, and the molecular regulation that underpins it, are new for us"", Maria Jo o Amorim reveals. DAF is a receptor found at the surface of most cells that functions to protect them from being attacked by one of our own immune surveillance systems--the complement. This system protects us against invading pathogens once it detects them in circulation, by inactivating the pathogen itself, or inside infected cells, by mounting a strategy to eliminate them.""But this can work as double-edged sword because if complement destroys cells from the host, there is the associated danger of provoking excessive self-injury by eliminating too many bystander cells and promoting inflammation. In fact, disease severity and mortality have been associated with both lack or excess of complement activation, which is tuned by regulators such as DAF"", remarks Nuno Santos, first author of the study. Contrary to expectations, the team found that influenza A virus exploits DAF to potentiate complement activation as an immune evasion mechanism, increasing the recruitment of immune cells. ""By doing so, it can exacerbate the immune response, and this is what damages the lungs. Remarkably, this occurs in a way that is independent of viral load, telling us that it directly affects resilience to infection"", says Zo  Vaz da Silva, coauthor of the study.The role of DAF upon influenza infection can depend on how it interacts with some parts of the virus, leading to more or less aggravated responses. ""The complement system is important, but not the only component that determines the outcome of the infection. These interactions have functional implications and are an unprecedented way of a virus, via altering a host protein from within the infected cell, to modulate the immune response. Studying this further in the future is crucial"", Maria Jo o Amorim says.Reference: Santos NB, Silva ZEV da, Gomes C, Reis CA, Amorim MJ.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/consumers-complicit-in-the-failure-of-healthy-eating-campaigns-350514,Consumers Complicit in the Failure of Healthy Eating Campaigns In Britain   Healthy eating  campaigns have largely failed since the     s because consumers have adapted confusing advice  and incorporated fast and convenience foods into self defined  balanced  lifestyles  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Supermarkets and food manufacturers have been excessively blamed for Britain s unhealthy eating habits since the 1980s, according to Cambridge historian Dr Katrina-Louise Moseley.In an article published in Contemporary British History, Moseley argues that far from being passive victims of manipulation in this period, consumers were  complicit  in long-term behavioural shifts, proactively selecting, rejecting and sweetening advice from the government, the food industry and the media to fit their circumstances and to satisfy their appetites.Rather than seeking to cast blame, Moseley asserts that we should think more carefully about how people rationalise their eating behaviours and interpret advice about food. Speaking ahead of a public event entitled 'Food on the Move' (9 July 2021), Moseley added that this is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a dramatic impact on eating behaviours. Food is a powerful coping mechanism in times of emotional distress, so it isn t surprising that people have been buying extra packets of their favourite snack or eating more takeaways. I m interested in the psychology of consumption and getting away from moralising language around food, which can be damaging , Moseley said. As part of the event, hosted by the University of Warwick, Moseley invites readers to complete an anonymous survey (closes 9 July 2021) to reflect on how their own food practices have changed during the pandemic.In her article, Moseley contrasts the success of Britain s anti-smoking campaign, which transformed attitudes to tobacco in the 1960s and 70s, with the failure of the  healthy eating  campaign to counteract rising levels of obesity from the late 1980s onwards.Moseley said:  The state faced a really difficult task.  Don t smoke  was a clear-cut message but you can t tell people not to eat. Food can't be rejected outright, it has to remain a part of everyday life, and that makes it so much more complicated. We re still really struggling with this today. The historian makes fresh use of consumer interviews and surveys conducted in England and Wales in the 1980s and 90s. These include a Mass Observation directive questionnaire on  Food and Drink  completed in 1982; interviews and participant observations gathered from 1992 96 in response to the 1992 Health of the Nation report; and a collection of life history interviews undertaken with a sample of older people in 2017 18. Moseley argues that a major problem facing Britain s  healthy eating  campaign has been its reliance, often unavoidable, on malleable language. Words like  balance  and  moderation  left themselves open to subjective interpretation. Moseley said:  These records reveal all kinds of people, not just the less affluent, leaning towards convenience foods while still trying to define their lifestyles as healthy. Looking at the 1982 questionnaire records, Moseley found that attitudes to convenience foods were 'shot through with contradictions'. Speaking for herself and her husband, one female respondent claimed,  neither of us can bear ready-made frozen dinners    but she made  an exception for certain things from Marks & Spencer   their frozen cod in parsley sauce is palatable and their cauliflower cheese makes me a quick solo meal if Neil is out for the evening. Moseley said:  For health enthusiasts and cynics alike, official information about food didn t always feel correct. Consumers continued to assert that foods had different effects on different individuals, that one could be overweight whilst leading a healthy lifestyle, and that   in the midst of a dizzying array of information, self-evaluation was key.  The study describes how supermarkets and food manufacturers seized on the idea of  healthy eating  in the 1980s in response to new nutritional guidelines being issued. In 1984, Heinz began a 25-year-programme to reduce salt and sugar in its products; and in 1986 Mars produced a pamphlet entitled  Confectionary in a Healthy Diet . Meanwhile Tesco and Sainsbury's turned their attention to nutritional labelling.Moseley said:  We underestimate what a pivotal role the convenience foods sector played in producing and disseminating knowledge about  healthy eating  in this period. Sometimes, as with Findus  calorie-controlled ready meals, it was the food industry rather than politicians or doctors that gave people usable, workable public health messages. But increasingly people came to view big food companies, government and public health experts as one and the same: a mysterious force manipulating consumer behaviour.  Testimonies collected in the 1980s and 90s emphasise that new jargon baffled many consumers. Puzzling over the term  polyunsaturated margarine , one respondent to the 1980s questionnaire said:  I understand that poly means many and unsaturated means not chock full of something, so what is margarine poly unsaturated with or not with?  In 1985, a market research study of nearly 1,500 consumers in England and Wales found that 43% were uncertain whether saturated or polyunsaturated fat was better for them. Moseley said:  Terms like  E-numbers  and  saturated fats  entered public discourse but that didn t mean that everyone understood or accepted health advice, let alone changed their behaviours. Naturally, people embraced foods that made their lives easier and their mealtimes tastier, often using the language of  moderation  to justify the consumption of highly processed, time-saving foods. The study examines the rise of scepticism as consumers felt overloaded with confusing, contradictory and unreliable  healthy eating  messages. The 1992 96 interviews reveal that consumers became increasingly committed to using their  common sense  when thinking about food. Moseley said:  Consumers didn t respond as authorities hoped they would, but they weren t irrational or lacking in judgement. People subscribed to their own, highly personalized logics. One 1992 96 interviewee said:  some days you just want mashed potatoes and I m not going to feel bad about that because with the rest of my life  it s balanced .  Interviewees also sought reassurance from their childhood eating habits or those of older relatives, saying things like:  Nan lived to a good old age  or  it didn t seem to do us much harm at the time .Testimonies from the 1990s also reveal the emergence of a new language linking food and feeling. One woman defined healthy eating as  that difference between  getting a good feeling from what you eat and getting this sort of not very nice feeling .  Cheese especially  made another young woman feel  so ugh   you know it makes me feel so fat and just weighs me down . She added that she felt  much healthier and brighter  if she avoided it. Moseley said:  The idea that different foods might cause individuals to feel a certain way in their bodies prefigured a major shift towards self-diagnosed food intolerances in the early twenty-first century. The study accepts that some positive health trends did come about in the late 20th century but points out that consumers favoured easier quick-fixes like switching to brown bread and semi-skimmed milk, over sweeping dietary transformations. Moseley said:  Medical researchers remain very worried about public scepticism, but their studies tend to lack historical context. Thinking about the history of trust and cynicism alongside developments in public health can help us understand and reconstruct the bigger picture. Reflecting on Britain s food culture today, Moseley points out that economic, social and geographic constraints on  healthy  choices lack public visibility: factors like deprivation, time poverty, and mental illness delimit the choices that consumers feel able to make. She said:  Too often, health education campaigns promote  informed  decision making around food, as if social and economic disparities do not exist. Food has long been a site of inequality in Britain, and unfortunately it remains so today. Reference: Moseley K-L.

This universality suggests they may have a biological origin and purpose, but exactly what this could be has been largely unexplored.""Adhering to a preregistered protocol, we investigated the hypothesis that thanatosis is the evolutionary origin of near-death experiences"", says Daniel Kondziella, a neurologist from Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital.When attacked by a predator, as a last resort defense mechanism, animals can feign death to improve their chances of survival, one example being the opossum. This phenomenon is termed thanatosis, also known as death-feigning or tonic immobility. ""As a survival strategy,"" Daniel Kondziella adds, ""thanatosis is probably as old as the fight-or-flight response.""Charlotte Martial, neuropsychologist from the Coma Science Group at ULi ge explains: ""We first show that thanatosis is a highly preserved survival strategy occurring at all major nodes in a cladogram ranging from insects to fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans. We then show that humans under attack by big animals such as lions or grizzly bears, human predators such as sexual offenders, and 'modern' predators such as cars in traffic accidents can experience both thanatosis and near-death experiences. Furthermore, we show that the phenomenology and the effects of thanatosis and near-death experiences overlap.""Steven Laureys, neurologist and head of GIGA Consciousness research unit and Centre du Cerveau (ULi ge, CHU Li ge) is excited: ""In this paper, we build a line of evidence suggesting that thanatosis is the evolutionary foundation of near-death experiences and that their shared biological purpose is the benefit of survival.""The authors propose that the acquisition of language enabled humans to transform these events from relatively stereotyped death-feigning under predatory attacks into the rich perceptions that form near-death experiences and extend to non-predatory situations.""Of note, the proposed cerebral mechanisms behind death-feigning are not unlike those that have been suggested to induce near-death experiences, including intrusion of rapid eye movement sleep into wakefulness,"" Daniel Kondziella explains. ""This further strengthens the idea that evolutionary mechanisms are an important piece of information needed to develop a complete biological framework for near-death experiences.""No previous work has tried to provide such a phylogenetic basis. Steven Laureys concludes, ""this may also be the first time we can assign a biological purpose to near-death experiences, which would be the benefit of survival.""And Daniel Kondziella adds, ""after all, near-death experiences are by definition events that are always survived, without exception.""Reference: Peinkhofer C, Martial C, Cassol H, Laureys S, Kondziella D.

A new study shows that ECM can also regulate the function of epithelial cells.Our tissues constitute of differentiated cell types, which perform specific tasks that are tightly controlled. Normal growth and functioning of tissues is possible only when the various differentiated cell types interact appropriately. Differentiation and function of breast epithelium is guided by a group of cells responsive for estrogen and progesterone hormones. In the recent study it was found that these cells produce an ECM protein into their surroundings, and it regulates the growth and differentiation of the epithelium from outside the cells. Especially, the production of this protein, Lama5, was found to strengthen the functionality of these cells.Hormone responsive cells can sense growth signals, such as cues from hormones and growth factors, and relay them into neighboring cells. When Lama5 gene was deleted from these cells, they became unable to relay these signals and halted the growth of the entire epithelium.""This study shows that the extracellular environment produced by the cells themselves is an important factor for the identity and function of epithelial cells, and therefore for the whole tissue"", says assistant professor Pekka Katajisto from University of Helsinki.

Our findings provide evidence that GBM might be influencing the state of tumor infiltrating CD4+ T cells by epigenetic modification in the form of DNA methylation of key immune function regulating genes and influencing the fate of helper T cells in the GBM TME. Based on our observations we believe that perhaps epigenetic interaction between GBM and tumor infiltrating CD4+ T cells is responsible for the immunosuppressed state seen in the GBM patients. Our data convincingly show that there is significant inter-patient variability in the GBM tumor ligand expression of various T-cell modulating ligands and consequently striking differences in the methylation pattern and gene expression in tumor infiltrating CD4+ T-cells. This has a very strong implication for selecting future patients for immunotherapy trials who will have better likelihood of responding to immunotherapy than others based on their tumor immune signature.

This is also true of diverse aspects of the sensory systems that enable species to perceive their surroundings. In the case of the visual system, these adaptations have shaped features such as the positioning of the eyes and the relative acuity of different regions of the retina.However, our knowledge of the functional evolution of visual systems in mammals has remained relatively sparse. ""In the past 10 or 15 years, the mouse has become the favored model for the investigation of the processing of visual information,"" says Professor Laura Busse of the Department of Biology II at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich. ""That's a somewhat surprising development, given that it was previously thought that these rodents primarily sensed the world using their whisker system and smell."" However, color vision in mammals is known to have an effect on the ability to find food, evade predators, and choose mating partners.""It occurred to us that we don't really know how mice perceive their natural environment visually,"" says Busse, who is a member of the transregional Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1233  on ""Robust Vision"". Here, the term ""robust"" refers the fact that animals (including humans) are able to draw inferences from limited amounts of visual information, even in environments that are constantly changing.

It holds fundraisers and connects with the public through social media, its website and email campaigns. Their  Monarch Story Campaign  asked donors to visit the EDF website and share their own stories about monarchs.People shared nearly 700 stories about their memories of monarchs in childhood and as adults. The stories described powerful feelings and joyous memories of personal encounters with  beautiful  monarchs and their  awe-inspiring  qualities. In addition, their stories raised conservation themes about monarch loss, the need for caretaking and calls for environmental action, the findings showed.Sharing personal encounters was associated with efforts to save the species, such as planting milkweed for feeding monarchs. Other contributors described personal experiences with monarchs in yards and gardens and with mass migration. Describing personal experiences with monarchs was associated with more financial donations, the study indicated. Drawing on personal experiences with wildlife builds awareness and associations with species that may increase later motivation to help in their conservation,  said U-M psychology professor Stephanie Preston, the study s lead author.This means interaction with local species in science classes and outdoor experiences may build lifelong awareness, concern and actions for the environment, the researchers said. Fostering memorable one-on-one encounters between species may build personal engagement and create future conservationists,  said co-author and U-M psychology professor Colleen Seifert.Reference: Preston SD, Liao JD, Toombs TP, Romero-Canyas R, Speiser J, Seifert CM.

In the global oceans however, this element is scarce, and nitrogen availability is therefore critical for the growth of marine life. Some bacteria found in marine waters can convert nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonia (known as N2 fixation), and thereby supply the marine food web with nitrogen. It has puzzled scientists for years whether and how bacteria, that live from dissolved organic matter in marine waters, can carry out N2 fixation. It was assumed that the high levels of oxygen combined with the low amount of dissolved organic matter in the marine water column would prevent the anaerobic and energy consuming N2 fixation. Already in the 1980s it was suggested that aggregates, so-called  marine snow particles , could possibly be suitable sites for N2 fixation, but this was never proven. Until now... In a new study, researchers from the University of Copenhagen demonstrate, by use of mathematical models, that microbial fixation of nitrogen can take place on these aggregates of live and dead organisms in the marine plankton. The study has just been published in the prestigious Nature Communications.  Our work took almost two years, but it was definitely worth the effort, since the results are quite a breakthrough. In close collaboration with our research collaborators at the Center for Ocean Life at DTU Aqua and in the USA, we managed to create a model mimicking conditions on marine snow particles. With this model, we show that a marine particle can become densely colonized by bacteria. This growth of bacteria causes extensive respiration leading to low oxygen concentrations on the particle, which ultimately allows for the anaerobic process of N2 fixation , explains first-author and postdoc at the Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Subhendu Chakraborty. With their model the researchers could also show the depth distribution of N2 fixation in the marine water column. They found, that among other things, the N2 fixation is dependent on the size, density and sinking speed of the marine snow particles. Moreover, they demonstrated that their modelled rates were comparable to actual rates measured in marine waters.  This comparison gave us confidence in the model , says corresponding author Lasse Riemann, Professor at the Department of Biology. He continues:  We are very proud of our study, because it provides the first explanation of how marine-snow-associated N2 fixation can take place. Furthermore, the results indicate that this process is important for the global marine nitrogen cycling and thereby for plankton growth and productivity . The researchers hope their study will inspire future work on microbial life on marine particles, due to its seemingly pivotal role in the cycling of many nutrients in the ocean.ReferenceChakraborty S, Andersen KH, Visser AW, Inomura K, Follows MJ, Riemann L.

Now, researchers from Japan and the United States have revealed that the pigments that determine the colors of tomatoes also affect their flavor.In a study published this month, researchers from University of Tsukuba developed a new method to rapidly measure the pigment profiles of tomatoes and used the technique to explore how pigments affect the taste and aroma of different tomato varieties. The color of tomatoes is produced by combinations of different types of pigments, including carotenoids and chlorophylls. These pigments can also affect the accumulation of flavor-related compounds such as sugars, which affect the taste of tomatoes, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which determine the aroma. As tomato fruits ripen from green to red, the amounts of pigments and flavor-related compounds change but until now the relationship between color and flavor has been unclear. ""Pigments like carotenoids have no taste,"" says lead author Professor Miyako Kusano, ""but they are precursors for compounds called apocarotenoid-VOCs (AC-VOCs) which produce the fruity/floral smell of tomatoes and increase the perception of sweetness--characteristics that appeal to consumers."" Traditional methods for identifying and measuring pigments can be slow, so the researchers developed a simple method to rapidly analyze large numbers of samples. Using the new technique, the team measured the amounts of carotenoids and chlorophylls in 157 different varieties of tomato and then analyzed the flavors of each variety to find the links between pigments and flavor. The results showed that tomato varieties with an abundance of chlorophyll also had a high sugar content, contributing to a sweet taste. They also found that the carotenoid profiles of the fruit reflected the appearance of the fruit, as well as AC-VOC levels. ""The pigment profile of one of the orange-colored varieties called ""Dixie Golden Giant"" was particularly interesting,"" explains Professor Kusano. ""It had very high levels of AC-VOCs, but the carotenoid content wasn't that high. We discovered that the pigment prolycopene was abundant in this variety, which explained the high AC-VOC levels."" The carotenoid content of fruit is influenced by growing conditions, like temperature and amount of light. By looking at the pigment profiles and AC-VOC content of fruits in different environments, it may be possible to find ways of improving AC-VOC production, which is good for both consumers and producers. Given its speed, the new method developed by the team is a powerful tool for analyzing pigment concentrations in large numbers of samples and could also be used for other fruits and vegetables.ReferenceAono Y, Asikin Y, Wang N, Tieman D, Klee H, Kusano M.

However, inflammatory reactions in healthy tissues frequently trigger side effects that can be serious and lead to the permanent discontinuation of treatment. This toxicity is still poorly understood and is a major obstacle to the use of immunotherapy. Scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, and Harvard Medical School, United States, have succeeded in establishing the differences between deleterious immune reactions and those targeting tumour cells that are sought after. It appears that while the immune mechanisms are similar, the cell populations involved are different. This work, published in the journal Science Immunology, makes it possible to envisage better targeted, more effective, and less dangerous treatments for cancer patients.Based on massive stimulation of the patient's immune system, immunotherapies have saved many lives. Unfortunately, they are not without consequences. ""When the immune system is activated so intensively, the resulting inflammatory reaction can have harmful effects and sometimes cause significant damage to healthy tissue"", says Mika l Pittet, holder of the ISREC Foundation Chair in Onco-Immunology at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine Department of Pathology and Immunology and Centre for Translational Research in Onco-Haematology, and a member of the Swiss Cancer Centre Leman. ""Therefore, we wanted to know if there are differences between a desired immune response, which aims to eliminate cancer, and an unwanted response, which can affect healthy tissue. The identification of distinctive elements between these two immune reactions would indeed allow the development of new, more effective and less toxic therapeutic approaches.""Using liver biopsy samples from patients treated at the CHUV and the HUG who had suffered such toxic reactions, the scientists studied the cellular and molecular mechanisms at work to reveal similarities and dissimilarities.

Plastic is notoriously hard to break down, but microbial communities living inside the digestive system of animals are a promising but under-investigated source of novel enzymes that could do the trick. The new findings present a sustainable option for reducing plastic waste and litter, co-opting the great metabolic diversity of microbes.Plastic is notoriously hard to break down, but researchers in Austria have found that bacteria from a cow s rumen   one of the four compartments of its stomach   can digest certain types of the ubiquitous material, representing a sustainable way to reduce plastic litter. The discovery is published today in the open access journal Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology. The scientists suspected such bacteria might be useful since cow diets already contain natural plant polyesters.  A huge microbial community lives in the rumen reticulum and is responsible for the digestion of food in the animals,  said Dr Doris Ribitsch, of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna,  so we suspected that some biological activities could also be used for polyester hydrolysis,  a type of chemical reaction that results in decomposition. In other words, these microorganisms can already break down similar materials, so the study authors thought they might be able to break down plastics as well.Ribitsch and her colleagues looked at three kinds of polyesters. One, polyethylene terephthalate, commonly known as PET, is a synthetic polymer commonly used in textiles and packaging. The other two consisted of a biodegradable plastic often used in compostable plastic bags (polybutylene adipate terephthalate, PBAT), and a biobased material (Polyethylene furanoate, PEF) made from renewable resources. They obtained rumen liquid from a slaughterhouse in Austria to get the microorganisms they were testing. They then incubated that liquid with the three types of plastics they were testing (which were tested in both powder and film form) in order to understand how effectively the plastic would break down. According to their results, all three plastics could be broken down by the microorganisms from cow stomachs, with the plastic powders breaking down quicker than plastic film. Compared to similar research that has been done on investigating single microorganisms, Ribitsch and her colleagues found that the rumen liquid was more effective, which might indicate that its microbial community could have a synergistic advantage   that the combination of enzymes, rather than any one particular enzyme, is what makes the difference. While their work has only been done at a lab scale, Ribitsch said,  Due to the large amount of rumen that accumulates every day in slaughterhouses, upscaling would be easy to imagine.  However, she cautions that such research can be cost-prohibitive, as the lab equipment is expensive, and such studies require pre-studies to examine microorganisms. Nevertheless, Ribitsch is looking forward to further research on the topic, saying that microbial communities have been underexplored as a potential eco-friendly resource.ReferenceQuartinello F, Kremser K, Schoen H, et al.

People's oxygen intake improved, their number of breathing stoppages was a third or more less.These new findings allow researchers to further refine these types of medications so that they have even greater benefit than what has currently been found.Commenting on the study, Professor Eckert said:""We were thrilled because the current treatment options for people with sleep apnoea are limited and can be a painful journey for many,"" he said. Next, we will look at the effects of these and similar medications over the longer term. We will assess whether we can harness the benefits of one drug without needing to use them both.""""Equally, we will test whether these treatments can be combined with other existing medications to see if we can improve their efficacy even more,"" he continued.Until now, the main therapy for sleep apnoea involves wearing a mask to bed, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Therapy (CPAP), which benefits millions. However, many people find it uncomfortable and half the people that try it find it hard to tolerate.Plus, the efficacy of second line therapies, such as mouthguards fitted by dentists, can be unpredictable and expensive.Reference: Lim R, Messineo L, Grunstein RR, Carberry JC, Eckert DJ.

This reactivity is key to the body s complex immune response to the virus, which allows the body to kill infected cells and stop severe infections. This study suggests that the impact of mutations found in the variants of concern is limited,  says LJI Professor Alessandro Sette, Dr.Bio.Sci., study senior author and member of the LJI Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research.   We can presume that T cells would still be available as a line of defense against viral infection. The researchers emphasize that the study only addresses how the body s T cells respond to Variants of Concern (VOCs). The researchers emphasize that several of these variants, are linked to lower levels of virus-fighting antibodies.The current study includes data on four of the most prevalent VOCs. Ongoing studies have been expanded to a larger panel of variants, including the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, which became prevalent after this study had been initiated. The team has also established relationships with more than 20 different laboratories around the world to help monitor T cell reactivity to VOCs. These variants are still a concern, but our study shows that even if there is a decrease in antibodies, as other studies have shown, the T cells remain largely unaffected,  says LJI Instructor Alba Grifoni, Ph.D.  The vaccines still work. The Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was not part of this study because it was not available at the time the study was launched.For the new study, the researchers analyzed T cells from three different groups: people who had recovered from COVID-19, people who had received either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, and people never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (from samples taken before the pandemic).Both the recovered subjects and the vaccinated subjects were likely to have T cells that recognized the  ancestral lineage  of SARS-CoV-2. This was the original strain that emerged at the beginning of the pandemic; however, the virus has mutated since December 2019, and several variants have been identified as VOCs.The question was whether people with T cells trained to recognize the ancestral strain would also recognize the new variants. The researchers tested T cell responses from the donor groups against four prominent VOCs: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429).The researchers found that both vaccinated individuals and the recovered patients had cross-reactive T cells that could target these variants. That is good news for anyone who has received one of the two mRNA vaccines and for anyone who has recovered from any variant of the virus. With this study, the underlying message is optimistic,  adds Tarke.  At least, as far as the T cell response goes, your immune system is still able to recognize these new variants and your T cells will be able to respond. Similar results reporting largely unaffected T cell reactivity has now been presented through independent studies published in Nature and Science Immunology.Study co-author and LJI Professor Shane Crotty, Ph.D., says this research highlights the importance of enlisting T cells in fighting SARS-CoV-2. COVID vaccines do a fantastic job of making antibodies that stop SARS-CoV-2 infections, but some of the vaccines do less well at stopping infections from variants,  Crotty says.  You can think of T cells as a backup system: if the virus gets past the antibodies if you have vaccine T cells the T cells can probably still stop the variant coronavirus infection before you get pneumonia. Researchers are now looking for ways to take advantage of how flexible the T cells response appears to be. With T cells already working hard to recognize SARS-CoV-2 variants, Grifoni says future  booster  shots could increase immunity by prompting the body to produce more antibodies against the variants and/or by adding additional parts of the virus recognized by T cells. T cell epitopes are well conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants, so incorporating T cell targets into future COVID vaccines could be a clever way to make sure future variants can t escape the vaccines,  adds Crotty.There is also the possibility that current SARS-CoV-2 research may one day lead to a universal,  pan-coronavirus  vaccine. This kind of vaccine would train the body to recognize the structural details, such as elements of the spike protein, that all coronaviruses have in common. This research shows that a pan-coronavirus vaccine is feasible,  says Grifoni.The group is now studying a much larger group of 12 different Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs), including the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), Eta (B.1.525), Iota (B.1.526), Kappa (B.1.617.1), Lambda (C37) and the variants B.1.526.1, B.1.617.3, R1 and B.1.1.519.Sette says he d also like to study T cells from people who have been infected with the variants and see how those T cells react to the ancestral strain of the virus.Reference: Tarke A, Sidney J, Methot N, et al.

Even better: The molecule isn't present in healthy cells, so they remain untouched by the new therapy.Plenty of progress has been made in this approach, known as molecular targeted cancer therapy. Some current cancer therapeutics inhibit enzymes that become overactive, allowing cells to proliferate, spread and survive beyond their norm. The challenge is that many known cancer-driving molecules are ""undruggable,"" meaning their type, shape or location prohibit drugs from binding to them.University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers are now exploring the therapeutic potential of RNA-binding proteins, a relatively untapped family of cancer-driving molecules. After genes (DNA) are transcribed into RNA, these proteins provide an extra layer of cellular control, determining which RNA copies get translated into other proteins and which don't. Like many molecular systems that govern cell growth, RNA-binding proteins can contribute to tumor development when they malfunction.In their latest study, publishing July 2, 2021 in Molecular Cell, the UC San Diego School of Medicine team discovered in human cells and mouse models that RNA-binding proteins represent a new class of drug targets for cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly difficult-to-treat cancer because it lacks most other molecular drug targets.One RNA-binding protein in particular stood out: YTHDF2. When the researchers genetically removed YTHDF2 from human triple-negative breast tumors transplanted into mice, the tumors shrank approximately 10-fold in volume.""We're excited that RNA-binding proteins look like they could be new class of drug targets for cancer,"" said senior author Gene Yeo, PhD, professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. ""We're not yet sure how easily druggable they are in this context, but we've built a solid framework to begin exploring them.""Yeo led the study with Jaclyn Einstein, PhD, a graduate student in his lab. Einstein will join a startup company spun out from the lab to explore YTHDF2's druggability.Yeo's team has long studied the role of RNA-binding proteins in a number of other diseases. In 2016, for example, they discovered that mutations in one such protein contribute to ALS by scrambling crucial cellular messaging systems.To begin exploring RNA-binding proteins as cancer drug targets, the researchers turned to an old philosophy known as synthetic lethality. In this one-two punch approach, they started with human breast cells engineered to over-produce another well-known cancer-driving molecule, and looked for additional vulnerabilities specific to those cells.The researchers systematically silenced RNA-binding proteins in these cancer cells one-by-one using the CRISPR gene editing technique. They found 57 RNA-binding proteins that, when inhibited, kill cancer cells with the known hyperactive cancer-driver. The advantage of the synthetic lethal approach is that normal cells, which don't produce that cancer-driving molecule, should be left untouched by the treatment. Of these 57 RNA-binding proteins, YTHDF2 appeared most promising.Yeo's team also recently developed a new laboratory technique called Surveying Targets by APOBEC-Mediated Profiling (STAMP), which allows them to measure what had previously been largely invisible: how RNA-binding proteins interact with RNA molecules within individual cells.The researchers used STAMP in this study to get a detailed look at how the various cells that make up a breast tumor behave without YTHDF2. The approach revealed that YTHDF2-deficient cancer cells die by stress-induced apoptosis, a carefully controlled mechanism cells use to destroy themselves. Apoptosis is supposed to shut down malfunctioning cells so tumors don't arise, but it doesn't always work. By removing YTHDF2, they managed to re-activate this cell death signal.To test how safe it might be to treat cancer by inhibiting YTHDF2, the researchers engineered mice that lack YTHDF2 in every cell of the adult body, not just transplanted breast cancer cells. The mice appeared completely normal -- not only did they not have tumors, there were no changes in body weight or behavior.""Those otherwise healthy mice tell us that we might expect minimal adverse side effects of potential therapies that work by targeting YTHDF2,"" Einstein said.Reference: Einstein JM, Perelis M, Chaim IA, et al.

But to produce those mature cells, human primed stem cells must be converted back into an earlier, less developed naive state so that the human stem cells can co-develop with the inner cell mass in a mouse blastocyst.The protocol outlining how to do that has now been published in Nature Protocols by the UB scientists. They were invited to publish it because of the significant interest generated by the team's initial publication describing their breakthrough last May.""This paper will enable many scientists to use this new platform to study the human disease of their interest,"" said Jian Feng, PhD, professor of physiology and biophysics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB and senior author. ""Over time, it will transform biomedical research toward a more effective use of the human model system to directly study virtually any inborn condition of an individual. It will stimulate unforeseen discoveries and applications that may fundamentally change our understanding of human biology and medicine.""The protocol will allow scientists to create animal models that Feng said provide a much more realistic picture of embryonic development than has ever been possible. These more realistic animal models also will have the potential to reveal the mechanisms behind numerous diseases, especially those that afflict individuals from birth.Better mouse models""This step-by-step protocol will benefit the entire field by enabling other scientists to use our methods to generate chimeras to study human diseases that they are experts in,"" said Feng. ""It will lead to the generation of better mouse models for various human diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, COVID-19 and many others, or various human developmental disorders."" The paper demonstrates how to generate naive human pluripotent stem cells from existing induced pluripotent stem cells that may be derived from patients with various diseases, how to generate mouse-human chimeras using these cells and how to quantify the amount of human cells in the chimeras.""Using our method, one can now track the development of naive human pluripotent stem cells in mouse-human chimeric embryos in real-time,"" said Feng. These stem cells can then be manipulated either genetically or pharmacologically, providing valuable information about human development and disease.""For example, one can label naive human pluripotent stem cells by inserting green fluorescent protein in a hemoglobin gene to study the development of human red blood cells in mouse-human chimeras,"" said Feng.Another application is to generate humanized mouse models to study many human diseases.""These mice contain critical human cells, tissues or even organs so that they more accurately reflect the human condition,"" said Feng. ""With our method, the human cells are made along with the mouse during the development of the mouse embryo. There would be better matching and no rejections, because there are ways for the human cells to be made where there is no competition from their mouse counterparts.""Organs for transplant in the futureBy allowing others to improve and adapt the method to eventually generate chimeras in larger animals, this protocol may also lead to the generation of human organs to address the dire shortage of organs available for transplant, said Feng.""If naive human pluripotent stem cells are able to generate significant amounts of mature human cells in other larger species, it could be possible to make human tissues or even human organs in chimeric animals,"" Feng explained.This would be possible using blastocyst complementation where, Feng explained, normal pluripotent stem cells from one species can reconstitute an organ for that species in a blastocyst of another species that been genetically modified not to grow that particular organ.Feng added: ""Ultimately, a better understanding of how human cells develop and grow in chimeras may enable the generation of human cells, tissues and organs in a completely artificial system and fundamentally change how we treat many human diseases. Research using chimeras is a bridge that must be crossed to reach that possibility.""Reference: Zhang B, Li H, Hu Z, et al. Generation of mouse human chimeric embryos.

They would also help illuminate the spatial regulation of gene expression.Mammalian embryonic development is a remarkable phenomenon: a fertilized egg divides repeatedly and turns, in a matter of weeks or months, into a complex organism capable of a myriad of physiological processes and composed of a variety of cells, tissues, organs, anatomical structures.A better understanding of how mammals form before birth -- particularly the prenatal spatial patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level during embryonic development -- could advance biomedical and veterinary research on a variety of conditions. These range from inherited disorders to congenital malformations and developmental delays. Understanding how organs originate might also assist future regenerative medicine efforts.An international team led by scientists at UW Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine in Seattle demonstrated the proof-of-concept of their sci-Space technique in mouse embryos.Their results are published in the July 2 edition of Science. The lead authors are Sanjay R. Srivatsan of the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and Mary C. Regier of the UW Department of Bioengineering.The senior authors are Jay Shendure, UW Medicine professor of genome sciences, and director of the Brotman Baty Institute, and an investigator at the Allan Discovery Center for Cell Lineage Tracing; Kelly R. Stevens, UW assistant professor of bioengineering; and Cole Trapnell, associate professor of genome sciences. Regier and Stevens are also investigators at the UW Medicine Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Research.The researchers observed the orchestration of genes in 120,000 cell nuclei. All the body's somatic cells contain the same DNA code. The researchers captured information on which genes were turned on or off in these nuclei as mouse embryos took shape. The scientists also investigated how cells' locations in an embryo affected which genes were activated during development.This technique builds on previous work in which these scientists and other groups developed ways of conducting whole-organism profiling of gene expression and DNA-code accessibility, in thousands of single cells, during embryonic development. They did so to track the emergence and trajectory of various cell types.How cells are organized spatially - what physical positions they take as an embryo forms - is critical to normal development. Misplacements, disruptions, or cells not showing at the right time in the right spot can cause serious problems or even prenatal death.However, gaining knowledge on spatial patterns of gene expression has been technically difficult. It has been unwieldy to assay gene transcripts of individual cells over wide swaths of the embryo. This limited the scientific understanding of how spatial organization influences gene expression and, consequently, why which cell types form where, or how neighboring groups of cells influence each other's future roles.The scientists on the present study had earlier developed a method to label cell nuclei, a technique they called sci-Plex. They then went on to index single-cell RNA sequencing, with a method called sci-RNA-sequencing.Now, with sci-Space, by analyzing spatial coordinates and cell gene transcripts the scientists identified thousands of genes whose expression was anatomically patterned. For example, certain genetic profiles emerged in neurons in the brain and spinal cord and others in cardiac muscle cells in the heart.The scientists also used spatial and gene profile information to annotate subtypes of cells. For example, while both blood vessel cells and heart muscle might both express the gene for a particular growth factor, only the heart muscle cells produced certain growth factor receptors.The researchers also observed that cell types varied greatly in the extent of their spatial patterning of gene expression. For example, connective tissue progenitor cells showed a relatively large proportion of spatially restricted gene expression. This observation suggests that subtypes of these cells behave in a position-dependent manner throughout the body.To measure the power of spatial position on a cell type's gene transcript profile, the researchers also calculated the physical distance between cells and the angular distance of their gene expression profiles.""For many cell types, as the physical distance between cells increased, so did the angular distance between their transcriptomes,"" the researchers noted in their paper. However, they added that this trend varied considerably. It was most pronounced in certain brain and spinal cord cells.The genetic transcript profiles of some other cell types were highly influenced by their position in the developing embryo. Among these are certain cartilage cells, which become part of the scaffolding for bones of the head and face.The researchers also studied gene expression dynamics that took place as part of brain cell differentiation and migration during mouse embryonic development. The researchers examined how various brain cell trajectories were anatomically distributed. The researchers did so by using the Allen Institute's Anatomical Reference Brain Atlas as a guide.""Cells from each trajectory overwhelmingly occupied distinct brain regions,"" the researchers noted. They also observed gradients of developmental maturity in different regions of the brain. These gradients revealed both known and new patterns of migration.In the future, the researchers hope sci-Space will be further applied to serial sections that span the entire mouse embryo and that cover many points of time.Reference: Srivatsan SR, Regier MC, Barkan E, et al.

These variants interact with environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and when you were born, and are predictors of longevity and later life disease.The researchers conducted a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), a search across the entire human genome, to see if there is a relationship between reproductive behaviour and a particular genetic variant. In the largest genomic study ever conducted to date, they combined multiple data sources to examine age at first sex (N=387,338) and birth (N=542,901) in men and women. They then calculated a genetic score, with all genetic loci combined explaining around 5-6% of the variability in the average age at sexual debut or having a first child.Professor Melinda Mills, Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford and Nuffield College, and the study's first author says, 'Our study has discovered hundreds additional genetic markers that shape this most fundamental part of our lives and have the potential for deeper understanding of infertility, later life disease and longevity.'The genetic signals were driven by social factors and the environment but also by reproductive biology, with findings related to follicle-stimulating hormone, implantation, infertility, and spermatid differentiation.Professor Mills adds 'We already knew that childhood socioeconomic circumstances or level of education were important predictors of the timing of reproduction. But we were intrigued to find literally not only hundreds of new genetic variants, but also uncover a relationship with substance abuse, personality traits such as openness and self-control, ADHD and even predictive of some diseases and longevity .'Professor Mills says, 'We demonstrated that it is a combination of genetics, social predictors and the environment that drives early or late reproductive onset. It was incredible to see that the genetics underlying early sex and fertility were related to behavioural dis-inhibition, like ADHD, but also addiction and early smoking. Or those genetically prone to postpone sex or first birth had better later life health outcomes and longevity, related to a higher socioeconomic status in during childhood.'Genetic factors driving reproductive behaviour are strongly related to later life diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.'It is exciting that the genetics underlying these reproductive behaviours may help us understand later life disease.'Professor Mills concludes, 'Starting your sexual journey early is rooted in childhood inequality but also has links with health problems, such as cervical cancer and depression. We found particularly strong links between early sexual debut, ADHD and substance abuse, such as early age at smoking. We hope our findings lead to better understanding of teenage mental and sexual health, infertility, later life disease and treatments to help.'Reference: Mills MC, Tropf FC, Brazel DM, et al.

Researchers at the University of Copenhagen reached this conclusion after examining a large group of older Danes' and their intensity perception of common food odours.That grandpa and grandma aren't as good at smelling as they once were, is something that many can relate to. And, it has also been scientifically demonstrated. One's sense of smell gradually begins to decline from about the age of 55. Until now, it was believed that one's sense of smell broadly declined with increasing age. However, a study from the University of Copenhagen reports that certain food odors are significantly more affected than others.The Department of Food Science's Eva Honnens de Lichtenberg Broge and her fellow researchers have tested the ability of older Danes to perceive everyday food odors. The researchers measured how intensely older adults perceived different food odours, as well as how much they liked the odours.""Our study shows that the declining sense of smell among older adults is more complex than once believed. While their ability to smell fried meat, onions and mushrooms is markedly weaker, they smell orange, raspberry and vanilla just as well as younger adults. Thus, a declining sense of smell in older adults seems rather odor specific. What is really interesting is that how much you like an odor is not necessarily dependent on the intensity perception"" says Eva Honnens de Lichtenberg Broge.For example, liking of seemed to be largely unaffected for fried meat, onions and mushrooms, despite the largest decline in intensity perception was seen for these specific odors. Also the ability to smell coffee declined, among other things, though they didn't like the aroma of coffee to the same degree as younger adults.The test subjects included 251 Danes between the ages of 60 and 98 and a control group consisting of 92 people between the ages of 20 and 39.

In recent years, the study of astrocytes has grown, gradually revealing their importance in brain function. Researchers from Inserm, CNRS and Coll ge de France at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology have now uncovered their crucial role in closing the period of brain plasticity that follows birth, finding them to be key to the development of sensory and cognitive faculties. Over the longer term, these findings will make it possible to envisage new strategies for reintroducing brain plasticity in adults, thereby promoting rehabilitation following brain lesions or neurodevelopmental disorders. This research has been published in Science.Brain plasticity is a transient key period after birth in which the brain remodels the ""wiring"" of the neurons according to the external stimulations it receives (environment, interactions, etc.). The end - or ""closure"" - of this period marks the stabilization of the neural circuits, associated with efficient information processing and normal cognitive development. Plasticity is still possible in the future, although at a much lower level than at the beginning of life.Problems occurring during the brain plasticity period could have major long-term consequences. For example, in the event of an eye condition preventing an individual from seeing correctly, such as strabismus (crossed eyes), the corresponding brain wiring will be permanently altered if it is not treated in time.To remedy this, the researchers aim to remodel this wiring by identifying a therapy that would reintroduce brain plasticity, even once closure has occurred. To achieve this, they also seek to better characterize the biological mechanisms that underlie this closure.Pioneering studies from the 1980s showed that transplanting immature astrocytes into the brains of adult animals reintroduced a period of major plasticity. The team of Inserm researcher and study coordinator Nathalie Rouach at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (Inserm/CNRS/Coll ge de France) took inspiration from this procedure to reveal the hitherto unknown cellular process responsible for the closure of plasticity.Transplanting immature astrocytes to reintroduce brain plasticityThrough experiments on the mouse visual cortex, the researchers show that the presence of immature astrocytes is the key to brain plasticity. The astrocytes are then later involved in developing interneuron maturation during the plasticity period, ultimately leading to its closure. This maturation process occurs via a novel mechanism involving the protein Connexin 30, of which the researchers found high levels in mature astrocytes during closure.Could transplanting astrocytes into adult mice reintroduce brain plasticity?To find out, the researchers cultured immature astrocytes from the visual cortex of young mice (1 to 3 days' old). These immature astrocytes were transplanted into the primary visual cortex of adult mice, following which the activity of the visual cortex was evaluated after four days of monocular occlusion - a standard technique used to assess brain plasticity. They found that the mice transplanted with the immature astrocytes presented a high level of plasticity, unlike the control mice which did not receive the transplant.""This study is a reminder that in the neurosciences we must not only focus on neurons. The glial cells, of which the astrocytes are a subtype, regulate most of the brain's functions. We realized that these cells have active roles. Glial cells are less fragile than neurons and so represent a more accessible means of acting on the brain, "" emphasizes Rouach.Glial cells account for over half of the brain's cells. They do not have the same cell lineage as neurons and their functions are very different. Until recently they were considered to be the brain's ""cleaners"", but the researchers realized that they also play an active role in releasing molecules. Compared with neurons, they occur at a later stage in the brain's development, do not communicate in the same way, and are predominant.Reference: Ribot J, Breton R, Calvo C-F, et al.

We've been living at the whim of the virus's so-called ""spike"" protein, which has mutated dozens of times to create increasingly deadly variants. But the truth is, we have always been ruled by proteins. At the cellular level, they're responsible for pretty much everything.Proteins are so fundamental that DNA - the genetic material that makes each of us unique - is essentially just a long sequence of protein blueprints. That's true for animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, archaea, and even viruses. And just as those groups of organisms evolve and change over time, so too do proteins and their component parts.A new study from University of Illinois researchers, published in Scientific Reports, maps the evolutionary history and interrelationships of protein domains, the subunits of protein molecules, over 3.8 billion years.""Knowing how and why domains combine in proteins during evolution could help scientists understand and engineer the activity of proteins for medicine and bioengineering applications. For example, these insights could guide disease management, such as making better vaccines from the spike protein of COVID-19 viruses,"" says Gustavo Caetano-Anoll s, professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, affiliate of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois, and senior author on the paper.Caetano-Anoll s has studied the evolution of COVID mutations since the early stages of the pandemic, but that timeline represents a vanishingly tiny fraction of what he and doctoral student Fayez Aziz took on in their current study.The researchers compiled sequences and structures of millions of protein sequences encoded in hundreds of genomes across all taxonomic groups, including higher organisms and microbes. They focused not on whole proteins, but instead on structural domains.""Most proteins are made of more than one domain. These are compact structural units, or modules, that harbor specialized functions,"" Caetano-Anoll s says. ""More importantly, they are the units of evolution.""After sorting proteins into domains to build evolutionary trees, they set to work building a network to understand how domains have developed and been shared across proteins throughout billions of years of evolution.""We built a time series of networks that describe how domains have accumulated and how proteins have rearranged their domains through evolution. This is the first time such a network of 'domain organization' has been studied as an evolutionary chronology,"" Fayez Aziz says. ""Our survey revealed there is a vast evolving network describing how domains combine with each other in proteins.""Each link of the network represents a moment when a particular domain was recruited into a protein, typically to perform a new function.""This fact alone strongly suggests domain recruitment is a powerful force in nature,"" Fayez Aziz says. The chronology also revealed which domains contributed important protein functions. For example, the researchers were able to trace the origins of domains responsible for environmental sensing as well as secondary metabolites, or toxins used in bacterial and plant defenses.The analysis showed domains started to combine early in protein evolution, but there were also periods of explosive network growth. For example, the researchers describe a ""big bang"" of domain combinations 1.5 billion years ago, coinciding with the rise of multicellular organisms and eukaryotes, organisms with membrane-bound nuclei that include humans.The existence of biological big bangs is not new. Caetano-Anoll s' team previously reported the massive and early origin of metabolism, and they recently found it again when tracking the history of metabolic networks.The historical record of a big bang describing the evolutionary patchwork of proteins provides new tools to understand protein makeup.""This could help identify, for example, why structural variations and genomic recombinations occur often in SARS-CoV-2,"" Caetano-Anoll s says.He adds that this new way of understanding proteins could help prevent pandemics by dissecting how virus diseases originate. It could also help mitigate disease by improving vaccine design when outbreaks occur.Reference: Aziz MF, Caetano-Anoll s G. Evolution of networks of protein domain organization.

But research on the neuroscience of spirituality and religiosity has been sparse. Previous studies have used functional neuroimaging, in which an individual undergoes a brain scan while performing a task to see what areas of the brain light up. But these correlative studies have given a spotty and often inconsistent picture of spirituality. A new study led by investigators at Brigham and Women's Hospital takes a new approach to mapping spirituality and religiosity and finds that spiritual acceptance can be localized to a specific brain circuit. This brain circuit is centered in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a brainstem region that has been implicated in numerous functions, including fear conditioning, pain modulation, altruistic behaviors and unconditional love. The team's findings are published in Biological Psychiatry.""Our results suggest that spirituality and religiosity are rooted in fundamental, neurobiological dynamics and deeply woven into our neuro-fabric,"" said corresponding author Michael Ferguson, PhD, a principal investigator in the Brigham's Center for Brain Circuit Therapeutics. ""We were astonished to find that this brain circuit for spirituality is centered in one of the most evolutionarily preserved structures in the brain.""To conduct their study, Ferguson and colleagues used a technique called lesion network mapping that allows investigators to map complex human behaviors to specific brain circuits based on the locations of brain lesions in patients. The team leveraged a previously published dataset that included 88 neurosurgical patients who were undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor. Lesion locations were distributed throughout the brain. Patients completed a survey that included questions about spiritual acceptance before and after surgery. The team validated their results using a second dataset made up of more than 100 patients with lesions caused by penetrating head trauma from combat during the Vietnam War. These participants also completed questionnaires that included questions about religiosity (such as, ""Do you consider yourself a religious person? Yes or No?"").Of the 88 neurosurgical patients, 30 showed a decrease in self-reported spiritual belief before and after neurosurgical brain tumor resection, 29 showed an increase, and 29 showed no change. Using lesion network mapping, the team found that self-reported spirituality mapped to a specific brain circuit centered on the PAG. The circuit included positive nodes and negative nodes -- lesions that disrupted these respective nodes either decreased or increased self-reported spiritual beliefs. Results on religiosity from the second dataset aligned with these findings. In addition, in a review of the literature, the researchers found several case reports of patients who became hyper-religious after experiencing brain lesions that affected the negative nodes of the circuit.Lesion locations associated with other neurological and psychiatric symptoms also intersected with the spirituality circuit. Specifically, lesions causing parkinsonism intersected positive areas of the circuit, as did lesions associated with decreased spirituality. Lesions causing delusions and alien limb syndrome intersected with negative regions, associated with increased spirituality and religiosity.""It's important to note that these overlaps may be helpful for understanding shared features and associations, but these results should not be over-interpreted,"" said Ferguson. ""For example, our results do not imply that religion is a delusion, that historical religious figures suffered from alien limb syndrome, or that Parkinson's disease arises due to a lack of religious faith. Instead, our results point to the deep roots of spiritual beliefs in a part of our brain that's been implicated in many important functions.""The authors note that the datasets they used do not provide rich information about the patient's upbringing, which can have an influence over spiritual beliefs, and that patients in both datasets were from predominantly Christian cultures. To understand the generalizability of their results, they would need to replicate their study across many backgrounds. The team is also interested in untangling religiosity and spirituality to understand brain circuits that may be driving differences. Additionally, Ferguson would like to pursue clinical and translational applications for the findings, including understanding the role that spirituality and compassion may have in clinical treatment.""Only recently have medicine and spirituality been fractionated from one another. There seems to be this perennial union between healing and spirituality across cultures and civilizations,"" said Ferguson. ""I'm interested in the degree to which our understanding of brain circuits could help craft scientifically grounded, clinically-translatable questions about how healing and spirituality can co-inform each other.""Reference: Ferguson MA, Schaper FLWVJ, Cohen A, et al.

Treatment for FMS is focussed on gentle aerobic exercises, as well as drug and psychological therapies designed to manage pain, although these have proven ineffective in most patients and have left behind an enormous unmet clinical need""   Dr David Andersson, study primary investigator, King's College LondonThe researchers injected mice with antibodies from people living with FMS and observed that the mice rapidly developed an increased sensitivity to pressure and cold, as well as displaying reduced movement grip strength. In contrast, mice that were injected with antibodies from healthy people were unaffected, demonstrating that patient antibodies cause, or at least are a major contributor to the disease.Furthermore, the mice injected with fibromyalgia antibodies recovered after a few weeks, when antibodies had been cleared from their system. This finding strongly suggests that therapies which reduce antibody levels in patients are likely to be effective treatments. Such therapies are already available and are used to treat other disorders that are caused by autoantibodies.Current estimates suggest that at least 1 in 40 people are affected by FMS worldwide (80% of which are women) and is commonly characterised by widespread pain throughout the body, as well as fatigue (often referred to as  fibro fog ) and emotional distress. It most commonly develops between the ages of 25 and 55, although children can also get it.Dr Andreas Goebel, the study s principle clinical investigator from the University of Liverpool said,  When I initiated this study in the UK, I expected that some fibromyalgia cases may be autoimmune. But David s team have discovered pain-causing antibodies in each recruited patient. The results offer amazing hope that the invisible, devastating symptoms of fibromyalgia will become treatable. Professor Camilla Svensson, the study s primary investigator from Karolinska Institute said,  Antibodies from people with FMS living in two different countries, the UK and Sweden, gave similar results, which adds enormous strength to our findings. The next step will be to identify what factors the symptom-inducing antibodies bind to. This will help us not only in terms of developing novel treatment strategies for FMS, but also of blood-based tests for diagnosis, which are missing today.""Fibromyalgia affects millions of people in the UK and can have a devastating impact on quality of life. It causes pain all over the body, fatigue, disturbed sleep and regular flare-ups where symptoms get even worse. Fibromyalgia is a particularly difficult condition to diagnose and manage because its causes are unknown. This research shows that antibodies found in human blood can cause fibromyalgia-like symptoms in mice, suggesting that these antibodies play a crucial role in the condition. Further research is needed but this offers hope to the millions of people with fibromyalgia that an effective treatment could be found in the relatively near future""   Dr Craig Bullock, Research Discovery and Innovations Lead at Versus ArthritisReference: Goebel A, Krock E, Gentry C, et al.

According to researchers, it can precisely measure light across dozens, if not hundreds, of bands of colors. The reflectance spectra can depict nutrient levels, chlorophyll content and other indicators of health for various crops, according to researchers.Scientists from UMaine, the Schoodic Institute and Wyman's, one of the world's largest purveyors of wild blueberries and the number one brand of frozen fruit in the country, found in their research that when incorporated into models, imaging spectroscopy can help predict whether wild blueberry fields will lack sufficient water for growing. Not only can the technology help inform growers as they evaluate irrigation routines and manage their water resources in a way that avoids damaging the crop, researchers say.The team collected imaging spectroscopy data by deploying a drone equipped with a spectrometer for capturing visible and near-infrared light to photograph wild blueberry fields owned by Wyman's in Debois, Maine. Researchers then processed the images to measure reflected light spectra from the plants for indications of chlorophyll levels and other properties that would help estimate their water potential, which, they say, is the primary force driving water flow and an indicator of water stress. At the same time, the group collected small branches with leaves from wild blueberry plants in the plots to assess their water potential and validate the spectra-based estimation. Pictures and samples were collected in the spring and summer of 2019 when the plants experienced peak bloom, green fruit and color break.The data from both drone images and ground samples were incorporated into models, which they developed using machine learning and statistical analysis, to estimate water potential, and thereby predict water stress, of the plants in the barrens. Models from the ground sample data were used to help guide the development of and validate the model created with data from the images. The results of both sets of models were comparable, demonstrating that imaging spectroscopy can accurately predict water stress in wild blueberry barrens at different times of the growing season. With the efficacy of the technology confirmed, researchers say scientists can capitalize on the benefits of it, such as conducting repeated measurements on small objects like blueberry leaves with ease.Graduate student Catherine Chan led the study, joined by UMaine faculty Daniel Hayes and Yongjiang Zhang, Schoodic Institute forest ecologist Peter Nelson and Wyman's agronomist Bruce Hall. The journal Remote Sensing published a report of their findings.""We couple spectral data and areas of known water potential in wild blueberry fields through machine learning, creating a model to further predict areas that may be water stressed,"" Chan says.Understanding how to sustainably manage water resources to mitigate risk associated with current and increasing drought frequency is crucial to wild blueberry growers, researchers say.""This research provides key learnings to ensure the continued viability of wild blueberry crops for generations to come,"" Hall says.Warming and drought exacerbated by climate change have compounded their struggles in recent years, alongside freezing and pathogens. Researchers say as a result, there has been an increased need for predictive tools, like imaging spectroscopy and models that rely on it, for land conditions to inform mitigation strategies.Nelson says the study was conducted in cooperation with his laboratory of ecological spectroscopy (lecospec) at the Schoodic Institute, which was financed by the Maine Economic Improvement Fund, Maine Space Grant Consortium, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other University of Maine System funds. The research team used a software he developed with Chan and other students that allows drones and spectrometers to measure light across dozens or hundreds of more bands of color than an average camera, Nelson says.""We envisioned and continue to promote this as a research and application tool to produce data and algorithms applied to questions and problems in forest, agricultural and marine sectors of Maine's economy,"" he says.Reference: Chan C, Nelson PR, Hayes DJ, Zhang Y-J, Hall B.

A research team led by Julia Vorholt from the Institute of Microbiology at ETH Zurich, together with colleagues in Germany, first inventoried and categorised these bacteria six years ago. Back then, they isolated 224 strains from the various bacterial groups that live on the leaves of thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana). These can be assembled into simplified, or ""synthetic"" plant microbiomes. The researchers thus laid the foundations for their two new studies, which were just published in the journals Nature Plants and Nature Microbiology.Volume control of the plant response In the first study, the researchers investigated how plants respond to their colonisation by microorganisms. Vorholt's team dripped bacterial cultures onto the leaves of plants that had, up to that point, been cultivated under sterile conditions. As expected, different types of bacteria triggered a variety of responses in the plants. For example, exposure to certain genera of Gammaproteobacteria caused the thale cress plants to activate a total of more than 3,000 different genes, while those of Alphaproteobacteria triggered a response in only 88 genes on average. ""Despite this broad range of responses to the different bacteria of the microbiome, we were astonished to pinpoint a central response: the plants practically always activate a core set of 24 genes,"" Vorholt says. But that's not all the team found: acting as a kind of volume control for the plant response, the activation intensity of these 24 genes provides information as to how extensively the bacteria have colonised the plant. This volume control also predicts how many additional genes the plant will activate as it adapts to the new arrivals. Plants with defects in some of these 24 genes are more susceptible to harmful bacteria, Vorholt's team has shown. And since other studies had noticed that some genes in the core set are also involved in plant responses to osmotic shock or fungal infestation, the ETH researchers infer that the 24 genes constitute a general defensive response. ""It looks like an immune training, even though the bacteria we used aren't pathogens, but rather partners in a natural community,"" Vorholt says. Bacterial community out of control In the second study, Vorholt and her team explored how bacterial communities change when mutations cause a plant to be deficient in one or several genes. The team expected to see that genetic defects in receptors, which plants use to detect the presence of microbes, play a major role in the story. What they didn't expect was that another genetic defect would have the biggest effect: if the plants were deficient in a certain enzyme, an NADPH oxidase, the bacterial community was thrown off-?kilter. Plants use this enzyme to produce highly reactive oxygen radicals, which have an antimicrobial effect. In the absence of this NADPH oxidase, microbes that under normal circumstances lived peacefully on the leaves developed into what are known as opportunistic pathogens. Is the NADPH oxidase found among the core set of 24 genes responsible for general defensive response? ""No, that would have been too good to be true,"" says Sebastian Pfeilmeier, a member of Vorholt's research group and lead author of the study. This is because the gene responsible for the NADPH oxidase is turned on prior to contact with microbes and because the enzyme is activated by chemical reactions governed by phosphorylation. For Vorholt, the two studies show that synthetic microbiomes are a promising approach to investigating the complex interactions within different communities. ""Since we can control and precisely engineer the communities, we can do much more than just observe what happens. In addition to simply determining cause and effect, we can understand them on a molecular level,"" Vorholt says. An ideal microbiome protects plants from diseases while also making them more resilient to drought and salty conditions. This is why the agricultural industry is among those interested in the team's results. They should help farmers harness the power of the microbiome in the future.ReferenceMaier BA, Kiefer P, Field CM, et al. A general non-self response as part of plant immunity.

This creates massive demand on the production of  virgin  polymer plastic material. Not all forms of which are currently recyclable; and of the ones that are, finding methods to do this that can provide reusable plastic material for use in products again is still limited.The scientists - including LaShanda Korley, Distinguished Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Thomas Epps III, Allan & Myra Ferguson Distinguished Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the University of Delaware and Brett Helms from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California - join Professor Tony Ryan, Director of the University of Sheffield Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures - to highlight how the pandemic has greatly contributed to the consumption of plastic, adding to the recent demand of single use plastics, including medical packaging, masks and gloves.Co-author and Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Sheffield, Tony Ryan, said:  This paper is essentially a call to arms to other scientists in this area to put their intellectual power behind potential solutions to the plastic problem. This is something that needs policy and business models to come together and create a broad multidisciplinary mix. It's a wicked problem that needs a holistic approach. One of the biggest hurdles to overcome around the problem is all of the regulations around the use of plastics, particularly in medical consumables such as devices and Personal Protective Equipment, which were written when single use plastic was at its cheapest and doesn t consider what would happen to it after it s useful life. Basically we've had 50 years of cultural training to throw things away that we now have to undo. With less than 10 per cent of plastics being recycled worldwide, only 1 per cent currently recycled more than once and only 12 per cent incinerated for energy recovery; over three quarters of plastic material is currently being wasted and thrown away, contributing to the more than seven billion tons of plastics already posing an urgent crisis for the planet.Traditional methods of recycling plastic waste, such as mechanical recycling, can still be inefficient, limit the amount of plastic material that can be recovered and reduce its material properties, limiting its second or third use as a new product and meaning it is typically cheaper to produce new plastic and products.Methods such as chemical upcycling can be used for certain plastics, like those used to create plastic bottles, to turn the plastic material into something with better properties than before, saving more in the process and even dealing with certain levels of contamination.Within the discussion paper, the academics hope that vital steps within the development of plastic products will generate more efficient use of polymer materials. Designing products to be recycled when used and to promote the development of upcycling and upgrading of plastics, so they can be used again instead of creating more waste.One example is an initiative by Sea2See eyewear, that uses discarded fishing nets to create glasses and timepieces, by finding material with a known provenance and the ability to turn the material back into its original polymer form, they are able to create something new, reducing the burden of waste on the environment, and producing less virgin material for their products.Professor Tony Ryan added:  The University of Sheffield and the Grantham Centre are striving for global equity and building a more sustainable future, what I want to be really clear in the paper was this isn't the silver bullet, it's not going to address every problem, but there are certain niches where this is the best solution and we can exploit it to find the best solutions for different problems, and of course different plastics. Promoting the cultural change needed to create the diverse solutions needed to tackle the complex problem of plastic waste worldwide is a central focus of Professor Ryan s  Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures Many Happy Returns project, where experts are developing reusable plastic packaging systems to reduce the need for single-use plastics, and tackle the plastic material produced for packaging each year, over half of which is never reused.Reference: Korley LTJ, Epps TH, Helms BA, Ryan AJ.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cultured-meat-replaces-animals-with-grass-350439,Cultured Meat Replaces Animals With Grass An affordable lab system that uses grass blades to turn cells into cultured meat has been developed  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An affordable lab system that uses grass blades to turn cells into cultured meat has been developed at the University of Bath.Researchers have successfully taken grass from the university s campus and used it to create a scaffold that animal cells can attach to and grow on. The resulting tissue has the potential to be used both as lab-made meat and as human muscle tissue to repair or replace tissue which has been damaged or lost through injury or disease. The study, by Dr Paul De Bank (Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology), Professor Marianne Ellis (Department of Chemical Engineering) and Scott Allan (a PhD researcher in the Department of Chemical Engineering), is published in this month s Journal of Biomedical Materials Research   Part A. The first step in the new bioengineering process involves emptying grass blades of their native cells in a process known as decellularisation. The decellularised blades are then seeded with a set of cells derived from a mouse cell line (these cells would eventually be replaced by bovine stem cells). The introduced cells stick to the scaffold s surface, multiply and form links with neighbouring cells, eventually growing as a cell mass to form new 3D tissue. There are several challenges researchers must overcome when looking for a suitable scaffold on which to engineer new muscle tissue. First, the scaffold must be one cells can readily attach to the surface. It must then allow these cells to proliferate and align in a way that precisely mimics the fibres of the natural tissue they are replicating (with muscle fibres, for instance, all the cells need to contract and relax in tandem). Second, for scale-up, the scaffold must be cost-effective and straightforward to manufacture. For lab-grown meat, there is a third challenge: the scaffold must be edible to humans, even if not highly digestible (as is the case for grass). The Bath project shows grass blades fulfil all criteria. Dr Paul De Bank, who led the research, said:  When we were looking for a scaffold for our cells, we wanted to find something that was both sustainable and edible. I thought along the lines of a decellularised natural material because cellulose (which grass is largely made of) is edible, but also because grass has aligned grooves that I hoped would allow the cells to line up together to make the fibres we needed   and it worked!  He added:  When we eat beef, we re partly eating the grass the cows have grazed on in their lifetime. What s neat about our study is that it shows that we can directly replace the animals with the grass they eat. Our system needs to be scaled up but I m hopeful that sooner rather than later, we could have a meat product on the market based on grass.  The adhesion of the animal stem cells to the grass surface was found to be around 35%, which is considered a good result.  Often, decellularised plant scaffolds need to be chemically modified to get cells to grow on them. The great thing we've found with grass is that we get significant adhesion without further processing steps.  said Dr De Bank, adding:  We are, however, hoping to find a way to increase this adhesion   we have a new PhD student who will be working on this, exploring ways to optimise cell attachment and growth. The next big challenge will be scaling up this process to generate sufficient quantities of both cells and scaffold material in order to produce a significant quantity of muscle tissue. If this is successful then   one day   consumers may be able to buy grass-reared meat with a clear conscience, free from the environmental and animal-welfare concerns many are wrestling with today.ReferenceAllan SJ, Ellis MJ, Bank PAD.

Their new method works by using a catalyst made from gold and palladium that takes in hydrogen and oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide   a commonly used disinfectant that is currently produced on an industrial scale. Over four million tonnes of hydrogen peroxide are made in factories each year, where it is then transported to the places it is used and stored. This means that stabilising chemicals are often added to the solutions during the production process to stop it degrading but these reduce its effectiveness as a disinfectant. Another common approach to disinfecting water is the addition of chlorine; however, it has been shown that chlorine can react with naturally occurring compounds in water to form compounds which, in high doses, can be toxic to humans. The ability to be able to produce hydrogen peroxide at the point of use would overcome both efficacy and safety issues currently associated with commercial methods. In their study, the team tested the disinfection efficacy of commercially available hydrogen peroxide and chlorine compared to their new catalytic method. Each was tested for its ability to kill Escherichia coli in identical conditions, followed by subsequent analysis to determine the processes by which the bacteria were killed using each method. The team showed that as the catalyst brought the hydrogen and oxygen together to form hydrogen peroxide, it simultaneously produced a number of highly reactive compounds, known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which the team demonstrated were responsible for the antibacterial and antiviral effect, and not the hydrogen peroxide itself. The catalyst-based method was shown to be 10,000,000 times more potent at killing the bacteria than an equivalent amount of the industrial hydrogen peroxide, and over 100,000,000 times more effective than chlorination, under equivalent conditions. In addition to this, the catalyst-based method was shown to be more effective at killing the bacteria and viruses in a shorter space of time compared to the other two compounds. It is estimated that around 785 million people lack access to water and 2.7 billion experience water scarcity at least one month a year. In addition to this, inadequate sanitation a problem for around 2.4 billion people around the world can lead to deadly diarrheal diseases, including cholera and typhoid fever, and other water-borne illnesses. Co-author of the study Professor Graham Hutchings, Regius Professor of Chemistry at the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, said:  The significantly enhanced bactericidal and virucidal activities achieved when reacting hydrogen and oxygen using our catalyst, rather than using commercial hydrogen peroxide or chlorination shows the potential for revolutionising water disinfection technologies around the world.  We now have proven one-step process where, besides the catalyst, inputs of contaminated water and electricity are the only requirements to attain disinfection.  Crucially, this process presents the opportunity to rapidly disinfect water over timescales in which conventional methods are ineffective, whilst also preventing the formation of hazardous compounds and biofilms, which can help bacteria and viruses to thrive.

Were these cells part of the animal or separate organisms? If separate, were they parasites or did they confer a benefit to the host?In a paper published in the journal Nature in 1882, biologist Sir Patrick Geddes of Edinburgh University proffered that not only were these cells distinct entities, but they were also beneficial to the animals in which they lived. He assigned them to a new genus, Philozoon -- from the Greek phileo, meaning 'to love as a friend,' and zoon, meaning 'animal' -- and then promptly changed his career direction to pioneer professions in urban planning and design. Over time, Geddes's scientific contributions were largely forgotten, and the Philozoon genus name was never used.Now, more than a century after Geddes's paper was published, an international team of researchers has revisited these ""yellow cells,"" which, after Geddes, had been determined to be photosynthetic algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae.In a study published in the June 28 issue of the European Journal of Phycology, the team resurrected the genus Philozoon by using modern technologies to thoroughly characterize two of the species of algae that Geddes had investigated, along with six new related ones.""Patrick Geddes was ahead of his time in recognizing the ecological significance of the 'yellow cells' found in some animals were actually distinct entities -- micro-algal symbionts -- existing inside the animal's tissues and creating a photosynthetic animal. That was a major revelation! In fact, we now know that microorganisms live in partnership with all multicellular organisms; for example, the bacteria that comprise our human gut microbiomes are essential for our overall health,"" said Todd LaJeunesse, professor of biology, Penn State, and lead author of the paper. ""By emending and reviving the Philozoon genus, we are honoring the work of this natural historian.LaJeunesse and his colleagues used genetic information; outward physical, or morphological, characteristics; ecological traits; and geographic distributions to define the diversity found within the newly recognized Philozoon genus. They obtained animal samples -- including from soft and stony corals, jellyfish, and sea anemones -- from locations all over the world. They also obtained samples from Italy where Geddes first conducted his original research.""Because our team comprises scientists from seven countries, we were able to collect all of these samples, and some during the global pandemic,"" said LaJeunesse. ""This study highlights how the spirit of scientific discovery brings people together, even in times of hardship.""""The fact that these algae exist in animals from the Mediterranean Sea to New Zealand to Chile reminds us how widespread these symbioses are on Earth,"" said LaJeunesse. ""Also, since most of the algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae have been thought to be mostly tropical where they are critical to the formation of coral reefs, finding and describing these new species in cold waters highlights the capacity of these symbioses to evolve and live under a broad range of environmental conditions. Life finds a way to persist and proliferate.""The team documented that at their northernmost and southernmost latitudinal extremes, Philozoon experience water temperatures that may reach winter lows of nearly 40 degrees F and summer highs of close to 90 F.""The abilities of these Philozoons to withstand a wide range of temperatures is likely due to their diversification during the cooler periods of the late Pliocene and most recent Pleistocene epochs,"" said LaJeunesse. ""This adaptation to a range of temperatures could protect them and the animals with which they associate from some of the effects of climate change, at least in the near term. Similarly, adaptation to high latitude environments may condition Philozoon species to tolerating future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which could also help make them resilient to some of the effects of ocean acidification.""He added that careful identification and categorization of these symbiotic algae is essential to understanding the biology and evolution of marine animals that rely on these organisms for their survival.""The advanced molecular-genetic techniques available to us today have substantially improved our ability to study and understand these microbes,"" said Pilar Casado-Amez a, researcher, HyT Association, Spain. ""Our new study lays the groundwork for extensive research on the ecological role of animal-algal mutualisms in temperate marine ecosystems.""LaJeunesse noted that although there were a handful of other scientists during the late 1800s that were investigating these 'yellow cells' it was Geddes who unequivocally recognized the full significance of the evidence before him.He explained, ""In describing the associations between the cells and the host animals, Geddes called them 'animal lichens' and eloquently wrote, 'Such an association is far more complex than that of the fungus and alga in the lichen, and indeed stands unique in the physiology as the highest development, not of parasitism, but of the reciprocity between the animal and vegetable kingdoms.' Geddes vigorously contended that these algae were symbiotic in nature. Now, more than a century after their discovery, the true identities of these algae are finally being properly characterized.""Reference: LaJeunesse TC, Wiedenmann J, Casado-Amez a P, et al.

It is already a known fact that NETs can contribute to sputum thickness, severe sepsis-like inflammation and thrombosis. After being treated with an already existing drug, the NETs were dissolved and patients improved. The study has now been published in Molecular & Cellular Proteomics.Using advanced fluorescence microscopy, the researchers examined sputum in the airways of three severely ill Covid-19 patients. The results showed that the samples contained large amounts of one of the immune system's most important agents against bacteria: neutrophils. Neutrophils can form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to capture and neutralise pathogens - primarily bacteria but also viruses.""We are aware that NETs contribute to sputum viscosity and severe sepsis-like inflammation as well as increase risk of thrombosis i.e. blood clots. We also see these three clinical findings in severely ill Covid-19 patients"", says Adam Linder, researcher at Lund University and infectious disease physician at Sk ne University Hospital.Patients with cystic fibrosis can also suffer from increased sputum viscosity. In these cases, a DNase drug is sometimes used to degrade DNA, of which NETs are primarily composed. Could the same drug have an effect on severe Covid 19 cases? A pilot study was conducted after the researchers could see in laboratory test tubes that the DNase preparation degraded the NETs. Five severely ill Covid-19 patients, who required high-flow oxygen therapy and were on the verge of needing mechanical ventilation, were treated with the preparation.""The patients responded very well to the treatment.

But new research may help neurologists identify which drugs are best for people with the advanced form of MS called secondary progressive MS. The new study, published in the June 30, 2021, online issue of Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that the more potent disease-modifying drugs are more effective in reducing flare-ups in secondary progressive MS than the less potent drugs that tend to be safer to take. However, the researchers found no difference in how fast the disease progressed between these two types of drugs.Most people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, marked by symptom flare-ups called relapses followed by quiet periods called remission. More than half of these people eventually transition to secondary progressive MS, which is a slow, steady, worsening of the disease that may or may not include relapses.""Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease to treat and must be closely monitored as it is managed with various medications, some of which can have serious side effects,"" said study author Tomas Kalincik, MD, PhD, of the University of Melbourne in Australia. ""High-efficacy medications are prescribed in early multiple sclerosis to more aggressively treat the disease and have been found to more effectively prevent flare-ups and modify progression, but less is known about how effective these therapies may be later when relapsing-remitting MS transitions to secondary progressive MS.""The study involved 1,000 people with secondary progressive MS. Participants were followed for 10 years to see whether they had relapses and if they became more disabled over time.Researchers divided participants into two groups, those treated with one of the more potent drugs, or high-efficacy drugs (natalizumab, alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, ocrelizumab, rituximab, cladribine and fingolimod) and those treated with one of the less potent drugs, or low-efficacy drugs (interferon  , glatiramer acetate and teriflunomide). People in each group were matched for factors like disability level and how long they had secondary progressive MS.After accounting for the lag time before a person starts to experience the benefit of a medication, researchers found that in people with active disease, or those experiencing relapses within the past two years, people who were treated with high-efficacy medications experienced 30% fewer relapses than people treated with low-efficacy medications. People in the high-efficacy group experienced an average of 0.17 relapses per year compared 0.27 relapses per year in the low-efficacy group.""Our study finding that high-efficacy therapies are superior to low-efficacy therapies only in reducing relapses in people with active secondary progressive MS provides valuable guidance for neurologists when choosing the most effective therapies for people with this form of MS,"" said Kalincik. ""When the goal is to alleviate ongoing relapse activity, more potent therapy is justified. But when the goal is to limit disability progression in secondary progressive MS, both types of drugs show comparable effectiveness.""A limitation of the study was that participants were grouped by those taking high-efficacy or low-efficacy therapies. However, therapies were not studied individually. Kalincik said it is possible that individual therapies may have different effects on symptoms and disability and recommend that they be examined separately in future research.Reference: Roos I, Leray E, Casey R, et al.

Understanding how eating disorder behaviors and neurobiology interact can shed light on why these disorders often become chronic and could aid in the future development of treatments. The study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, was supported by the National Institutes of Health. This work is significant because it links biological and behavioral factors that interact to adversely impact eating behaviors,  said Janani Prabhakar, Ph.D., of the Division of Translational Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, part of NIH.  It deepens our knowledge about the underlying biological causes of behavioral symptom presentation related to eating disorders and will give researchers and clinicians better information about how, when, and with whom to intervene. Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses that can lead to severe complications, including death. Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Behaviors associated with eating disorders can vary in type and severity and include actions such as binge-eating, purging, and restricting food intake.In this study, Guido Frank, M.D.(link is external), at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues wanted to see how behaviors across the eating disorder spectrum affect reward response in the brain, how changes in reward response alter food intake control circuitry, and if these changes reinforce eating disorder behaviors. The study enrolled 197 women with different eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and other specified feeding and eating disorders) and different body mass indexes (BMIs) associated with eating disorder behaviors, as well as 120 women without eating disorders.The researchers used cross-sectional functional brain imaging to study brain responses during a taste reward task. During this task, participants received or were denied an unexpected, salient sweet stimulus (a taste of a sugar solution). The researchers analyzed a brain reward response known as  prediction error,  a dopamine-related signaling process that measures the degree of deviation from the expectation, or how surprised a person was receiving the unexpected stimulus. A higher prediction error indicates that the person was more surprised, while a lower prediction error indicates they were less surprised. They also investigated whether this brain response was associated with ventral-striatal-hypothalamic circuitry, a neural system associated with food intake control.The researchers found that there was no significant correlation between BMI, eating disorder behavior, and brain reward response in the group of women without eating disorders. In the group of women with eating disorders, higher BMI and binge-eating behaviors were associated with lower prediction error response. Further, for the women with eating disorders, the direction of ventral striatal-hypothalamic connectivity was the reverse of those without eating disorders, with connectivity directed from the ventral striatum to the hypothalamus. This connectivity was positively related to the prediction error response and negatively related to feeling out of control after eating.These results suggest that for the women with eating disorders, eating disorder behaviors and excessive weight loss or weight gain modulated the brain s dopamine-related reward circuit response, altering brain circuitry associated with food intake control, and potentially reinforcing eating disorder behaviors. For example, women with anorexia nervosa, restrictive food intake, and low BMIs had a high prediction error response. This response may strengthen their food intake-control circuitry, leading these women to be able to override hunger cues. In contrast, the opposite seems to be the case for women with binge-eating episodes and higher BMIs. The study provides a model for how behavioral traits promote eating problems and changes in BMI, and how eating disorder behaviors, anxiety, mood, and brain neurobiology interact to reinforce the vicious cycle of eating disorders, making recovery very difficult,  said Dr. Frank.          Overall, this study suggests that behavioral traits, including food intake behavior, contribute to eating disorder maintenance and progression by modulating one s internal reward response and altering food intake control circuitry. However, further research is needed to investigate treatments that could target and change behaviors for individuals with eating disorders to achieve lasting recovery.Reference: Frank GKW, Shott ME, Stoddard J, Swindle S, Pryor TL.

For business and for pleasure, human beings are in constant communication.Our proclivity for socialization is lifelong, equally prominent in the lives of adolescents and adults. A recent study determined key differences in the ways that various age groups communicate, as well as one conversational component that stands the test of time: friendship. Specifically, bonds between individuals who identify as female.Led by former Beckman Institute postdoctoral researchers Michelle Rodrigues and Si On Yoon, an interdisciplinary team evaluated how interlocutors' age and familiarity with one another impacts a conversation, reviewing the interaction's overall effectiveness and stress responses generated as a result.The study, titled ""What are friends for? The impact of friendship on communicative efficiency and cortisol response during collaborative problem solving among younger and older women,"" was published in the Journal of Women and Aging in May 2021.Two hypotheses form the foundation of this female-focused study. First, the tend-and-befriend hypothesis, which challenges the traditionally masculine ""fight-or-flight"" dichotomy.""Women have evolved an alternative mechanism in response to stress,"" said Rodrigues, who is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Sciences at Marquette University. ""In order to deal with stress, women can befriend female peers.""The team also tested the socio-emotional selectivity hypothesis, which postulates a social ""pruning"" as humans advance in age and pursue more intimate, higher-quality circles of friends.The introduction of age as a variable is novel in the field and stems from an interdisciplinary Beckman collaboration.""I was working with several different groups in several different disciplines, coming from the perspective of studying friendship but having previously done research on adolescent girls, but not older women,"" Rodrigues said.She combined forces with then-Beckman-postdoc Si On Yoon, who was studying the cognitive mechanisms of natural conversation across the lifespan, including healthy younger and older adults.""My research program was focused on language measures in social interactions, and I was glad to work with Dr. Rodrigues to develop an integrative approach including both language processing and physiological measures to study social interactions,"" said Yoon, who is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University of Iowa.The interdisciplinary team merged both theories into a single query: Across women's lifespans, how are the tendencies to ""tend and befriend"" as well as socially select reflected in their communication?They tested a pool of 32 women: 16 ""older adults"" aged 62-79, and 16 ""younger adults"" aged 18-25. Each participant was either paired with a friend (a ""familiar"" conversation partner) or a stranger (""unfamiliar"").The partnerships underwent a series of conversational challenges, wherein the participant instructed her partner to arrange a set of tangrams in an order that only the former could see. The catch? Each shape was abstract, their appearances purposefully difficult to describe.""You could look at one [tangram] and say, 'This looks like a dog.' Or, you could say, 'This looks like a triangle, with a stop sign, and a bicycle wheel,'"" Rodrigues said.This exercise helped quantify each conversation's efficiency: partners who achieved the desired tangram arrangement in fewer words were considered more efficient, and pairs who needed more words to complete the task were considered less efficient.The researchers found that while the younger adult pairs communicated more efficiently with familiar partners than their older counterparts, they communicated less efficiently with unfamiliar partners; alternatively, the older adults demonstrated conversational dexterity, quickly articulating the abstract tangrams to friends and strangers alike.""A referential communication task like this requires that you see where the other person is coming from. It seems like the younger adults are a little more hesitant in trying to do that, whereas the older adults have an easier time doing that with strangers,"" Rodrigues said.This was not predicted based on the socio-emotional selectivity hypothesis, which anticipated a correlation between age and social isolation.""Even though older adults choose to spend more time with people who matter to them, it's clear that they have the social skills to interact with unfamiliar people if and when they choose to,"" Rodrigues said.Rodrigues' team also measured salivary cortisol to quantify and compare participants' stress levels throughout the testing process.""When you experience something stressful, if you have a stress response system that's working as it should, the result is an elevated amount of cortisol, our primary stress hormone, which then tells our bodies to release glucose into our bloodstreams,"" she said. ""That's reflected in our saliva about 15 to 20 minutes after we experience it. If we see a rise in salivary cortisol from an individual's baseline levels, that indicates that they are more stressed than they were at the time of the earlier measurements.""Across both age groups, those working with familiar partners had consistently lower cortisol levels than those working with unfamiliar partners.""A lot of the research on the tend-and-befriend hypothesis has only focused on young women, so it's great to have these results that pull that out to the end of life. We can see that friendship has that same effect throughout the lifespan. Familiar partners and friendship buffer stress, and that's preserved with age,"" Rodrigues said.Reference: Rodrigues MA, Yoon SO, Clancy KBH, Stine-Morrow EAL. What are friends for?

For instance, heatwaves and droughts lead to earlier berry ripening and lackluster wine. And these types of episodes are expected to intensify as Earth's climate changes. Now, researchers reporting in ACS' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry have tweaked growing conditions for Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to slow down their ripening, which increased the levels of compounds associated with wine's characteristic floral and fruity notes.As grapes ripen and change color from light green to deep red, sugars and aroma compounds accumulate in the berries. But, when they ripen quickly because of heat or water stress, the resulting fruits produce a less desirable wine with more alcohol, a duller color and a lingering taste of cooked fruit. To counteract these negative effects of climate change on wine quality, scientists have been testing different ways to grow the plants. Previous researchers have shown that reducing the crop on the vines can speed-up grape ripening, while more intense irrigation later in the growing season can delay the process. Christopher Ford and colleagues wanted to examine the impacts of these techniques on the chemical components that contribute to the berries' quality.The researchers grew Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes at a commercial vineyard in the San Joaquin Valley in California. Then, they either removed a portion of the clusters on the vines, irrigated the plants more during the later growing season, did both or did neither, and collected grapes throughout the ripening period. The plants with the fewest berry clusters had the fastest increase in sugar content and were ripe the earliest for all of the tested conditions. However, the plants that were both thinned and watered more had the slowest rate of sugar accumulation. The researchers found that slowing down grape ripening decreased six-carbon aldehydes and alcohols and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine -- associated with green and vegetal wine notes -- and increased norisoprenoids and terpenes -- associated with pleasant floral and fruity wine notes. The longer growing time improved the quality of grapes for winemaking, the researchers explained, but these adaptation strategies should be monitored over several years before changes are made to current practices.Reference: Previtali P, Dokoozlian NK, Pan BS, Wilkinson KL, Ford CM.

The findings by a team of researchers from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), parts of the National Institutes of Health; and the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, were published in the July 3 issue of The BMJ.This study of 182 adults with frequent migraines expanded on the team's previous work on the impact of linoleic acid and chronic pain. Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid commonly derived in the American diet from corn, soybean, and other similar oils, as well as some nuts and seeds. The team's previous smaller studies explored if linoleic acid inflamed migraine-related pain processing tissues and pathways in the trigeminal nerve, the largest and most complex of the body's 12 cranial nerves. They found that a diet lower in linoleic acid and higher in levels of omega-3 fatty acids (like those found in fish and shellfish) could soothe this pain pathway inflammation.In a 16-week dietary intervention, participants were randomly assigned to one of three healthy diet plans. Participants all received meal kits that included fish, vegetables, hummus, salads, and breakfast items. One group received meals that had high levels of fatty fish or oils from fatty fish and lowered linoleic acid. A second group received meals that had high levels of fatty fish and higher linoleic acid. The third group received meals with high linoleic acid and lower levels of fatty fish to mimic average U.S. intakes.During the intervention period, participants monitored their number of migraine days, duration, and intensity, along with how their headaches affected their abilities to function at work, school, and in their social lives, and how often they needed to take pain medications. When the study began, participants averaged more than 16 headache days per month, over five hours of migraine pain per headache day, and had baseline scores showing a severe impact on quality of life despite using multiple headache medications.The diet lower in vegetable oil and higher in fatty fish produced between 30% and 40% reductions in total headache hours per day, severe headache hours per day, and overall headache days per month compared to the control group. Blood samples from this group of participants also had lower levels of pain-related lipids. Despite the reduction in headache frequency and pain, these same participants reported only minor improvements in migraine-related overall quality of life compared to other groups in the study.Migraine, a neurological disease, ranks among the most common causes of chronic pain, lost work time, and lowered quality of life. More than 4 million people worldwide have chronic migraine (at least 15 migraine days per month) and over 90% of sufferers are unable to work or function normally during an attack, which can last anywhere from four hours to three days. Women between the ages of 18 and 44 are especially prone to migraines, and an estimated 18% of all American women are affected. Current medications for migraine usually offer only partial relief and can have negative side effects including sedation, and the possibility of dependence or addiction.""This research found intriguing evidence that dietary changes have potential for improving a very debilitating chronic pain condition like migraine without the related downsides of often prescribed medications,"" said Luigi Ferrucci, M.D., Ph.D., scientific director of NIA.The NIH team was led by Chris Ramsden, a clinical investigator in the NIA and NIAAA intramural research programs, and UNC adjunct faculty member. Ramsden and his team specialize in the study of lipids -- fatty acid compounds found in many natural oils -- and their role in aging, especially chronic pain and neurodegenerative conditions. The UNC team was led by Doug Mann, M.D., of the Department of Neurology, and Kim Faurot, Ph.D., of the Program on Integrative Medicine. Meal plans were designed by Beth MacIntosh, M.P.H., of UNC Healthcare's Department of Nutrition and Food Services.""Changes in diet could offer some relief for the millions of Americans who suffer from migraine pain,"" said Ramsden. ""It's further evidence that the foods we eat can influence pain pathways.""The researchers noted that these findings serve as validation that diet-based interventions increasing omega-3 fats while reducing linoleic acid sources show better promise for helping people with migraines reduce the number and impact of headache days than fish-oil based supplements, while reducing the need for pain medications. They hope to continue to expand this work to study effects of diet on other chronic pain conditions.Reference: Ramsden CE, et al.

By examining this network using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, they were able to identify key proteins involved in infection as well as biological pathways that might be targeted by drugs.To date, the majority of small molecule and antibody approaches for treating COVID-19 are drugs that are either currently the subject of clinical trials or have already been through clinical trials and been approved. Much of the focus has been on several key virus or host targets, or on pathways - such as inflammation - where a drug treatment could be used as an intervention.The team used computer modelling to carry out a 'virtual screen' of almost 2,000 approved drugs and identified 200 approved drugs that could be effective against COVID-19. Forty of these drugs have already entered clinical trials, which the researchers argue supports the approach they have taken.When the researchers tested a subset of those drugs implicated in viral replication, they found that two in particular - an antimalarial drug and a type of medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis - were able to inhibit the virus, providing initial validation of their data-driven approach.Professor Tony Kouzarides, Director of the Milner Therapeutics Institute, who led the study, said: ""By looking across the board at the thousands of proteins that play some role in SARS-CoV-2 infection - whether actively or as a consequence of infections - we've been able to create a network uncovering the relationship between these proteins.""We then used the latest machine learning and computer modelling techniques to identify 200 approved drugs that might help us treat COVID-19. Of these, 160 had not been linked to this infection before. This could give us many more weapons in our armoury to fight back against the virus.""Using artificial neural network analysis, the team classified the drugs depending on the overarching role of their targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection: those that targeted viral replication and those that targeted the immune response. They then took a subset of those involved in viral replication and tested them using cell lines derived from humans and from non-human primates.Of particular note were two drugs, sulfasalazine (used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease) and proguanil (and antimalarial drug), which the team showed reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cells, raising the possibility of their potential use to prevent infection or to treat COVID-19.Dr Namshik Han, Head of Computational Research and AI at the Milner Therapeutics Institute, added: ""Our study has provided us with unexpected information about the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 and has provided us with some promising drugs that might be repurposed for either treating or preventing infection. While we took a data-driven approach - essentially allowing artificially intelligent algorithms to interrogate datasets - we then validated our findings in the laboratory, confirming the power of our approach.""We hope this resource of potential drugs will accelerate the development of new drugs against COVID-19. We believe our approach will be useful for responding rapidly to new variants of SARS-CoV2 and other new pathogens that could drive future pandemics.""Reference: Han N, Hwang W, Tzelepis K, et al.

Large cities emit significant amounts of methane, but in many cases the exact emission sources are unknown. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology have conducted mobile measurements of methane and its sources throughout Paris. Their findings suggest that the natural gas distribution network, the sewage system and furnaces of buildings are ideal targets for methane reduction efforts.In cities, major sources of atmospheric methane include heating systems, landfills, wastewater and road transport. Plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been enacted for the city of Paris, but to be successful in reducing methane emissions, sources in the city need to be precisely mapped and quantified. To draw a baseline to assess future mitigation policies and actions, Sara Defratyka and colleagues conducted repeated mobile measurements around the city to identify methane leaks. The researchers conducted 17 street-level surveys throughout Paris from September 2018 to March 2019. The team used either vehicle-mounted instruments or portable instruments for walking measurements to detect methane and its probable source, based on the gas s isotopic signature. A total of 90 potential methane leaks were detected in Paris, with 27 of them identified. Of these, 63% of emissions came from natural gas distribution networks, 33% from sewage networks and 4% from heating furnaces of buildings. Based on these findings, the researchers estimated that the total methane emission rate of Paris is about 190 metric tons per year. The actual number is likely higher because not all streets were surveyed, and the method does not report mobile methane sources from road transport, the researchers say.ReferenceDefratyka SM, Paris J-D, Yver-Kwok C, Fernandez JM, Korben P, Bousquet P.

""The results show that we can use this to test other derivatives of the NAC compound--as well as different antioxidants--and see if we find anything that has even higher neural protection.""Co-author Isabelle Matthiesen, a PhD student at KTH, says that the research is not meant to provide definitive proof of how anti-inflammatories affect the brain; yet the results provide encouraging evidence that the model could replace testing drugs on animals before clinical trials.""We successfully based the barrier on human stem cell-derived cells so this model is relevant to drugs being testing for humans, while other models are made with animal cells or are too simple to monitor closely,"" Matthiesen says.The researchers' ""brain-on-chip"" model is actually a two layered set-up where small channels carry simulated blood and inflammation agents, as well as anti-inflammatory drugs, through compartments simulating the perivascular space within the brain, and the external vascular system.Just as in a real brain, these two areas are separated by a blood brain barrier--a membrane of cells that line the blood vessels of the brain.This layer is held together by tight junctions that prevent small molecules from diffusing through the gaps between the cells. The barrier serves as a filter to prevent harmful substances from passing into the brain tissue from the bloodstream.In the model, the barrier is represented by a membrane of cells derived from the stem cells of a single patient, knitted together with proteins.Cell activity is monitored by electronic sensors which are able to take measurements every minute, as the barrier is exposed to stress similar to that which neurodegenerative diseases cause.Winkler says that the minute-by-minute detail is important because many cellular processes happen quickly.""As an example, when you first administer a drug, it causes a huge change in cells, then levels out,"" Winkler says. ""In the typical methods of testing drugs, you wouldn't see those rapid changes.""We can now see that the breakdown of the blood brain barrier happens fast under stress and we could see how that could be prevented with the anti-oxidant,"" he says.Reference: Matthiesen I, Voulgaris D, Nikolakopoulou P, Winkler TE, Herland A.

Seven high-risk patients did not. ""We could not find any antibodies against the virus in those patients,"" said Dimpy P. Shah, MD, PhD, of the Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson. ""That has implications for the future. Should we provide a third dose of vaccine after cancer therapy has completed in certain high-risk patients?""Dr. Shah is corresponding author of the study, published in the high-impact journal Cancer Cell. Coauthors are from the Mays Cancer Center and the University of Geneva.""With other vaccines and infections, patients with cancer have been shown not to develop as robust an immune response as the general population,"" said study senior coauthor Ruben Mesa, MD, FACP, executive director of the Mays Cancer Center. ""It made sense, therefore, to hypothesize that certain high-risk groups of patients do not have antibody response to COVID-19 vaccine.""""Patients with hematological malignancies, such as myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma, were less likely to respond to vaccination than those with solid tumors,"" said Pankil K. Shah, MD, PhD, of the Mays Cancer Center, who served as co-lead author of the study with Alfredo Addeo, MD, senior oncologist at the Geneva University Hospital.Among the high-risk groups, patients receiving a therapy called Rituximab within six months of vaccination developed no antibodies. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of hematological cancers and autoimmune diseases.Patients on chemotherapy that is toxic to cells developed antibody response, but it was muted compared to the general population. ""How that relates to protection against COVID-19, we don't know yet,"" Dr. Dimpy Shah said.The Delta variant and other mutants of the COVID-19 virus were not examined in the study. The team also did not analyze the response of infection-fighting T cells and B cells in the patients with cancer.The median age of patients in the study was 63. Most of the patients (106) had solid cancers as opposed to hematological malignancies (25). The study population was 80% non-Hispanic white, 18% Hispanic and 2% Black.""We recommend that future studies be done in Black, Asian and Hispanic patients, as well, to see if there are any differences in vaccination immune response,"" Dr. Mesa said.In countries where there is lack of vaccination, there is talk that one dose might confer adequate protection, but this may not be true in the case of patients with cancer, Dr. Dimpy Shah said.""We observed a significant difference in response when two doses were given,"" Dr. Shah said. ""At least for patients with cancer, two doses are very important for robust antibody response.""Dr. Pankil Shah said the study is unique because, unlike a few studies conducted in the past that evaluated immune response on the day of the second dose or within seven days of it, this study waited three to four weeks to obtain results.Patients with high-risk cancers, especially those receiving anti-CD20 antibodies, should continue to take precautions even after being vaccinated, the study implies. ""They still need to have that awareness that they could potentially be at risk because their body has not responded to vaccination,"" Dr. Pankil Shah said.Reference: Addeo A, Shah PK, Bordry N, et al.

The minerals in fossilized eggs and shell fragments provide snapshots into these creatures  early lives, as well as their fossilization processes. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Earth and Space Chemistry have analyzed the molecular makeup of fossilized dinosaur eggshells from Mexico, finding nine amino acids and evidence of ancient protein structures.Current research indicates that all dinosaurs laid eggs, though most haven t survived the test of time. And because whole eggs and shell fragments are very rare fossils, their mineral composition has not been widely investigated. Previously, Abel Moreno and colleagues reported the micro-architectures of eggshells from several species of dinosaurs found in Baja California. Although other teams have shown that some dinosaur eggshells contained calcium carbonate, carbohydrates and other compounds, no one has done similar analyses on the shells of species that Moreno s team had collected. So, as a next step, these researchers wanted to look at the mineral and organic carbon-based components in fossilized eggshells from species that hatched in the Late Cretaceous. The researchers collected five fossilized eggshells from dinosaurs in the Theropod (bipedal carnivores) and Hadrosauridae (duck-billed dinosaurs) families and an unidentified ootaxon. They found that calcium carbonate was the primary mineral, with smaller amounts of albite and quartz crystals. Anhydrite, hydroxyapatite and iron oxide impurities were also present in the shells, which the researchers suggest replaced some of the original minerals during fossilization. Then, with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), the team found nine amino acids among the five samples, but only lysine was in all of them. In addition, they identified evidence of secondary protein structures, including turns,  -helices,  -sheets and disordered structures, which were preserved for millions of years by being engrained in the minerals. The FT-IR bands corresponding to amino acids and secondary structures could be indicative of ancestral proteins that have not been characterized before, the researchers say.

""If we can identify women who are at greatest risk, we can triage them for more intense screening, improving early detection and prognosis.""The four-year project will pinpoint which factors can either increase or reduce the risks of ovarian cancer, with a special focus on metabolomics, the small molecules involved in breaking down fats for energy.Scientists believe that changes in lipid metabolism are biomarkers for ovarian cancer and they will also explore hormonal data and blood biomarkers to better predict the risks.""We know that age, endometriosis, obesity and ovulation are risk factors, and there has been great interest in seeing if these risks might be modified using hormones or other medications, such as oral contraceptives or aspirin.""There is also some research to suggest that we might even be able to modify ovarian cancer risk through diet,"" Prof Hypponen says.""Globally, this is the first and largest study of ovarian cancer to include such a comprehensive analysis of risk factors.

The research is published in the journal PLoS ONE.1But what happens to our DNA when we are not on Earth? The majority of us will not leave the planet in our lifetime, nonetheless, space exploration is extremely important when it comes to navigating and understanding human life. ""Human space exploration helps to address fundamental questions about our place in the Universe and the history of our solar system. Through addressing the challenges related to human space exploration we expand technology, create new industries and help to foster a peaceful connection with other nations,"" National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) states. It is therefore important that we have a comprehensive understanding of how space travel impacts astronauts at the molecular and cellular level. Research continues to explore this, particularly in reference to DNA damage and how the mechanisms used to repair such damage might differ on Earth and in space.In the present study, the team used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast, to test the technique. This is because yeast is safe to grow and handle, has a nucleus like human cells and DNA repair in yeast has been extensively studied.""First, we needed to insert the instructions for making the components of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system into yeast cells. These components, when assembled inside the cell, would cut the yeast DNA at a particular site. If left alone, this cut would result in the death of the yeast cells, however we also provided the instructions for repairing the DNA lesion,"" Gleason says. Inserting foreign DNA into cells had not been performed in space prior to this study, so this initial step was an ambitious goal. Once the CRISPR-Cas9 system was inserted into the cells, it would damage the DNA at the specified location, which would be visibly detectable as a color change in the yeast from red to white. ""Additionally, we assessed the DNA sequence at the lesion site to see if it had been edited using the instructions we provided. These techniques confirmed that the cells had used the instructions we provided to repair the damage caused by the CRISPRCas9 system,"" Gleason explains.In other words, the researchers had performed the first successful CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing experiment in space. ""The ability to perform this all-encompassing, end-to-end investigation is a huge step forward for space biology,"" says Sarah Castro-Wallace researcher at the NASA JSC and co-author of the study.","Published: June 30, 2021"

But new research tracing the DNA of eel fillets used for this dish has found that fraudulent food labelling is rife, with a third of the products violating EU regulations on the provision of food information. With certain species of eels now endangered, the researchers say that accurate labelling on these products is vital if the global eel trade is to be sustainable.Evidence of labelling fraud is alarmingThe European eel is a critically endangered species with trade strictly regulated, and import and export banned across the EU s external borders. While the researchers found little evidence of illegal trade in European eel in the products they examined, the prevalence of fraudulent labelling suggests that EU, and current UK, labelling requirements are insufficient.  Only through DNA analysis were we able to demonstrate that more than ten percent of the unagi kabayaki fillets were prepared from species other than that indicated on the label  said Florian Stein, the lead author from the Technische Universit t Braunschweig in Germany. He added,  In times when eel trafficking is considered to be one of the biggest wildlife crimes and consumer awareness regarding the source of their products in general is increasing   the level of evident labelling fraud is alarming. Pinpointing four species involved The origins and labelling of 108 unagi kabayaki products for sale in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France and the UK were investigated by the researchers. Being prepared fillets covered in sauce, it was impossible to identify the species without molecular analysis. Taking DNA and cross-referencing this information with a global database meant that researchers could pinpoint the species involved and check the accuracy of each product label.The researchers found that none of the products purchased in Europe were produced in Europe, all were imported from China and Taiwan.  Each product contained the fillets of one type of eel, but in total four species were detected across the sample group, only one of which is found in Chinese waters. 73 samples were American eel, 33 Japanese eel, and a single sample of European eel and Indian shortfin eel were identified.Global nature of the eel trade The presence of eels originating from various parts of the world points at the global nature of the eel trade , said Vincent Nijman, Professor in Anthropology at Oxford Brookes University in the UK, and one of the authors of the paper.  American eel is transported from the east coast of the US to southern China, where it is turned into eel fillets, these are then exported to the Netherlands from where they end up in UK supermarkets. At the same time, in another shop, also in the UK, you can buy similar looking fillets that are actually Indian eels imported from Germany, that also were processed in China but which originated from perhaps the Philippines . Accurate labelling is vitalThe research paper says it is vital that the EU and the UK achieve straightforward labelling requirements that include the scientific name of the species, and that this is made mandatory for prepared and preserved fish products.Andrew Kerr, Chairman of the Sustainable Eel Group in Brussels, who was not involved in the research, noted,  Eel is essentially a wild fish and finite   control is therefore an essential requirement for a sustainable global trade. Accurate and fully traceable labelling are in everyone s long term interests. Reference: Stein FM, Frankowski J, Nijman V, Absil C, Kranendonk I, Dekker W.

Frontiers in Pharmacology published the finding, led by scientists at Emory University.The researchers dubbed the molecule Castaneroxy A, after the genus of the European chestnut, Castanea. The use of chestnut leaves in traditional folk remedies in rural Italy inspired the research.""We were able to isolate this molecule, new to science, that occurs only in very tiny quantities in the chestnut leaves,"" says Cassandra Quave, senior author of the paper and associate professor in Emory's Center for the Study of Human Health and the School of Medicine's Department of Dermatology. ""We also showed how it disarms Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by knocking out the bacteria's ability to produce toxins.""Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes infections that are difficult to treat due to its resistance to antibiotics. It is one of the most serious infectious disease concerns worldwide, labeled as a ""serious threat"" by the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States alone, nearly 3 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the U.S. each year, killing more than 35,000 people.Antibiotics work by killing staph bacteria, which can lead to greater resistance among those few bacteria that survive, spawning ""super bugs."" The Quave lab has identified compounds from the Brazilian peppertree, in addition to the European chestnut tree, that simply neutralize the harmful effects of MRSA, allowing cells and tissue to naturally heal from an infection without boosting resistance.""We're trying to fill the pipeline for antimicrobial drug discovery with compounds that work differently from traditional antibiotics,"" Quave says. ""We urgently need these new strategies."" She notes that antimicrobial infections kill an estimated 700,000 globally each year, and that number is expected to grow exponentially if new methods of treatment are not found.First author of the Frontiers in Pharmacology paper is Akram Salam, who did the research as a PhD student in the Quave lab through Emory's Molecular Systems and Pharmacology Graduate Program.Quave is a medical ethnobotanist, researching traditional plant remedies to find promising leads for new drugs. Although many major drugs are plant-based, from aspirin (the bark of the willow tree) to Taxol (the bark of the Pacific yew tree), Quave is one of the few ethnobotanists with a focus on antibiotic resistance.The story behind the current paper began more than a decade ago, when Quave and her colleagues researched written reports and conducted hundreds of field interviews among people in rural southern Italy. That pointed them to the European, or sweet, chestnut tree, native to Southern Europe and Asia Minor. ""In Italian traditional medicine, a compress of the boiled leaves is applied to the skin to treat burns, rashes and infected wounds,"" Quave says.Quave took specimens back to her lab for analysis. By 2015, her lab published the finding that an extract from the leaves disarms even the hyper-virulent MRSA strains capable of causing serious infections in healthy athletes. Experiments also showed the extract did not disturb normal, healthy bacteria on skin cells.Finally, the researchers demonstrated how the extract works, by inhibiting the ability of MRSA bacteria to communicate with one another, a process known as quorum sensing. MRSA uses this sensing signaling system to make toxins and ramp up its virulence.For the current paper, the researchers wanted to isolate these active ingredients from the plant extract. The process is painstaking when done manually, because plant extracts typically contain hundreds of different chemicals. Each chemical must be separated out and then tested for efficacy. Large scale fraction collectors, coupled to high-performance liquid chromatographic systems, automate this separation process, but they can cost tens of thousands of dollars and did not have all the features the Quave lab needed.Marco Caputo, a research specialist in the lab, solved the problem. Using a software device from a child's toy, the LEGO MINDSTORMS robot creator, a few LEGO bricks, and some components from a hardware store, Caputo built an automated liquid separator customized to the lab's needs for $500. The lab members dubbed the invention the LEGO MINDSTORMS Fraction Collector. They published instructions for how to build it in a journal so that other researchers can tap the simple, but effective, technology.The Quave lab first separated out a group of molecules from the plant extract, cycloartane triterpenoids, and showed for the first time that this group actively blocks the virulence of MRSA. The researchers then dove deeper, separating out the single, most active molecule from this group, now known as Castaneroxy A.""Our homemade piece of equipment really helped accelerate the pace of our discovery,"" Quave says. ""We were able to isolate this molecule and derive pure crystals of it, even though it only makes up a mere .0019 percent of the chestnut leaves.""Tests on mouse skin infected with MRSA, conducted in the lab of co-author Alexander Horswill at the University of Colorado, confirmed the molecule's efficacy at shutting down MRSA's virulence, enabling the skin to heal more rapidly.Co-author John Bacsa, director of Emory Department of Chemistry's X-ray Crystallography Center, characterized the crystal shape of Castaneroxy A. Understanding the three-dimensional configuration of the crystal is important for future studies to refine and optimize the molecule as a potential therapeutic.""We're laying the groundwork for new strategies to fight bacterial infections at the clinical level,"" Quave says. ""Instead of being overly concerned about treating the pathogen, we're focusing on ways to better treat the patient. Our goal is not to kill the microbes but to find ways to weaken them so that the immune system or antibiotics are better able to clear out an infection.""Reference: Salam AM, Porras G, Cho Y-SK, et al.

The vaccine combines live parasites with either of two widely used antimalarial drugs an approach termed chemoprophylaxis vaccination. A Phase 2 clinical trial of the vaccine is now underway in Mali, a malaria-endemic country. If the approach proves successful there, chemoprophylaxis vaccination, or CVac, potentially could help reverse the stalled decline of global malaria. Currently, there is no vaccine in widespread use for the mosquito-transmitted disease.The trials were conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. They were led by Patrick E. Duffy, M.D., of the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Stephen L. Hoffman, M.D., CEO of Sanaria Inc., Rockville, Maryland.The Sanaria vaccine, called PfSPZ, is composed of sporozoites, the form of the malaria parasite transmitted to people by mosquito bites. Sporozoites travel through blood to the liver to initiate infection. In the CVac trials, healthy adult volunteers received PfSPZ along with either pyrimethamine, a drug that kills liver-stage parasites, or chloroquine, which kills blood-stage parasites. Three months later, under carefully controlled conditions, the volunteers were exposed to either an African malaria parasite strain that was the same as that in the vaccine (homologous challenge) or a variant South American parasite (heterologous challenge) that was more genetically distant from the vaccine strain than hundreds of African parasites. Exposure in both cases was via inoculation into venous blood, which infects all unvaccinated individuals.At the lowest PfSPZ dosage, the CVac approach conferred modest protection: only two of nine volunteers (22.2%) who received the pyrimethamine combination were protected from homologous challenge. In contrast, seven out of eight volunteers (87.5%) who received the highest PfSPZ dosage combined with pyrimethamine were protected from homologous challenge, and seven out of nine volunteers (77.8%) were protected from heterologous challenge. In the case of the chloroquine combination, all six volunteers (100%) who received the higher PfSPZ dosage were completely protected from heterologous challenge. The high levels of cross-strain protection lasted at least three months (the time elapsed between vaccination and challenge) for both higher-dose regimens. One hundred percent protection for three months against heterologous variant parasites is unprecedented for any malaria vaccine in development, the authors note. These data suggest that CVac could be a promising approach for vaccination of travelers to and people living in malaria-endemic areas.Reference: Mwakingwe-Omari A, Healy SA, Lane J, et al.

The Mediterranean diet is high in fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains and legumes and low in meat and dairy.  While this study was observational in nature, the results suggest that diet may be a modifiable risk factor for sudden cardiac death, and, therefore, diet is a risk factor that we have some control over,  said James M. Shikany, Dr.P.H., F.A.H.A., the study s lead author and professor of medicine and associate director for research in the Division of Preventive Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  Improving one s diet   by eating a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish such as the Mediterranean diet and low in fried foods, organ meats and processed meats, characteristics of the Southern-style dietary pattern, may decrease one s risk for sudden cardiac death,  he said. The study examined data from more than 21,000 people ages 45 and older enrolled in an ongoing national research project called REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), which is examining geographic and racial differences in stroke. Participants were recruited between 2003 and 2007. Of the participants in this analysis, 56% were women; 33% were Black adults; and 56% lived in the southeastern U.S., which is noteworthy as a region recognized as the Stroke Belt because of its higher stroke death rate. The Stroke Belt states included in this study were North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana. This study is the latest research to investigate the association between cardiovascular disease and diet   which foods have a positive vs. negative impact on cardiovascular disease risk. It may be the only study to-date to examine the association between dietary patterns with the risk of sudden cardiac death, which is the abrupt loss of heart function that leads to death within an hour of symptom onset. Sudden cardiac death is a common cause of death and accounted for 1 in every 7.5 deaths in the United States in 2016, or nearly 367,000 deaths, according to 2019 American Heart Association statistics. Researchers included participants with and without a history of coronary heart disease at the beginning of the study and assessed diets through a food frequency questionnaire completed at the beginning of the study. Participants were asked how often and in what quantities they had consumed 110 different food items in the previous year. Researchers calculated a Mediterranean diet score based on specific food groups considered beneficial or detrimental to health. They also derived five dietary patterns. Along with the Southern-style eating pattern, the analysis included a  sweets  dietary pattern, which features foods with added sugars, such as desserts, chocolate, candy and sweetened breakfast foods; a  convenience  eating pattern which relied on easy-to-make foods like mixed dishes, pasta dishes, or items likely to be ordered as take-out such as pizza, Mexican food and Chinese food; a  plant-based  dietary pattern was classified as being high in vegetables, fruits, fruit juices, cereal, bean, fish, poultry and yogurt; and an  alcohol and salad  dietary pattern, which was highly reliant on beer, wine, liquor along with green leafy vegetables, tomatoes and salad dressing. Shikany noted that the patterns are not mutually exclusive.  All participants had some level of adherence to each pattern, but usually adhered more to some patterns and less to others,  he explained.  For example, it would not be unusual for an individual who adheres highly to the Southern pattern to also adhere to the plant-based pattern, but to a much lower degree.  After an average of nearly 10 years of follow-up every six months to check for cardiovascular disease events, more than 400 sudden cardiac deaths had occurred among the 21,000 study participants. The study found: - Overall, participants who ate a Southern-style diet most regularly had a 46% higher risk of sudden cardiac death than people who had the least adherence to this dietary pattern. - Also, participants who most closely followed the traditional Mediterranean diet had a 26% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than those with the least adherence to this eating style. The American Heart Association s Diet and Lifestyle recommendations emphasize eating vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein, fish, beans, legumes, nuts and non-tropical vegetable cooking oils such as olive and canola oil. Limiting saturated fats, sodium, added sugar and processed meat are also recommended. Sugary drinks are the number one source of added sugar in the U.S. diet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Heart Association supports sugary drink taxes to drive down consumption of these products.  These findings support the notion that a healthier diet would prevent fatal cardiovascular disease and should encourage all of us to adopt a healthier diet as part of our lifestyles,  said Stephen Juraschek, M.D., Ph.D., a member of the American Heart Association s Nutrition Committee of the Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Council.  To the extent that they can, people should evaluate the number of servings of fruit and vegetables they consume each day and try to increase the number to at least 5-6 servings per day, as recommended by the American Heart Association. Optimal would be 8-9 servings per day.  This study  also raises important points about health equity, food security and social determinants of health,  he continued.  The authors describe the  Southern Diet  based on the U.S. geography associated with this dietary pattern, yet it would be a mistake for us to assume that this is a diet of choice. I think American society needs to look more broadly at why this type of diet is more common in the South and clusters among some racial, ethnic or socioeconomic groups to devise interventions that can improve diet quality. The gap in healthy eating between people with means and those without continues to grow in the U.S., and there is an incredible need to understand the complex societal factors that have led and continue to perpetuate these disparities.  This current research expands on earlier studies on participants from the same national stroke project, REGARDS. In a 2018 analysis, Shikany and colleagues reported that adults ages 45 and older with heart disease who had an affinity for the Southern diet had a higher risk of death from any cause, while greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause. And in a 2015 study, the Southern diet was linked to a greater risk of coronary heart disease in the same population. The large population sample and regional diversity, including a significant number of Black participants, are considered strengths of the REGARDS research project. However, potential limitations of this study include that that dietary intake was based on one-time, self-reported questionnaires, thus, it relied on the participants  memory. Self-reported diet can include inaccuracies leading to bias that could reduce the strength of the associations observed. One usual association that remains unexplained is that among individuals with a history of heart disease, those who most adhered to the sweets dietary pattern had a 51% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than participants who followed that pattern the least. Researchers note that they found  no viable explanation for the inverse association of the sweets dietary pattern with risk of sudden cardiac death in those with a history of coronary heart disease.

The findings, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, describe how these tiny synthetic nanorobots are incredibly effective at escaping cavities within maze-like environments. These nanoswimmers could one day be used to remediate contaminated soil, improve water filtration or even deliver drugs to targeted areas of the body, like within dense tissues.  This is the discovery of an entirely new phenomenon that points to a broad potential range of applications,  said Daniel Schwartz, senior author of the paper and Glenn L. Murphy Endowed Professor of chemical and biological engineering. These nanoswimmers came to the attention of the theoretical physics community about 20 years ago, and people imagined a wealth of real-world applications, according to Schwartz. But unfortunately these tangible applications have not yet been realized, in part because it s been quite difficult to observe and model their movement in relevant environments until now.  These nanoswimmers, also called Janus particles (named after a Roman two-headed god), are tiny spherical particles composed of polymer or silica, engineered with different chemical properties on each side of the sphere. One hemisphere promotes chemical reactions to occur, but not the other. This creates a chemical field which allows the particle to take energy from the environment and convert it into directional motion also known as self-propulsion. In biology and living organisms, cell propulsion is the dominant mechanism that causes motion to occur, and yet, in engineered applications, it s rarely used. Our work suggests that there is a lot we can do with self-propulsion,  said Schwartz. In contrast, passive particles which move about randomly (a kind of motion known as Brownian motion) are known as Brownian particles. They re named after 19th century scientist Robert Brown, who studied such things as the random motion of pollen grains suspended in water.The researchers converted these passive Brownian particles into Janus particles (nanoswimmers) for this research. Then they made these self-propelled nanoswimmers try to move through a maze, made of a porous medium, and compared how efficiently and effectively they found escape routes compared to the passive, Brownian particles. The results were shocking, even to the researchers. The Janus particles were incredibly effective at escaping cavities within the maze as much as 20 times faster than the Brownian particles because they moved strategically along the cavity walls searching for holes, which allowed them to find the exits very quickly. Their self-propulsion also appeared to give them a boost of energy needed to pass through the exit holes within the maze.  We know we have a lot of applications for nanorobots, especially in very confined environments, but we didn t really know how they move and what the advantages are compared to traditional Brownian particles. That s why we started a comparison between these two,  said Haichao Wu, lead author of the paper and graduate student in chemical and biological engineering.  And we found that nanoswimmers are able to use a totally different way to search around these maze environments.  While these particles are incredibly small, around 250 nanometers just wider than a human hair (160 nanometers) but still much, much smaller than the head of a pin (1-2 millimeters) the work is scalable. This means that these particles could navigate and permeate spaces as microscopic as human tissue to carry cargo and deliver drugs, as well as through soil underground or beaches of sand to remove unwanted pollutants.Swarming nanoswimmers The next step in this line of research is to understand how nanoswimmers behave in groups within confined environments, or in combination with passive particles.  In open environments, nanoswimmers are known to display emergent behavior behavior that is more than the sum of its parts that mimics the swarming motion of flocks of birds or schools of fish. That s been a lot of the impetus for studying them,  said Schwartz.One of the main obstacles to reaching this goal is the difficulty involved in being able to observe and understand the 3D movement of these tiny particles deep within a material comprising complex interconnected spaces. Wu overcame this hurdle by using refractive index liquid in the porous medium, which is liquid that affects how fast light travels through a material. This made the maze essentially invisible, while allowing the observation of 3D particle motion using a technique known as double-helix point spread function microscopy. This enabled Wu to track three-dimensional trajectories of the particles and create visual representations, a major advancement from typical 2D modeling of nanoparticles. Without this advancement, it would not be possible to better understand the movement and behavior of either individuals or groups of nanoswimmers.  This paper is the first step: It provides a model system and the imaging platform that enables us to answer these questions,  said Wu.  The next step is to use this model with a larger population of nanoswimmers, to study how they are able to interact with each other in a confined environment.

If malaria parasites invade the placenta, they can starve babies of nutrition, potentially causing low birth weight, preterm deliveries, stillbirths, and pregnancy loss. But not all women are susceptible to placental malaria infections, and the new study may help clinicians to identify those at risk and researchers to develop new therapies to protect pregnant women from malaria and related complications.A protein made by malaria parasites called VAR2CSA allows them to attach to placental cells and invade the placenta. ""Many women produce antibodies that can prevent this infection, and even those who have placental malaria during their first pregnancy are less likely to become infected during subsequent pregnancies because they have already developed protective antibodies,"" explains co-first author Dr Elizabeth Aitken, Research Officer at the Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne, Australia. ""We set out to identify the features of these antibodies that help protect women from placental infections.""In their experiments, the research team used a machine learning technique to identify naturally acquired antibody features mid pregnancy that were associated with protection from placental malaria at delivery. They analysed 169 antibody features in 77 pregnant women from Madang, Papua New Guinea.Of these features, they identified six that were associated with placental malaria protection. These fell into two broad groups: those related to preventing the parasites from binding to placental cells, and those that led to the destruction of infected blood cells. ""Using these features, we created a model that could predict which pregnant women would develop placental malaria infections with 86% accuracy,"" says co-first author Timon Damelang, a PhD student at the Doherty Institute.""These results suggest it is likely there are multiple pathways to protection against placental malaria,"" adds co-first author Amaya Ortga-Pajares, also a PhD student at the Doherty Institute.""It will be interesting to learn whether this same combination of features can protect pregnant women from placental malaria infections in other populations,"" concludes senior author Professor Stephen Rogerson, Head of the Malaria Laboratory at the Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne.

A complex set of physical and chemical processes are subsequently needed to produce useable materials. These recycling routes are energy intensive and inefficient.If an alternate approach is taken and end-of-life batteries are disassembled rather than shredded, there is the potential to recover more material, in a purer state. The disassembly of lithium-ion batteries has been shown to recover a high yield (around 80% of the original material) in a purer state than was possible using shredded material.The stumbling block - of how to remove and separate critical materials (such as lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt) from used batteries in a fast, economical and environmentally-friendly way - can now be avoided thanks to the new approach which adapts technology currently in widespread use in the food preparation industry.The ultrasonic delamination technique effectively blasts the active materials required from the electrodes leaving virgin aluminium or copper. The process proved highly effective in removing graphite and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides, commonly known as NMC.The research has been published in Green Chemistry and the research team led by Professor Abbott have applied for a patent for the technique.Professor Abbott said:""This novel procedure is 100 times quicker and greener than conventional battery recycling techniques and leads to a higher purity of recovered materials.""It essentially works in the same way as a dentist's ultrasonic descaler, breaking down adhesive bonds between the coating layer and the substrate.""It is likely that the initial use of this technology will feed recycled materials straight back into the battery production line. This is a real step change moment in battery recycling.""Professor Pam Thomas, CEO, The Faraday Institution commented:""For the full value of battery technologies to be captured for the UK, we must focus on the entire life cycle -- from the mining of critical materials to battery manufacture to recycling -- to create a circular economy that is both sustainable for the planet and profitable for industry.""Faraday Institution researchers have been focused on the life cycle of the battery - from their first production to their re-use in secondary applications to their eventual recycling, to ensure that the environmental and economic benefits from Electric Vehicle batteries are fully realised.The research team are in initial discussions with several battery manufacturers and recycling companies to place a technology demonstrator at an industrial site in 2021, with a longer-term aim to license the technology.The research team has further tested the technology on the four most common battery types and found that it performs with the same efficiency in each case.Reference: Lei C, Aldous I, Hartley JM, et al.

Composed of several concentric star polygons, the images prompt viewers to see bright fleeting rays emanating from the center that are not actually there.""The research illustrates how the brain 'connects the dots' to create a subjective reality in what we see, highlighting the constructive nature of perception,"" explains Pascal Wallisch, a clinical associate professor in New York University's Department of Psychology and Center for Data Science and senior author of the paper, which appears in the journal i-Perception.""Studying illusions can be helpful in understanding visual processing because they allow us to distinguish the mere sensation of physical object properties from the perceptual experience,"" adds first author Michael Karlovich, founder and CEO of Recursia Studios, a multidisciplinary art and fashion production company. The authors acknowledge that the visual effects of this illusion are superficially similar to a number of previously described effects of other, grid-based illusions. However, their Scintillating Starburst, unlike known visual illusions, evokes a number of newly discovered effects, among them that fleeting illusory lines diagonally connect the intersection points of the star polygons.To better understand how we process this class of illusion, the researchers ran a series of experiments with more than 100 participants, who viewed 162 different versions of the Scintillating Starburst, which varied in shape, complexity, and brightness.The research participants were then asked a series of questions about what they saw--for instance, ""I do not see any bright lines, rays, or beams,"" ""I maybe see bright lines, rays, or beams, but they are barely noticeable,"" and ""I see bright lines, rays, or beams, but they are subtle and weak.""The authors found that the confluence of several factors, including contrast, line width, and number of vertices, matters.""In particular, a large number of prominent intersection points leads to stronger and more vivid rays, as there are more cues to indicate the implied lines,"" observes Wallisch.Thus, this research illustrates how the brain ""connects the dots"" to create one's subjective reality, even on the perceptual level, highlighting the constructive nature of perception.Reference: Karlovich MW, Wallisch P.

The loss of these neurons is related to alpha-synuclein aggregation. Recent studies show that oligomers, the initial aggregates of this protein, are the most pathogenic forms of  -synuclein and are responsible for the spreading of the disease in the brain.Therefore, one of the more promising approaches in fighting this disorder consists in neutralising these oligomers and, thus, slow down the pathological progression. However, the fact that these aggregates do not present a defined structure and that they are transitory by nature makes it extremely difficult to identify molecules that bind with enough strength as to explore any clinical application.A scientific collaboration between researchers from the Institute for Biotechnology and Biomedicine (IBB) at the Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona (UAB) and from the Instituto de Biocomputaci n y F sica de Sistemas Complejos (BIFI) of the Universidad de Zaragoza (UniZar) now has been able to identify a human endogenous peptide which strongly and specifically attaches to the  -synuclein oligomers, thus avoiding their aggregation and blocking their neurotoxicity, two processes closely related to the neurodegenerative decline of Parkinson's disease. The identification and study of the peptide, called LL-37, was recently published in Nature Communications.""LL-37 interacts with the toxic alpha-synuclein oligomers in a selective manner and with a strength superior to that of any peptide previously described, equivalent to the strength exhibited by antibodies. It inhibits aggregation at very low concentrations and protects neuronal cells from being damaged"", researchers point out.They add that, ""LL-37 is found naturally in the human organism, both in the brain and in the intestine, organs in which  -synuclein aggregation takes place in Parkinson's disease. This suggests that LL-37's activity might respond to a mechanism developed by the body itself as a means to naturally fight this disease.""Encouraged by this idea, researchers now want to study how its expression can be regulated and if this strategy can become a safe therapy with the potential of influencing the course of the disease. ""There is a possibility that a therapy for Parkinson's disease already lies in our interior and that it only needs to be activated correctly"", states Salvador Ventura, researcher at the IBB and coordinator of the study.The identification of LL-37 was conducted under the framework of a research analysing the structure and characteristics of pathogenic oligomers with the aim of neutralising them in a specific manner. The analyses conducted demonstrate that helical peptides with a hydrophobic side and another positively charged side are ideal for this type of activity. The trials allowed researchers to identify three molecules with anti-aggregation activity: in addition to the human molecule, a second peptide present in bacteria and a third artificially made molecule were identified.In addition to representing a possible therapeutic route for Parkinson's disease and other synuclein pathologies, the molecules identified in the study are promising tools for its diagnosis, given that they discriminate between functional and toxic  -synuclein species.""Until now there were no molecules capable of selectively and efficiently identifying toxic  -synuclein aggregates; the peptides we present on these issues are unique and, therefore, have great potential as diagnostic and prognostic tools,"" says study co-coordinator Nunilo Cremades, researcher at BIFI-UniZar.In the study, over 25,000 human peptides were computationally analysed, and single molecule spectroscopy methods, as well as protein engineering, were applied, in addition to cell cultures in vitro using toxic oligomers.Participating in the study were researchers from the IBB-UAB and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the UAB Jaime Santos (first author of the article), Irantzu Pallar s and Salvador Ventura (co-coordinators of the study), members of the ""Protein Folding and Conformational Diseases"" group; and BIFI-UniZar researchers Pablo Gracia (second author of the article) and Nunilo Cremades (co-coordinator of the study, predoctoral researcher and lead researcher, respectively, of the ""Amyloid Protein Misfolding and Aggregation"" NEUROMOL group from the BIFI-Unizar.Reference: Santos J, Gracia P, Navarro S, et al.  -Helical peptidic scaffolds to target  -synuclein toxic species with nanomolar affinity.

They re cephalopods related to true squid, octopus, and cuttlefish, which are renowned for their intelligence and complex behaviors, but of which scientists still know little about. Now, in a new study, published in Communications Biology, researchers have used genetic techniques to show that bobtail squid and bottletail squid share a relatively recent common ancestor and that major biogeographic events might have shaped the evolution of the many different species. With 68 recognized species, bobtail squid are a very diverse family and split into three subfamilies. This study found that one of these subfamilies is further split into two geographic lineages.  explained one of the lead authors, Dr. Gustavo Sanchez, researcher at Hiroshima University and former Visiting Research Student in the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University s (OIST) Molecular Genetics Unit.  In 2019, as part of my previous research at OIST, we described a new species of bobtail squid, which highlights both the diversity present and that many unknowns remain. Bobtail and bottletail squids make up the order Sepiolida. They re small, normally between 1 and 8 cm, and live in a range of marine habitats around the globe, from shallow coastal waters to the open ocean.For this new study, Dr. Sanchez, alongside researchers from OIST and the National University of Ireland Galway, collected 32 species of bobtail and bottletail squids from across the Indo-Pacific, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean. They use a technique called genome skimming that sequences whole genomes, albeit at low coverage. This allowed them to look at the genetic variations between these species so they could estimate their evolutionary relationships and when they diverged.Their results revealed that bobtail and bottletail squids split into different families around 66 million years ago. This aligns with the rapid diversification of modern marine fishes, following the disappearance of more ancient groups due to a global mass-extinction (the same one that wiped out most of the dinosaurs). Bobtail squid went on to further diversify into three subfamilies Sepiolinae and the more closely related Rossinae, and Heteroteuthinae. The researchers found that Sepiolinae, which makes up the largest of these subfamilies, can be further split into two tribes those that are found in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and those that are found in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. This split coincided with another major biogeographical event the closure of the Tethys Sea, around 50 million years ago, which generated the separation of these two regions and resulted in this subfamily being split in two.A second interesting part of this study focused on the evolution of a light organ in bobtail squid that allows the production of luminescence. Producing luminescence is important for the survival of many of these animals as it allows for counter-illumination, which keeps them hidden from predators at night. The researchers found that the ancestor of the Sepiolinae subfamily likely possessed a bilobed light organ that housed luminescence-producing symbiotic bacteria. This has been retained by many of the species that exist today but was lost in two groups one in the Indo-Pacific tribe and the other in the Mediterranean-Atlantic tribe.   The evolutionary relationship of nearly 50% of bobtail squid still needs to be investigated but this research has provided a reliable foundation for classifying bobtail and bottletail squids,  said Prof. Daniel Rokhsar, who leads the OIST Unit.  We hope that this phylogenetic work and ancestral reconstructions will be useful in future studies. Reference: Sanchez G, Fern ndez- lvarez F , Taite M, et al.

When G4s are located in the regulatory sequences that control how genes are expressed or in other functional, but non-protein coding, regions of the genome, they are maintained by selection, are more common, and their unusual structures are more stable, according to a new study. Conversely, the structures are less common, less stable, and evolve neutrally outside of these regions, including within the protein-coding regions of genes themselves.Together, these lines of evidence suggest that G4 elements should be added to the list of functional elements of the genome along with genes, regulatory sequences, and non-protein coding RNAs, among others. A paper describing the study, by a team of researchers led by Penn State scientists, appears June 29, 2021 in the journal Genome Research.""There have been only a handful of studies that provided experimental evidence for individual G4 elements playing functional roles,"" said Wilfried Guiblet, first author of the paper, a graduate student at Penn State at the time of research, and now a postdoctoral scholar at the National Cancer Institute. ""Our study is the first to look at G4s across the genome to see if they show the characteristics of functional elements as a general rule.""As much as 1% of the genome can fold into G4s, rather than the typical double helix (in comparison, protein-coding genes occupy approximately 1.5% of the genome). G4s are one of several non-canonical shapes into which DNA can fold, collectively known as ""non-B DNA."" The G4 structure forms in DNA sequences rich in the nucleotide guanine, the ""G"" in the ACGT alphabet of the genome. G4s have been implicated in several key cellular processes and have been suggested to play a role in several human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer.To better understand the function of G4s at a genome-wide scale, the research team looked at their distribution across the genome, their thermostability, and whether or not they showed signs of being under the influence of natural selection, all in relation to other functional elements of the genome. They confirmed that, as a rule, G4s are more common in regions of the genome known to have important cellular functions and that the G4s in these regions are more stable than elsewhere in the genome.""The three-dimensional structure of G4s can form transiently and how stable their structure is depends on their underlying DNA sequence and other factors,"" said Guilbet. ""We found that, usually, G4s located within functional regions of the genome tend to be more stable. In other words, it's more likely that the DNA is folded into a G4 at any given time and thus, more likely that the G4 is there for a functional reason.""Functional regions of the genome are generally maintained by a type of natural selection called purifying selection. Mutations in these regions could disrupt their function and be harmful to the organism. The mutations therefore are usually eliminated by purifying selection, which keeps the DNA sequence relatively unchanged over time. In nonfunctional regions of the genome, a mutation may have no impact and can persist in the genome without any consequences. These regions of the genome are said to evolve neutrally. Where G4s fall in this spectrum depends on their location in the genome.""We can look at the patterns of change in a DNA sequence among human individuals and between humans and our close primate relatives as a test of natural selection and then use selection as an indicator of function,"" said Yi-Fei Huang, assistant professor of biology at Penn State and a leader of the research team. ""Our tests show that G4s located within functional regions of the genome appear to be under purifying selections, which is further evidence that G4s should be considered as functional elements. The only exception from this pattern were protein-coding regions of genes, where G4s are relatively uncommon, rather unstable, and do not evolve under purifying selection. G4s in protein-coding regions of genes might be nonfunctional and costly to maintain.""The research team has recently shown that G4s, along with other types of non-B DNA, have increased mutation rates. The fact that G4s located outside of protein-coding regions are maintained by purifying selection, despite their high mutagenic potential, adds further weight to the evidence for classifying G4s as functional elements.""We think that we are seeing evidence for a paradigm shift for how scientists define function in the genome,"" said Kateryna Makova, Verne M. Willaman Chair of Life Sciences at Penn State and a leader of the research team. ""First, geneticists focused almost exclusively on protein-coding genes, then we became aware of many functional non-coding elements, and now we have G4s and possibly other non-B DNA elements. Three-dimensional structure may be just as important for defining function as the underlying DNA sequence.""""Defining the full complement of functional genome elements is crucial for interpreting the potential disease consequences not only of inherited genetic variants but also of mutations arising within tissues over the lifetime of individuals,"" said Kristin Eckert, professor of pathology at the Penn State College of Medicine, co-author of the paper, and a member of the research team. ""The identification of G4s as novel functional elements within the human genome is key to advancing the use of genetics in precision medicine.""Reference: Guiblet WM, DeGiorgio M, Cheng X, et al.

But because they are specifically made to degrade quickly, they cannot be recycled.In Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing, researchers from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand have developed a method to turn biodegradable plastic knives, spoons, and forks into a foam that can be used as insulation in walls or in flotation devices. The investigators placed the cutlery, which was previously thought to be  nonfoamable  plastic, into a chamber filled with carbon dioxide. As pressure increased, the gas dissolved into the plastic. When they suddenly released the pressure in the chamber, the carbon dioxide expanded within the plastic, creating foaming. Author Heon Park said the process is like opening a can of soda and releasing the carbonation.  Tweaking temperature and pressure, there is a window where we can make good foams,  said Park.  It s not that every temperature or every pressure works. We found what temperature or what pressure is the best to make those nonfoamable plastics into foams.  Each time plastic is recycled, it loses a bit of its strength. Foams are an ideal new material, because they are not required to be strong in many applications.  Whenever we recycle, each time, we degrade the plastics,  said Park.  Let s say we have a biodegradable spoon. We use it once, and we recycle it back into another spoon. It may break in your mouth.  The ideal structure of a foam depends on its final use. Bulky foams, which have large or plentiful air pockets, are good for buoys. The researchers found, contrary to what was previously thought, lower chamber pressures led to bulky foams. Making biodegradable plastics recyclable could alleviate some of the global pollution problem. While biodegradable material eventually breaks down in nature, it is even better for the environment if plastics can be repurposed. Biodegradable and recyclable plastics can be used more than once but are also less of an environmental threat if they end up in oceans or landfills. The team believes this process could be implemented on a large scale.  We can expand foaming applications to a lot of plastics, not just this plastic,  said Park.ReferenceLin L, Lee Y, Park HE.

The innovative method offers great potential, especially for systematic testing in daycare centers, schools or companies. Today, the results of the study on the new Corona test have been published in the renowned journal ""Nature Biotechnology"".In order to be able to effectively monitor and contain the infection process in the corona pandemic, in addition to vaccination, systematic testing of the population remains of central importance. This is the only way to effectively monitor the spread of the virus and to contain it through targeted measures.The innovative corona test ""LAMP-Seq"", which has been developed at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), offers the possibility to test many people regularly for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this way, infections can be detected at an early stage and corresponding chains of infection can be interrupted quickly. ""Our corona test ""LAMP-Seq"" can detect about 100 times lower amounts of virus than current rapid antigen tests and is almost as sensitive and specific as the common qPCR test"" describes Prof. Dr. Jonathan Schmid-Burgk from the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology of the UKB the characteristics of the test procedure, which was developed interdisciplinary with other researchers at the UKB.""Added to this is the high scalability of the test. By using sequencing machines, thousands of samples can be analyzed simultaneously,"" said Schmid-Burgk, who was appointed to the University of Bonn from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in early 2020. The LAMP-Seq method detects not only corona infections with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also the novel variants of concern alpha to delta.Members of the ImmunoSensation2 cluster of excellence, the Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Life&Brain GmbH and Bundeswehr Central Hospital Koblenz were among those involved in the project.For the ""LAMP-Seq"" test, the Bonn scientists have adapted the already established LAMP method (""Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification"" - propagation of the viral genome at a constant temperature) and made it compatible with sequencing machines used for biomedical research. As a result, many samples can be analyzed simultaneously in a high-throughput procedure. Before thousands of samples are analyzed together in a sequencing run, each individual sample is linked to a molecular barcode. This barcode ensures that each sample can be assigned without doubt, even after thousands of samples have been pooled. ""Retesting of the entire pool in case of a positive test result is therefore no longer necessary"" says Dr. Kerstin Ludwig, Emmy-Noether group leader at the Institute of Human Genetics. This technology significantly reduces the cost per test in comparison to the qPCR test and makes the ""LAMP-Seq"" procedure a scalable corona mass test.""With its high throughput and sensitivity, the ""LAMP-Seq"" test can make a significant contribution to the screening of undetected infections. Especially in schools or companies, where many people regularly meet, the corona test is ideal to systematically and preventively monitor the occurrence of infections"" describes Ludwig, the co-developer of the test procedure, the possible application scenarios of the ""LAMP-Seq"" test.Prof. Wolfgang Holzgreve, Medical Director and CEO of the UKB, explains the benefits of the new test for corona surveillance as follows: ""In order to effectively contain a pandemic, infected people must be found before they infect others. To achieve this goal, we need mass screenings with the highest sensitivity that can give us a detailed picture of existing chains of infection. This is exactly what the corona test ""LAMP-Seq"" developed at UKB is suited for.""Even smaller models of the sequencing machines used are capable of analyzing around 10,000 samples in a single run (duration: around ten to twelve hours). This virtually eliminates laboratory capacity as a limiting factor in testing.In several large studies (including school and employee testing) with a total of around 20,000 tests, the Bonn scientists have extensively tested, optimized and successfully validated the entire upstream and downstream logistics, from sample collection by throat swabs to fully digital feedback of the test results. The documentation of the study results recently passed an independent peer review process and was published today in the renowned journal Nature Biotechnology.While the Bonn scientists have currently focused their innovative method entirely on SARS-CoV-2 testing, ""LAMP-Seq"" can also be used in the future for differential diagnostics in testing for other viruses such as influenza A and can also be quickly adapted to other viruses.The scientists are currently working on CE certification in order to make the ""LAMP-Seq"" test available internationally in the near future. Until this approval is obtained, the technically and scientifically fully validated ""LAMP-Seq"" method will continue to be used for pilot testing.Reference: Ludwig KU, Schmithausen RM, Li D, et al.

However, these theories predict that its influence on quantum scales must be vanishingly small, and experiments so far have not been accurate enough to either verify or discredit them. In new research published in EPJ Special Topics, a team led by Hartmut Abele at TU Wien in Austria demonstrate a robust experimental technique for studying one such theory, using ultra-cold neutrons. Named  Gravity Resonance Spectroscopy  (GRS), their approach could bring researchers a step closer to understanding one of the greatest mysteries in cosmology.Previously, phenomena named  scalar symmetron fields  have been proposed as a potential candidate for Dark Energy. If they exist, these fields will be far weaker than gravity   currently the weakest fundamental force known to physics. Therefore, by searching for extremely subtle anomalies in the behaviours of quantum particles trapped in gravitational fields, researchers could prove the existence of these fields experimentally. Within a gravitational field, ultra-cold neutrons can assume several discrete quantum states, which vary depending on the strength of the field. Through GRS, these neutrons are made to transition to higher-energy quantum states by the finely tuned mechanical oscillations of a near-perfect mirror. Any shifts from the expected values for the energy differences between these states could then indicate the influence of Dark Energy. In their study, Abele s team designed and demonstrated a GRS experiment named  qBOUNCE , which they based around a technique named Ramsey spectroscopy. This involved causing neutrons in an ultra-cold beam to transition to higher-energy quantum states   before scattering away any unwanted states, and picking up the remaining neutrons in a detector. Through precise measurements of the energy differences between particular states, the researchers could place far more stringent bounds on the parameters of scalar symmetron fields. Their technique now paves the way for even more precise searches for Dark Energy in future research.ReferenceJenke T, Bosina J, Micko J et al.

In particular, the LOVIT team elucidated the mechanism through which the H-1PV cancer-destroying virus can attach to and enter cancer cells, thereby causing their lysis and death. At the heart of this process lie laminins, and specifically laminin  1, a family of proteins on the surface of a cancer cell to which this virus binds, and which therefore act as the 'door' through which the virus enters the cells. The findings, which were published in the prestigious international journal Nature Communications, carry significant implications for the advancement of virus-based anticancer strategies and for the prediction of a patient's response to this innovative therapeutic approach.Oncolytic viruses, such as the rat virus H-1PV, have the ability to selectively infect and kill tumour cells, inducing their lysis and stimulating an anticancer immune response, without however harming normal healthy tissues. Despite their notable clinical potential, their use as a standalone treatment does not currently result in complete tumour regression, mainly due to the varying degree of patient sensitivity and responsiveness. It is therefore important to be able to identify patients whose tumours display genetic characteristics that make them vulnerable to the virus and who are thus most likely to benefit from this novel anticancer therapy.""In this context, we sought to elucidate the features of host cancer cells that enable oncolytic viruses to effectively infect and destroy them, focusing specifically on the factors required for cell attachment and entry"", says Dr Antonio Marchini, leader of LOVIT and corresponding author of the publication.Using a technique known as RNA interference, the research team progressively 'switched off' close to 7,000 genes of cervical carcinoma cells to detect those that negatively or positively modulate the infectious capacity of H-1PV. They thus identified 151 genes and their resulting proteins as activators and 89 as repressors of the ability of H-1PV to infect and destroy cancer cells. The team specifically looked at those genes that coded for proteins localised on the cell surface, in order to characterise their role in determining virus docking and entry. They found that a family of proteins called laminins, and particularly laminin  1, play a crucial role in mediating cell attachment and penetration. Indeed, deactivating the corresponding LAMC1 gene in glioma, cervical, pancreatic, colorectal and lung carcinoma cells resulted in a significant reduction in virus cell binding and uptake, and in increased cancer cell resistance to virus-induced death. A similar effect was observed when switching off the LAMB1 gene encoding the laminin  1 protein.""Essentially, laminins at the surface of the cancer cell are the 'door' that allows the virus to recognise its target, attach itself and penetrate into it, subsequently leading to its destruction. In particular, the virus interacts with a specific portion of the laminin, a sugar called sialic acid, which is essential for this binding and entry process and for infection"", explains Dr Amit Kulkarni, first author of the publication.The team went a step further and sought to assess the clinical implications of their findings for cancer patients. They found that laminins  1 and  1 are differentially expressed across different tumours, being for instance overexpressed in pancreatic carcinoma and glioblastoma (GBM) cells compared to healthy tissues. Moreover, in brain tumours, their expression increases with tumour grade, with late-stage GBM displaying higher laminin levels than lower grade gliomas. Similarly, based on the analysis of 110 biopsies from both primary and recurrent GBM, the researchers reported significantly higher levels of laminins in recurrent GBM compared to primary tumours.""These observations indicate that elevated laminin expression is associated with poor patient prognosis and survival in a variety of tumours, including gliomas and glioblastoma. The encouraging fact, however, is that cancers displaying high laminin levels are more susceptible to being infected and destroyed by the H-1PV virus and that patients with these tumours are therefore more likely to be responsive to this therapy"", adds Dr Marchini.These findings could lead to the classification of cancer patients according to their individual laminin expression levels, thereby acting as a biomarker that predicts their sensitivity and responsiveness to H-1PV-based anticancer therapies. This will in turn allow the design of more efficient clinical trials with reduced costs and approval times and, ultimately, the development of enhanced combinatorial treatments to tangibly improve patient outcomes.The study was published in June 2021 in the renowned journal Nature Communications, with the full title ""Oncolytic H-1 parvovirus binds to sialic acid on laminins for cell attachment and entry"".Reference: Kulkarni A, Ferreira T, Bretscher C, et al.

It also lowered by over 40 percent symptoms of ADHD and significantly corrected deficits in executive brain function, with fewer episodes of procrastination, improvements in keeping things in mind, and strengthened prioritization skills.Publishing in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry online June 29, the study also showed that one-quarter of the overall improvements in sluggish cognitive tempo, such as feelings of boredom, trouble staying alert, and signs of confusion, were due to improvements in symptoms of ADHD.The team interpreted that outcome to mean that decreases in ADHD-related incidents of physical restlessness, behaving impulsively, and/or moments of not paying attention were linked to some but not all of the improvements in sluggish cognitive tempo.""Our study provides further evidence that sluggish cognitive tempo may be distinct from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and that the stimulant lisdexamfetamine treats both conditions in adults, and when they occur together,"" says lead study investigator and psychiatrist Lenard Adler, MD.Adler, who directs the adult ADHD program at NYU Langone Health, says until now stimulants have only been shown to improve sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms in children with ADHD. The NYU Langone-Mount Sinai team's findings, he adds, are the first to show that such treatments also work in adults.A professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NYU Langone, Adler says sluggish cognitive tempo is likely a subset of symptoms commonly seen in some patients with ADHD and other psychiatric disorders. However, it remains unclear if sluggish cognitive tempo is a distinct psychiatric condition on its own and if stimulant medications will improve sluggish cognitive tempo in patients without ADHD.Some specialists have been seeking to qualify sluggish cognitive tempo as distinct, but critics say more research is needed to settle the question.""These findings highlight the importance of assessing symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo and executive brain function in patients when they are initially diagnosed with ADHD,"" says Adler.For the study, funded by the drug manufacturer, Takeda Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Mass., several dozen volunteer participants received daily doses of either lisdexamfetamine or a placebo sugar pill for one month. Researchers then carefully tracked their psychiatric health on a weekly basis through standardized tests for signs and symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo, ADHD, as well as other measures of brain function. Study participants then switched roles: The one-half who had been taking the placebo started taking daily doses of lisdexamfetamine, while the other half who had been on the drug during the study's first phase started taking the placebo.Adler has received grant and/or research support from Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Enymotec, Shire Pharmaceuticals (now part of Takeda), Otsuka, and Lundbeck.

The study found that warmer nights alter the rice plant s biological schedule, with hundreds of genes being expressed earlier than usual, while hundreds of other genes are being expressed later than usual. Essentially, we found that warmer nights throw the rice plant s internal clock out of whack,  says Colleen Doherty, an associate professor of biochemistry at North Carolina State University and corresponding author of a paper on the work.  Most people think plants aren t dynamic, but they are. Plants are constantly regulating their biological processes   gearing up for photosynthesis just before dawn, winding that down in the late afternoon, determining precisely how and where to burn their energy resources. Plants are busy, it s just difficult to observe all that activity from the outside.  And what researchers have learned is that the clock responsible for regulating all of that activity gets messed up when the nights get hotter relative to the days.  We already knew that climate change is leading to increased temperatures globally, and that nighttime temperatures are rising faster than daytime temperatures,  Doherty says.  We also knew that warmer nights hurt rice production. But until now, we had very little insight into why warmer nights are bad for rice.  We still don t know all the details, but we re narrowing down where to look.  Research that addresses rice yield losses is important because rice is an essential crop for feeding hundreds of millions of people each year   and because a changing climate poses challenges for global food security. To better understand how warm nights affects rice, Doherty worked with an international team of researchers   including Krishna Jagadish of Kansas State University and Lovely Lawas of the International Rice Research Institute   to study the problem in the field. The researchers established two study sites in the Philippines. Temperatures were manipulated in different areas of each study site using either ceramic heaters or heat tents. A research team led by Jagadish used the ceramic heaters to maintain experimental plots at 2 degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature, and took samples from the rice plants every three hours for 24 hours. Control plots were not heated, but were also sampled every three hours during the same 24-hour period. These tests were repeated four times. The heat tents were later used to validate the results from the ceramic heater tests. Meanwhile, a team led by Doherty found that more than a thousand genes were being expressed at the  wrong  time when nighttime temperatures were higher. Specifically, hotter nights resulted in hundreds of genes   including many associated with photosynthesis   becoming active later in the day. Meanwhile, hundreds of other genes were becoming active much earlier in the evening than normal, disrupting the finely tuned timing necessary for optimal yield.  It s not clear what all of these genes do, but it is clear that these conflicting schedule shifts are not good for the plant,  Doherty says. The researchers found that many of the affected genes are regulated by 24 other genes, called transcription factors. Of those 24, four of the transcription factors were deemed most promising for future study.  We need to do additional work to figure out exactly what s happening here, so that we can begin breeding rice that s resilient against warmer nights,  Doherty says.  Rice is an important food crop. And other staple crops are also affected by hotter nights   including wheat. This isn t just an interesting scientific question, it s a global food security issue.

The treatment candidate has been declared safe by Japan's governing board, and the researchers plan to begin clinical trials in humans in the next year.""There are currently no disease-modifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, Huntington disease and frontotemporal dementia in the world,"" said paper author Kohji Fukunaga, professor emeritus in Tohoku University's Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. ""We discovered the novel, disease-modifying therapeutic candidate SAK3, which, in our studies, rescued neurons in most protein-misfolding, neurodegenerative diseases.""In a previous study, the team found that the SAK3 molecule - the base structure of which is found in the enhancement of T-type Ca2+ channel activity - appeared to help improve memory and learning in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.According to previous studies, SAK3 enhances the function of a cell membrane channel thereby promoting neuronal activity in the brain. Typically, SAK3 promotes neurotransmitter releases of acetylcholine and dopamine that are significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. The Ca2+ channel enhancement is thought to trigger a change from resting to active in neuronal activity. When the Ca2+ channel is dysregulated in the brain, the acetylcholine and dopamine releases are reduced. The result is a dysregulated system that a person experiences as cognitive confusion and uncoordinated motor function.SAK3 directly binds to the subunit of this channel, resulting in the enhancement of neurotransmission thereby improving cognitive deficits. The researchers found that the same process also appeared to work in a mouse model of Lewy body dementia, which is characterized by a build-up of proteins known as Lewy bodies.""Even after the onset of cognitive impairment, SAK3 administration significantly prevented the progression of neurodegenerative behaviors in both motor dysfunction and cognition,"" Fukunaga said.In comparison, Aduhelm, the Alzheimer's drug recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, reduces the number of amyloid plaques in the brain, but it is not yet known if the amyloid reduction actually prevents further cognitive or motor decline in patients. According to Fukunaga, SAK3 helps destroy amyloid plaque - at least in mice.SAK3 also helps manage the destruction of misfolded alpha-synuclein. Normal alpha-synuclein helps regulate neurotransmitter transmission in the brain. The protein can misfold and aggregate, contributing to what researchers suspect may be an underlying cause of neurodegenerative symptoms. This aggregation can also lead to the loss of dopamine neurons, which help with learning and memory.""We found that chronic administration of SAK3 significantly inhibited the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the mice,"" Fukunaga said, noting that the mice received a daily oral dose of SAK3.According to Fukunaga, SAK3 enhances the activity of the system that identifies and destroys misfolded proteins. In neurodegenerative diseases, this system is often dysfunctional, leaving misfolded proteins to muck up the cell's machinery.""SAK3 is the first compound targeting this regulatory activity in neurodegenerative disorders,"" Fukunaga said. ""SAK3 administration promotes the destruction of misfolded proteins, meaning the therapeutic has the potential to solve the problems of diverse protein misfolding diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington disease, in addition to Alzheimer's disease.""Reference: Xu J, Kawahata I, Izumi H, Fukunaga K.

These results may help to explain why some affected people continue to complain of symptoms long after an infection (long Covid).Shortness of breath, fatigue and headaches: some patients still struggle with the long-term effects of a severe infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus after six months or more. This post Covid-19 syndrome, also called long covid, is still not properly understood. What is clear is that -- during the course of the disease -- often blood circulation is impaired, dangerous vascular occlusions can occur and oxygen transport in is limited. These are all phenomena in which the blood cells and their physical properties play a key role.To investigate this aspect, a team of scientists led by Mark ta Kub nkov , Jochen Guck, and Martin Kr ter from the Max-Planck-Zentrum f r Physik und Medizin, the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light (MPL), the Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg and the German Centre for Immunotherapy measured the mechanical states of red and white blood cells. ""We were able to detect clear and long-lasting changes in the cells -- both during an acute infection and even afterwards,"" reports Professor Guck, currently managing director of MPL. The research group has now published their results in the renowned Biophysical Journal.To analyse the blood cells, they used a self-developed method called real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC), which has recently been recognized with the prestigious Medical Valley Award. In this method, the researchers send the blood cells through a narrow channel at high speed. In the process, the leukocytes and erythrocytes are stretched. A high-speed camera records each of them through a microscope, and custom software determines which cell types are present, and how big and deformed they are. Up to 1000 blood cells can be analysed per second. The advantage of the method: It is fast and the cells do not have to be labelled in a laborious procedure.The method could help as an early warning system to detect future pandemics by unknown virusesThe biophysicists from Erlangen examined more than four million blood cells from 17 patients acutely ill with Covid-19, from 14 people who had recovered and 24 healthy people as a comparison group. They found that, for example, the size and deformability of the red blood cells of patients with the disease deviated strongly from those of healthy people. This indicates damage to these cells and could explain the increased risk of vascular occlusion and embolisms in the lungs. In addition, the oxygen supply, which is one of the main tasks of the erythrocytes, may be impaired in infected persons. Lymphocytes (one type of white blood cell responsible for the acquired immune defense) were in turn significantly softer in Covid-19 patients, which typically indicates a strong immune reaction. The researchers made similar observations for neutrophil granulocytes, another group of white blood cells involved in the innate immune response. These cells even remained drastically altered seven months after the acute infection. ""We suspect that the cytoskeleton of immune cells, which is largely responsible for cell function, has changed,"" explains Mark ta Kub nkov , first author of the research article. In her view, real-time deformability cytometry has the potential to be used routinely in the diagnosis of Covid-19 -- and even to serve as an early warning system against future pandemics caused by as yet unknown viruses.Reference: Kub nkov  M, Hohberger B, Hoffmanns J, et al.

Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have shown in preclinical studies conducted in mice and human cells that this type of cell-based immunotherapy also could be effective against solid tumors, starting with melanoma, a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not caught early.The study is published June 29 in Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.In recent years, an immunotherapy called immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized treatment for advanced melanoma. In one well-known example, this immunotherapy was successfully used to treat former President Jimmy Carter, whose melanoma had spread to his liver and brain.But the therapy only works in about half of such patients. And even among those who respond well to the initial therapy, about half go on to develop resistance to it. Consequently, researchers have been seeking different ways to harness the immune system to attack melanoma cells. One possibility is to use natural killer (NK) cells, a part of the immune system's first line of defense against dangerous cells, whether cancer cells or invading bacteria.Todd A. Fehniger, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine, and his team have had success in clinical trials treating recurrent leukemia with a patient's own natural killer cells or those from a donor. The NK cells are harvested from the patient's or a donor's blood and exposed to a set of chemical signals called cytokines that activate the cells and prime them to remember this activation. When these ""cytokine-induced memory-like"" NK cells are given to the patient, they are more potent in attacking the cancer because they already have been revved up, as Fehniger puts it.""These 'revved-up' memory-like NK cells attack blood cancers quite well,"" said Fehniger, the study's co-senior author and an oncologist who treats patients at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. ""But relatively little work has been done on whether these cells can be used against solid tumors. This is an unmet need in solid tumor oncology. Our study provides proof of principle that memory-like NK cells respond better than normal NK cells against melanoma, and it serves as a stepping stone to a first-in-human clinical trial of these cells in advanced melanoma.""Added co-senior author Ryan C. Fields, MD, the Kim and Tim Eberlein Distinguished Professor of Surgical Oncology: ""We hope this is also a step toward harnessing NK cells against multiple solid tumors. Melanoma was a good place to start because we know it responds to immune therapy. But because many patients don't respond or develop resistance, we felt that targeting a different aspect of the immune system was a promising strategy to pursue.""The standard checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy that works well in some melanoma patients targets T cells, another type of immune cell that also frequently is harnessed against different forms of cancer. According to the researchers, patients who don't respond well or stop responding to the T cell-based standard therapy and have no other options would be good candidates for NK cell therapy.The researchers studied human NK cells from both healthy people and from patients with melanoma and found that the cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells could effectively treat mice harboring human melanoma tumors. Tumors shrank to the point of being almost undetectable in many of the mice, and the memory-like NK cells prevented the tumors from returning in most cases for the duration of the 21-day experiment. While normal NK cells also reduced and controlled melanoma tumors, they did not do so to the same degree.""We are currently designing a clinical trial to evaluate these NK cells in patients with advanced melanoma who have exhausted all other treatment options,"" Fehniger said. ""We would like to investigate NK cells from a donor and, separately, a patient's own NK cells to see if the cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells offer an effective treatment option for patients with this aggressive skin cancer.""The NK cell-based immunotherapy is potentially safer than other cell-based immunotherapies because the NK cells do not trigger a cytokine storm, as is seen sometimes in CAR-T cell therapy, which often is used for blood cancers, nor do the NK cells cause graft-versus-host disease, which sometimes follows a stem cell transplant.""Even 10 years ago, we had no effective therapies for advanced melanoma -- much like the lack of therapies for glioblastoma or advanced pancreatic cancer today,"" said Fields, a surgeon who treats patients at Siteman. ""Checkpoint immunotherapy has revolutionized melanoma treatment, but we're still not satisfied with the 50% response rate. We want to do better, and this NK cell therapy is a promising approach. And in the future, we may be able to combine an NK cell-based therapy with checkpoint inhibition for an even better response.""Fehniger and his colleagues have worked with Washington University's Office of Technology Management to license the cytokine-induced memory-like NK cell technology to a company called Wugen. Fehniger is a co-founder of Wugen and serves on its scientific advisory board.Reference: Marin ND, Krasnick BA, Becker-Hapak M, et al.

The current gold standard for colon cancer testing measures blood (hemoglobin) present in stool, and tests for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) measure levels of calprotectin, a protein that detects inflammation in the intestines.""The unique aspect of both research reports is that we are looking at stool samples comprehensively, and not just at one or two favorite molecules,"" said Chandra Mohan, Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Endowed Professor of biomedical engineering in the UH Cullen College of Engineering. ""We are casting a wide net, and this has never been done before.""With colon cancer, typical fecal blood tests look for hemoglobin in stool samples. In Mohan's work, hemoglobin is just one of more than a thousand proteins being hunted.""By the time you see blood, it might be too late, and there are other proteins that appear in the stool if someone has colon cancer, and they may appear much earlier than when the blood appears,"" reports Mohan in Nature Communications.Using aptamer-based screening, Mohan and team screened 1,317 proteins searching for precursor biomarkers of colon cancer and found five elevated. Stool MMP9, fibrinogen, myeloperoxidase, and haptoglobin emerged as promising stool biomarkers of colorectal cancer, outperforming stool hemoglobin.Aptamers are pieces of DNA that can be selected to bind to other molecules. They serve as bait, carefully selected for each protein they will try to detect. If the protein is present in the stool, it will bind to the aptamer in the library. If the protein is not present, it will be washed away.""Longitudinal studies are warranted to assess the clinical utility of these novel biomarkers in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer,"" said Mohan.Mohan's research team includes Robert S. Bresalier, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Nicholas Chia, Mayo Clinic; Hao Li and Kamala Vanarsa, University of Houston.Predicting the Future with Markers for IBDIn the Journal of Gastroenterology, Mohan is reporting similar findings in early diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, finding several proteins elevated in pediatric patients with the disease after screening for 1300 proteins. Those proteins are stool Ferritin, Fibrinogen, Haptoglobin, Hemoglobin, Lipocalin-2, MMP-12, MMP-9, Myeloperoxidase, PGRP-S, Properdin, Resistin, Serpin A4, and TIMP-1, all significantly elevated in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.The team took samples from patients at four different time periods, allowing the researchers a rare window into disease progression.""Using the new biomarkers, we can predict if the disease will become worse or if the intestines will become more inflamed. Stool proteins assayed at baseline can predict how the disease might progress in the weeks and months ahead,"" reports Mohan.The IBD study represents the first use of the aptamer-based screen of stool samples in IBD, representing the largest-ever targeted stool proteomic study in IBD.""We demonstrate the utility of comprehensive aptamer-based proteomic screens in identifying novel disease biomarkers for IBD that outperform the current gold standard, fecal calprotectin,"" said Mohan.Mohan's hope is to replace the invasive endoscopy test by finding stool markers that can predict what is happening in the intestine without having to do endoscopy. Stool test for proteins can be done at home and through the mail.On this paper, Mohan was joined by Subra Kugathasan from Emory University whose lab supplied the stool samples; Suresh Venkateswaran, Emory University; Sanam Soomro and Kamala Vanarsa, University of Houston.Reference: Soomro S, Venkateswaran S, Vanarsa K, et al.

This gram-negative, rod-shaped microorganism causes septicemic, pneumonic and bubonic plagues. It  was the pathogen behind the Black Death, a medieval pandemic that killed at least 75 million people. But New archeological findings suggests that humans started battling Y. pestis many centuries before the Black Death.The Ri ukalns site, a Stone Age shell midden on the banks of the Salaca River near the outflow from Lake Burtniek. Credit: Harald L bke, ZBSA, Schloss GottorfIn the current study, the genetic analysis showed that RV was infected with a strain of Y. pestis that is the earliest sample of the bacteria ever recovered. It is part of a lineage, the research suggests, that likely emerged just a few hundred years after Y. pestis is likely to have first split from its predecessor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which causes Far East scarlet-like fever.While the authors reckon that the bacterium was RV s likely cause of death, they also believe he could have been living with the infection for some time. In contrast, the pathogen behind the Black Death killed 80% of its victims within eight days.The findings, say the authors, have implications not only for our understanding of this deadly bacterium s history, but also for wider studies of how Europe s population changed over the prehistoric period. Other studies have suggested that evidence of prehistoric Y. pestis is linked to sudden mass shrinkages of the population during the Great Decline.But the new study s senior author, Ben Krause-Kyora, head of the aDNA Laboratory at the University of Kiel in Germany, said in a press release that the team s findings suggest that rarer cases emerging independently were a more likely answer. ""Isolated cases of transmission from animals to people could explain the different social environments where these ancient diseased humans are discovered. We see it in societies that are herders in the steppe, hunter-gatherers who are fishing, and in farmer communities   totally different social settings but always spontaneous occurrence of Y. pestis cases,"" says Krause-Kyora.These occurrences seem more indicative of a slow-moving, harder-to-catch infection   RV likely acquired the bacteria after being bitten by an infected animal   than the rapid, deadly respiratory bacteria that Y. pestis would become. As the rapidly evolving mutants of SARS-CoV-2 have shown, pathogens are an ever-evolving threat. Reference:","Published: June 29, 2021"

But what if you could wear cutting-edge biotechnology in your clothing, and it could warn you when you were exposed to something dangerous?A team of researchers from the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has found a way to embed synthetic biology reactions into fabrics, creating wearable biosensors that can be customized to detect pathogens and toxins and alert the wearer.The team has integrated this technology into standard face masks to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a patient's breath. The button-activated mask gives results within 90 minutes at levels of accuracy comparable to standard nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests like polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The achievement is reported in Nature Biotechnology.""We have essentially shrunk an entire diagnostic laboratory down into a small, synthetic biology-based sensor that works with any face mask, and combines the high accuracy of PCR tests with the speed and low cost of antigen tests,"" said co-first author Peter Nguyen, Ph.D., a Research Scientist at the Wyss Institute. ""In addition to face masks, our programmable biosensors can be integrated into other garments to provide on-the-go detection of dangerous substances including viruses, bacteria, toxins, and chemical agents.""Taking cells out of the equationThe SARS-CoV-2 biosensor is the culmination of three years of work on what the team calls their wearable freeze-dried cell-free (wFDCF) technology, which is built upon earlier iterations created in the lab of Wyss Core Faculty member and senior author Jim Collins. The technique involves extracting and freeze-drying the molecular machinery that cells use to read DNA and produce RNA and proteins. These biological elements are shelf-stable for long periods of time and activating them is simple: just add water. Synthetic genetic circuits can be added to create biosensors that can produce a detectable signal in response of the presence of a target molecule.The researchers first applied this technology to diagnostics by integrating it into a tool to address the Zika virus outbreak in 2015. They created biosensors that can detect pathogen-derived RNA molecules and coupled them with a colored or fluorescent indicator protein, then embedded the genetic circuit into paper to create a cheap, accurate, portable diagnostic. Following their success embedding their biosensors into paper, they next set their sights on making them wearable.""Other groups have created wearables that can sense biomolecules, but those techniques have all required putting living cells into the wearable itself, as if the user were wearing a tiny aquarium. If that aquarium ever broke, then the engineered bugs could leak out onto the wearer, and nobody likes that idea,"" said Nguyen. He and his teammates started investigating whether their wFDCF technology could solve this problem, methodically testing it in over 100 different kinds of fabrics.Then, the COVID-19 pandemic struck.Pivoting from wearables to face masks""We wanted to contribute to the global effort to fight the virus, and we came up with the idea of integrating wFDCF into face masks to detect SARS-CoV-2. The entire project was done under quarantine or strict social distancing starting in May 2020. We worked hard, sometimes bringing non-biological equipment home and assembling devices manually. It was definitely different from the usual lab infrastructure we're used to working under, but everything we did has helped us ensure that the sensors would work in real-world pandemic conditions,"" said co-first author Luis Soenksen, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute.The team called upon every resource they had available to them at the Wyss Institute to create their COVID-19-detecting face masks, including toehold switches developed in Core Faculty member Peng Yin's lab and SHERLOCK sensors developed in the Collins lab. The final product consists of three different freeze-dried biological reactions that are sequentially activated by the release of water from a reservoir via the single push of a button.The first reaction cuts open the SARS-CoV-2 virus' membrane to expose its RNA. The second reaction is an amplification step that makes numerous double-stranded copies of the Spike-coding gene from the viral RNA. The final reaction uses CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect any Spike gene fragments, and in response cut a probe molecule into two smaller pieces that are then reported via a lateral flow assay strip. Whether or not there are any Spike fragments available to cut depends on whether the patient has SARS-CoV-2 in their breath. This difference is reflected in changes in a simple pattern of lines that appears on the readout portion of the device, similar to an at-home pregnancy test.The wFDCF face mask is the first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test that achieves high accuracy rates comparable to current gold standard RT-PCR tests while operating fully at room temperature, eliminating the need for heating or cooling instruments and allowing the rapid screening of patient samples outside of labs.""This work shows that our freeze-dried, cell-free synthetic biology technology can be extended to wearables and harnessed for novel diagnostic applications, including the development of a face mask diagnostic. I am particularly proud of how our team came together during the pandemic to create deployable solutions for addressing some of the world's testing challenges,"" said Collins, Ph.D., who is also the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science at MIT.Credit: Wyss Institute at Harvard UniversityBeyond the COVID-19 pandemicThe face mask diagnostic is in some ways the icing on the cake for the team, which had to overcome numerous challenges in order to make their technology truly wearable, including capturing droplets of a liquid substance within a flexible, unobtrusive device and preventing evaporation. The face mask diagnostic omits electronic components in favor of ease of manufacturing and low cost, but integrating more permanent elements into the system opens up a wide range of other possible applications.In their paper, the researchers demonstrate that a network of fiber optic cables can be integrated into their wFCDF technology to detect fluorescent light generated by the biological reactions, indicating detection of the target molecule with a high level of accuracy. This digital signal can be sent to a smartphone app that allows the wearer to monitor their exposure to a vast array of substances.""This technology could be incorporated into lab coats for scientists working with hazardous materials or pathogens, scrubs for doctors and nurses, or the uniforms of first responders and military personnel who could be exposed to dangerous pathogens or toxins, such as nerve gas,"" said co-author Nina Donghia, a Staff Scientist at the Wyss Institute.The team is actively searching for manufacturing partners who are interested in helping to enable the mass production of the face mask diagnostic for use during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for detecting other biological and environmental hazards.""This team's ingenuity and dedication to creating a useful tool to combat a deadly pandemic while working under unprecedented conditions is impressive in and of itself. But even more impressive is that these wearable biosensors can be applied to a wide variety of health threats beyond SARS-CoV-2, and we at the Wyss Institute are eager to collaborate with commercial manufacturers to realize that potential,"" said Don Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., the Wyss Institute's Founding Director.

Its muscles, blood vessels, gut and nervous system are beginning to develop. But this embryo is unusual: It was made in a lab, out of mouse embryonic stem cells, and represents the most sophisticated in vitro (in a dish) model of a mammal ever so created.This new model, developed at the University of Virginia School of Medicine by Christine and Bernard Thisse, is a major step forward in scientists' efforts to mimic the natural development of a mammal by using stem cells. Its existence is a wonder that will help scientists understand mammalian development, battle diseases, create new drugs and, eventually, grow tissues and organs for people in need of transplants.""We found a way to instruct aggregates of stem cells to initiate embryonic development. In response to this controlled instruction, the aggregates develop into embryo-like entities in a process that recapitulate the embryonic steps one-by-one,"" explained Christine Thisse, PhD, of UVA's Department of Cell Biology. ""What is amazing is that we can get the variety of tissues that are present in an authentic mouse embryo.""Bernard Thisse, PhD, who is also part of the Department of Cell Biology, noted the significance of the advance: ""Human organs are made of multiple cell types that originate from different parts of the growing embryo,"" he said. ""The gut, for example, is made from cells that form an hollow tube. Models of this tube in a dish have been made and are called gut organoids. However, this tube is not enough to make a functional gut because this organ contains other components, such as smooth muscles, blood vessels and nerves that control the function of the gut and which are made from cells of a different origins. The only way to have all the variety of cells necessary to the formation of functional organs is to develop systems in which all precursor cells are present. The embryo-like entities we have engineered using stem cells are providing just this.""The Potential of Stem CellsStem cells are special cells that can turn into other cell types with specific functions. For example, stem cells turn into our hearts, our brain, our bones, our nerves. So scientists have been eager to harness the potential of stem cells, to put them to work to advance medical research and benefit human patients. But building sophisticated models with multiple cell types has proved incredibly challenging. It is far easier to direct the formation of a single cell type in a dish than to conduct the orchestra needed to have an organism develop as in nature.The Thisses' new model is notable for its sophistication. It is the first in vitro model of a mammalian embryo with so many tissues to be built from stem cells, the researchers report. Most importantly, those structures are organized as they should be, around the notochord (the precursor of the vertebral column), a defining trait of vertebrate animals. In the Thisses' model, different cells types are woven together elegantly and correctly - a huge achievement.To accomplish this, the Thisses and their collaborators had to overcome some of the greatest challenges in the stem cell field. Prior models failed to develop properly, or weren't organized correctly, or were plagued by other problems. Using their expertise in developmental biology and building on their previous work using cells from fish embryos (published in the journal Science in 2014), the Thisses solved these problems. The result is the beginnings of a mouse in a dish with properly organized cells and tissues. With the Thisses' model, the notochord is present and accounted for; the digestive tract starts to develop; the heart beats; and, for the first time in vitro, a nervous system develops with the formation of a neural tube.""This in vitro mouse model shows that we are able to induce cells to execute complex developmental programs in the right succession of steps. Having all the variety of tissues made allows us to hope that the scientific community will be able to build organs with a proper vascularization, innervation and interactions with other tissues,"" Christine Thisse said. ""This is essential to be able one day to produce functional human replacement organs in a dish. This would overcome the shortage of organ for transplants.""The Thisses' new model isn't a complete mouse yet and can't develop into one. Key parts are still missing, such as the anterior part of the brain. For now, the development of the embryoids stops at a time corresponding to middle period of gestation of a mouse embryo. The researchers' real accomplishment is developing an effective approach to creating sophisticated, embryonic-like structures, mimicking the development of a mouse embryo. This advances their field substantially, and it gives scientists more tailored control over stem cells than they have ever known.""The embryoids we are currently producing lack the anterior brain domains,"" Bernard Thisse said. ""However, with the techniques we have developed, we should be able, at some point, to manipulate molecular signals that control embryo formation, and this should lead generating embryo-like entities containing all tissues and organs including the anterior brain.""""The knowledge we acquired along all our career of developmental biologists served as a starting point for this study in the stem cell field,"" Christine Thisse said. ""This was a big jump for us, but it shows that if you have a solid idea, it can be used to cross barriers and can be developed for other purposes. I say that for students: Nothing is definitive, there is room for knowing more and for solving problems.""""Watching an embryo develop is a marvelous thing to behold,"" she added. ""I am lucky my work led me to contribute to the knowledge of how invertebrate and vertebrate embryos develop, and that using these principles, we were able to produce embryo formation in a dish using stem cells as building bricks.""Reference: Xu P-F, Borges RM, Fillatre J, et al.

Besides clinical assessment, brain imaging and lumbar puncture are the two most commonly used medical procedures to detect changes in the brain caused by AD. However, these methods are expensive, invasive, and frequently unavailable in many countries.Now, a team led by Prof. Nancy IP, Vice-President for Research and Development at HKUST, has identified 19 out of the 429 plasma proteins associated with AD to form a biomarker panel representative of an ""AD signature"" in the blood. Based on this panel, the team has developed a scoring system that distinguishes AD patients from healthy people with more than 96% accuracy. This system can also differentiate among the early, intermediate, and late stages of AD, and can be used to monitor the progression of the disease over time. These exciting findings have led to the development of a high-performance, blood-based test for AD, and may also pave the way to novel therapeutic treatments for the disease.""With the advancement of ultrasensitive blood-based protein detection technology, we have developed a simple, noninvasive, and accurate diagnostic solution for AD, which will greatly facilitate population-scale screening and staging of the disease,"" said Prof. Nancy Ip, Morningside Professor of Life Science and the Director of the State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience at HKUST.The work was conducted in collaboration with researchers at University College London and clinicians in local hospitals including the Prince of Wales Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The discovery was made using the proximity extension assay (PEA) - a cutting-edge ultrasensitive and high-throughput protein measurement technology, to examine the levels of over 1,000 proteins in the plasma of AD patients in Hong Kong.As the most comprehensive study of blood proteins in AD patients to date, the work has recently been published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, and has also been featured and actively discussed on different scholarly exchange platforms on AD research such as Alzforum.AD, which affects over 50 million people worldwide, involves the dysfunction and loss of brain cells. Its symptoms include progressive memory loss as well as impaired movement, reasoning, and judgment. While patients often only seek medical attention and are diagnosed when they have memory problems, AD affects the brain at least 10-20 years before symptoms appear.Reference: Jiang Y, Zhou X, Ip FC, et al.

Memory loss is a common sign of accelerated ageing and often an early sign of the Alzheimer's disease (AD).The discovery was published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).""This finding is exciting because it provides a mechanistic explanation of how gut-brain communication is translated into brain cell renewal, through gut microbe produced molecules stimulating the formation of new nerve cells in the adult brain. These findings bring us closer to the possibility of novel treatment options to slow down memory loss, which is a common problem with ageing and neurodegenerative diseases including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease.

However, a state of heightened anxiety, which is the reality for thousands of people who struggle to cope with these feelings, is called anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder can invoke debilitating fear or apprehension, even without any immediate threat. Though intensive research over the years has yielded a plethora of information, and effective drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used to alleviate this condition, a lot remains to be understood about this complex condition and its treatment.For a group of Japanese researchers from Tokyo University of Science and University of Tsukuba, endeavoring in this line of research is not new. In a previous study, they used a drug called KNT-127, which acts by activating specific receptors in the brain, called ""delta opioid receptors.""The researchers found KNT-127 to reduce anxiety-like behavior in mice. They found that KNT-127 caused the reduction of an excitatory neurotransmitter, called glutamate, in the extracellular regions of a part of the brain that controls several emotional states, called the ""prelimbic subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex"" (PL-PFC). The researchers went on to study this phenomenon in a new study published in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications.According to Professor Akiyoshi Saitoh, from the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, and corresponding author of this study, there is a good reason to have investigated the glutamate levels specifically in PL-PFC. He says, ""The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a vital role in the processing of emotional events. It has been shown that activation of the glutamatergic transmission in PL-PFC evoked anxiety-like behavior in rodents.""Accordingly, Professor Saitoh and his colleagues conducted electrophysiological studies at a single-neuron level in mice. The team measured spontaneous excitatory currents from the glutamate-releasing presynapse region of various important neurons treated with and without KNT-127, in the PL-PFC of mice that had been induced to exhibit anxious behavior.For neurons treated with KNT-127, the results showed that release of glutamate was reduced at the PL-PFC synapses. Since this excitatory neurotransmitter relays information from one neuron to the other, at the synapse region, the corresponding brain activity was also found to be lowered. Interestingly, the team found that KNT-127 treatment made the PL-PFC neurons less excitable. The researchers considered these findings to be a consequence of the anxiolytic effects of KNT-127.Overall, this study proposes a novel pathway and a novel drug candidate that can be targeted for treating anxiety disorder. Commenting on the clinical potential of drugs like KNT-127, Dr. Daisuke Yamada, one of the investigators in the study from Tokyo University of Science, says, ""There is a need for the development of new therapeutic agents that have different mechanisms of action from existing drugs. The results of this study are expected to lead to the development of evidence-based antipsychotics with a new mechanism of action, targeting opioid delta receptors.""Indeed, the world can hope for groundbreaking anxiolytic drugs to enter the market, taking after the results of this promising study!Reference: Yamada D, Takahashi J, Iio K, Nagase H, Saitoh A.

Both vaccines performed well in clinical trials, and both have been widely credited with reducing disease, but concerns remain over how long immunity induced by the new vaccine technology will last.Now, a study from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, published June 28 in the journal Nature, has found evidence that the immune response to such vaccines is both strong and potentially long-lasting. Nearly four months after the first dose, people who received the Pfizer vaccine still had so-called germinal centers in their lymph nodes churning out immune cells directed against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Germinal centers, which form as the result of natural infection or vaccination, are boot camps for immune cells, a place where inexperienced cells are trained to better recognize the enemy and weapons are sharpened. A better germinal center response may equal a better vaccine.Moreover, vaccination led to high levels of neutralizing antibodies effective against three variants of the virus, including the Beta variant from South Africa that has shown some resistance to vaccines. Vaccination induced stronger antibody responses in people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those who had never been infected.In April, both Pfizer and Moderna reported that their vaccines provided at least six months of protection. Their reports were based on tracking whether vaccinated people came down with COVID-19. Other groups have monitored antibody levels in the blood and concluded that the vaccine provides at least months of protection. But nobody had looked to see how the immune response was developing in the body, which could provide important clues to the strength and persistence of the immune response without requiring years of follow-up.""Germinal centers are the key to a persistent, protective immune response,"" said senior author Ali Ellebedy, PhD, an associate professor of pathology & immunology, of medicine and of molecular microbiology. ""Germinal centers are where our immune memories are formed. And the longer we have a germinal center, the stronger and more durable our immunity will be because there's a fierce selection process happening there, and only the best immune cells survive. We found that germinal centers were still going strong 15 weeks after the vaccine's first dose. We're still monitoring the germinal centers, and they're not declining; in some people, they're still ongoing. This is truly remarkable.""Scientists don't fully understand why some vaccines, such as the one for smallpox, induce strong protection that lasts a lifetime, while others, such as the vaccine for whooping cough, require regular boosters. But many suspect that the difference lies in the quality of the germinal centers induced by different vaccines.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were created with mRNA technology. Unlike most vaccines, which provide bits of viral or bacterial proteins to trigger an immune response, mRNA-based vaccines provide instructions for the body to build and release foreign proteins, such as the spike protein in the case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To assess whether this new kind of vaccine induces a good germinal center response, Ellebedy and co-first author Jackson Turner, PhD, an instructor in pathology & immunology, teamed up with co-senior author Rachel Presti, MD, PhD, an associate professor of medicine, and co-first author Jane O'Halloran, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, and started the study once the first COVID-19 vaccine became available in mid-December 2020.The team enlisted the help of co-authors Sharlene Teefey, MD, and William Middleton, MD, both professors of radiology, to perform ultrasound-guided sampling of the minuscule germinal centers in lymph nodes in the armpit. Teefey and Middleton extracted cells from 14 people who received the Pfizer vaccine. Samples were obtained three weeks after the first dose (just prior to administration of the second dose), and at weeks four, five and seven. Ten of the participants gave additional samples 15 weeks after the first dose. None of the participants previously had been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.Three weeks after the first dose, all 14 participants had formed germinal centers with B cells producing antibodies that target a key SARS-CoV-2 protein. The response expanded greatly after the booster shot and then stayed high. Even 15 weeks after the first dose, eight of 10 people still had detectable germinal centers containing B cells targeting the virus.""This is evidence of a really robust immune response,"" Presti said. ""Your immune system uses germinal centers to perfect the antibodies so they can bind well and last as long as possible. The antibodies in the blood are the end result of the process, but the germinal center is where it is happening.""The researchers also obtained blood samples from 41 people who received the Pfizer vaccine, including eight who previously had been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Samples were obtained prior to the administration of each dose of the vaccine, as well as at weeks four, five, seven and 15 after the first dose. In people without prior exposure to the virus, antibody levels rose slowly after the first dose and peaked one week after the second. People who previously had been infected already had antibodies in their blood before the first dose. Their levels shot up quickly after the first dose and peaked higher than the uninfected participants' levels.""We didn't set out to compare the effectiveness of vaccination in people with and without a history of infection, but when we looked at the data we could see an effect,"" O'Halloran said. ""If you've already been infected and then you get vaccinated, you get a boost to your antibody levels. The vaccine clearly adds benefit, even in the context of prior infection, which is why we recommend that people who have had COVID-19 get the vaccine.""Reference: Turner JS, O Halloran JA, Kalaidina E, et al.

However, the operation is far more complicated than this simple list of ingredients might suggest. Prof. Dr. Dario Leister and research group in the Department of Biology I at LMU are analyzing the complex regulation of photosynthesis. Their latest findings shed light on the roles of three proteins, named PGRL1, PGRL2 and PGR5, which participate in the control of one of the two subsystems of the photosynthetic apparatus. PGRL2 itself was first discovered in the course of the new study.Photosynthesis involves several coordinated sequences of reactions. In the first step, a specific portion of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun is absorbed by membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, which are organized into two 'photosystems' called PSI and PSII. The photosystems operate in two basic modes - linear and cyclic. In the former, PSII and PSI act in series. Light energy detaches electrons from water molecules, generating hydrogen ions (protons) and molecular oxygen. The protons are pumped to the opposite side of the membrane, while the electrons are transferred sequentially from one complex to the next, gaining in energy in the process. Ultimately, this energy is stored in the form of ATP, which drives most of the biochemical transactions in cells. Linear electron flow (LEF) through PSI also supplies the 'reducing equivalents' required for the conversion of carbon dioxide into sugars. The second mode of photosynthesis involves only photosystem I. Here, the electrons energized by solar radiation are diverted by other proteins, such that they follow a cyclic route. Notably, this cyclic electron flow (CEF) through PSI generates ATP only. ""Plants need both subsystems,"" Leister points out. The cyclic pathway is particularly significant when plants are under stress, and need more ATP. Indeed, without this mechanism plants could not survive under natural conditions.","Published: June 29, 2021"

This represent one of the first studies to analyze the long-term effects of extraction on taste.""Prior studies have only pointed to adverse effects on taste after extraction and it has been generally believed that those effects dissipate over time,"" said senior author Richard L. Doty, PhD, director of the Smell and Taste Center at the University of Pennsylvania. ""This new study shows us that taste function can actually slightly improve between the time patients have surgery and up to 20 years later. It's a surprising but fascinating finding that deserves further investigation to better understand why it's enhanced and what it may mean clinically.""Doty and co-author Dane Kim, a third-year student in the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine, evaluated data from 1,255 patients who had undergone a chemosensory evaluation at Penn's Smell and Taste Center over the course of 20 years. Among that group, 891 patients had received third molar extractions and 364 had not.The ""whole-mouth identification"" test incorporates five different concentrations of sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, and caffeine. Each solution is sipped, swished in the mouth, and then spit out. Subjects then indicate whether the solution tastes sweet, salty, sour, or bitter.The extraction group outperformed the control group for each of the four tastes, and in all cases, women outperformed men. The study suggests, for the first time, that people who have received extractions in the distant past experience, on average, an enhancement (typically a three to 10 percent improvement) in their ability to taste.""The study strongly suggests that extraction of the third molar has a positive long-term, albeit subtle, effect on the function of the lingual taste pathways of some people,"" Kim said.Two possibilities, the authors said, could explain the enhancement. First, extraction damage to the nerves that innervate the taste buds on the front of the mouth can release inhibition on nerves that supply the taste buds at the rear of the mouth, increasing whole-mouth sensitivity. Second, hypersensitivity after peripheral nerve injury from a surgery like an extraction has been well documented in other contexts. There is evidence, for example, from animal studies that repetitive light touch, which might occur during chewing, gradually accentuates neural responses from irritated tissue that can lead to progressive long-term tactile hypersensitivity. Whether this occurs for taste, however, is not known.""Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism or mechanisms behind the extraction-related improvement in taste function,"" Doty said. ""The effects are subtle but may provide insight into how long-term improvement in neural function can result from altering the environment in which nerves propagate.""Reference: Kim D, Doty RL.

PTFE is known to be the most stable existent polymer. According to the scientists, it is a simple, affordable and easily scalable method, which will allow obtaining chemically stable membranes in industrial-scale production. The membranes can be used in petrochemical, aerospace, nuclear industries, carbon-free energy and medicine.The latest results of the research of physical and chemical properties and biocompatibility of the obtained membranes are published in the Journal of Fluorine Chemistry (IF: 2,332; Q1). The obtained membranes were tested using cells and laboratory animals. The research confirmed that the membranes are not rejected by the cells and are not destroyed in the biological matrix. The interdisciplinary team consisting of physicists and chemicals is currently conducting the research at TPU.""The material and methods of work with it were noteworthy for us. PTFE is a polymer containing fluorine. Fluorine and similar compounds are called fluoropolymers. They are noteworthy for scientists and experts working at industrial enterprises due to their inert. Fluoropolymers can be used in corrosive media or where material stability is crucial. These either can be hydrogen fuel cell operating in the conditions of corrosive media or a medical implant inside a human body. It means that obtaining membranes is very perspective, however, there is no large capacity technology in the world yet. It is either expensive or labour-intensive, even if the raw material is affordable,"" Evgeny Bolbasov, Research Fellow of the TPU Butakov Research Center, says.The TPU scientists used electrospinning. It is drawing charged threads of polymer solutions under the effect of an electric field. The result is a knitted material of polymer threads.""The main advantage of the method is that the small laboratory installation is not different from an industrial one by its core and processes. Everything that can be done in the laboratory is easily reproducible at the enterprise. Previously, it was believed that obtaining a PTFE membrane using electrospinning is simply impossible. PTFE is not pulled into threads. To solve this problem, we added polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a crosslinking agent in the synthesis chain,"" the scientist says.The process of obtaining the membrane described in the article carries two stages. First, very fine powder is mixed with PVA. A solution loading in the electrospinning installation is obtained. The thinnest threads are pulled inside of the electrospinning installation and the white porous bed is spun from these pulled threads. It is the membrane. At stage two, the membrane is fired in an oven at about 400 ?. The added PVA completely evaporates in the oven and the membrane is getting dark a bit. The entire process takes no longer than three hours.The researchers note that all raw materials used for the synthesis are commercially affordable and are produced in Russia.These membranes possess a wide range of potential application. Only a scalable technology is required. Industrial methods of obtaining membranes from fluoropolymers are searched in Europe, the USA, China. Meanwhile, the Russian scientists possess an opportunity to offer a commercially interesting solution. From our point of view, electrospinning is such a solution.This method is dozen folds cheaper than its alternatives, it allows easily controlling the pore structure of the membranes. Moreover, this method is reproducible and scalable, which is very interesting for potential industrial partners,"" Vyacheslav Buznik, an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, one of the article authors, says.""Currently, the main task of the TPU researchers is to show the method opportunities for solving specific applied problems.

""What the data suggest is that some three-year-olds have a leg up or seem particularly well positioned to learn a lot about the world.""The findings appear today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Until this study, little was known about curiosity in the pre-verbal mind, as curiosity has mainly been studied in much older children and adults.The key question behind this work was sparked by Feigenson's own curiosity, and that of lead author Johns Hopkins graduate student Jasmin Perez, about a constant frustration with the classic experimental method for studying infant cognition. In those experiments, babies are shown regular objects and objects behaving in surprising, unexpected ways. Many but not all babies tend to look longer at the unexpected events. Some will stare and stare at a car that seems to float in midair or a ball that seems to pass through a solid wall. Other babies will take a glimpse, yawn and they're done.Researchers assumed the variability was due to babies being babies - maybe they were fussy or hungry or distracted. But Feigenson and Perez suspected something important was happening.""We started to wonder if maybe all of that individual variability is actually meaningful, and tells us that babies are responding to the world differently, from baby to baby,"" Perez said.To find out, they launched an experiment where they studied 65 babies over time. At 11 months old, some babies were shown a toy that behaved normally, while others saw the toy seemingly pass straight through a wall. Six months later, the babies, now a year and a half old, now saw either a new toy that behaved normally, or seemed to float in mid-air.""We found babies who looked really long at magical objects at 11 months were the same babies that looked really long at magical objects at 17 months,"" Perez said. ""Babies are affected by these magical events in different ways, and these ways appear to be stable across a six-month period during infancy.""There was also little change in the least interested babies over the six-month period.But was this difference among babies predictive of future thinking? To determine that, the team originally wanted to bring the participants back to the lab after they turned three, but because of the pandemic, they instead sent their parents standardized curiosity questionnaires.They found that the babies who looked longest at events that defied their expectations were the ones whose parents rated them as most curious in an information-seeking, problem-solving way - the type of curiosity most likely to help children learn about the world.Feigenson's lab previously found that these magical, expectation-defying events are learning opportunities for babies. The new findings, which show some kids are better at noticing these surprising events in the first place, raise the possibility that some kids are better positioned to learn, at least in this way that uses expectation violations as leverage to think more deeply about the world.The team plans to follow-up with the cohort to see just how long lasting and broad the individual differences among the children become.""One reason these results are exciting is they open the door to so many other important questions,"" Feigenson said. ""What does it mean for the children in the future? Are these kids also rated as most curious in middle school? Are those kids going to score highest on school achievement tests or IQ tests? These results are screaming out for longitudinal follow-up.""Reference: Perez J, Feigenson L. Stable individual differences in infants  responses to violations of intuitive physics.

However, the identity of many OCD genes remains unknown. Many neurological diseases are influenced by strongly acting mutations which can cause disease by themselves,  says David Goldstein, PhD, director of the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Columbia and a senior author on the new paper.  These mutations are individually very rare but important to find because they can provide a starting point for the development of therapeutics that target precise underlying causes of disease. Although strongly acting mutations have been hypothesized to exist in OCD, statistically reliable evidence has been difficult to obtain.Most previous studies on the genetics of OCD have used a  candidate gene  approach, in which researchers focus on plausible genes that might be involved in pathogenesis and look for genetic signatures of risk. Although that approach has had some successes, it can lead to challenges in statistical interpretation and can miss unexpected genes. As a result, both funding agencies and the pharmaceutical industry increasingly focus on genome-wide analyses that can securely implicate genes in disease risk.  The solution to the problem is to study all the genes in the genome at the same time and ask whether any of them have significant evidence of influencing risk. That had not been done yet at scale in OCD,  says Goldstein.In collaboration with Gerald Nestadt, MBBCh, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University with access to a cohort of OCD patients, Goldstein s team took this genome wide approach, which uses high-throughput sequencing and computational biology techniques to identify relevant genes anywhere in the genome.The investigators looked at genes that encode protein using whole exome sequencing in more than 1,300 OCD patients and compared them to similarly large control groups. The multi-institution collaboration also included scientists from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles, Harvard Medical School, and SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.Goldstein expects that the new data on SLITRK5 will encourage pharmaceutical companies and translational researchers to develop drugs that target this gene.The study also identified a specific pattern of variation in other genes.  When you look at genes that do not tolerate variation in the human population, those are the genes most likely to cause disease, and with OCD, we see an overall increased burden of damaging mutations in those genes compared to controls,  Goldstein says.  That s telling us that there are more OCD genes to be found and where to find them. For patients suffering from OCD and their doctors, new treatments can t come too soon. OCD causes uncontrollable, recurring thought patterns and behaviors that interfere with patients  daily lives. OCD is a disabling disorder that is twice as common as schizophrenia,  says H. Blair Simpson, MD, PhD, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and director of the Center for OCD & Related Disorders at New York State Psychiatric Institute, who was not involved with the new study.Two available treatments, serotonin reuptake inhibiting drugs and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are highly effective, Simpson adds, but only work on about half of patients.  Thus, these genetic findings are very exciting; they indicate that the promise of precision medicine could include OCD, ultimately transforming how we diagnose and treat this disorder.

Among the key players in the ECM are fibroblasts, the cells that make tough structural matrix proteins like collagen.Published online June 28 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the new analysis found that lumican, a protein-sugar combination (proteoglycan) secreted by fibroblasts, and known to partner with collagen in connective tissues, also promotes immune system responses in immune cells called macrophages that fight bacterial infections. At the same time, the study found that lumican protects tissues by restraining a different type of immune response that reacts to DNA, whether from an invading virus, or from human cells that spill their DNA as they die (a signal that tissues are under stress).Such inflammatory responses represent as a transition into healing, but grow too big in sepsis, damaging the body's own tissues to the point of organ failure. Sepsis affects 48.9 million people worldwide, the authors say, but the role of the ECM in the condition is largely unknown.""Lumican may have a dual protective role in ECM tissues, promoting defense against bacteria on the one hand, and on the other, limiting immune overreactions to DNA that cause self-attack, or autoimmunity,"" says corresponding study author Shukti Chakravarti, PhD, professor in the departments of Ophthalmology and Pathology at NYU Langone Health.The findings suggest that connective tissue, and extracellular matrix proteins like lumican, operate outside of cells normally, but as disease or damage break down ECM, get sucked into and regulate immune cells homing in on the damage.

Between 1986 and 2019 the area covered by glaciers on top of Kilimanjaro in Africa decreased by nearly 75%. The study is the first to combine NASA satellite imagery with data from ice cores drilled during field expeditions on tropical glaciers around the world. That combination shows that climate change is causing these glaciers, which have long been sources of water for nearby communities, to disappear and indicates that those glaciers have lost ice more quickly in recent years. The two datasets allowed the researchers to quantify exactly how much ice has been lost from glaciers in the tropics. Those glaciers are  the canaries in the coal mines,  said Lonnie Thompson, lead author of the study, distinguished university professor of Earth Sciences at The Ohio State University and senior research scientist at Ohio State s Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center.  These are in the most remote parts of our planet--they re not next to big cities, so you don t have a local pollution effect,  Thompson said.  These glaciers are sentinels, they re early warning systems for the planet, and they all are saying the same thing.  The study compared changes in the area covered by glaciers in four regions: Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the Andes in Peru and Bolivia, the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas of Central and South Asia, and ice fields in Papua, New Guinea, Indonesia. Thompson has led expeditions to all these glaciers and recovered ice cores from each. The cores are long columns of ice that act as timelines of sorts for the regions  climates over centuries to millennia. As snow falls on a glacier each year, it is buried and compressed to form ice layers that trap and preserve the chemistry of snow and whatever is in the atmosphere, including pollutants and biological material such as plants and pollen. Researchers can study those layers and determine what was in the air at the time the ice formed. One image taken in 2019 of the top of Huascar n, the highest tropical mountain in the world, shows ice retreating upslope and exposing the rock beneath. Analyses performed by researchers at the University of Colorado showed that the area of the glacier ice on top of that mountain decreased by nearly 19% from 1970 to 2003. In 2020, the surface area of the Quelccaya Ice Cap, the second-largest glaciated area in the tropics, had decreased by 46% from 1976, the year Thompson drilled the first ice core from its summit. Around the time of Thompson s first expedition, NASA launched the first version of its Landsat mission. Landsat is a collection of satellites that photograph Earth s surface and has been in operation in various forms since 1972. It offers the longest continuous space-based record of Earth s land, ice and water.  We are in this unique position where we have ice core records from these mountaintops, and Landsat has these detailed images of the glaciers, and if we combine those two data sets, we see clearly what is happening,  Thompson said. Glaciers in the tropics respond more quickly to climate change and as they exist in the warmest areas of the world, they can survive only at very high altitudes where the climate is colder. Before Earth s atmosphere warmed, the precipitation there fell as snow. Now, much of it falls as rain that causes the existing ice to melt even faster.  You re not sustaining the ice at the highest elevations anymore,  said co-author Christopher Shuman, associate research professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County and associate research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.  It s this interplay between the warm air lower down melting away the margins of the ice fields while the very highest elevations are still cold enough to get a certain amount of snowfall, but not enough to sustain the ice cap to the dimensions it once was.  That could have profound repercussions for people who live near those glaciers. The study details the story of one community near the Quelccaya Ice Cap, and the aftermath of a flood caused by massive amounts of ice that fell from the glacier into a nearby glacial lake. The flood destroyed fields that one farming family had spent years cultivating and so frightened the family that they moved four hours away from the community to start a new life in the city. In Papua New Guinea, the ice has cultural significance for many of the indigenous people who live near the ice fields, as they consider the ice to be the head of their god. Thompson believes the ice fields there will disappear entirely within two or three years. It is too late for those glaciers, Thompson said, but not too late to attempt to slow the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, which are causing the planet to warm.  The science doesn t change the trajectory we re on -- regardless of how clear the science is, we need something to happen to change that trajectory,  he said.ReferenceThompson LG, Davis ME, Mosley-Thompson E, et al.

The researchers focused on type II alveolar (AT2) cells, which are non-immune cells of the lung that are critical for basic lung health and tissue repair after lung injury. They found that AT2 cells express high levels of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), an important immune system trigger, and that AT2 MHC-II expression appears to confer an appreciable advantage in the outcome of respiratory viral infection. The findings were published today in Nature Communications. This study shows that MHC-II expression is regulated in a unique way in AT2 cells, which has important implications for the health of lungs when faced with infection,  said senior author Laurence Eisenlohr, VMD, PhD, investigator and Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at CHOP.  Future research should explore whether alterations in AT2 MHC-II expression or function contribute to the wide variation in outcome of lung diseases in humans, particularly SARS-CoV-2 infection, as AT2s are a major cell type infected with this virus in the human lung.  MHC-II triggers an immune cascade that activates helper T cells, which in turn drive B cells, cytotoxic T cells and other important immune cells required to fight an infection. The sequence begins when a peptide from the infectious pathogen connects with MHC-II protein, and that complex is presented on the surface of the cell, a process known as  antigen presentation.  Historically, only certain types of specialized immune cells, termed  professional antigen presenting cells,  have been shown to express MHC-II at steady state, including B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages; other cells outside of the immune system are thought to express MHC-II only when inflammation is present, such as during an infection. However,  recent research has shown that some of these other  non-immune  cell types, including AT2s, can also express MHC-II under normal conditions as well, and this is thought to be driven by small amounts of inflammation that are still present even at homeostasis. AT2 cells are epithelial cells in the lung parenchyma that produce surfactant and promote cell renewal. Previous studies of AT2 MHC-II expression and function have varied widely, and as a result, researchers have not fully understood how well AT2 cells express MHC-II, what triggers AT2 MHC-II expression, and how AT2 MHC-II functions in lung immunity both at baseline and during lung infection. To better understand the role of AT2 MHC-II, the researchers analyzed mouse and human AT2 cells and found that despite being non-immune cells, AT2s express MHC-II uniformly and to high levels under normal conditions, at levels similar to the  professional antigen presenting cells.  They also found that in AT2 cells, MHC-II expression is activated independently of the inflammation cascade that is thought to set the complex into action in essentially all other non-immune cells, suggesting it is triggered in AT2s by unique mechanisms. Given the role of MHC-II in initiating an immune response, the researchers examined the role of AT2 MHC-II in protecting the lungs from respiratory disease. To test this, the researchers generated mice with an AT2-specific deletion of MHC-II. Under normal conditions, the health of the mice did not seem to be affected by the deletion of MHC-II; they did not develop spontaneous respiratory disease and the lung tissue was comparably healthy to mice with functional AT2 MHC-II, leading researchers to conclude that MHC-II does not seem to be required for effective surfactant production or lung regeneration, or lung immunity at homeostasis. However, when the mice were exposed to influenza A virus and Sendai virus, the mice with MHC-II deletions had higher morbidity and mortality than those with intact MHC-II, implying that it does contribute to improved outcomes during lung infection. Although loss of AT2 MHC-II worsened respiratory virus disease, the effect was smaller than the researchers had anticipated based on the abundance of AT2 cells in the lung and the magnitude of AT2 MHC-II expression. Surmising this might be a result of a limitation in the actual function of MHC-II on AT2 cells, the researchers examined the ability of AT2 cells to present infectious and non-infectious antigens via MHC-II to stimulate other immune cells. They found that AT2 cells are capable of presenting antigen via MHC-II and that this is enhanced in the setting of inflammation, but compared to the specialized  professional antigen presenting cells,  AT2 cells exhibit very limited antigen presentation capacity.  Although future studies will need to explore the reasons why this combination of high MHC-II expression but limited antigen presentation occurs in AT2 cells, we propose that this is actually part of a carefully balanced system in the lung, where excessive T cell activation would be especially damaging,  Eisenlohr said.  We propose that high MHC-II expression by AT2s allows them to participate in immune responses, but restrained MHC-II antigen presentation establishes a higher threshold that must be overcome in order to for them to activate the immune system, allowing for AT2s to contribute in a more tempered manner. This way, MHC-II presentation by AT2s would only trigger T cell activation in the setting of high antigen burden, such as a severe lung infection, but would prevent AT2-induced amplification of T cells in response to low levels of inhaled innocuous environmental antigens.

Their origins lie in tectonic plate boundaries where one plate subsides below another. Though the causal mechanism is already known, there has been a lack of data to accurately model the life cycle of slow earthquakes. For the first time, researchers use deep-sea boreholes to gauge pressures far below the seafloor. They hope data from this and future observations can aid the understanding of earthquake evolution.The surface of the Earth lies upon gargantuan tectonic plates. The edges of these interact in different ways depending on the plates  relative movement, composition and density. Where plates collide and one sinks below another is known as a subduction zone, often the site of what are known as slow earthquakes. These are low-frequency earthquakes which release their energy over longer periods   hours to months   than the earthquakes we might feel shaking the ground beneath us, which can last seconds to minutes. It is important to understand slow earthquakes as, although not especially dangerous by themselves, they can cause larger short-period earthquakes, which can be extremely dangerous. Researchers believe that the variation of pressure between water-permeable regions at a subduction zone is the cause of slow earthquakes. They expected that excessive pressures beyond those the types of rock at those boundaries can withstand, might be responsible. At last, hard data on these high-pressure conditions has been collected on a recent Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expedition, which included researchers from the University of Tokyo s Earthquake Research Institute.  We believe the subduction fault zone is much weaker than the surrounding rock, and that this can lead to the fault zones slipping, which could trigger earthquakes,  said Professor Masa Kinoshita of the Earthquake Research Institute.  High fluid pressure within the water-permeable rocky faults, called ocean aquifers, is one cause for this weakness. Our expedition to the Nankai Trough, a few hundred kilometers south of Osaka, included boring down to measure temperatures and pressures along the fault line.  Typical, or  hydrostatic,  pressures below the seafloor in this region are around 60 megapascals   that s approximately the pressure you d feel if you lay down flat and someone dropped 200 Empire State Buildings on you. The researchers  borehole samples revealed pressures around 5 megapascals to 10 megapascals greater than this in the vicinity of the fault zone itself. The chosen area was ideal for making these kinds of observations. The team had prior knowledge that there were high-temperature gradients which would likely correlate with the variations in pressure they hoped to discover. The team also included microbiologists who aimed to uncover unseen microbial life in these previously unexplored regions.  Although we acquired some very useful data, and the first of its kind, the pressure readings had to be inferred, and in future we wish to have in situ observation stations in place which can relay pressure and temperature data without the need for a ship,  said Kinoshita.  We now propose another expedition, this time just west of Japan where there are frequent slow earthquakes. I have studied subsea heat flow since my graduate days. It s exciting to see in reality what was only theoretical until very recently. ReferenceHirose T et al.

Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University, and Samantha O'Connor, a biomedical engineering doctoral student in the Plaisier Lab, are leading research into a new stage of the stem cell life cycle that could be the key to unlocking new methods of brain cancer treatment. Their work was recently published in the research journal Molecular Systems Biology.""The cell cycle is such a well-studied thing and yet here we are looking at it again for the umpteenth time and a new phase pops out at us,"" Plaisier says. ""Biology always has new insights to show us, you just have to look.""The spark for this discovery came through a collaboration with Patrick Paddison, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and Dr. Anoop Patel, an assistant professor of neurological surgery at the University of Washington who is also involved in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.Paddison's team called upon Plaisier to help analyze their brain stem cell data characterized through a process called single-cell RNA sequencing.""That data turned out to be pretty amazing,"" Plaisier says. ""It mapped out into this beautiful circular pattern that we identified as all of the different phases of the cell cycle."" O'Connor developed a new cell cycle classifier tool -- called ccAF, or cell cycle ASU/Fred Hutchinson to represent the collaboration between the two institutions -- that takes a closer, ""high-resolution"" look at what's happening within the growth cycles of stem cells and identifies genes that can be used to track progress through the cell cycle.""Our classifier gets deeper into the cell cycle because there could be pieces we're capturing that have important implications for disease,"" O'Connor says.When Plaisier and O'Connor used the ccAF tool to analyze cell data for glioma tumors, they found the tumor cells were often either in the Neural G0 or G1 growth state. And as tumors become more aggressive, fewer and fewer cells remain in the resting Neural G0 state. This means more and more cells are proliferating and growing the tumor.They correlated this data with the prognosis for patients with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor. Those with higher Neural G0 levels in tumor cells had less aggressive tumors.They also found that the quiescent Neural G0 state is independent of a tumor's proliferation rate, or how fast its cells divide and create new cells.""That was an interesting finding from our results, that quiescence itself could be a different biological process,"" Plaisier says. ""It's also a potential point where we could look for new drug treatments. If we could push more cells into that quiescent state, the tumors would become less aggressive.""Current cancer drug treatments focus on killing cancer cells. However, when the cancer cells are killed, they release cell debris into the surrounding area of the tumor, which can cause the remaining cells to become more resistant to the drugs.""So, instead of killing the cells, if we put them to sleep it could potentially be a much better situation,"" Plaisier says.With their ccAF tool, they were also able to find new states at the beginning and end of the cell cycle that exist between the commonly known states. These are among the topics for their next phase of research.""We're starting to think about ways to dig into those and learn more about the biology of the entry and exit from the cell cycle because those are potentially really important points where the cells will either go into the G1 state or G0,"" Plaisier says.Figuring out what triggers a cell to enter the division cycle or remain in a G0 resting state could help understand the processes behind tumor growth.""The primary feature of any cancer is that the cells are proliferating,"" Plaisier says. ""If we could get in there and figure out what the mechanisms are, that might be a place to slow them down.""Plaisier and O'Connor are making the ccAF classifier tool open source and available in a variety of formats for anyone studying single-cell RNA sequencing data to ease into the process of studying cell cycles.Reference: O Connor SA, Feldman HM, Arora S, et al.

The first human trial has shown no obvious side effects and a good immune response. Researchers based at the University of Tokyo and Chiba University have published the peer-reviewed results of the Phase 1 clinical trial of the vaccine, named MucoRice-CTB, in The Lancet Microbe.Vaccine manufacturing has made enormous strides in 2020, spurred on by COVID-19. However, the complexity of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has highlighted the value of inoculations that can be made, transported and stored cheaply and without refrigeration.The MucoRice-CTB vaccine is stable at room temperature from start to finish.""I'm very optimistic for the future of our MucoRice-CTB vaccine, especially because of the dose escalation results. Participants responded to the vaccine at the low, medium and high doses, with the largest immune response at the highest dose,"" said Professor Hiroshi Kiyono, D.D.S., Ph.D., from the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo who leads the MucoRice project. Dr. Kiyono is also a faculty member at Chiba University in Japan and the University of California, San Diego, in the U.S.Thirty volunteers received a placebo and groups of 10 volunteers received a total of four doses spaced every two weeks of either 3 milligrams (mg), 6 mg or 18 mg each of the vaccine. Tests two and four months after receiving the last dose revealed that volunteers who responded to the vaccine had IgA and IgG antibodies - two types of proteins the immune system produces to fight infections - specific to cholera toxin B (CTB). Participants who received a higher dose of vaccine were more likely to have CTB-specific antibodies.An independent review board found no evidence of significant side effects.Growing a new type of vaccine Vibrio cholerae bacteria is spread most often by drinking water contaminated with sewage. Without medical attention, cholera can kill in mere hours due to diarrhea with severe dehydration. Cholera infects 1.3 million to 4 million people and causes 21,000 to 143,000 deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization.There are four modern needle-free cholera vaccines, all of which are given as drops on the tongue, but require cold storage and are made from whole killed or live-attenuated (weakened) cholera cells; https://www.fda.gov/media/98688/download).The new cholera vaccine grows in genetically modified Japanese short-grain rice plants that produce a nontoxic portion of CTB that can be recognized by the immune system. CTB is similar in structure to a toxin made by some types of disease-causing E. coli bacteria, so cholera vaccines often provide cross protection against travelers' diarrhea.Researchers grow the rice plants in a purpose-built, indoor hydroponic farm that meets WHO good manufacturing practice standards for medicines, which ensures that the vaccine remains uncontaminated and that the plants are isolated from the natural environment.The plants produce the CTB subunit in their seeds, the edible grains of rice, and store the antigens in droplets called protein bodies with membranes made of fat.""The rice protein bodies behave like a natural capsule to deliver the antigen to the gut immune system,"" said Dr. Kiyono.Other medicines have been grown in plants, most often in the leaves - including treatments for Ebola, lymphoma and flu - but the drugs have to be extracted and purified before being used. The grain-based aspect of the MucoRice system avoids those extra steps, the need for cold storage, and protects the antigens as they travel through the harsh acid of the stomach.When the plants are mature, the rice is harvested and ground into a fine powder, then sealed in aluminum packets for storage. When people are ready to be vaccinated, the powder is mixed with about 90 milliliters (1/3 U.S. cup) of liquid and then drunk. Researchers have only tested the vaccine using saline (a salt solution equivalent to body fluids), but they expect it would work equally well with plain water. ","Published: June 28, 2021"

Men are also more likely to become depressed if their workplace pays scant attention to their psychological health.Due to the global burden of depression, which affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and shows no sign of abating despite available treatments, more attention is now being paid to poorly functioning work environments which could contribute to the problem.High levels of burnout and workplace bullying are also linked to corporations' failure to support workers' mental health.A second paper co-authored by Professor Dollard and published in the European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology earlier this month, found that low PSC was an important predictor of bullying and emotional exhaustion.""Lack of consultation with employees and unions over workplace health and safety issues, and little support for stress prevention, is linked to low PSC in companies.""We also found that bullying in a work unit can not only negatively affect the victim, but also the perpetrator and team members who witness that behaviour. It is not uncommon for everyone in the same unit to experience burnout as a result.""In this study we investigated bullying in a group context and why it occurs. Sometimes stress is a trigger for bullying and in the worst cases it can set an 'acceptable' level of behaviour for other members of the team. But above all bullying can be predicted from a company's commitment to mental health, so it can be prevented,"" Prof Dollard says.The global costs of workplace bullying and worker burnout are significant, manifested in absenteeism, poor work engagement, stress leave and low productivity.The extent of the problem was recognised in 2019 with the International Labour Organization (ILO) implementing a Global Commission on the Future of Work and calling for ""a human-centred approach, putting people and the work they do at the centre of economic and social policy and business practice"".""The practical implications of this research are far reaching. High levels of worker burnout are extremely costly to organisations and it's clear that top-level organisational change is needed to address the issue,"" Prof Dollard says.Reference: Zadow AJ, Dollard MF, Dormann C, Landsbergis P.

However, ethanol production is limited in large part by its reliance on corn, which isn't grown in large enough quantities to make up a significant portion of U.S. fuel needs.To try to expand biofuels' potential impact, a team of MIT engineers has now found a way to expand the use of a wider range of nonfood feedstocks to produce such fuels. At the moment, feedstocks such as straw and woody plants are difficult to use for biofuel production because they first need to be broken down to fermentable sugars, a process that releases numerous byproducts that are toxic to yeast, the microbes most commonly used to produce biofuels.The MIT researchers developed a way to circumvent that toxicity, making it feasible to use those sources, which are much more plentiful, to produce biofuels. They also showed that this tolerance can be engineered into strains of yeast used to manufacture other chemicals, potentially making it possible to use ""cellulosic"" woody plant material as a source to make biodiesel or bioplastics.""What we really want to do is open cellulose feedstocks to almost any product and take advantage of the sheer abundance that cellulose offers,"" says Felix Lam, an MIT research associate and the lead author of the new study.Gregory Stephanopoulos, the Willard Henry Dow Professor in Chemical Engineering, and Gerald Fink, the Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor at the Whitehead Institute of Biomedical Research and the American Cancer Society Professor of Genetics in MIT's Department of Biology, are the senior authors of the paper, which appears today in Science Advances.

A lack of oxygen triggers molecular repair mechanisms in these mouse astrocytes but not in human astrocytes. In contrast, inflammation activates immune-response genes in human astrocytes but not mouse astrocytes.Although the mouse is a ubiquitous laboratory model used in research for neurological diseases, results from studies in mice are not always applicable to humans. In fact, more than 90% of drug candidates that show preclinical promise for neurological disorders ultimately fail when tested in humans, in part due to a dearth of knowledge about the differences in astrocytes and other brain cells between the two species.Astrocytes are crucial to the development and function of the brain, and they play a substantial role in neurological disorders that, nonetheless, is not fully understood. Injury or infection causes astrocytes to go from a resting to reactive state in which they can aid in repairing the brain but can also increase detrimental inflammation.The scientists studied developing cells purified from mouse and human brain tissue, as well as cells grown in serum-free cultures from astrocytes selected using an antibody-based method developed by the study s corresponding author.This technique was necessary because the conventional method of selecting astrocytes by growing them in serum   a mixture of proteins, hormones, fats and minerals   throws them into a reactive state similar to that caused by infection or injury. With the researchers' strategy, they were able to examine the astrocytes in a healthy state and in controlled conditions of oxidative stress, lack of oxygen and excessive inflammation.The findings have implications for basic and translational research into neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis   conditions whose underlying mechanisms include oxidative stress, lack of oxygen and excessive inflammation.Because mouse astrocytes stand up to oxidative stress better, the authors suggest that laboratory models for neurodegeneration could be engineered to lessen that resistance, rendering them more human-like. In addition, the mouse astrocyte's facility for repair in response to lack of oxygen may suggest a new avenue of stroke research. And neuroscientists can take a more informed approach to preclinical studies by accounting for differences in response to inflammation between mouse and human astrocytes, as well as metabolic differences identified in the study.Reference: Li J, Pan L, Pembroke WG, et al.

Every year, 76,000 new cases of dementia are diagnosed in Canada, a number expected to increase as the population ages.There is no cure or treatment for dementia. However, about a third of dementia may be preventable through lifestyle factors like physical activity, healthy eating, reducing alcohol and tobacco use, and managing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.The researchers based the dementia calculator on survey data from over 75,000 Ontarians.""What sets this dementia risk calculator apart is that you don't need to visit a doctor for any tests,"" said Dr. Stacey Fisher, the lead author of the study who performed the research largely in Ottawa while she was a PhD student supervised by Dr. Doug Manuel and Dr. Peter Tanuseputro at The Ottawa Hospital. ""People already have all the information they need to complete the calculator in the comfort of their home."" Dr. Fisher is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto and Public Health Ontario.Factors in the Dementia Population Risk Tool (DemPoRT) include: The calculator can be used by individuals to assess their dementia risk and help them modify their lifestyle. The researchers also have a goal for policy makers to use this algorithm to do the same thing for the general population.Through this research, the team has developed the first predictive tool designed to predict dementia at a population level. It can predict the number of new cases in the community, identify higher-risk populations, inform dementia prevention strategies, and will be used to support Canada's national dementia strategy. By using regularly collected health data and surveys, population health experts have all the information they need to use the algorithm.""This tool will give people who fill it out clues to what they can do to reduce their personal risk of dementia,"" said Dr. Peter Tanuseputro, senior author of the study, and scientist at The Ottawa Hospital, investigator at the Bruy re Research Institute, adjunct scientist at ICES and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has also made it clear that sociodemographic variables like ethnicity and neighbourhood play a major role in our health. It was important to include those variables in the tool so policy makers can understand how different populations are impacted by dementia, and help ensure that any prevention strategies are equitable.""The dementia calculator will be added to a list of existing calculators on Project Big Life that help Canadians estimate their own life expectancy based on habits and lifestyle choices.The calculator was based on data from the Statistics Canada Canadian Community Health Surveys housed at ICES.

These small flecks of plastic are harmful to marine organisms and ecosystems. Microplastics can be carried hundreds or thousands of miles away from the source by ocean currents, making it difficult to track and remove them. Currently, the main source of information about the location of microplastics comes from fisher boat trawlers that use nets to catch plankton - and, unintentionally, microplastics. The new technique relies on data from NASA's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), a constellation of eight small satellites that measures wind speeds above Earth's oceans and provides information about the strength of hurricanes. CYGNSS also uses radar to measure ocean roughness, which is affected by several factors including wind speed and debris floating in the water. Working backward, the team looked for places where the ocean was smoother than expected given the wind speed, which they thought could indicate the presence of microplastics. Then they compared those areas to observations and model predictions of where microplastics congregate in the ocean. The scientists found that microplastics tended to be present in smoother waters, demonstrating that CYGNSS data can be used as a tool to track ocean microplastic from space.ReferenceEvans MC, Ruf CS.

We can generally recognize an object, even if it is presented for a very brief time. However, if another object appears immediately following the first object, the perception on the first object is impaired such that we do not notice its existence. This perceptual phenomenon, called ""visual backward masking,"" is used in vision science to study how visual perception is processed in the brain. Interestingly, this phenomenon occurs even if the second object does not spatially overlap the first object, such as a contour or four dots surrounding the object.The occurrence of this phenomenon is assumed to be due to a disruption of ""feedback processing."" When we see something, visual information is serially processed from lower to higher visual areas in the brain in a bottom-up manner. However, top-down feedback processing, in which visual signals are sent back from higher to lower areas, also plays a critical role in visual perception. Visual backward masking is thought to occur owing to interference with feedback processing.""We applied backward masking to infants aged 3-8 months to examine the development of feedback processing,"" says Yusuke Nakashima, a postdoctoral fellow at Chuo University in Tokyo and the study's lead author. ""Recent studies in vision science revealed the importance of feedback processing in visual perception, but its development is poorly understood.""To test whether backward masking occurs in infants, the researchers presented images of faces on a computer screen and measured the length of time that infants spent looking at them. As infants tend to look longer at faces, researchers can test whether infants perceive faces by measuring their looking time. The faces were presented in two ways. In one condition, a face was followed by a mask image, in which infants would not see the face if backward masking occurred. In another condition, nothing appeared after the face; thus, infants would be able to see the face.The researchers found that infants aged 7-8 months could not see faces followed by the mask, indicating that backward masking occurred, similar to adults. In contrast, infants aged 3-6 months could perceive faces even when the faces were followed by the mask image, indicating that masking did not occur and that younger infants could see faces that older infants could not.""These results suggest that feedback processing is immature in infants younger than 7 months,"" says Nakashima. ""That is, younger infants do not have feedback processing that backward masking should interfere, and thus, masking is ineffective for them."" The results of the study demonstrated that the mechanisms for visual perception change drastically in the second half of the first year of life, from the bottom-up system to the system incorporating top-down processing.The results also showed that objects that can be perceived in early infancy become imperceptible during development. ""This might seem counterintuitive,"" says Masami Yamaguchi, a professor at Chuo University. ""Instead, important visual abilities would be acquired by the maturation of feedback processing.""For example, feedback processing is essential for robustly perceiving ambiguous visual images, such as occluded objects. ""Younger infants whose feedback processing is immature might perceive the external world ambiguously,"" says Yamaguchi. ""In return for susceptibility to visual masking, we acquire the ability to robustly perceive ambiguous visual scenes.""Reference: Nakashima Y, Kanazawa S, Yamaguchi MK.

Although it is treatable, the rise of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis poses a major threat to global health security, and has been declared by the World Health Organization as a global health emergency. Reduced access to diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to dramatically increase the number of tuberculosis infections. This will set global efforts to tackle the disease back several years.Tuberculosis is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a bacterium that infects human lungs and other organs by using complex molecular machineries. These include protein complexes known as type VII secretion systems, which enable M. tuberculosis to release molecules into its host, which disarm and ultimately kill the infected human cell. Five such secretion systems, labelled ESX-1 to ESX-5, are found among M. tuberculosis and other closely related mycobacteria, many of which are pathogenic. Without them, the bacteria are unable to infect human cells. The Wilmanns group at EMBL Hamburg has been using high-resolution structural biology to study mycobacterial proteins for the last two decades. The molecular understanding of the bacterial machinery used to infect cells resulted in collaborations with industry to develop new drugs against tuberculosis. In their most recent study, they determined the molecular structure of the secretion system ESX-5 to a high level of detail. They saw that the core of ESX-5 is built of 30 protein units, which form a dynamic membrane pore to allow secretion of proteins that enable the bacterium to survive and multiply inside human cells. Knowledge of the ESX-5 structure at high-resolution is essential to target specific sites with small-molecule drugs.  Our new structure of the ESX-5 secretion complex provides deep insight into a major sluice gate that separates the inner of these bacteria from the outer host environment. Opening this gate allow the pathogen to spit out its deadly weapons to infect humans to develop tuberculosis. We can use this structure as a toolbox with literally thousands of potential drug targets. This will open an entirely new field of studies on tuberculosis,  says Matthias Wilmanns, who leads the study. Kate Beckham, who developed an innovative way to isolate ESX-5, adds:  The central pore we saw in ESX-5 could serve as a new drug target. Blocking it could prevent infection with pathogenic mycobacteria.  The study could also help scientists to develop new vaccines for tuberculosis. The widely used Bacillus Calmette Gu rin (BCG) vaccine, which has its 100th anniversary this year, is based on a strain of mycobacterium that has lost its ability to cause disease because of a defect in the ESX-1 system. However, as BCG vaccination offers insufficient protection and is most effective in young infants only, alternative vaccines are urgently needed. Due to its close structural and functional relation with ESX-1, targeting the ESX-5 secretion system might spur the development of new vaccines that could complement or replace those currently used. Determining the molecular structure of ESX-5 was particularly challenging because of its large size and complexity. No single structural biology method can provide the full picture. In this case, the key to success was using integrative structural biology, in which data obtained using different methods   cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry and computational methods   were used jointly to create a coherent model.  Eighteen months ago, solving this structure looked like mission: impossible,  says Matthias Wilmanns.  We managed to put the puzzle pieces together because each team member contributed unique expertise. To solve the complete structure, we collaborated with Jan Kosinski s group at EMBL Hamburg and the Centre for Structural Systems Biology, which provided necessary expertise in integrative structural biology. We also received great help from our colleagues at EMBL Heidelberg, who performed cryo-electron microscopy experiments. ReferenceBeckham KSH, Ritter C, Chojnowski G, et al.

Using that model, the team concluded that unconventional drilling methods like hydraulic fracturing - or hydrofracking - do not necessarily incur more environmental problems than conventional oil and gas drilling.The two common ways to extract oil and gas in the U.S. are through conventional and unconventional methods. Conventional oil and gas are pumped from easily accessed sources using natural pressure. Conversely, unconventional oil and gas are acquired from hard-to-reach sources through a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Hydrofracking extracts natural gas, petroleum and brine from bedrock formations by injecting a mixture of sand, chemicals and water. By drilling into the earth and directing the high-pressure mixture into rock, the gas inside releases and flows out to the head of a well.Tao Wen, assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences (EES) at Syracuse, recently led a study comparing data from different states to see which method might result in greater contamination of groundwater. They specifically tested levels of methane, which is the primary component of natural gas.The team selected four U.S. states located in important shale zones to target for their study: Pennsylvania, Colorado, Texas and New York. One of those states - New York - banned the practice of hydrofracking in 2015 following a review by the NYS Department of Health which found significant uncertainties about health, including increased water and air pollution.Wen and his colleagues compiled a large groundwater chemistry dataset from multiple sources including federal agency reports, journal articles, and oil and gas companies. The majority of tested water samples in their study were collected from domestic water wells. Although methane itself is not toxic, Wen says that methane contamination detected in shallow groundwater could be a risk to the relevant homeowner as it could be an explosion hazard, could increase the level of other toxic chemical species like manganese and arsenic, and would contribute to global warming as methane is a greenhouse gas.Their model used sophisticated algorithms to analyze almost all of the retained geochemistry data in order to predict if a given groundwater sample was negatively impacted by recent oil and gas drilling.The data comparison showed that methane contamination cases in New York - a state without unconventional drilling but with a high volume of conventional drilling - were similar to that of Pennsylvania - a state with a high volume of unconventional drilling. Wen says this suggests that unconventional drilling methods like fracking do not necessarily lead to more environmental problems than conventional drilling, although this result might be alternatively explained by the different sizes of groundwater chemistry datasets compiled for these two states.The model also detected a higher rate of methane contamination cases in Pennsylvania than in Colorado and Texas. Wen says this difference could be attributed to different practices when drillers build/drill the oil and gas wells in different states. According to previous research, most of the methane released into the environment from gas wells in the U.S. occurs because the cement that seals the well is not completed along the full lengths of the production casing. However, no data exists to conclude if drillers in those three states use different technology. Wen says this requires further study and review of the drilling data if they become available.According to Wen, their machine learning model proved to be effective in detecting groundwater contamination, and by applying it to other states/counties with ongoing or planned oil and gas production it will be an important resource for determining the safest methods of gas and oil drilling.Reference: Wen T, Liu M, Woda J, Zheng G, Brantley SL.

The scientists found that other enzymes do play a role in this process but TET enzymes do the heavy lifting.  If we can figure out what s going on with these enzymes, that could be important for controlling cardiovascular disease,  says Atsushi Onodera, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher at LJI and first author of the new Genome Biology study. LJI Professor Anjana Rao, Ph.D., co-discovered TET enzymes while working at Harvard University alongside Mamta Tahiliani, Ph.D., and L. Aravind, Ph.D. Their work showed that this family of three enzymes alters how our genes are expressed. Over the last decade, Rao has shown the importance of TET activity in cancer development. Her work has revealed that TET enzymes are key to proper gene expression in immune cells and they can actually protect against cancerous mutations. For the new study, Rao and Onodera investigated how immune cell DNA can be altered by either TET enzymes (a process called passive demethylation) or by a DNA repair enzyme called TDG (active demethylation). The researchers aimed to uncover which demethylation pathway has a bigger role in determining the gene expression the very fate of immune cells. The researchers started with two immune cell models: CD4  helper  T cells and monocytes. Both cell types must proliferate and mature into more specific cell types to help fight off pathogens. However, once monocytes are differentiated into macrophages and stimulated with a molecule called LPS, they stop proliferating. By taking a close look at these CD4 helper T cells and macrophages the researchers could better understand proliferating and non-proliferating models. The proliferation process is very quick, making it a prime time to witness how demethylation occurs and how it affects gene expression. Onodera used CD4 helper T cells to analyze the demethylation process using a cutting-edge computational analysis program developed for this study. This tool gives scientists an unprecedented look at which regions of DNA within a cell are methylated.  We found that in immune cells, most demethylation happens through the passive pathway,  explains Onodera. Using a new technique called pyridine borane sequencing, the researchers showed that  active  demethylation through TDG is working in immune cells. Onodera says TDG s role is minor: it does the job of removing two molecules generated by TET enzyme activity. This discovery is important because TET mutations can be life-threatening. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the TET2 enzyme disable (or interfere with) some of the normal restraints on healthy monocytes. The monocytes go rogue and mature into inflammatory macrophages. People bearing TET2 mutations in macrophages have a 40 percent increase in their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. A deeper understanding of how TET enzymes work could help researchers know where to intervene and help patients with this kind of mutation. Onodera s new analysis program for identifying changes in DNA modification may also prove useful for understanding how TET mutations in immune cells can lead to blood cancers. He explains that researchers could potentially use the program to identify patients who may have different treatment outcomes based on where their DNA has been demethylated.  Hopefully we can apply this technique to disease diagnoses,  says Onodera. In fact, Onodera says the new sequencing and analysis program from this study can be applied to many immune cell types and many disease models.  At this point, we can make significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms behind DNA demethylation,  Onodera says.ReferenceOnodera A, Gonz lez-Avalos E, Lio C-WJ, et al.

Moreover, an elephant's personality may play an important role in how well that elephant can solve novel problems.The article was written by Lisa Barrett and Sarah Benson-Amram in the University of Wyoming's Animal Behavior and Cognition Lab, led by Benson-Amram. It may be viewed here.The authors of the paper tested 15 Asian elephants and three African savanna elephants in three zoos across the country -- the San Diego Zoo, the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park and the Oklahoma City Zoo -- with the help of elephant caretakers.Previous work from Barrett and Benson-Amram demonstrated that Asian elephants can use water as a tool to solve a novel problem -- and reach a tasty marshmallow reward -- in what's called the floating object task. This time, the authors designed new novel tasks, as well as personality tests, for the elephants.""We took a comprehensive approach by using three different problem-solving tasks and three types of personality assessments to determine if individual personality played a role in which elephants were able to solve these tasks,"" Barrett says. ""Since we couldn't give the elephants a personality test like the ones you're familiar with online, we had to think creatively.""The authors developed novel object tests, in which they presented the elephants with an unfamiliar object, a mylar balloon, a burned log and the scent of a predator (lion or hyena), and recorded the elephants' responses. You can watch videos of the novel object trials: balloon, burned log and urine. They also asked elephant caretakers to fill out a survey about the personalities of the animals in their care; and, finally, they observed the elephants interacting with one another in their zoo habitats.From those assessments, Barrett and Benson-Amram learned that the surveys and observations were the most reliable methods to get at elephant personality. Overall, Barrett and Benson-Amram measured traits such as active, affectionate, aggressive, defiant, excitable, mischievous, shy and sociable, which have been studied in other animals as well.""We were eager to see if the personality traits we uncovered through the surveys and observations predicted success on novel problem-solving tasks,"" Benson-Amram says. ""The elephants had an opportunity to solve each task three times, and we measured if they learned to solve faster over time, and then we traced their success back to their personality type.""The three problem-solving tasks included the trap tube task, which is a common test used with primates but which had never been presented outside of primates before. You can watch videos of the problem-solving trials: boxed ball, rod ball and trap tube.Barrett and Benson-Amram found that elephants did learn to solve two out of the three tasks faster over time, even though the elephants only received three trials on each task. Traits including aggressiveness and activity were important predictors of problem-solving overall, but the personality traits measured did not significantly predict learning ability.This study makes connections between two sources of individual variation, personality and cognition, in threatened species. One reason it is important to examine problem-solving in elephants is that they are faced with new problems that they need to solve regularly in the wild. For example, if certain traits enable elephants to overcome novel problems, elephants may be more likely to invade farmland and contribute to human-elephant conflict. With more research, managers can predict which elephants might overcome or habituate to deterrents, and managers can devote more resources to tracking elephants.The authors call for more work on different forms of personality assessments to determine which methods would be best for management of zoo and wild elephants.""Research with free-ranging elephants can extend this study to determine which personality traits are most important for solving novel problems that elephants experience in the wild,"" says Barrett, a 2020 graduate of UW's Program in Ecology and the Department of Zoology and Physiology.Reference: Barrett LP, Benson-Amram S.

Their study in mice has implications for cell replacement strategies and cancer research.Gastrulation is the formation of the three principal germ layers - endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Understanding the formation of the basic body plan is not only important to reveal how the fertilized egg gives rise to an adult organism, but also how congenital diseases arise. In addition, gastrulation serves as the basis to understand processes during embryonic development called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition which is known to lead to cancer metastasis in adulthood when dysregulated.""The famous biologist Lewis Wolpert once said that it is not birth, marriage or death, but gastrulation which is truly the most important time of our life. However, there are many things we still don't know about this phenomenon,"" says study leader Heiko Lickert.In a new study, researchers could show that the formation of the endoderm germ layer is driven by a different mechanism than it has been assumed for a long time. In contrast to the mesoderm, which undergoes an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the endoderm forms independent of this process. The researchers revealed that its formation is regulated by mechanisms of epithelial cell plasticity that allows cells to leave an epithelium and migrate away. During this process, a gene regulatory protein shields the endoderm from undergoing a mesenchymal transition.A better understanding of endoderm formation has the potential to advance cell replacement therapy (by improving stem cell differentiation into endoderm in vitro). Moreover, epithelial cell plasticity might be an alternative mechanism of cancer cell metastasis and further studies could identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.""Our study has not only revealed further details of germ layer formation, but also has broader implications for stem cell differentiation and cancer metastasis of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide,"" explains first author Katharina Scheibner.Reference: Scheibner K, Schirge S, Burtscher I, et al.

The researchers are adapting the test to detect other forms of bacteria and for the rapid diagnosis of viruses, including COVID-19. They also plan to test its viability for detecting markers of cancer.""It's going to mean that patients can get better treatment, faster results and avoid serious complications. It can also avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics, which is something that can buy us time in the battle against antimicrobial resistance,"" says Leyla Soleymani, the paper's co-corresponding author and an associate professor of engineering physics.""This will give doctors the science to support what they already suspect based on their skills and experience,"" says co-corresponding author Yingfu Li, a professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences.The new DNA-based technology uses a handheld device similar to a blood-glucose monitor. A microchip analyzes a droplet of bodily fluid such as blood, urine or saliva, using molecules that can detect the specific protein signature of an infection. The device, about the size of a USB stick, plugs into a smartphone, which displays the result.The invention combines electrochemical engineering technology developed by Soleymani and her team with biochemical technology developed by Li and his colleague Dingran Chang. They worked with infectious disease clinician Marek Smeija, a professor of medicine who provided samples from real patients, and with Todd Hoare, a professor of chemical engineering.""As scientists, we want to enable things,"" says Li, ""We are knowledgeable in different scientific and engineering principles, and when you put them together to help people, that's a special feeling. Having the chance to impact society is the reason we all do this work.""Existing practice typically requires sending samples to laboratories to be cultured, a process that can take days. Providing immediate results to patients can reduce the spread of infection, improve patients' quality of life and simplify the work of busy clinicians.The new technology can distinguish strains of the same bacteria that can be treated with antibiotics from others that are resistant to antibiotics, a critical distinction that can help battle the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, or AMR.""Clinicians identified testing delays as a problem that needed to be resolved,"" says Soleymani, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Miniaturized Biomedical Devices. ""We wanted to build a system that could give as much information as possible to the physician during the patient's first visit.""The researchers are in the midst of testing an adaptation of the same technology for the virus that causes COVID-19, using samples from a Hamilton clinic.""This technology is very versatile and we're getting very close to using the same technology for COVID-19 testing,"" says Li, who is also a member of McMaster's Michael Groote Institute for Infectious Disease Research.The researchers are exploring regulatory approvals and industry partnerships to get the technology into wide use as quickly as possible, not only in Canada, but around the world, especially where access to lab testing is limited or non-existent.""I think this technology is a step toward democratizing disease diagnosis and management,"" says lead author Richa Pandey, a post-doctoral research fellow in Soleymani's lab.

But while a brief stretch or walk can relieve minor pain, for many millions of people around the world, including up to 8% of the US population, simple solutions just don t cut it. These people suffer from intractable back pain, where painkillers, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), no longer work.For these individuals, proposed therapeutic solutions involve potentially addictive opioid drugs, or electrical stimulation methods that disrupt pain signaling between the nerves of the spinal cord and the brain; but optimum stimulation methods come at a price. The most effective devices involve invasive surgery, where stimulator electrode  paddles  are implanted into the spinal cord. While the signals produced by these devices can offer pain relief, for many patients, such surgery is a step too far.Now, a new electrical stimulation device could offer the benefits of a paddle stimulator via a more simple procedure that could open stimulation-based therapies to far more pain patients. Spinal cord stimulators have been used in the clinic for pain management for over 50 years,  says Dr. Christopher Proctor, a group leader of the Bionic Systems Group in the Engineering Department at the University of Cambridge and coauthor of a new study that shows off the prototype device.The device is inflated to a paddle shape after insertion into the epidural space. Credit: Woodington et al.  As a result of these issues, only 100,000 people each year seek stimulation-based solutions, despite the global burden. This includes patients with other pain conditions that can be relieved by stimulation, including angina.  There are a probably about a billion people worldwide that suffer from pain conditions,  Proctor points out.The new device, which remains at an experimental stage, would be implanted via an outpatient procedure.  The implant goes into a cavity [called the epidural space] between the dura, a skin-like sheath that protects the spinal cord, and the spinal column,  explains Proctor. The device itself is minuscule, just 60 microns thick, and is made of a combination of thin-film electronics and a fluidics system. This latter feature allows the device to be  inflated  by infusing a combination of air and water into it. This makes it expand to a paddle shape within the epidural space, covering a much greater area of the spinal cord than wire stimulators. The air and water is then sucked back out of the device, allowing it to fit snugly in the tissue in the epidural space.  We are trying to combine the best of both worlds here,  says Proctor,  Minimally invasive surgery to get a paddle-like device that can provide the best treatment and is least likely to have issues with displacement.  In their paper, Proctor and his team examined the device s engineering, showing that it could successfully inflate inside an in vitro model of the spinal cord, and that it could be successfully implanted into an actual spinal cord by using a human cadaver to validate the technique. This is the beginning of a journey that will task the researchers with proving its safety and efficacy in pre-clinical animal models and then in human patients. Proctor hopes that progress will be rapid,  We are aiming to be ready for first in-human clinical trials in three years,  he says.Proctor is aware of the scale of the task   funding and expertise will be required to move from the team s lab setting to a regulated space that is suitable for medical device production, and much more evidence will be required to prove the device s worth, but the potential benefits to pain patients make it worthwhile. Spinal cord stimulation isn t going to be the answer for a billion people, but it could be the answer for a lot more people than it is now, and it can dramatically improve a lot of patients  lives. I think our innovations is going to allow a lot more patients to access this highly effective treatment,  Proctor concludes.Reference: Woodington BJ, Curto VF, Yu, Y et al., Electronics with shape actuation for minimally invasive spinal cord stimulation.

At the same time, boys are diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum four times as often as girls.Both statistics may be related to dopamine, one of our body's neurotransmitters.""This is interesting. Research shows a more active dopamine system in most men"" than in women, says Hermundur Sigmundsson, a professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU)Department of Psychology.He is behind a new study that addresses gender differences in key motivating factors for what it takes to become good at something. The study uses men's and women's differing activity in the dopamine system as an explanatory model.""We looked at gender differences around passion, self-discipline and positive attitude,"" Sigmundsson says.The study refers to these qualities as passion, grit and mindset. The researchers also applied theories to possible links with dopamine levels.Dopamine is linked to learning, attention and our ability to focus.Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released in the brain. It can contribute to a feeling of satisfaction.Men normally secrete more dopamine, which is often called the ""happy hormone,"" but it plays a far more complex role than that. The effects of dopamine are linked to learning, attention and our ability to focus.Previous studies on Icelandic students have shown that men are more dependent on passion in order to succeed at something. This study confirms the earlier findings. Men require more passion. In six out of eight test questions, men score higher on passion than women.However, the association with dopamine levels has not been established previously.""The fact that we've developed a test to measure passion for goal achievement means that we can now relate dopamine levels to passion and goal achievement,"" says Sigmundsson.Women, on the other hand, may have greater self-discipline - or grit - and be more conscientious, according to other studies. Their level of passion may not be as pronounced in general, but they still are able to do what it takes to be good.The results for the women, however, are somewhat more ambiguous than men's strong need to burn for something, and this study found no such gender difference.Nor did the researchers find any difference between the sexes in terms of growth mindset.In the past, the dopamine system has been associated with many different conditions, such as ADHD, psychoses, manias and Parkinson's disease. But it may also be related to a certain form of autistic behaviour.Some individuals with autism may become very interested in certain topics, which can be a bit unusual, or even strange, for most people. People on the autism spectrum can focus intensely on these topics or pursuits, at least for a while. Dopamine may play a role.""Other research in neuroscience has shown hyperactivity in the dopamine system in individuals with autism, and boys make up four out of five children on the autism spectrum. This, and dopamine's relationship to passion, might be a mechanism that helps to explain this behaviour,"" says Sigmundsson.The research group tested 917 people aged 14 to 77, consisting of 502 women and 415 men. This is considered a major study in this context.Reference: Sigmundsson H, Gu nason S, J hannsd ttir S. Passion, grit and mindset: Exploring gender differences.

Lacking this molecule, called hepaCAM, astrocytes aren't as sticky as they should be, and tend to stick to themselves rather than forming connections with their fellow astrocytes.This finding, in studies on mice with the gene for hepaCAM knocked out of their astrocytes, is an important clue in efforts to understand several brain disorders, including cognitive decline, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders. The work appears June 24 in the journal Neuron.A rare disorder called megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy (MLC) is also known to be caused by a mutation in the hepaCAM gene, and this work might provide answers about what exactly has gone wrong. MLC is a developmental disorder that grows progressively worse, causing macrocephaly (a large head), swelling of the brain's white matter, intellectual disability and epilepsy.By removing hepaCAM selectively from astrocytes to see what it does, ""we sort of made the cells into introverts,"" said senior author Cagla Eroglu, an associate professor of cell biology at the Duke University School of Medicine. ""They're normally wanting to reach out, but without hepaCAM, they started to hug themselves instead.""""If the astrocyte makes junctions to its neighbors, then you start to have a network,"" Eroglu said. ""To make a functional brain, you need a functional astrocytic network.""The researchers zeroed in on hepaCAM by looking for genes that are highly active in astrocytes and which have been implicated in brain dysfunction. They partnered with another group working on hepaCAM at the University of Barcelona, but that group has been looking at the molecule for its role in regulating chloride signaling channels in astrocytes.The Duke group found that removing hepaCAM from astrocytes led to a synaptic network that was too easily excited and not as well dampened. ""The effect on the inhibitory synapses was the strongest,"" said first author Katie Baldwin, who recently became an assistant professor of cell biology and physiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""You're putting the inhibition down and the excitation up, so that really could point to a mechanism for epilepsy.""Baldwin, who did this work as a postdoctoral researcher in Eroglu's lab, is planning to further pursue these questions in her new lab at UNC, testing whether hepaCAM-deficient mice behave differently or have changes in learning and memory, or whether they exhibit the stress and social anxiety that are markers of autism spectrum disorders. She said they might also reintroduce the disease-mutation versions of the protein to mice that were born without it to see what effects it has.""We know hepaCAM is interacting with itself between two astrocytes, but we don't know what it's interacting with at the synapse,"" Baldwin said. ""We don't know if it could be interacting with hepaCAM which is also found in the neurons, or if it could be some other protein that we don't know about yet.""Reference: Baldwin KT, Tan CX, Strader ST, et al.

But all vaccinated individuals, whether previously infected or not, will likely require booster shots moving forward because antibodies created through both vaccines and natural infection wane at the same relatively rapid rate, the authors say.In a study published today in the peer-reviewed journal ACS Nano, the researchers report that a previous COVID-19 infection effectively serves as the first  dose  of a two-dose vaccine, with one shot providing the same amount of protection in previously infected people as two shots would in those who have not been infected. Our data suggest that a person who previously had COVID-19 has a huge response after the first mRNA vaccination and has little or no benefit from the second dose,  said senior author Dr. Otto Yang, a professor of infectious diseases and of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.  It is worth considering changing public health policy to take this into account, both to maximize vaccine usage and avoid unnecessary side effects. The researchers focused on the two-dose Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, both of which use mRNA technology to trigger the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Clinical trials of these vaccines showed that two doses are roughly 95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 illness for the first few months after vaccination. These trials, however, included only a small percentage of participants who had already recovered from the disease and did not assess how previous infections affected the production of antibodies. In addition, the time course of antibody development in both uninfected and previously infected individuals and how long virus-neutralizing antibodies persist have remained unclear.To answer those questions, Yang and his colleagues measured the level, quality and persistence of COVID-19 antibodies after one and two doses of the mRNA vaccines in people who had experienced cases of COVID-19 and those who hadn t.For the 28 participants who had not had an infection, the first dose of either vaccine triggered antibody levels similar to those seen soon after mild COVID-19 infections; two doses were required to obtain antibodies approaching those observed soon after severe cases.In contrast, among the 36 participants who had COVID-19 prior to being vaccinated, the first dose produced a vigorous antibody response similar to a severe natural infection, but the second dose provided no additional increase in antibody levels.The quality of the antibodies produced   their ability to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein   was found to be similar in both previously infected and uninfected participants. After the second vaccine dose, antibody levels waned in both groups, comparable to the decrease seen after natural infections, resulting in an average loss of 90% of antibodies within 85 days.Although Yang noted that more research is needed on the response of the immune system s T cells   and particularly long-lasting  memory  T cells   to the vaccines, he said the study findings on the sharp drop-off in antibodies in the months after vaccination suggest that booster vaccinations will likely be necessary for everyone to maintain protection against the virus.Reference: Ibarrondo FJ, Hofmann C, Fulcher JA, et al.

They demonstrated the approach by generating nanobodies that neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 virus more potently than an antibody isolated from an infected patient and a nanobody isolated from an immunized animal.Nanobodies are small antibody fragments which bind strongly to their target molecules and block their functions. Currently, antibody and nanobody discovery involves selecting initial lead antibody candidates, followed by time- and labor-intensive modifications to make them suitable for therapeutic applications, said Jennifer Zupancic, doctoral candidate in chemical engineering and co-first author, with Alec Desai, doctoral candidate in chemical engineering. The study is in Cell Chemical Biology. A key advantage to this method, both in terms of addressing pandemics and nanobody development more generally, is the ability to select nanobodies that bind strongly more rapidly than with current methods,  said Zupancic. This unexpected discovery appears to be a key step toward addressing a long-standing challenge in the field, namely the rapid and simple generation of high-affinity agents (agents that bind strongly) such as nanobodies, without the need for extensive screening and optimization,  said Peter Tessier, the Albert M. Mattocks Professor in Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chemical Engineering, and senior author. He s also a member of the U-M Biointerfaces Institute,Nanobodies and antibodies bind to their targets via multiple flexible binding loops called the complementarity-determining regions. Researchers discovered that one or more of the individual binding loops from different lead nanobodies could be combined into single nanobody mutants with improved properties, Zupancic said. That process is called complementarity-determining region swapping. This process of CDR swapping resulted in substantial changes to the nanobodies we initially started out to modify,  she said.  It was surprising to us that such large changes not only did not hinder the nanobodies  ability to bind and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but actually greatly improved it. Researchers discovered the method accidentally, but found and reported that the technique is simple to perform in a systematic manner.Generally, approved antibody drugs must demonstrate drug-like properties, including high stability, specificity and solubility, and must also bind strongly to their target. Often, there are tradeoffs between these properties, which frustrate therapeutic antibody development. However, we observe that our nanobodies have drug-like properties and also bind to and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus strongly,  she said.The new method likely can be used to develop nanobodies against other viruses and disease targets. That work is ongoing in the lab now, Zupancic said.Reference: Zupancic JM, Desai AA, Schardt JS, et al.

By measuring how gene activity and regulation change over time, researchers now have a better understanding of how the cerebral cortex is built, as well as a brand new set of tools to explore how the cortex is affected in neurodevelopmental disease. The study is published in the journal Nature.""We have had a long-standing interest in understanding the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex, as it is the seat of higher-order cognition and the part of the brain that has expanded and diversified the most during human evolution,"" said Paola Arlotta, the co-senior author of the study and the Golub Family Professor of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology at Harvard University. ""In this study, we looked at the cortex with a very fine lens, practically profiling all of its cells, one by one, every day of development. We catalogued changes in gene expression and regulation at an unprecedented level of temporal resolution to build a first single-cell-resolution molecular map of this amazing tissue. The map allowed us to extract first mechanistic principles governing how the cortex is built, and begin to decode how genetic abnormalities affect such highy controlled process in the embryo.""""In the developing brain, we have to consider three things: the types of cells that are present, where those cells are located, and at what stage they are in development. In addition, by identifying the drivers that direct this process in normal development, we can better understand what may go wrong in disease,"" said co-senior author Aviv Regev, who was a core institute member at the Broad Institute when the study began and is currently Head of Genentech Research and Early Development.The researchers focused on the somatosensory cortex, which may serve as a model for other regions of the cerebral cortex because it contains cells representing all of its major classes. For every day of cortex development, the researchers analyzed the brain using multiple technologies at the single-cell level. They used RNA-seq to measure which genes are expressed, as well as spatial transcriptomics to measure where genes are expressed in the tissue. They also used ATAC-seq to measure which parts of the genome were accessible for regulation.""These technologies allowed us to look at different modes of gene expression and how genes are regulating each other. By combining these three modalities, we have a stronger sense of which are the important genes for directing neuronal development, for example"" said Daniela Di Bella, a postdoctoral fellow in the Arlotta lab and co-first author of the study.For instance, it has been unclear exactly when the cortex's diversity of different neuron populations is established. ""We found that the different flavors of neurons are decided during the neuron maturation process, rather than pre-established in their stem cells,"" Di Bella said.The researchers also used their data to predict the underlying mechanism of how genetic mutation leads to defects in cortical development, finding which specific developmental steps are failing and which cells are being affected.""We have created a uniquely comprehensive molecular atlas of the developing somatosensory cortex, and we are continuing to mine the data for more insights,"" said co-first author Ehsan Habibi. ""Our goal is for our data to serve as a resource for the wider neuroscience community and inform how the field looks at brain development, both during normal and disease processes.""""These combined, extensive measurements provided us with a first dynamic view of the symphony of molecular events that unfold as this critical region of the brain is built in the embryo,"" said Arlotta, who is also an institute member in the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute. ""Researchers have been studying the process of development of the cerebral cortex for over a century, but the mechanistic events that govern how cells are made and how they interact to ultimately form functional circuit have remained elusive. As a field, we have historically looked at this complex developing tissue one cell type at a time, and investigated small numbers of genes for their roles in putting together pieces of this amazing puzzle. But the brain does not develop one cell type at the time -- it is truly a symphony in the sense that hundreds of cell types undergo development together, using ever-changing lanscapes of genes to form the adult tissue. Now imagine having for the first time the full 'recipe' of genes that any given cell class uses as its development unfolds. Imagine also gaining detailed knowledge of the 'codes of genes' that turn on or off as distinct lineages of cells separate from each other and get built. This type of overarching mechanistic knowledge offers an opportunity to study cortical development in a brand new way, looking at all cells and all genes. We never had information this complete before and I must admit that I stared at the data in awe, thinking about the type of discovery that it enables.""""Ten years ago, this study would not have been possible because the technologies either did not exist or were not mature enough yet,"" Regev said. ""But with advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and new machine learning algorithms for large data analysis, we were able to map where cells develop, put those maps together, and watch development unfold like a movie over time. We could not only reconstruct the movie, but could also link that picture to a greater biological understanding of brain development. We hope this approach could one day help us better understand and treat diseases of the brain.""Arlotta added: ""It is a pretty interesting movie -- one that I have looked forward to filming for most of my scientific career.""Reference: Di Bella DJ, Habibi E, Stickels RR, et al.

Bacterial canker is caused by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) and more recent outbreaks have been particularly devastating due to the emergence of a new, extremely aggressive biovar called Psa3. Due to its recent introduction, the molecular basis of Psa3 s virulence is unknown, making it difficult to develop mitigation strategies. In light of this dilemma, a group of scientists at the University of Verona and University of Rome collaborated on a study comparing the behavior of Psa3 with less-virulent biovars to determine the basis of pathogenicity. They found that genes involved in bacterial signaling (the transmission of external stimuli within cells) were especially important, especially the genes required for the synthesis and degradation of a small chemical signal called c-di-GMP, that suppresses the expression of virulence factors. Compared to other biovars, Psa3 produces very low levels of c-di-GMP, contributing to an immediate and aggressive phenotype at the onset of infection before the plant can corral a defense response.  It was exciting to discover this diversified arsenal of pathogenicity strategies among closely related bacterial strains that infect the same hosts but display different behaviors,  said Elodie Vandelle, one of the scientists involved with this study.  Although their  small  genomes mainly contain the same information, our research shows that bacterial populations within a pathovar are more complex than expected and their pathogenicity may have evolved throughout different strategies to attack the same host.  Their research highlights the importance of working on a multitude of real-life pathogenic bacterial strains to shed light on the diversity of virulence strategies. This approach can contribute to the creation of wider pathogenicity working models. In terms of kiwi production, Vandelle hopes their findings can help scientists develop new mitigation methods. In the long-term, their research could lead to the identification of key molecular switches responsible for the transition between high and low bacterial virulence phenotypes.  This identification would allow, at industrial level, to develop new targeted strategies to control phytopathogenic bacteria, weakening their aggressiveness through switch control, instead of killing them,  Vandelle explained.  This would avoid the occurrence of new resistances among bacterial communities, thus guaranteeing a sustainable plant protection. ReferenceVandelle E et al.

It has long been of interest to researchers due to its roles in taste perception and blood sugar regulation.Now, a team led by scientists at Van Andel Institute has published the first-ever high-resolution images of TRPM5, which reveal two areas that may serve as targets for new medications. The structures also may aid in the development of low-calorie alternative sweeteners that mimic sugar. The findings were published today in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology.""TRPM5 is the cornerstone of taste signaling, which itself has a much larger role in the body than often recognized,"" said Wei L , Ph.D., an associate professor at VAI and co-corresponding author of the study. ""We hope our structures of TRPM5 will serve as blueprints for designing new medications that help control blood sugar in diabetes, while also providing a template for development of low-calorie sweeteners that activate sensory circuits in the brain and the gut -- a key distinction that mimics sugar.""There are five types of taste that the body senses: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. When the tongue encounters a taste, specialized cells on the tongue called taste receptors send messages about that taste to the brain. TRPM5 is a key part of the complex process that ushers these important signals on their way to the brain's sensory processing center.But taste perception goes far beyond helping us sense the subtle flavors of a tiramisu. It helps protect the body by detecting bitter and acidic tastes, which commonly are associated with harmful substances. Taste perception also occurs beyond the tongue; for example, the process of taste perception in certain pancreatic cells regulates insulin secretion, which keeps blood sugar levels in check. Similar cells, called tuft cells, also coat the linings of the intestine, lungs and gallbladder, where they use TRPM5 and related proteins to sense the sugar-like byproducts of parasitic infections and trigger immune responses to deal with the threat.""Targeting TRPM5 and taste-signaling throughout the body has two major potential benefits: it may help us improve treatment for a number of metabolic and immune disorders while also providing a path toward improved sweeteners,"" said Juan Du, Ph.D., an associate professor at VAI and co-corresponding author of the study. ""While the body needs sugar to survive, too much of it can be harmful. We're hopeful a more thorough understanding of TRPM5 will lead to better alternatives.""TRPM5 belongs to the TRP superfamily, a group of proteins that mediate responses to sensory stimuli, such as pain, pressure, vision, temperature and taste. Broadly known as ion channels, proteins like TRP nestle within cells' membranes, acting as gatekeepers for chemical signals passing into and out of the cell. The eight proteins that comprise the TRPM subfamily are part of this broader group.To date, L  and Du laboratories have solved the structures of three of the eight known TRPM proteins as well as an ion channel called CALHM2, which belongs to the calcium homeostasis modulator family. Another member of this molecular family is CALHM1, also an important component of taste signaling.Reference: Ruan Z, Haley E, Orozco IJ, et al.

The drugs are widely considered safe, but the effect of these medications on the unborn fetus has remained a topic of some concern. Now, researchers have found that maternal psychiatric conditions - but not the use of serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) - increased the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental delay (DD) in offspring.The study appears in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier.Previous studies had found links between SSRI use and ASD in offspring, and ASD is associated with disrupted serotonergic pathways. But the question of whether medication or underlying conditions are responsible remained muddy.Jennifer Ames, PhD, from Kaiser Permanente and lead author of the new study, said, ""Our latest findings are good news for women managing psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety while pregnant and are consistent with a growing body of research that's trying to better disentangle the separate relationships of the mother's SSRI treatment and psychiatric indications during pregnancy with child neurodevelopment.""Dr. Ames and colleagues used data from the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), which collected information about the development of thousands of children born across the US between 2003 and 2011. The current analysis of SEED data included three groups of children: those with ASD (1,367 children); with DD (1,750 children); or healthy population controls (1,671 children). Mothers were determined to have psychiatric disorders and to have taken SSRIs during pregnancy based on self-report and on medical records. About a third of mothers in the study had a psychiatric condition before or during pregnancy, and about a quarter of those took SSRIs or other antidepressants.The findings indicated that the risk of ASD or DD was roughly doubled for children of mothers with a psychiatric disorder compared to those without. But importantly, the use of SSRIs was not associated with increased risk.John Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, said of the work, ""Parents have been concerned about the risks posed to infants when mothers take antidepressant medications. It is a big relief to see that maternal antidepressant consumption does not increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, this study does confirm that maternal psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder in offspring.""""Our study has some unique strengths such as including a large and demographically diverse group of mothers and children in the United States, an analysis of specific subgroups of children with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disorders, and an examination of multiple types of psychiatric conditions in the mothers,"" added Dr. Ames.The findings should provide some peace of mind for the estimated 6% of pregnant women in the US taking SSRIs.Reference: Ames JL, Ladd-Acosta C, Fallin MD, et al.

Appetite was also monitored in the following three hours to understand how these drinks may affect the participants  hunger and their desire to eat. The research observed that vegan protein shakes led to a lower rise in blood insulin compared to whey, while potato protein prevented any rise in insulin. This may explain the better blood glucose control following consumption of the plant-based protein and poses the question of whether vegan protein shakes are more suitable for individuals who need to need control their blood glucose levels such as diabetic and obese individuals. Interestingly, release of the key appetite regulating hormone GLP-1 was greater after drinking the whey protein shake. However, the greater GLP-1 response did not translate to an increased feeling of fullness as there were no differences observed in appetite perception between the three different protein shakes. Consumer trends in protein intake are on the rise with milk protein derivatives such as whey extensively used in consumer products such as protein shakes, fortified food and beverage products. There are alternative protein products available for vegetarians and vegans such as soy, rice, wheat and pea proteins but there is a relative lack of evidence on their health benefits in comparison to milk proteins. Potato protein is a novel plant-based protein product that is obtained from the waste material from potato starch production and is a sustainable economic protein source. This study provides the first evidence to suggest that it may be an alternative to whey protein sources. Professor M Gulrez Zariwala, corresponding author and Director of the Centre for Nutraceuticals at the University of Westminster, said:  Global concerns on sustainability have led to consumer shifts towards ethical eating and a change in dietary habits with increased adoption of vegetarian and vegan diets.  However, research in this area is still lacking and it would be interesting to clarify whether proteins from plant sources can provide identical metabolic health benefits as those with traditional sources such as milk.  Our results shed new light in this area and improves our understanding of how plant source proteins can be a more sustainable yet nutritionally beneficial food source. We plan to conduct follow-up studies further research this exciting area. ReferenceTiekou Lorinczova H, Deb S, Begum G, Renshaw D, Zariwala MG.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/streptococcus-pneumoniae-worsens-flu-by-sticking-to-dead-and-dying-cells-350202,Streptococcus pneumoniae Worsens Flu by Sticking to Dead and Dying Cells Researchers have identified a new virulence mechanism for a surface protein on the pneumonia causing bacteria S  pneumoniae   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A bout with flu virus can be hard, but when Streptococcus pneumonia enters the mix, it can turn deadly.Now researchers have found a further reason for the severity of this dual infection by identifying a new virulence mechanism for a surface protein on the pneumonia-causing bacteria S. pneumoniae. This insight comes more than three decades after discovery of that surface protein, called pneumococcal surface protein A, or PspA.This new mechanism had been missed in the past because it facilitates bacterial adherence only to dead or dying lung epithelial cells, not to living cells. Heretofore, researchers typically used healthy lung cell monolayers to search for bacterial adhesins that aid infection. Virus killing of lung cells during flu was found to set the stage for S. pneumonia attachment to the airway, thereby worsening disease and pneumonia.The research, published in the journal Cell Reports, was led by Carlos Orihuela, Ph.D., and David Briles, Ph.D., professor and professor emeritus in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Microbiology. Orihuela and Briles say their findings provide further explanation for how an infection by influenza A flu virus -- followed by S. pneumoniae superinfection -- causes severe pneumonia and a high death rate. The mechanism also points to possible improvements for disease treatment and vaccination.A historical example of the deadly synergy of flu infection followed by S. pneumoniae superinfection is found in banked lung samples from the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic that killed 40 million to 50 million people -- the vast majority of these samples showed co-infection or secondary infection with S. pneumonia.The UAB research on PspA began with some head-scratching results from experimental lung infections of mice with influenza A, followed by either wild-type S. pneumonia that has the intact PspA gene, or a mutant S. pneumoniae that lacks PspA. Lung homogenates from mice infected with the wild-type had much higher numbers of S. pneumonia bacteria than lungs infected with the mutant. However, when researchers washed the interiors of the lungs and collected that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, they counted similar numbers of the wild-type S. pneumonia and the mutant.""This unexpected result was interpreted to mean that wild-type S. pneumoniae were more resistant to dislodgement than S. pneumonia with a pspA gene deletion, and it served as rationale for further experimentation,"" Orihuela said.From this clue, the researchers were able to show that PspA functions as an adhesin to dying host cells, in addition to its several other previously established virulence mechanisms. The researchers also detailed the molecular mechanism of this bacterial adherence.Both influenza A infection and release of the S. pneumoniae toxin pneumolysin cause death of lung epithelial cells. As they are dying, cells' phosphatidylserine residues get flipped to the outer cell membrane, where they bind the host enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or GAPDH. In turn, the S. pneumoniae PspA on the surface of the bacteria binds to the GAPDH. PspA-GAPDH-mediated binding to lung cells increased S. pneumoniae localization in the lower airway, and this was enhanced by pneumolysin exposure or co-infection with influenza A virus.Tests with fragments of the PspA protein showed that a 52-amino acid portion of the protein -- from amino acid 230 to 281 -- was required for GAPDH binding. Instilling one of those binding fragments into the lungs of influenza-infected mice reduced the disease severity of S. pneumoniae superinfection, presumably through binding competition.""Our findings support the targeting of regions of PspA for therapeutic and vaccine development against influenza A/Streptococcus pneumoniae superinfections,"" Orihuela said. ""Importantly, and despite more than 30 years since its discovery, PspA was not previously shown to function as an adhesin. Thus, our finding of PspA's role in adherence substantially advances our knowledge on the interactions of S. pneumoniae with its host.""Reference: Park S-S, Gonzalez-Juarbe N, Riegler AN, et al.

The levels of polyphenols in their urine were measured after three hours.To measure visual acuity, letter charts were placed four metres from the individuals in different lighting conditions, one high (photopic) and one low (mesopic). Adaptation to darkness employed a psychophysical method measuring the sensitivity recovery dynamic subsequent to the whitening of the retinal photopigments.Before these tests, a series of questionnaires and eye examinations were conducted to demonstrate the absence of any dietary factor or prior pathology which could give rise to any error in the analysis of the results and the conclusions drawn.""We need to conduct certain further studies as proof of concept to confirm that the effect is real and that the results could be applied to the design of products which could help to improve visual acuity and attention in defined populations,"" adds Sonia de Pascual-Teresa of the ICTAN-CSIC.Reference: Puell MC, de Pascual-Teresa S.

The new artificial intelligence system developed in the University of Houston's Air Quality Forecasting and Modeling Lab could lead to improved ways to control high ozone problems and even contribute to solutions for climate change issues.""This was very challenging. Nobody had done this previously. I believe we are the first to try to forecast surface ozone levels two weeks in advance,"" said Yunsoo Choi, professor of atmospheric chemistry and AI deep learning at UH's College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. The findings are published online in the scientific journal, Scientific Reports-Nature.Ozone, a colorless gas, is helpful in the right place and amount. As a part of the earth's stratosphere (""the ozone layer""), it protects by filtering out UV radiation from the sun. But when there are high concentrations of ozone near earth's surface, it is toxic to lungs and hearts.""Ozone is a secondary pollutant, and it can affect humans in a bad way,"" explained doctoral student Alqamah Sayeed, a researcher in Choi's lab and the first author of the research paper. Exposure can lead to throat irritation, trouble breathing, asthma, even respiratory damage. Some people are especially susceptible, including the very young, the elderly and the chronically ill.Ozone levels have become a frequent part of daily weather reports. But unlike weather forecasts, which can be reasonably accurate up to 14 days ahead, ozone levels have been predicted only two or three days in advance - until this breakthrough.The vast improvement in forecasting is only one part of the story of this new research. The other is how the team made it happen. Conventional forecasting uses a numerical model, which means the research is based on equations for the movement of gasses and fluids in the atmosphere.The limitations were obvious to Choi and his team. The numerical process is slow, making results expensive to obtain, and accuracy is limited. ""Accuracy with the numerical model starts to drop after the first three days,"" Choi said.The research team used a unique loss function in developing the machine learning algorithm. A loss function helps in optimization of the AI model by mapping decision to their associated costs. In this project, researchers used index of agreement, known as IOA, as the loss function for the AI model over conventional loss functions. IOA is a mathematical comparison of gaps between what is expected and how things actually turn out.In other words, team members added historical ozone data to the trials as they gradually refined the program's reactions. The combination of the numerical model and the IOA as the loss function eventually enabled the AI algorithm to accurately predict outcomes of real-life ozone conditions by recognizing what happened before in similar situations. It is much like how human memory is built.""Think about a young boy who sees a cup of hot tea on a table and tries to touch it out of curiosity. The moment the child touches the cup, he realizes it is hot and shouldn't be touched directly. Through that experience, the child has trained his mind,"" Sayeed said. ""In a very basic sense, it is the same with AI. You provide input, the computer gives you output. Over many repetitions and corrections, the process is refined over time, and the AI program comes to 'know' how to react to conditions that have been presented before. On a basic level, artificial intelligence develops in the same way that the child learned not to be in such a hurry to grab the next cup of hot tea.""In the lab, the team used four to five years of ozone data in what Sayeed described as ""an evolving process"" of teaching the AI system to recognize ozone conditions and estimate the forecasts, getting better over time.""Applying deep learning to air quality and weather forecasting is like searching for the holy grail, just like in the movies,"" said Choi, who is a big fan of action plots. ""In the lab, we went through some difficult times for a few years. There is a process. Finally, we've grasped the holy grail. This system works. The AI model 'understands' how to forecast. Despite the years of work, it somehow still feels like a surprise to me, even today.""Before success in the laboratory can lead to real-world service, many commercial steps are ahead in before the world can benefit from the discovery.""If you know the future - air quality in this case - you can do a lot of things for the community. This can be very critical for this planet. Who knows? Perhaps we can figure out how to resolve the climate change issue. The future may go beyond weather forecasting and ozone forecasting. This could help make the planet secure,"" said Choi.Sounds like a happy ending for any good action story.Reference: Sayeed A, Choi Y, Eslami E, et al.

This third generation CRISPR system focuses on multiplexed gene activation, meaning that it can boost the function of multiple genes simultaneously. According to the researchers, this system boasts four to six times the activation capacity of current state-of-the-art CRISPR technology, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency in up to seven genes at once. While CRISPR is more often known for its gene editing capabilities that can knock out genes that are undesirable, activating genes to gain functionality is essential to creating better plants and crops for the future.""While my lab has produced systems for simultaneous gene editing [multiplexed editing] before, editing is mostly about generating loss of function to improve the crop,"" explains Qi. ""But if you think about it, that strategy is finite, because there aren't endless genes that you can turn off and actually still gain something valuable. Logically, it is a very limited way to engineer and breed better traits, whereas the plant may have already evolved to have different pathways, defense mechanisms, and traits that just need a boost. Through activation, you can really uplift pathways or enhance existing capacity, even achieve a novel function. Instead of shutting things down, you can take advantage of the functionality already there in the genome and enhance what you know is useful.""In his new paper, Qi and his team validated the CRISPR 3.0 system in rice, tomatoes, and Arabidopsis (the most popular model plant species, commonly known as rockcress). The team showed that you can simultaneously activate many kinds of genes, including faster flowering to speed up the breeding process. But this is just one of the many advantages of multiplexed activation, says Qi.""Having a much more streamlined process for multiplexed activation can provide significant breakthroughs. For example, we look forward to using this technology to screen the genome more effectively and efficiently for genes that can help in the fight against climate change and global hunger. We can design, tailor, and track gene activation with this new system on a larger scale to screen for genes of importance, and that will be very enabling for discovery and translational science in plants.""Since CRISPR is usually thought of as ""molecular scissors"" that can cut DNA, this activation system uses deactivated CRISPR-Cas9 that can only bind. Without the ability to cut, the system can focus on recruiting activation proteins for specific genes of interest by binding to certain segments of DNA instead. Qi also tested his SpRY variant of CRISPR-Cas9 that greatly broadens the scope of what can be targeted for activation, as well as a deactivated form of his recent CRISPR-Cas12b system to show versatility across CRISPR systems. This shows the great potential of expanding for multiplexed activation, which can change the way genome engineering works.""People always talk about how individuals have potential if you can nurture and promote their natural talents,"" says Qi. ""This technology is exciting to me because we are promoting the same thing in plants - how can you promote their potential to help plants do more with their natural capabilities? That is what multiplexed gene activation can do, and it gives us so many new opportunities for crop breeding and enhancement.""Reference: Pan C, Wu X, Markel K, et al.

These are designed to treat the inflammation caused by autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. A EULAR taskforce was set up to develop a set of new points to consider to give guidance and advice on the best way to use these medicines to treat COVID-19. The taskforce included rheumatologists, immunologists, haematologists, paediatricians, patients and other health professionals. They looked at the published evidence on the use of immunomodulatory therapies to treat severe COVID-19.In total, there are two overarching principles and 14 points to consider. The principles stress that the picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be very different in different people. Infections range from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe or fatal. People with COVID-19 may need different treatment approaches, including antiviral medicines, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation and/or immunomodulatory treatment at different stages of the disease. The 14 points to consider are split into two categories: pathophysiology, and immunomodulatory therapy. Pathophysiology is about the disease itself. Immunomodulatory therapy is about how we might use existing medicines from the field of rheumatology to treat severe COVID-19. These give specific advice about which treatments to use at what stages of the disease. The picture is changing very quickly, which means there are some areas of uncertainty. EULAR intends to update the advice in response to increasing knowledge and evidence both about the disease, and the impact of COVID-19 vaccines.These findings do not apply to people living with RMDs who are taking immunomodulatory treatments for their rheumatic disease.

The color variety was known as Lemon Frost - with their bold bands and snazzy spots, the rare animals could fetch upwards of $2,000.But the gaudy geckos had one problem. Roughly 80 percent develop bulbous white skin tumors within the first five years of life. In some individuals, these tumors can become massive, making it difficult for the animals to move and potentially causing infection if ruptured.

Doctors currently treat people with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer using therapy that inhibits both estrogen levels and cell cycle activity. While these therapies often initially shrink tumors, about 90% of metastatic patients and 50% of Stage 2 and 3 breast cancer patients develop resistance.A research team led by Andrea Bild, Ph.D., a professor in City of Hope's Department of Medical Oncology & Therapeutics Research, used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify resistant traits cancer cells acquire; these cancer cells are able to persist despite therapy. The team also identified when these resistant traits are acquired and found them as early as two weeks after the start of a treatment regimen, which is months faster than current methods used to measure treatment response.""If health care providers are able to identify the development of tumor resistance earlier, then they can quickly switch gears and offer a different treatment regimen that could eventually bring the breast cancer patient into remission rather than continuing on a path that may fail to achieve a positive outcome,"" Bild said. ""With the current available set of precision medicine tools, medical professionals could measure patient response to treatment earlier to offer treatment options that are more likely to work for each individual patient.""Bild and her colleagues studied the evolution of the DNA and RNA in breast tumor cells of postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer who were enrolled in the FELINE trial. These patients were treated with endocrine therapy (letrozole) alone and in combination with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor therapy (ribociclib), a treatment that restrains tumor cells from growing. Patients were treated with targeted therapy in a neoadjuvant setting, meaning prior to surgery to remove the tumor, to assess response. Biopsies from over 40 patients' tumors were processed and analyzed from cells taken prior to, two weeks after and six months from the start of endocrine and combination treatments.City of Hope researchers found that resistant cells that persist even after endocrine and cell cycle (CDK4/6) inhibition therapy tend to shift their growth engine from using estrogen signaling to using alternative growth factor receptors and to rewiring cell cycle pathways. For example, resistant cells bypass the blocked pathways by turning on alternative signaling pathways such as growth receptors and MAPK signaling; this rewiring enables cancer cells to continue growing despite the estrogen and cell cycle drug inhibitors. Targeting these acquired resistance pathways with appropriate therapies may help doctors in the future treat patients with resistant ER+ early-stage breast cancer.""The study is impressive in its scope, presenting comprehensive genomic profiling of the longitudinal samples from multiple patients,"" said Suwon Kim, Ph.D., who was not involved in the research and is an associate professor at Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), an affiliate of City of Hope, and a faculty member of the University of Arizona College of Medicine. ""The results are significant, revealing the emergence of the alternate specific pathways in single tumor cells as they become resistant to CDK inhibitors and endocrine therapy. The study findings offer opportunities for evidence-guided therapeutic intervention for therapy-resistant breast cancer.""Understanding how tumor cells quickly change and rewire signaling pathways so that they can persist after combination neoadjuvant cancer treatment will enable scientists to design novel treatment regimens that target tumor resistance. Bild and colleagues are now identifying drugs that block the traits found specifically in resistant cancer cells.""Early-stage ER+ and PR+ (progesterone receptor positive) breast cancer is often curable, and we need to continue down this line of research to design therapy strategies that provide a positive patient outcome that lasts,"" Bild said. ""I recommend that, when possible, clinicians continue to collect tumor biopsies so we can measure cancer cell responses during treatment to understand how the patient's tumors are responding. In addition, we need to look at RNA changes and not just DNA modifications, as these changes may more broadly capture resistance mechanisms.""She added, ""I am grateful to patients who participate in clinical trials so that scientists can continue to find better ways to treat this disease.""Reference: Griffiths JI, Chen J, Cosgrove PA, et al.

An outbreak of Ebola, for which treatment options are extremely limited, occurred earlier this year in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In common with viruses such as the Hendra and rabies viruses, Ebola infects humans from animals, with bats thought to be the natural hosts. The research team, led by Dr Greg Moseley and Dr Angela Harrison from the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, in collaboration with researchers at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP, CSIRO) found that Ebola virus can block the function of the STAT3 protein, a critical  messenger  protein that transmits signals within our cells important to regulating host immune and inflammatory responses against infections. Importantly, using infections with pathogenic virus under the highest biocontainment level (BSL4) together with gene expression analysis and quantitative single cell imaging, the research team have discovered that STAT3 activity is antiviral toward Ebola virus, but that Ebola virus uses a protein called VP24 to target and disable STAT3 s messenger function through at least two different strategies, including binding to STAT3 protein complexes. The findings were published today in the journal PLOS Pathogens. The elucidation of this entirely new way for Ebola virus to disarm immune responses may provide new targets that can be used in research towards developing new anti-virals that prevent Ebola virus, and possibly other viruses, from interfering with the infected person s antiviral system, allowing them to fight off the disease, according to Dr Moseley.  This shows us that Ebola virus uses more tricks to evade and dysregulate the immune system than we previously thought, and highlights the expanding importance of targeting of STAT3 by viruses. Understanding this process gives us new potential targets that might contribute to developing therapies that block the ability of Ebola and other viruses to shut down the immune response,  he said. Importantly the STAT3 pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of many other diseases, including cancers. Dr Moseley believes that understanding how Ebola virus and other viruses specifically target and modify STAT3 could also provide new directions for the development of therapeutics for diseases such as cancer.ReferenceHarrison AR et al.

They demonstrated the approach by generating nanobodies that neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 virus more potently than an antibody isolated from an infected patient and a nanobody isolated from an immunized animal.Nanobodies are small antibody fragments which bind strongly to their target molecules and block their functions. Currently, antibody and nanobody discovery involves selecting initial lead antibody candidates, followed by time- and labor-intensive modifications to make them suitable for therapeutic applications, said Jennifer Zupancic, doctoral candidate in chemical engineering and co-first author, with Alec Desai, doctoral candidate in chemical engineering. The study is in Cell Chemical Biology. A key advantage to this method, both in terms of addressing pandemics and nanobody development more generally, is the ability to select nanobodies that bind strongly more rapidly than with current methods,  said Zupancic. This unexpected discovery appears to be a key step toward addressing a long-standing challenge in the field, namely the rapid and simple generation of high-affinity agents (agents that bind strongly) such as nanobodies, without the need for extensive screening and optimization,  said Peter Tessier, the Albert M. Mattocks Professor in Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chemical Engineering, and senior author. He s also a member of the U-M Biointerfaces Institute,Nanobodies and antibodies bind to their targets via multiple flexible binding loops called the complementarity-determining regions. Researchers discovered that one or more of the individual binding loops from different lead nanobodies could be combined into single nanobody mutants with improved properties, Zupancic said. That process is called complementarity-determining region swapping. This process of CDR swapping resulted in substantial changes to the nanobodies we initially started out to modify,  she said.  It was surprising to us that such large changes not only did not hinder the nanobodies  ability to bind and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but actually greatly improved it. Researchers discovered the method accidentally, but found and reported that the technique is simple to perform in a systematic manner.Generally, approved antibody drugs must demonstrate drug-like properties, including high stability, specificity and solubility, and must also bind strongly to their target. Often, there are tradeoffs between these properties, which frustrate therapeutic antibody development. However, we observe that our nanobodies have drug-like properties and also bind to and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus strongly,  she said.The new method likely can be used to develop nanobodies against other viruses and disease targets. That work is ongoing in the lab now, Zupancic said.Reference: Zupancic JM, Desai AA, Schardt JS, et al.

Those simulations are then used to model the impact of therapies and interventions.The international research, led by the University of Leeds and reported today (23 June) in the journal Nature Communications, investigated whether an in-silico trial could replicate the results of three, real-life clinical trials that assessed the effectiveness of a device called a flow diverter, used in the treatment of brain aneurysms, a disease where the wall of a blood vessel weakens and begins to bulge.

It is used as an easily identifiable marker in genetic experiments using fruit flies since any defects arising from mutations in the gene are assumed to be mild enough not to greatly impact other aspects of biology under investigation.Now, working with fruit flies, a team led by developmental cell biologist Sa Kan Yoo of the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research has found a previously unsuspected role of the gene it also drives aging-related defects in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) through changes in the metabolism of nutrients.An analogous gene is expressed in the human gut, where it could be contributing to the development of colorectal cancer, one of the most common tumor types in the world.More immediately, the findings could have major implications for the large community of researchers who study fruit flies if white contributes substantially to gut metabolism, then that could skew results in studies related to physiology, energetics and behavior where it is used as a genetic marker.  I predict our study will have a huge impact on the fly-research community, especially scientists using fruit flies to investigate metabolism,  says Yoo.Yoo s team stumbled upon the link between white and ISC function in a routine screen of flies from various genetic backgrounds. While looking for differences in stem-cell proliferation induced by aging, they found that flies with white mutations stood out from the rest. In those flies, levels of white expression in ISCs went up as the insects got older. With more of the corresponding protein, the stem cells took in more tetrahydrofolate, a derivative of vitamin B9 that helps fuel the kind of runaway cell growth that, in humans at least, tends to bring about colon polyps and eventually cancer.Genetically blocking white activity in ISCs prevented this kind of cellular dysregulation and increased the lifespan of flies. If a similar phenomenon occurs in human ISCs and Yoo emphasizes that further investigation is still needed drugs that inhibit the process could help to maintain gut health and prevent cancer from taking root.Reference: Sasaki A, Nishimura T, Takano T, Naito S, Yoo SK. white regulates proliferative homeostasis of intestinal stem cells during ageing in Drosophila.

Andrea Hobkirk and her team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to understand how the brain's reward areas react to e-cigarette aerosol with and without flavor.""There are nearly 12 million e-cigarette users in the United States,"" Hobkirk, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral health at Penn State College of Medicine, said. ""The vast majority use e-cigarettes with menthol, mint, fruity and dessert-type flavors. Although regulations that limit the sale of flavored e-cigarettes may help curb use among youth, they might also stop adults from using e-cigarettes as a smoking reduction or cessation aid. We are trying to understand how flavor influences e-cigarette reward and satisfaction for smokers and the risk of nicotine addiction for non-smokers.""The team first developed a device to deliver e-cigarette aerosols during brain scanning. Next, the research team used this new device to deliver aerosols containing a low dose of nicotine to nine adult female smokers during a single laboratory visit. One aerosol had a strawberry-vanilla flavor, and the other aerosol was flavorless. The team compared the strength of brain activation and reward brain region involvement between flavored and unflavored aerosols.""For our study, we were interested in looking first at, for smokers, how flavor might affect their response to nicotine e-cigarettes,"" Hobkirk said. ""We recruited smokers who had never used e-cigarettes before or were not regular e-cigarette users. What we were interested in is figuring out whether or not flavor changed how they perceived or how their brain responded to this e-cigarette use.""The researchers found that the strawberry-vanilla aerosol engaged the brain's taste region. In contrast, the unflavored aerosol engaged the brain's reward region, similar to observations during cigarette smoking. The researchers published their results in the journal Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology.The researchers also assessed patterns of neural activity between brain regions. Stronger connectivity between two brain regions typically means that these regions are working together. They found that key brain reward regions were strongly connected with flavored aerosol and not unflavored.The findings suggest that, for smokers, unflavored e-cigarettes may mimic the typical smoking experience more than flavored e-cigarettes.""We found that for smokers who had never really used e-cigarettes before, the flavor did not make the experience more rewarding for them, at least in terms of what we saw in the brain,"" Hobkirk said. ""It did not make the experience of breathing in these aerosols more like a smoking experience. Typically, that's what smokers are looking for when they're trying to transition over to a healthier product. They want something that gives all the similar rewarding and sensory-motor effects of their regular combustible cigarette, but without all the harmful effects that come in the toxins of a cigarette. We found that adding flavor doesn't necessarily do that for these smokers, at least what we saw in their response to them in the brain. This could suggest that, potentially, smokers do not necessarily need these flavors to make the transition from a combustible cigarette to an e-cigarette.""Reference: Hobkirk AL, Houser KR, Hoglen B, et al.

Chan School of Public Health and MIT researchers.Using this biostatistical methodology, the researchers pinpointed a mutation in the variant known as P.1, or Gamma, as being linked to increased mortality and, potentially, greater transmissibility, higher infection rates, and increased pathogenicity before the P.1 variant had been identified.The team's methodology is described online on June 23, 2021 in the journal Genetic Epidemiology.""Based on our experience, GWAS methodology might provide suitable tools that could be used to analyze potential links between mutations at specific locations in viral genomes and disease outcome,"" said Christoph Lange, professor of biostatistics at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the paper. ""This could enable better real-time detection of novel, deleterious variants/new viral strains in pandemics.""The first patients in Brazil with the P.1 variant were documented in January 2021 and within a few weeks the variant caused a spike in cases in Manaus, Brazil. The city had already been hard hit by the pandemic in May 2020, and researchers thought that the city's residents had achieved population immunity because so many people in the area had developed antibodies for the virus during that initial wave. Instead, P.1, which has several mutations in the spike protein the virus uses to attach to and invade a host cell, caused a second wave of infections and seemed to have higher transmissibility and be more likely to cause death than the earlier variants seen in the area.In September 2020, several months before the first P.1 patient was documented, the Harvard Chan School and MIT team repurposed methodology used in GWAS, which are widely used to link certain genetic variations with specific diseases, to tease apart the relative pathogenicity of various SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The team looked for links between each mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's single-stranded RNA and mortality in 7,548 COVID-19 patients. Data for the study came from the global initiative on sharing avian influenza data (GISAID) database, which contains the genetic sequence and related clinical and epidemiological data associated with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.The researchers found one mutation--at locus 25,088bp in the virus's genome--that alters the spike protein and was linked to a significant increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients. The team flagged the variant with this mutation, which was later identified as part of P.1.The team's biostatistical methodology should have broader applications beyond the P.1 variant and SARS-CoV-2, according to the researchers.""We expect that this approach would work in similar scenarios involving other diseases, provided the quality of the data collected in public databases is sufficiently high,"" said Georg Hahn, research associate and instructor of biostatistics at Harvard Chan School and co-first author of the paper.Reference: Hahn G, Wu CM, Lee S, et al.

Researchers will measure the development and durability of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in people vaccinated during pregnancy or the first two postpartum months. Researchers also will assess vaccine safety and evaluate the transfer of vaccine-induced antibodies to infants across the placenta and through breast milk.The study, called MOMI-VAX, is sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. MOMI-VAX is conducted by the NIAID-funded Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC).

Fauci, M.D.,  The results of this study will fill gaps in our knowledge and help inform policy recommendations and personal decision-making on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Pregnant people with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized, be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, and die from the illness than their non-pregnant peers. Severe COVID-19 during pregnancy also may put the infant at risk for complications such as preterm birth. Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding can choose to receive(link is external) authorized COVID-19 vaccines, and studies to gather safety data in these populations are ongoing. So far, COVID-19 vaccines appear to be safe in these populations. The NIAID study will build on these studies by improving the understanding of antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines among pregnant and postpartum people and the transfer of antibodies to their infants during pregnancy or through breast milk. Experience with other diseases suggests that the transfer of vaccine-induced antibodies from mother to baby could help protect newborns and infants from COVID-19 during early life.Investigators will enroll up to 750 pregnant individuals and 250 postpartum individuals within two months of delivery who have received or will receive any COVID-19 vaccine authorized or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Their infants also will be enrolled in the study. Vaccines are not provided to participants as part of the study protocol. Currently, three COVID-19 vaccines are available in the United States under emergency use authorization: the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines and the Johnson & Johnson adenoviral vector vaccine. The study is designed to assess up to five types of FDA-licensed or authorized COVID-19 vaccines, should additional options become available.Participants and their infants will be followed through the first year after delivery. To assess the development and durability of vaccine-induced antibodies overall and by vaccine type and vaccine platform, researchers will analyze blood samples collected from pregnant and postpartum participants. These samples will be collected at study enrollment; at delivery for participants who enrolled during pregnancy; and two, six, and 12 months after delivery. Pregnant participants enrolled in the study prior to receiving the vaccine will have blood drawn at enrollment as well as approximately one month after vaccination. To assess transfer of antibodies through the placenta and the levels and durability of antibodies in infants, researchers will perform antibody testing on samples from umbilical cord blood collected at delivery and blood samples collected from infants two and six months after delivery.Investigators also will assess the potential effects on maternal immune responses and transfer of antibodies across the placenta according to the mother s age, the trimester of pregnancy during which the vaccine was received, the mother s health, and the mother s COVID-19 risk status. Additionally, mothers will have the option of providing breast milk samples at approximately two weeks, two months, six months, and 12 months after delivery. The investigators will evaluate breast milk antibodies to assess the potential for protection against COVID-19 in breastfed infants.

However, only a few locations have large enough deposits worth mining, resulting in global supply chain tensions. So, there's a push toward recycling them from non-traditional sources, such as waste from burning coal -- fly ash. Now, researchers in ACS' Environmental Science & Technology report a simple method for recovering these elements from coal fly ash using an ionic liquid.While rare-earth elements aren't as scarce as their name implies, major reserves are either in politically sensitive locations, or they are widely dispersed, which makes mining them challenging. So, to ensure their supply, some people have turned to processing other enriched resources. For instance, the ash byproduct from coal-fired power plants has similar elemental concentrations to raw ores. Yet, current methods to extract these precious materials from coal fly ash are hazardous and require several purification steps to get a usable product. A potential solution could be ionic liquids, which are considered to be environmentally benign and are reusable. One in particular, betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide or [Hbet][Tf2N], selectively dissolves rare-earth oxides over other metal oxides. This ionic liquid also uniquely dissolves into water when heated and then separates into two phases when cooled. So, Ching-Hua Huang, Laura Stoy and colleagues at Georgia Tech wanted to see if it would efficiently and preferentially pull the desired elements out of coal fly ash and whether it could be effectively cleaned, creating a process that is safe and generates little waste.The researchers pretreated coal fly with an alkaline solution and dried it. Then, they heated ash suspended in water with [Hbet][Tf2N], creating a single phase. When cooled, the solutions separated. The ionic liquid extracted more than 77% of the rare-earth elements from fresh material, and it extracted an even higher percentage (97%) from weathered ash that had spent years in a storage pond. Finally, rare-earth elements were stripped from the ionic liquid with dilute acid. The researchers found that adding betaine during the leaching step increased the amounts of rare-earth elements extracted. The team tested the ionic liquid's reusability by rinsing it with cold water to remove excess acid, finding no change in its extraction efficiency through three leaching-cleaning cycles. The researchers say that this low-waste approach produces a solution rich in rare-earth elements, with limited impurities, and could be used to recycle precious materials from the abundance of coal fly ash held in storage ponds.Reference: Stoy L, Diaz V, Huang C-H.

Aside from being tasty, this combination might also help people take up more of the  superfruit s  nutrients, such as anthocyanins. Researchers reporting in ACS  Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry show that  -casein, a protein found in cow s milk, helped rats absorb more blueberry anthocyanins and their byproducts, boosting accessibility to these good-for-you nutrients.In studies, anthocyanins have been shown to have antioxidant properties, lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of developing some cancers. However, only small amounts of these nutrients are absorbed from blueberries during digestion, despite their abundance in the fruit. Previous researchers have reported that consuming foods with ingredients such as citrus pectin, capcasin, capsicate and some proteins improve the uptake of anthocyanins. For instance, Bin Li and colleagues found that  -casein and  -casein proteins from cow s milk protected blueberry anthocyanins in simulated digestion experiments. Now, this team wanted to see whether  -casein could help increase the absorption of blueberry anthocyanins in vivo. The researchers fed rats purified blueberry anthocyanin extracts, adding  -casein to the solution given to one group of rats. During the next 24 hours, anthocyanin and metabolite concentrations were 1.5 to 10.1 times higher in the  -casein group than in the control rats. When examining  -casein s molecular structure, the researchers observed that its amino acids allowed it to interact with and encapsulate the anthocyanin molecules, improving their stability in the intestines and allowing for better transport into the bloodstream. While the  -casein protein used in these experiments was derived and purified from milk, the results may not be the same for whole milk because its fats and sugars could impact absorption, the researchers explain. They say their next step is to conduct similar tests with human subjects.ReferenceLang Y et al.

However, many groups have limited access to this technology due to its cost and fragility. Now, researchers from the Universities of G ttingen and M nster have succeeded in building a high-resolution microscope using nothing more than children s plastic building bricks and affordable parts from a mobile phone. They then went on to show that children aged 9-13 had significantly increased understanding of microscopy after constructing and working with the LEGO  microscope. Their results were published in The Biophysicist.The researchers designed a fully functional, high-resolution microscope with capabilities close to a modern research microscope. Apart from the optics, all parts were from the toy brick system. The team realized that the lenses in modern smartphone cameras, which cost around  4 each, are of such high quality that they can make it possible to resolve even individual cells. The scientists produced instructions for building the microscope as well as a step-by-step tutorial to guide people through the construction process whilst learning about the relevant optical characteristics of a microscope. The researchers measured children s understanding through questionnaires given to a group of 9-13 year olds. The researchers found that children given the parts and plans to construct the microscope themselves significantly increased their knowledge of microscopy. For this particular study, the researchers, whose day-to-day research focusses on fundamental biophysical processes, benefitted from the input and enthusiasm of their 10-year-old co-author.  An understanding of science is crucial for decision-making and brings many benefits in everyday life, such as problem-solving and creativity,  says Professor Timo Betz, University of G ttingen.  Yet we find that many people, even politicians, feel excluded or do not have the opportunities to engage in scientific or critical thinking. We wanted to find a way to nurture natural curiosity, help people grasp fundamental principles and see the potential of science.  The researchers stayed in contact with the children and monitored their progress: after they had constructed the main parts, they discovered that the lenses can act as magnifying glasses. After exploring this, and realizing that a good light source was important, they initially found it tricky to align two magnifying glasses. However, once they had achieved this, the lenses generated tremendous magnification. This enabled the children to literally  play  with the microscope: make their own adaptations; explore how the magnification works; and discover the exciting world of the micro-cosmos for themselves.  We hope that this modular microscope will be used in classrooms and homes all over the world to excite and inspire children about science,  continues Betz.  We have shown that scientific research does not need to be separate from everyday life. It can be enlightening, educational and fun! ReferenceTimo Betz et al,.

Research teams at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine have a new strategy to attack it.Chemist Han Xiao at Rice and biologist Xiang Zhang at Baylor and their labs have developed an antibody conjugate called BonTarg that delivers drugs to bone tumors and inhibits metastasis.Their open-access study, which appears in Science Advances, shows how Xiao's pClick technology can be used to link bone-targeting antibodies and therapeutic molecules.In experiments, they used pClick to couple a molecule used to treat osteoporosis, alendronate, with the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab used to treat breast cancer and found it significantly enhanced the concentration of the antibody at tumor sites.They reported the combination also inhibited secondary metastasis from infected organs seeded by bone tumors.""Bone cancer is really challenging to treat, and clinical trials of different treatments have been disappointing for people with bone metastasis,"" said Xiao, who joined Rice in 2017 with funding from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). ""We feel our strategy is a real game changer.""""Getting effective concentrations of drugs to bone tumors has been challenging because bones are hard, their networks of blood vessels is limited and drugs have tended to attach to adjacent healthy tissues,"" Zhang said.The new strategy employs bisphosphonates, a class of drugs typically used to treat osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates have a high binding affinity for hydroxyapatite, the main component of hard bone, and help overcome physical and biological barriers in the bone microenvironment.They're also amenable to binding with drugs through pClick, which uses a cross-linker to snap to specific sites on antibodies without having to re-engineer them with harmful chemicals, enzymes or ultraviolet light.The result is a molecule that seeks out bone tumors and stays put, giving the drug time to kill tumor cells. It helps that bisphosphonate molecules prefer acidic sites like bone tumors, keeping the drug concentration higher there than in surrounding healthy tissue.The researchers chose breast cancer drugs because while many recover from the disease, 20 to 40% of breast cancer survivors eventually suffer metastases to distant organs, with metastasis to bone occurring in about 70% of these cases, significantly increasing mortality, they said.While chemotherapy, hormone and radiation therapy used to treat women with bone metastatic breast cancers can shrink or slow bone metastasis, they usually do not eliminate the metastases, Xiao said.""Bone is kind of a fertile soil for cancer cell,"" Xiao said. ""If a cancer cell reaches it, then it has a really good chance to grow and to further migrate, for example to the brain, the heart, the liver or to other tissues. That's a really bad situation for a patient.""Xiao hopes to get the compound into a clinical trial, and sees potential for custom conjugates that treat other tumors prone to metastasis, including prostate cancer.Reference: Tian Z, Wu L, Yu C, et al.

The new research is published in Cell.The billions of organisms living on body surfaces such as the skin of mammals   collectively called microbiota   communicate with each other and the host immune system in a sophisticated network. According to the study, viruses integrated in the host genome, remnants of previous infections called endogenous retroviruses, can control how the host immune system and the microbiota interact, affecting tissue repair and antimicrobial defenses. Endogenous retroviruses  can comprise up to 10% of all genes. The newly discovered role of endogenous retroviruses adds to the scientific community s understanding of certain diseases and inflammatory states and opens new research avenues.  Together, our results support the idea that mammals may have co-opted their endogenous viromes as a means to communicate with their microbiota, resulting in a multi-kingdom dialogue that controls both immunity and inflammation,  the authors state. Scientists from NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases led the project with collaborators from the NIH Center for Human Immunology, the National Cancer Institute, Stanford University and Scripps Research in California, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, University of Oxford and The Francis Crick Institute in England. Building on a series of studies over the past decade showing that microbiota broadly promote immune protection, the NIAID scientists and collaborators sought to discover how this occurs. They used Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common skin bacterium with known helpful and harmful features, as a study model in laboratory and mouse experiments. The models helped them identify the important roles of skin cells called keratinocytes and of endogenous retroviruses in communication between microbiota and the skin immune system. Keratinocytes are the primary interface between the host and its microbiota. Their study showed that S. epidermidis triggered an antiviral response in keratinocytes, and that finding led them to discover that endogenous retroviruses coordinate responses to the microbiota that stimulate the immune system. The mouse model also showed that a high-fat diet triggers an inflammatory immune response to S. epidermidis that can be controlled by providing antiretroviral treatment, suggesting a role for endogenous retroviruses in driving inflammatory responses caused by microbes under high-fat conditions. The researchers will continue exploring how these ancient viruses control the beneficial role of the microbiota and how nutrition can change this dialogue toward pro-inflammatory responses.ReferenceLima-Junior DS et al.

The findings confirm that these cancers have their origin in specific forms of developmental cells present in the maturing fetus.The study, published today (23 June) in Nature Communications, used computational methods to analyse existing datasets and pinpoint the 'cellular signals' given off by different cancers as they emerge. This method holds promise as a tool for diagnosing patients with rare cancers - in the study, one patient's cryptic kidney cancer was identified as a Wilms-like tumour by looking at its cellular signals.All cancers are derived from normal cells that have started to multiply uncontrollably. By comparing patterns of gene expression in cancer and normal cells, it is possible to learn about aspects of each tumour's origin and behaviour. This type of analysis has been made possible by the advent of single-cell mRNA sequencing, a high-resolution technology that can identify different cell types present in a tissue according to the genes expressed by individual cells.Previous studies have used these techniques to compare normal and diseased tissue in some of the most common kidney cancers, but to conduct single-cell sequencing on many hundreds of tumours would not be achievable.In this study, researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and their collaborators turned to computational techniques to mine Human Cell Atlas (HCA) reference data* and databases of tumour gene expression. They assessed mRNA signals in 1,300 childhood and adult renal tumours, spanning seven different tumour types, in order to investigate the origins of these cancers**.The results confirmed that these childhood cancers are developmental in origin, occurring after errors in a particular developmental cell type's journey to maturity. In contrast, adult kidney cancers emerged from mature cell types and do not revert to a developmental pattern of gene expression in the vast majority of cases.Each cancer type was also found to exhibit unique 'cellular signals', or patterns of gene expression, that could be used to classify them in future.Dr Matthew Young, first author of the study from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""It has long been assumed that childhood tumours have 'fetal' origins. Now we can replace that loose definition with a precise, quantitative measurement of the cellular signals that different tumour types exhibit. Our analysis also refutes the theory that adult tumours revert to a developmental state, unless they are a highly lethal subtype of adult kidney cancer.""The study sheds light on the behaviour and origins of some kidney tumour subtypes whose rarity would have made it difficult to examine otherwise. These were congenital mesoblastic nephroma, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.The method pioneered in the study also helped to classify one patient's tumour, which clinicians had been unable to diagnose fully.Dr Karin Straathof, a senior author of the study from Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ""Sometimes it is not possible to fully diagnose childhood kidney cancers via the usual methods, which can impact our ability to adopt the best course of treatment. One of the samples used in this study was from a child with one of these undiagnosed tumours. But by analysing the genes expressed by the tumour cells, we were able to recognise it as Wilms' tumour. My hope is that this approach can be used in such cases in future.""In recent studies, researchers have identified the origins of individual childhood cancers, such as neuroblastoma, using mRNA single-cell sequencing on small numbers of tumours. Here, computational analysis of existing data has been used to determine the origin of a larger groups of childhood cancers.Dr Sam Behjati, a senior author of the study from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""Not only does this computational approach using existing datasets validate previous results on the origins of childhood kidney cancers, it provides a new way of expanding this research to much larger numbers of tumours and rare cancer types. I believe that the success of this approach could act as a blueprint for investigating the behaviour and origins of the entire spectrum of human cancer.""Reference: Young MD, Mitchell TJ, Custers L, et al.

His Dresden colleague, Dr. Hayder Amin, remarked: ""The existing methodology is a fundamental shortfall. The human brain is tremendously complex and cannot be modeled adequately by the current methodologies used in the laboratory. They are too reductionist to reveal the true effect of a drug on neuronal networks. In particular, two-dimensional cell cultures and conventional data acquisition methods do not capture the complicated electrophysiological and cellular properties of the brain.""

They change over time as pressures from the environment cause individuals with certain traits to become more common in a population while those with other traits become less common.Cancer is no different. Within a growing tumor, cancer cells with the best ability to compete for resources and withstand environmental stressors will come to dominate in frequency. It's ""survival of the fittest"" on a microscopic scale.But fitness -- how well suited any particular individual is to its environment -- isn't set in stone; it can change when the environment changes. The cancer cells that might do best in an environment saturated with chemotherapy drugs are likely to be different than the ones that will thrive in an environment without those drugs. So, predicting how tumors will evolve over time, especially in response to treatment, is a major challenge for scientists.A new study by researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering in collaboration with researchers at the University of British Columbia/BC Cancer in Canada suggests that one day it may be possible to make those predictions. The study, published June 23, 2021, in the journal Nature, was led by MSK computational biologist Sohrab Shah and BC Cancer breast cancer researcher Samuel Aparicio. The scientists showed that a machine-learning approach, built using principles of population genetics that describe how populations change over time, could accurately predict how human breast cancer tumors will evolve.""Population genetic models of evolution match up nicely to cancer, but for a number of practical reasons it's been a challenge to apply these to the evolution of real human cancers,"" says Dr. Shah, Chief of Computational Oncology at MSK. ""In this study, we show it's possible to overcome some of those barriers.""Ultimately, the approach could provide a means to predict whether a patient's tumor is likely to stop responding to a particular treatment and identify the cells that are likely to be responsible for a relapse.

Whereas an evening person struggles to get up in the morning and feels more productive in the evening.Researchers from the University of Warwick with colleagues from the University of Tartu have recently had the paper, 'Personality Traits Relate to Chronotype at Both the Phenotypic and Genetic Level' published in the Journal of Personality, in which they have analysed the relationship between sleep timing (chronotype), preference to the morning/evening, and personality traits at a phenotypic and genetic level.Ultimately the researchers have found that the relationship between personality and morningness-eveningness is partly due to genetic factors.Using a large-scale sample of participants form the Estonian Biobank researchers asked them to answer questionnaires about their sleep timings and personality, personality was also assessed by someone who knew the participant well. Once answered researchers were able to identify the phenotypic relationships between the sleep and personality.However they were also able to calculate the genetic correlations through summary statistics of large genome-wide association studies of personality and sleep preferences.Personalities can be divided into three hierarchies: personality domains, facets and items, researchers analysed all three, but in particular they found on a domain level that people high in Conscientiousness and low in Openness were associated with being earlier chronotypes (i.e., they went to bed and got out of bed earlier).On a facet level, researchers found that less straightforward (a facet of Agreeableness) and excitement-seeking (a facet of Extraversion), yet more self-disciplined (a facet of Conscientiousness) people were more likely to have earlier chronotypes. Higher Conscientiousness and lower Openness were also genetically related to preference for morningness.Postgraduate researcher Dr Anita Lenneis, from the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick comments:""Our findings have helped us to come up with two possible pathways of how personality might influence chronotype. Personality traits such as Conscientiousness and C5: Self-discipline in particular may influence chronotype through shaping people's preferences for various social activities and behaviours which in turn, may influence what time people go to and get out of bed, or personality may influence chronotype is through active decisions people make regarding their sleep.""However, it could also be that chronotype influences personality or that chronotype and personality mutually influence each other. The findings of the genetic correlations support this view but further studies will be necessary to better understand the shared genetic mechanisms between the two constructs as well as the causality of their relationships.""Professor Anu Realo, from the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick adds:""Not only have we shown there is a relationship between chronotype, personality and partially your genes, our findings also suggest that it might be possible to change your chronotype or at least train yourself into a different more socially convenient sleep pattern by increasing your self-control. Ideally work hours would be adapted to your chronotype, but if not, evening people who typically experience worse health could learn to go to bed at earlier hours which might also accelerate the release of melatonin. Melatonin is also influenced by artificial light, so regularly turning off the lights at earlier hours might also lead to falling asleep at earlier hours of the evening. However, future studies will need to investigate whether such interventions to enhance self-control would result in a permanent change or would indeed promote better health in later chronotypes.""Reference: Lenneis A, Vainik U, Teder-Laving M, et al.

However, the studies also suggest that identifying fake news with artificial intelligence may be even more complicated than anticipated, said S. Shyam Sundar, James P. Jimirro Professor of Media Effects in the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications and co-director of the Media Effects Research Laboratory.""One of the ideas in fake news research is that if we can just solve the clickbait problem, we can get closer to solving the fake news problem,"" said Sundar, who also is an affiliate of Penn State's Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS). ""Our studies push back on that a little bit. They suggest that fake news might be a completely different ballgame, and that clickbait is itself more complicated than we thought.""In the first study, the research team randomly assigned 150 participants to read one of eight different types of headlines and measured if the participants would then read or share the story. The participants read either a traditional headline, or a headline that relied on one of the seven types of clickbait features, including headlines with questions, lists, ""Wh"" words (i.e., what, when), demonstrative adjectives (i.e., this, that), positive superlatives (i.e., best, greatest), negative superlatives (i.e., worst, least), or modals (i.e., could, should). The headlines were taken from both reliable and unreliable online sources and classified using algorithms developed to detect clickbait.""One of the questions we had initially was, which of those clickbait features would attract more clicks?"" said Maria Molina, assistant professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State, who is the lead author of the study. ""We wanted to explore that more in depth, but when we analyzed the results, we realized there were no significant differences, and, if anything, people were more attracted to non-clickbait headlines. So, from there, we figured there might be some reasons why this might have happened.""The researchers conducted a second study to make sure that other factors such as the subject matter of each headline, were not confusing the results, according to Molina.In this study, the researchers recruited 249 participants, who were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions -- seven clickbait headlines and one non-clickbait headline. This time, all headlines focused on a single political topic and were written by a former journalist. Again, the team reported that the clickbait headlines did not dramatically outperform the traditional headline.According to Dongwon Lee, professor of information sciences and technology at Penn State, the team conducted a third study to examine several types of AI, or machine-learning models, that were used in the study to classify headlines as either clickbait headlines or not. They found that the models frequently disagreed about whether the headline was clickbait or not.The study found that the four AI models agreed on the classification of clickbait only 47% of the time. Of the 175 headlines that were classified to be similar by the four algorithms, 139 were identified as clickbait and 36 were non-clickbait. The level of agreement between the systems also varied based on the type of headline. For example, while the four algorithms agreed on the clickbait classification more times for the negative superlative characteristic, compared to the other six characteristics, the four classifiers failed to agree on a non-clickbait classification for the negative superlative or question characteristics.Performance of AI and machine learning models tends to vary, said Lee, who is an ICDS affiliate. When the headlines classified by each model were assessed against the number of clicks, three of the four models consistently showed that demonstrative adjectives, lists and ""wh"" words attracted more engagement from readers than non-clickbait headlines.""As these machine learning models are the product of the past several decades, we have many variations -- some are very simple, some run very fast, yet others are more complicated and require a lot of resources,"" said Lee. ""It is like when you assemble a desk -- you can do the job with a screwdriver that costs $5, but can probably do the job faster with a power drill costing $50. So, depending on the inherent power of these machine-learning models, and the training dataset the models are given, they tended to have different levels of performance and varying pros/cons.""However, these findings raise doubts about using AI to detect fake news by classifying the headlines alone.""People were putting a lot of stock into using clickbait headlines as an element for fake news detection algorithms, but our studies are calling this assumption into question,"" said Sundar.He added that the studies also suggest that programmers who develop algorithms to detect fake news may have to continually adapt as human fake news producers -- and media consumers -- become savvy to the elements that make up fake news.""It becomes a bit of a cat and mouse game,"" said Sundar. ""The people who write fake news may become aware of the characteristics that are identified as fake news by the detectors and they will change their strategies. News consumers may also just become numb to certain characteristics if they see those headlines all the time. So, fake news detection must constantly evolve with the readers as well as the creators.""The researchers suggested that the popularity of clickbait headlines in the past might be a reason for the failure of the headlines to engage readers in their studies. Clickbait could be so ubiquitous in today's media that they fail to stand out and attract the same attention as traditional headlines.The popularity of clickbait also brought more media scrutiny, which may have made participants in the study more wary of clickbait headlines, added Molina.Reference: D.

The team followed 69 primarily African American females, ages 50 to 85, who complained that their cognitive ability was worsening though clinical assessments showed no impairments. Three magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) at 18-month intervals showed significant changes in functional connectivity in two areas of the brain.""An older adult's perceived cognitive decline could be an important precursor to dementia,"" Damoiseaux said. ""Brain alterations that underlie the experience of decline could reflect the progression of incipient dementia and may emerge before cognitive assessment is sensitive enough to detect a deficit.""The resulting paper, ""Longitudinal change in hippocampal and dorsal anterior insulae functional connectivity in subjective cognitive decline,"" appeared in the May 31 issue of Alzheimer's Research & Therapy. Damoiseaux conducted the study with graduate student Raymond Viviano, Ph.D., who is first author.Subjective cognitive decline, defined as a perceived worsening of cognitive ability not noted on clinical assessment, may be an early indicator of dementia. Previous cross-sectional research has demonstrated aberrant brain functional connectivity in subjective cognitive decline, but longitudinal evaluation has been limited.Viviano and Damoiseaux's three-year study found that persons reporting more subjective cognitive decline showed a larger decrease in connectivity between components of the default mode network and a larger increase in connectivity between salience and default mode network components. The functional connectivity changed in the absence of a change in cognitive performance.Since these brain changes occurred without concomitant cognitive changes, they could indicate that brain changes underlie the perception of decline. These changes could be a sensitive marker for nascent dementia months or years before assessments detect any cognitive deficit.Reference: Viviano RP, Damoiseaux JS.

The study titled, ""Direct activation of the proton channel by albumin leads to human sperm capacitation and sustained release of inflammatory mediators by neutrophils,"" was published today in Nature Communications.Researchers examined the physiological connection between Alb and human voltage-gated proton channels (hHv1), which are both essential to cell biology in health and diseases. They also demonstrated the mechanism by which Alb binds directly to hHv1 to activate the channel. This research explains how sperm are triggered to fertilize, and neutrophils are stimulated to release mediators in the innate immune response, describing a new role for Alb in physiology that will operate in the many tissues expressing hHv1.""We found that the interaction of Alb and hHv1 activates sperm when they leave semen and enter the female reproductive tract because Alb is low in semen and high in the reproductive tract. We now understand why albumin supplementation improves IVF,"" said first author Ruiming Zhao, PhD, from the Department of Physiology & Biophysics at UCI School of Medicine. ""We also found the same Alb/hHv1 interaction allows the white blood cells called neutrophils to produce and secrete the inflammatory mediators that kill bacteria and fight infection. However, it's important to note that the inflammatory response itself can lead to disease.""The essential stimulatory role of Alb in the physiology of sperm and neutrophils via hHv1 suggests that Alb will have as-yet unrecognized enhancing or deleterious roles in the other tissues, including the central nervous system, heart and lungs, and will influence cancers of the breast and gastrointestinal tract.""It is exciting to discover that a common protein has the power to activate the proton channel. This finding suggests new strategies to block or enhance fertility, and to augment or suppress the innate immune response and inflammation,"" said senior author Steve A. N. Goldstein, MD, PhD, vice chancellor of Health Affairs at UCI and distinguished professor in the School of Medicine Departments of Pediatrics and Physiology & Biophysics, and in the new School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.hHv1 is implicated in a wide range of biological processes in addition to the capacitation of sperm and the innate immune responses included in the study. The channels have notable roles in proliferation of cancer cells, tissue damage during ischemic stroke, and hypertensive injury of the kidney. Because Alb is ubiquitous at levels that vary in different human compartments in health and disease, the potentiation of hHv1 by Alb described in the paper will be widespread, tissue-dependent, and play both salutary and unfavorable roles in human physiology.""We have modeled the structural basis for binding of Alb to the channel that leads to activation and changes in cellular function, and we are now conducting in vivo studies of viral and bacterial infections. Our next steps include studies of the effects of inhibitors of the Alb-hHv1 interaction on infection, inflammation and fertility,"" said Goldstein.Reference: Zhao R, Dai H, Arias RJ, et al.

Now, researchers from Japan have solved the physics of Guinness' cascading flow, which will have widespread applications to technology in life and environmental sciences.In a study recently published in Physical Review E, researchers from Osaka University have revealed why the nitrogen bubbles of Guinness draught beer flow similarly to a fluid. The bubbles of many just-opened carbonated beverages simply move upwards, following Archimedes  principle. Much of the appeal of the draught from Guinness beer is that the bubbles sink and flow collectively, known as  bubble cascade.  Brewers and researchers believe this collective flow behavior must have something to do with how draught Guinness beer is dispensed. At present, the physics of the collective flow remains unresolved, something the researchers at Osaka University aimed to address. ""A wide range of lab work and computational simulations has been useful for estimating individual and collective bubble motion, but only after the flow has occurred,"" says lead and senior author of the study Tomoaki Watamura, Osaka University. ""We're interested in predicting cascading flow via mathematical modeling, rather than results from experiments or simulations after the fact."" To do this, the researchers used numerical simulations to approximate the fluid and bubble particles of cascading draught beer. Bench work experiments consisted of testing a transparent  pseudo-Guinness fluid,  which is a mixture of ultra-small hollow particles in tap water, and actual Guinness beer. ""The simulation results matched experimental data, over a wide range of glass sizes and other conditions,"" explains Watamura. ""We have developed the most successful simulation of cascading flow in Guinness beer to date."" Intriguingly, cascading bubbles may not require a nitrogenated stout beer after all. ""The bubble diameter and bubble volume fraction in carbonated water, poured into the approximate dimensions of a common 200-liter drum with inclination angle, facilitate cascading bubbles,"" says Hideyuki Wakabayashi, Kirin HD.  Furthermore, the associated fluid motion near an inclined container wall pertains to maintenance of product quality during brewing, suggesting an immediate application of our findings."" In addition to proving insight into optimizing brewing conditions, this research has clear applications to any work that involves fermenters or cell incubation. As such, the Osaka University and Kirin HD researchers' findings may be used to meet diverse needs, such as pharmaceutical production from industrial-scale cell cultures, and city water purification.ReferenceWatamura T, Sugiyama K, Yotsumoto Y, Suzuki M, Wakabayashi H.

It has existed since the 1960s and is today a standard method in materials science. But researchers at Link ping University have in an article in Scientific Reports been able to show that the method often gives incorrect results.Method criticism is a virtue in research, but here a couple of generations of researchers seem to miss being critical of a method with shortcomings that have actually been known from the beginning. For a long time, it also included our own research group. But now we hope that X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy will start to be used with greater thought, says Grzegorz Greczynski, senior lecturer at the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology at Link ping University. Together with Lars Hultman, professor at the same department, Grzegorz Greczynski has been able to state that the technology X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, also called XPS, can give misleading analyzes due to an incorrect calibration method. The results are published in the journal Scientific Reports.XPS is used to analyze the chemical composition of different materials. It is a standard method in materials science and is used in over 12,000 scientific articles annually. The technology was developed into a useful and powerful method for chemical analysis in the 1960s by Kai Siegbahn, professor at Uppsala University, which later awarded him the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics. The pioneering effort behind the Nobel Prize should not be questioned. When the technology was first developed, the error was comparatively small due to the more roughly calibrated spectrometers of the time. But due to the rapid development of spectroscopy and spread to several disciplines of science, the instruments have been improved to such an extent that the underlying error has become of decisive importance for future development, says Lars Hultman. According to the Link ping researchers, the original XPS method has been misused by a fatal assumption in a calibration method that uses the element carbon to calibrate the experiments. But it turns out that carbon-based chemical compounds, which naturally condense on most samples and are used for calibration, give rise to measurement signals that depend on the environment and the substrate to which they adhere. Therefore, there is no unique signal from carbon and large errors occur when a more or less arbitrary value is used as a reference to calibrate the measuring instrument.Already in the 1970s and 80s there was criticism of the calibration method, but for some reason it fell into oblivion and the method became standard. According to Lars Hultman, there are a number of different factors that interact for the errors to have gone unnoticed for almost 40 years. He believes, among other things, that the dramatic increase in magazines that came with the digital publishing opportunities comes into play as well as a lack of review. In addition to a rapidly growing number of researchers failing to be critical, there also seems to be a form of laxity among editors and reviewers of the scientific journals who agree to publish obviously unphysical interpretations of data. View from inside an XPS spectrometer. It can be likened to a perfect storm. There are probably the same type of problems with a lack of method criticism in several scientific disciplines, and it risks damaging the credibility of science in the long run, says Lars Hultman.Grzegorz Greczynski hopes that their discovery will partly lead to the further development of XPS technology and partly contribute to a more critical way of thinking in the research world.  Our experiments show that the calibration method, which is enormously popular, leads to contradictory results and should therefore be discontinued. There are various options that can provide more reliable measurement calibration, but they require more of the user and some need to be further refined. At the same time, it is important to encourage method-critical conversations in the lab, development department, or seminar, concludes Grzegorz Greczynski.ReferenceGreczynski G, Hultman L.

According to researchers, mercury content should be increasingly carefully investigated and monitored in fish and food webs, as the climate and land use change.Mercury is a heavy metal found in nature. Methylmercury, a particularly toxic form of the metal, accumulates in fish and is biomagnified in food webs. Humans are exposed to methylmercury especially through fish-based diets. Researchers investigated the joint effects of the climate and land use in Finnish Lapland. Intense land use, a warmer climate and increased precipitation increase the leaching of nutrients and carbon-bound mercury stored in the soil into waterways. The use of fossil fuels has also increased mercury levels in the environment.  Lapland is an important subject of research, since temperatures, precipitation and nutrient levels grow significantly when we move from the almost pristine lakes in the north towards the southern lakes which are more eutrophic and murkier. At the same time, land use in catchment areas is moving from reindeer herding to intensive forestry. Our research area has no direct sources of mercury emissions. Instead, the mercury found in the region originates in long-range atmospheric deposition and leaching from the catchment area soil,  says Professor of Environmental Research Kimmo Kahilainen from the University of Helsinki s Lammi Biological Station. The researchers found that the warmer and murkier the lake, the higher the mercury concentration in algae. This was reflected in the fish as well. Mercury content in vendace and roach living in warmer and eutrophic lakes was slightly higher compared to those living in pristine lakes, while the mercury content of perch and pike grew markedly.  Global warming and increasing precipitation, together with intensifying land use, increase leaching from catchment areas. In the future, mercury content in Lappish fish can indeed shift closer to the level found in subarctic lakes. As the climate and land use change, mercury concentration in fish and food webs should be increasingly carefully investigated and monitored,  Kahilainen says.ReferenceKozak N, Ahonen SA, Keva O, et al.

""This signaling module has a one-to-one relationship with a signaling receptor. What we have done in the study is define what that looks like and how those two interact. That helps us with trying to understand how we can therapeutically modulate the signaling molecule or the signaling receptor pair.""""When you introduce AMH signaling you can stop the ovarian follicles very early on from developing into eggs in the ovaries,"" says Thompson. ""That's the angle where you have this for a potential contraceptive. If you can enhance AMH signaling you can stop the follicles from being selected for growth.""Researchers are also considering this for female cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.""Chemotherapy can damage follicles and cause less fertility over time,"" Thompson explains ""If you can put the brakes on the reproductive process, you can actually protect the ovary and possibly maintain the ability to have children after chemotherapy.""Research findings from Thompson and lead author Kaitlin Hart, a doctoral student in UC Department of Pharmacology and Systems Physiology, are available online in the scholarly journal for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Thompson and Hart worked closely with researchers from Harvard Medical School, including Nicholas Nagykery, Patricia Donahoe, MD, and David P pin, PhD, who have tested AMH in animal models. Other collaborators from Monash University in Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, are William Stocker, PhD, Kelly Walton, PhD, and Craig Harrison, PhD.""Preserving the fertility of women undergoing chemotherapy by protecting the follicles will have a big impact on the quality of life for women of reproductive age,"" says UC's Hart. ""This becomes more important as more women have children at a later age and increased incidents of cancer occur in younger individuals.""Hart says a better understanding of how AMH interacts with its signaling receptor might also help scientists find a better treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that leads to irregular menstrual periods, excess production of male hormones such as androgen and impeded ovulation in women of reproductive age.The causes of PCOS are unknown, but it can also lead to Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It's one of the most common causes of female infertility affecting up to 12% of women of reproductive age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""There is no cure for PCOS and treatment options are extremely limited due to a lack of understanding of the disease,"" says Hart. ""A group of researchers in France investigating AMH believe it is linked to PCOS with possibly too much AMH leading to infertility.""Animal well-being might also receive a boost with development of a contraceptive that uses AMH.The knowledge UC researchers have advanced will benefit a project spearheaded by the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden to reduce the population of feral cats. Officials at the Cincinnati Zoo are working closely with the same researchers from Harvard Medical School who are collaborators on the research from Thompson's laboratory.""They are developing AMH as a temporary nonsurgical sterilization option,"" explains Hart. ""Instead of capturing cats to neuter, spay and release, you could deliver a therapy based on AMH that could achieve the same result with a single injection. We now understand the interaction between AMH and its receptor so we can contemplate targeted changes to the interfaces to increase that interaction and make AMH more potent.""Bill Swanson, DVM, PhD, director of animal research for the Cincinnati Zoo, adds that ""early results have been promising and we are optimistic that this approach will be useful for reducing feral cat overpopulation.""Reference: Hart KN, Stocker WA, Nagykery NG, et al.

He says:""You take away your main engine, you're kind of on some backup engines. But it's getting by on those. The ship isn't sinking yet. It's still moving at a slower pace. Ultimately what we want to do is sink the ship.""Tuveson and his team wanted to figure out the ""backup engines"" in these cancer cells. They used a technique called biotin proximity labeling to identify what other proteins interacted with mutant KRAS. Cheng says, ""I basically attach a spray can to my favorite protein, or rather least favorite protein, in this case. And so it attaches biotin, basically spraying biotin 'paint' to nearby proteins, and we're able to analyze it to figure out what proteins were labeled.""The scientists found ""biotin paint"" on a protein named RSK1, which is part of a complex that keeps a nearby group of proteins, called RAS proteins, dormant. The scientists were surprised to discover that when they inactivated mutant KRAS, the nearby RSK1 complex stopped working as well. This allowed the RAS proteins to activate and take over the work of the missing mutant KRAS.Stopping pancreatic cancer cells may require drugs that can simultaneously target multiple molecules. Tuveson hopes to uncover more of the players contributing to adaptation in cancer cells to improve future treatments.Reference: Cheng DK, Oni TE, Thalappillil JS, et al.

Get their more susceptible neighbors to help.The Rice University lab of synthetic chemist K.C. Nicolaou, in collaboration with AbbVie Inc., has created unique antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that link a synthetic uncialamycin analogue to antibodies that target cancer cells.Once they enter the targeted tumor cells, these ADCs exhibit a ""significant bystander effect,"" according to the study. In other words, cancerous neighbor cells that aren't directly attacked by the drugs are also affected.The study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences presents ""an intriguing opportunity in the tumor-targeting therapeutics development area,"" according to the researchers.""The bystander effect is expected to improve the efficacy of the ADC drug by killing, in addition to the targeted cancer cells, a significant number of nearby, nontargeted cancer cells usually found within or in close proximity to malignant tumors,"" Nicolaou said.Nicolaou's lab, which specializes in the synthesis of molecules found in nature that have medicinal properties, first reported in 2016 its development of a method to simplify its synthesis of uncialamycin, an enediyne compound isolated from a strain of marine bacteria. Once inside the nucleus of a cell, it produces radicals that cut both strands of the target's DNA.The earlier study produced 13 analogues of uncialamycin and tested them on lung, gastric, ovarian and multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines with ""remarkably high potency,"" the researchers reported at the time, suggested they showed promise as ADC payloads and chose one for further development.That promise is now paying off. In tests on solid tumors, the best of a variety of ADCs killed not only the cell that expressed the target protein but also ""neighbor"" cancer cells that didn't.""That is unique within the enediyne payload-carrying ADCs, and in contrast to the currently employed ADCs containing N-acetyl calicheamicin payloads, which do not exhibit this killing effect,"" Nicolaou said.Importantly, he said, the majority of clinically approved ADCs demonstrate bystander killing effect.The study found ADCs made with cleavable linkers that are stable in the bloodstream but release their payloads in the tumor microenvironment were most effective at decreasing the size of small-cell lung cancer tumors in PDX mouse models.Reference: Nicolaou KC, Rigol S, Pitsinos EN, et al.

Falls, violence, disease - various forms of trauma can cause irreversible damage to the spinal cord, leading to paralysis, sometimes even death.Although many vertebrates, including humans, are unable to recover from a spinal cord injury, some animals stand out. For instance, the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), a salamander from Mexico, has the remarkable ability to regenerate its spinal cord after an injury. When an axolotl's tail is amputated, neural stem cells residing in the spinal cord are recruited to the injury to rebuild the tail. So far, scientists could only detect this activity a few days after the process had started.""Four days after amputation, stem cells within about one millimetre of the injury divide three times as fast as the normal rate to regenerate the spinal cord and replace lost neurons,"" explains Emanuel Cura Costa, co-first author of the study. ""What the stem cells are doing in the first four days after injury was the real mystery.""To understand what happens in the first moments of spinal cord regeneration, researchers at CONICET, IMP, and TU Dresden teamed up to recreate the process in a mathematical model and test its predictions in axolotl tissue with the latest imaging technologies. Their findings, published in eLife, show that neural stem cells accelerate their cell cycles in a highly synchronised manner, with the activation spreading along the spinal cord.Regenerating in sync: cells follow the tempoIn the uninjured spinal cord, cells multiply asynchronously: some are actively replicating their DNA before splitting into two cells to sustain growth, while some are simply resting.The scientists' model predicted that this could change dramatically upon injury: most cells in the vicinity of the injury would jump to a specific stage of the cell cycle to synchronise and proliferate in unison.""We developed a tool to track individual cells in the growing spinal cord of axolotls. Different colours label resting and active cells, which allow us to see how far and how fast cell proliferation happens with a microscope,"" says Leo Otsuki, postdoc in the lab of Elly Tanaka at the IMP and co-first author of this study. ""We were very excited to see the match between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results.""The way cells multiply in chorus in the regenerating spinal cord is exceptional in animals. How can cells coordinate their efforts over almost one millimetre - 50 times the size of a single cell?A mystery signal orchestrating regeneration""Our model made us realise there had to be one or more signals that spread through the tissue from the injury, like a wave, for the area of proliferating cells to expand,"" explains Osvaldo Chara, career researcher at CONICET, group leader of SysBio at the Institute of Physics of Liquids and Biological Systems (IFLySIB) and guest professor at Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing (ZIH), Technische Universit t Dresden. ""This signal might act like a messenger and instruct stem cells to proliferate.""The researchers suspect that this mystery messenger helps reprogram stem cells to divide rapidly and regrow amputated tissue. Their work pinpoints this signal in space and time, and paves the way to characterise it further.""Combining mathematical models with our expertise in tissue imaging was key to understanding how the spinal cord starts regenerating,"" says Elly Tanaka, senior scientist at the IMP.

The intestine also has the unique characteristic of being in a continuous state of self-renewal. This means that approximately every 5 days all the cells of its inner walls are renewed to guarantee correct intestinal function. Until now, scientists knew that this renewal could take place thanks to stem cells, which are protected in the so-called intestinal crypts, and which give rise to new differentiated cells. However, the process that leads to the concave shape of the crypts and the migration of new cells towards the intestinal peaks was unknown.Now, an international team led by Xavier Trepat, ICREA Research Professor and Group Leader at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), in collaboration with the IRB, researchers from the UB and UPC universities in Barcelona, and the Curie Institute of Paris, has deciphered the mechanisms leading the crypts to adopt and maintain their concave shape, and how the migration movement of the cells towards the peaks occurs, without the intestine losing its characteristic folded shape. The study, published in the prestigious journal Nature Cell Biology, has combined computer modelling, led by Marino Arroyo, professor at the UPC, researcher associated with IBEC and member of CIMNE, with experiments with intestinal organoids from mouse cells, and shows that this process is possible thanks to the mechanical forces exerted by the cells. An important part of this study has been supported by the ""la Caixa"" Foundation within the framework of the CaixaResearch programme. The entity has also awarded a scholarship to the first co-author, Gerardo Ceada, to carry out his PhD at IBEC.The forces determine and control the shape of the intestine and the movement of the cellsUsing mouse stem cells and bioengineering and mechanobiology techniques, researchers have developed mini-intestines, organoids that resemble the three-dimensional structure of peaks and valleys, recapitulating tissue functions in vivo. Using microscopy technologies developed by the same group, researchers carried out high-resolution experiments for the first time that have allowed them to obtain 3D maps showing the forces exerted by each cell.In addition, with this in vitro model, scientists have shown that the movement of new cells to the peak is also controlled by mechanical forces exerted by the cells themselves, specifically by the cytoskeleton, a network of filaments that determines and maintains cell shape.""Contrary to what was believed up until now, we have been able to determine that it is not the cells of the intestinal crypt that push the new ones up, but that it is the cells at the peak pulling the new ones up, akin to a mountaineer who helps another climber by pulling them up"", explains Gerardo Ceada from IBEC.""With this system, we have discovered that the crypt is concave because the cells have more tension on their upper surface than on the bottom, which causes them to adopt a conical shape. When this occurs in several cells next to each other, the result is that the tissue folds, giving rise to a pattern of peaks and valleys"", adds Carlos Perez-Gonzalez, (IBEC and Curie Institute).The new mini-intestine model will allow further studies of diseases such as cancer, celiac disease or colitis to be conducted in reproducible and real conditions, in which there is an uncontrolled proliferation of stem cells or a destructuring of the folds. In addition, intestinal organoids can be manufactured with human cells and used for the development of new drugs or for the study of the intestinal microbiota.Reference: P rez-Gonz lez C, Ceada G, Greco F, et al.

For this reason, increasing their levels has been an important target for breeders of vegetable brassicas.Previous work using model plants under optimal laboratory conditions has shown that glucosinolate biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae family is regulated by the gene MYB28. But the effects of this master regulator have not been verified by translating them into crop plants grown in the field.In this proof-of-concept study, scientists successfully used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to ""knock out"" the MYB28 gene in Brassica oleracea (a species that includes many common cultivars such as broccoli). Single gene knockouts in Brassica genus are complicated by multiple copies of numerous genes, including those in the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway.The gene-edited plants were grown in field trial conditions in compliance with the 2001/18 GMO directive, in accordance with the ECJ ruling in 2018. Genetic and metabolomic analysis showed that the gene-knockout resulted in a down regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes and a reduction in accumulation of glucosinolates in the leaves and florets of field-grown myb28 mutant broccoli plants.These results revealed for the first time that MYB28 in B. oleracea regulates glucosinolate levels in a field-based environment, in agreement with previous findings obtained with model plants and in the glasshouse.Reducing gene activity via a knockout - is one application of the gene-editing toolkit.First author Dr Mikhaela Neequaye said: ""By showing that the master regulator of methionine-derived glucosinolate biosynthesis genes, MYB28, functions in the field, as we know it does in glasshouse-grown plants, the MYB28 gene represents a reliable target for manipulating glucosinolate levels in vegetable brassicas.

But just how cells first start organizing themselves with directionality along this head-to-tail axis is hard to study because it happens in the earliest days of embryonic development, in the confines of a mammal's uterus.Now, scientists at Gladstone Institutes have created an organoid--a three-dimensional cluster of cells grown in the lab--that mimics the earliest developmental steps of the nervous system in embryos. The organoid is the first to show how human spinal cord cells become oriented in an embryo, and could shed light on how environmental exposures or toxins can make this process go awry, causing early miscarriages and birth defects.""This is such a critical point in the early development of any organism, so having a new model to observe it and study it in the lab is very exciting,"" says Gladstone Senior Investigator Todd McDevitt, PhD, senior author of the new paper published in the journal Development.In a weeks-old human embryo, cells destined to become the backbone and spinal cord start assembling--beginning at the embryo's head end and growing to form the tail (or tailbone) end of the embryo. The process is known as axial elongation.Although scientists have studied this process in chick and mouse embryos, they have not been able to study molecules that help signal ""heads"" or ""tails"" to cells. What's more, differences in the body plans of humans compared to other animals--such as the lack of a tail--might mean that observations in these model organisms don't hold true in humans.Members of McDevitt's team were working on a new organoid, made from a population of brain cells, when they noticed that certain conditions allowed cell clusters to begin to spontaneously elongate, forming tadpole-shaped structures reminiscent of developing spinal cords. The extended organoids had made the same transition that an embryo undergoes when the spinal cord develops--switching from a ball of cells to something with a distinct head and a tail, marking the top and bottom of the spine.""Organoids don't typically have head-tail directionality, and we didn't originally set out to create an elongating organoid, so the fact that we saw this at all was very surprising,"" says Gladstone Graduate Student Nick Elder, a co-author of the new paper along with fellow Graduate Student Emily Bulger and former Graduate Students Ashley Libby, PhD, and David Joy, PhD.The researchers worked to narrow down exactly what made the organoid elongate, and homed in on a handful of required signaling molecules. Then, they analyzed which genes were turned on or off in cells throughout the elongating organoid over the course of about 2 weeks. They found that the organoid had cellular and molecular patterns similar to those previously found in early developing mouse embryos.""That means we can now use this model to better dissect the cellular and molecular details of human spinal cord elongation in the developing embryonic environment,"" says Bulger.For instance, the researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology to silence a gene from stem cells thought to be important in spinal cord development, and then created organoids from the edited cells. Without the gene, the team showed, the organoids didn't elongate normally, verifying the importance of the gene in axial elongation.The organoid model could also be used to screen drugs or environmental exposures for their effect on a developing embryo, the researchers say.""We can use this organoid to get at unresolved human developmental questions in a way that doesn't involve human embryos,"" says Libby. ""For instance, you could add chemicals or toxins that a pregnant woman might be exposed to, and see how they affect the development of the spinal cord.""For now, McDevitt's team is planning to continue refining their approach to create elongating organoids under different conditions and using different cell types in an attempt to further understand the complex interactions that are required to build the spinal cord.Reference: Libby ARG, Joy DA, Elder NH, et al.

The experiments, conducted by investigators at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, offer what the researchers call a  blueprint  for the development of brain implants to treat pain syndromes and other brain-based disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.  Published June 21 in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering, the study showed that device-implanted rats withdrew their paws 40 percent more slowly from sudden pain compared with times when their device was turned off. According to the study authors, this suggests that the device reduced the intensity of the pain the rodents experienced. In addition, animals in sudden or continuous pain spent about two-thirds more time in a chamber where the computer-controlled device was turned on than in a chamber where it was not. Researchers say the investigation is the first to use a computerized brain implant to detect and relieve bursts of pain in real time. The device is also the first of its kind to target chronic pain, which often occurs without being prompted by a known trigger, the study authors say.  Our findings show that this implant offers an effective strategy for pain therapy, even in cases where symptoms are traditionally difficult to pinpoint or manage,  says senior study author Jing Wang, MD, PhD, the Valentino D.B. Mazzia, MD, JD, Associate Professor and the vice chair for clinical and translational research in the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Care, and Pain Medicine at NYU Langone.Chronic pain is estimated to affect one in four adults in the United States, yet until now, safe and reliable treatments have proven elusive, says Dr. Wang, who is also director of NYU Langone s Interdisciplinary Pain Research Program. Particularly for pain that keeps coming back, current therapies such as opioids often grow less effective over time as people become desensitized to the treatment.

The same issue of PNAS also features an accompanying Q&A with McMahon to mark his recent election as a member of the National Academy of Sciences.""Acute kidney injury can be a common side effect of surgery, sepsis or certain prescription drugs, and there is no effective treatment,"" said McMahon, who is the W.M. Keck Provost and University Professor of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and Biological Sciences at USC. ""Even a mild or moderate injury can progress into chronic kidney disease, which affects 9.1 percent of the world's population and causes 1.2 million deaths each year.""The adult kidney lacks stem cells to regenerate damaged tissue in its approximately 1 million filtering units, which are called nephrons. Damage predominantly occurs in a segment of the nephron known as the proximal tubule. Fortunately, differentiated proximal tubule cells (PTCs) do have their own capacity to repair.To understand this repair process, first authors Louisa M. S. Gerhardt, Jing Liu, and their colleagues in the McMahon Lab pioneered a way to track injured PTCs in lab mice by using a protein called keratin-20, which the cells tend to produce after acute kidney injury.As expected, when a sudden injury provoked the death of some PTCs, surviving ones multiplied to repair the injury. However, weeks after kidney function was restored, the scientists observed that PTCs, which failed to repair normally, appeared at the site of the original injury, and also in regions remote from the initial injury. Unlike normal PTCs, these damaged cells showed activity of gene networks implicated in inflammation, scarring, and cell migration-- features associated with a slow progression to chronic kidney disease.Some of the harmful PTCs showed activity in both genes that support survival and genes that promote programmed cell death, the normal process through which irreparably damaged cells self-destruct. As is observed in cancers, pro-survival genes may prevent programmed cell death, despite abnormalities that would normally limit cell survival, making it more likely for damaged cells to linger, promoting disease progression.""This research presents a dynamic picture of how the initial injury, even if mild, leads to the creation of harmful PTCs that likely contribute to chronic kidney disease,"" said McMahon, who is also the Director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC. ""Our study also raises the possibility of targeting these harmful PTCs for destruction, either by priming them for immune attack or by removing the genes that are interfering with the normal safeguard of programmed cell death.""Reference: Gerhardt LMS, et al.

Nearly half of American adults have elevated blood pressure. Treating high blood pressure with blood pressure-lowering medicines reduced the cases of mild cognitive impairment by 19% in one large trial (SPRINT MIND).ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers and diuretics are different classes of blood pressure-lowering medicines. Each class acts in a different way to reduce blood pressure, and some cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby impacting cognitive function. Research has been mixed on which medicines have the most benefit to cognition,  said study author Daniel A. Nation, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychological science in the Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders at the University of California, Irvine.  Studies of angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have suggested these medicines may confer the greatest benefit to long-term cognition, while other studies have shown the benefits of calcium channel blockers and diuretics on reducing dementia risk. This is the first meta-analysis to compare the potential impact over time of blood pressure lowering medicines that do vs. those that do not cross the blood-brain barrier. The medicines were evaluated for their effects on several cognitive domains, including attention, language, verbal memory, learning and recall. Hypertension occurs decades prior to the onset of dementia symptoms, affecting blood flow not only in the body but also to the brain,  Nation said .  Treating hypertension is likely to have long-term beneficial effects on brain health and cognitive function later. Researchers gathered information from 14 studies of nearly 12,900 adults ages 50 years and older. These included studies done in the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland and Japan. The meta-analysis found:  These findings represent the most powerful evidence to-date linking brain-penetrant ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to better memory. It suggests that people who are being treated for hypertension may be protected from cognitive decline if they medications that cross the blood-brain barrier,  said study co-author Jean K. Ho, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Irvine.Blood pressure is considered elevated at 120/80 mm Hg and higher. The current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for treating high blood pressure suggest changes to diet and activity levels to lower blood pressure and adding blood pressure-lowering medication for people with levels of 130/80 mm Hg or higher depending on their risk status. If blood pressure reaches 140/90 mm Hg, blood pressure-lowering medication is recommended.Limitations of this analysis are that the authors could not account for differences in racial/ethnic background based on the available studies, and there is a higher proportion of men vs. women in the group who took medications that cross the blood-brain barrier. This is an important area of future research since previous studies have shown that people from various racial/ethnic backgrounds may respond differently to different blood pressure medications.Reference: Ho JK, Moriarty F, Manly JJ, et al.

The challenge now lies in increasing agricultural output without clearing more land or applying excessive fertilizers. Precision farming is a promising solution that involves real-time monitoring of plant needs and responding to them with just the right amount of water, light or nutrients.  Precision farming typically relies on soil-based sensors or drones fitted with special cameras,  says Ph.D. student Abdullah Bukhamsin,  but they cannot capture changes in the plant early enough to enable intervention.  Previous research has shown that measuring bioimpedance   how easily an electrical current passes through organic tissues   can reveal physiological information about a plant, from its nitrogen and water content to the presence of fungal infections or metal contaminants. Plants, however, have a thick outer layer that blocks electrical signals, and bioimpedance sensors must pierce the surface without affecting the properties they wish to measure. It remains difficult to manufacture instruments tiny and thin enough to do this job. Now, an efficient method for making silicone molds that can be used to manufacture such ultrathin microneedles has been developed by Bukhamsin and a multidisciplinary team of KAUST researchers led by Khaled Salama. These delicate needles can be released intact by submerging the mold in trichloromethane.  The swelling causes the mold to expand ever so slightly, thereby gently pushing the trapped structure out,  says Bukhamsin. The reusable molds could enable cost-effective, mass-production of microneedles in various plant-friendly polymers. When the team tested their microneedle on an Arabidopsis thaliana leaf, the puncture hole sealed within four days and the plant was not harmed.  In our tests, the impedance measurements were closely related to how much light a plant has been exposed to and how dehydrated it is,  says Bukhamsin.  This bioimpedance data could be used alongside shading technologies and an irrigation system that responds to the actual needs of the crops, thereby avoiding overwatering.  Unexpectedly, this relationship was almost identical in other crops, including date palm and barley.  This is promising as it highlights the versatility of the approach and its potential applicability across different plants,  he adds.  Next, we will explore what other environmental factors affect the impedance of plants,  says Salama,  and how we can use electrochemical measurements to quantify hormone levels in different plant species.

A new study by the open access publisher Frontiers on identical twins investigates the genetic basis for both migraine and PTSD. It reveals epigenetic changes that are shared by PTSD and migraine, suggesting that similar environmental risk factors are at play in both conditions. The findings could help researchers to develop new treatments.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and migraine often co-occur, but researchers knew relatively little about how or why this happens. A new study in Frontiers in Neuroscience is the first to investigate if the conditions have a common genetic basis. By studying identical twins, where one twin in each pair lives with PTSD or migraines and the other twin does not, the researchers found common genes that may play a role in both conditions. These genes may help to explain why the conditions co-occur, and could reveal new treatment targets for both.PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that typically occurs after a traumatic experience, such as a life-threatening event. Most people will experience a traumatic event at some point in their lives, but the vast majority will not develop PTSD, so there is something special about those who do.Those who live with PTSD are also more likely to experience migraine headaches, suggesting common risk factors for these conditions. The synergy between PTSD and migraines is not understood as no studies have examined this link before. This latest study suggests that our genes may hold the answer, and specifically, epigenetic changes.Epigenetics refers to the influence of our environment on how our genes are expressed, and typically involves biochemical modifications to DNA. Identical twins have exactly the same genes, but different experiences as they grow up may result in different epigenetic changes. This can mean that some genes are more or less likely to be expressed in each twin.The researchers used this phenomenon in twins to see which genes show altered activity in PTSD and migraine and whether the conditions shared common changes. Six pairs of twins volunteered for the study, where both twins had experienced traumatic events, but only one of each pair lives with PTSD.Given the low probability that all these conditions are met, the sample size could never be large. But because identical twins share all of their DNA   but not all of their epigenetic marks   the study is still powerful. The researchers also enrolled 15 pairs of twins where one of each pair experiences migraine headaches. The researchers took blood samples from the twins and analyzed them to detect epigenetic changes associated with PTSD or migraine.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The risk profile based on 50 genes could help customize how COVID-19 is treated, improve allocation of limited health care resources such as intensive care beds and ventilators, and potentially save lives.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a disease of unknown cause, affects the lung interstitium or the space between the lung sacs and the bloodstream, leading to severe lung scarring. Severe COVID-19 can also damage the lung interstitium leading to severe lung scarring.""Our study identified at the molecular level, a gene risk profile that predicts worse COVID-19 outcomes before the patient becomes severely ill,"" said principal investigator Jose Herazo-Maya, MD, an associate professor and associate chief of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine. ""That means every patient with COVID-19 could potentially get a blood test that could tell us if they are at high or low risk of dying... And if we know in advance who will likely end up in the ICU and who will likely do well recovering at home with appropriate monitoring, we can tailor our interventions to individual patients based on their level of risk.""The USF Health study appeared online June 20 in EBioMedicine, a publication of THE LANCET. It builds upon previous genomic research by Dr. Herazo-Maya and colleagues at Yale School of Medicine. In 2017, they led an international team that studied and validated a gene expression signature in the blood that reliably forecasts the likelihood of IPF mortality. (Certain patients with lung scarring can live well for years, while others develop worsening disease and die quickly from IPF.)As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, ""the basic question we had was 'Can we repurpose the gene signature known to predict mortality in a fibrotic lung disease to predict mortality in those infected with a new coronavirus that can cause lung fibrosis as well?"" said the EBioMedicine paper lead author Brenda Juan-Guardela, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine and medical director of Respiratory Care Services at Tampa General Hospital (TGH). ""To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to compare overlapping immune gene profiles in COVID-19 and IPF, which were remarkably similar.""The USF Health-led team analyzed gene expression patterns of 50 genes known to predict IPF mortality in three COVID-19 cohorts and two IPF cohorts. The researchers used a molecular scoring system to distinguish between high versus low-risk gene profiles in all five cohorts.Among their findings: At TGH, Dr. Herazo-Maya treats previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients who come to the Center for Advanced Lung Disease with severe lung fibrosis; some are being evaluated for lung transplantation. ""Even though coronavirus cases are dropping, that doesn't mean all the patients will recover without complications,"" he said. ""We're starting to see the damaging, long-term effects in the lungs of some COVID-19 survivors.""While more studies are needed, researchers and clinicians may soon be able to apply the gene risk profiles to help advance the care of both COVID-19 and IPF patients, Dr. Herazo-Maya said. His laboratory is currently developing a blood test, based on these genes, that can be easily applied in clinical practice to predict poor disease outcomes.Besides outcome prediction, the identification of 50-gene risk profiles may also have significant therapeutic potentials. For example, a 10-day regimen of the steroid dexamethasone, a drug that suppresses the immune system, has been shown to increase survival of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.Immunosuppressant drugs have been essentially discontinued for IPF treatment because they increase mortality when given at high doses and in combination over long periods, Dr. Herazo-Maya said. ""But perhaps we could investigate the use of dexamethasone or a similar steroid treatment for a short period of time in a subgroup of IPF patients with a 50-gene high risk profile, using the principle of precision or personalized medicine.""The 50-gene high risk profile may also support the rationale to investigate the use of targeted IPF antifibrotic medications, which slow the rate of lung scarring, to prevent short and long-term sequelae of COVID-19, he added.Reference: Juan Guardela BM, Sun J, Zhang T, et al. 50-gene risk profiles in peripheral blood predict COVID-19 outcomes: A retrospective, multicenter cohort study.

While awareness of the value of sleep has risen in the last decade, there is a significant need for greater emphasis on sleep health in education, clinical practice, inpatient and long-term care, public health promotion, and the workplace.""Healthy sleep is as important as proper nutrition and regular exercise for our health and well-being, and sleep is critical for performance and safety,"" said AASM President Dr. Kannan Ramar. ""It is the position of the AASM that sleep is essential to health, and we are urging educators, health care professionals, government agencies, and employers to prioritize the promotion of healthy sleep.""The statement was written by the members of the 2020 - 2021 AASM board of directors, comprising 11 sleep medicine physicians and a clinical psychologist. In recognition of sleep's significant and multi-faceted connections to health and chronic disease, the authors outlined the following positions: ""Education about sleep and sleep disorders is lacking in medical school curricula, graduate medical education, and education programs for other health professionals,"" said Ramar. ""Better sleep health education will enable our health care workforce to provide more patient-centered care for people who have common sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia.""According to the authors, chronic insufficient sleep and untreated sleep disorders are linked to increased health and safety risks such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, workplace accidents, and motor vehicle crashes. Data from surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau show that 34.1% of children, 74.6% of high school students, and 32.5% of adults in the U.S. fail to get a sufficient duration of sleep on a regular basis.

Melanoma cells are not only able to survive oxygen deprivation, but also to use it to their own advantage by hijacking the anti-tumour immune response and developing resistance mechanisms to conventional anti-cancer therapies. A key gene responsible for cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia is HIF-1  (Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha). Led by Dr Bassam Janji, head of the Tumor Immunotherapy and Microenvironment (TIME) research group at the Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH) and in collaboration with Gustave Roussy Cancer Center in France and the Thumbay Research Institute of Precision Medicine at Gulf Medical University in the United Arab Emirates, the team used gene editing technologies to show how targeting HIF-1  could not only inhibit tumour growth, but also drive cytotoxic (toxic to cells) immune cells to the cancer tissue. This discovery provided a valuable new target to make resistant melanomas more vulnerable to available anti-cancer treatments. Their findings were recently published in the reputable Oncogene Journal.Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, cells that are responsible for the production of pigments. Melanomas become harder to treat if not detected early, with emerging treatment resistance being an important barrier to their effective management. Due to their rapid growth rate and low blood supply, solid tumours including melanoma often exhibit areas of hypoxia. Hypoxia, or the decrease of oxygen in the tumour microenvironment, would normally cause tumour cell death. ""However, certain solid tumours have evolved to survive this hostile microenvironment by activating HIF-1 , a gene reported to be a major factor mediating the adaptive response to changes in tissue oxygen level,"" explains Dr Janji. William G. Kaelin Jr, Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2019 for their discovery of HIF-1? and how cells use it to sense hypoxia. Hypoxia has also been reported to be responsible for the failure of tumour response to conventional anti-cancer therapies and can prevent the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour. It is therefore crucial to understand the mechanisms by which cancer cells overcome this hypoxic environment to improve the effectiveness of available anti-cancer therapies.In this context, the team led by Dr Janji sought to inactivate the functionality of the HIF-1  gene using CRISPR gene editing technology and investigate the impact of such inactivation on tumour growth, immune cell infiltration and response to immunotherapy in a preclinical melanoma mouse model.""Our study revealed that blocking the activity of HIF-1  significantly inhibited melanoma growth and amplified the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour microenvironment by increasing the release of CCL5, a well-defined mediator involved in driving cytotoxic immune cells to the tumour battlefield"", summarises Dr Audrey Lequeux, first author of the publication. Importantly, the study also showed that combining a drug devised to stop hypoxia significantly improves melanoma immunotherapy. When the results were validated retrospectively in a cohort of 473 melanoma patients, the hypoxic signature of tumours was correlated to worsened outcomes and the lack of immune cell infiltration into tumours, which is considered as a major characteristic of tumour resistance to immunotherapies.""Together, our data strongly argue that therapeutic strategies disrupting HIF-1  would be able to modulate the tumour microenvironment to permit the infiltration of immune cells. Such strategies could be used to improve vaccine-based and immune checkpoint blockade-based cancer immunotherapies in non-responder melanoma patients,"" conclude Dr Chouaib and Dr Janji from Gulf Medical University and Luxembourg Institute of Health, respectively.Reference: Lequeux A, Noman MZ, Xiao M, et al.

Most of the thirty trillion cells in a person's body contain genes that come from both their mother and father, with each parent contributing one version of each gene. The unique combination of genes goes part of the way to making an individual unique. Usually, each gene in a pair is equally active or inactive in a given cell. This is not the case for imprinted genes. These genes - which make up less than one percent of the total of 20,000+ genes - tend to be more active (sometimes much more active) in one parental version than the other.Until now, researchers were aware of around 130 well-documented imprinted genes in the mouse genome - the new additions take this number to over 200.Professor Tony Perry, who led the research from the Department of Biology & Biochemistry at Bath in the UK, said: ""Imprinting affects an important family of genes, with different implications for health and disease, so the seventy-plus new ones add an important piece of the jigsaw.""Close examination of the newly identified genes has allowed Professor Perry and his colleagues to make a second important discovery: the switching on and off of imprinted genes is not always related to DNA methylation, where methyl groups are added to genomic DNA- a process that is known to repress gene activity, switching them off). DNA methylation was the first known type of imprint, and was discovered around thirty years ago. From the results of the new work, it seems that a greater contribution to imprinting is made by histones - structures that are wrapped up with genomic DNA in chromosomes.Although scientists have known for some time that histones act as 'dimmer' switches for genes, fading them off (or back on), until now it was thought that DNA methylation provided the major switch for imprinted gene activity. The findings from the new study cast doubt on this assumption: many of the newly identified genes were found to be associated with changes to the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and only a minority with DNA methylation.

A new study from West Virginia University researcher Eric E. Kelley in collaboration with the University of Minnesota suggests that unrepaired DNA damage can increase the speed of aging. The study appears in the journal Nature. Kelley and his team created genetically-modified mice with a crucial DNA-repair protein missing from their hematopoietic stem cells, immature immune cells that develop into white blood cells. Without this repair protein, the mice were unable to fix damaged DNA accrued in their immune cells.  By the time the genetically-modified mouse is 5 months old, it s like a 2-year-old mouse,  said Kelley, associate professor and associate chair of research in the School of Medicine s Department of Physiology and Pharmacology.  It has all the symptoms and physical characteristics. It has hearing loss, osteoporosis, renal dysfunction, visual impairment, hypertension, as well as other age-related issues. It s prematurely aged just because it has lost its ability to repair its DNA.  According to Kelley, a normal 2-year-old mouse is about equivalent in age to a human in their late 70s to early 80s. Kelley and his colleagues found that markers for cell aging, or senescence, as well as for cell damage and oxidation were significantly greater in the immune cells of genetically-modified mice compared to normal, wild-type mice. But the damage was not limited to the immune system; the modified mice also demonstrated aged, damaged cells in organs such as the liver and kidney. These results suggest that unrepaired DNA damage may cause the entire body to age prematurely. When we are exposed to a pollutant, such as radiation for cancer treatment, energy is transferred to the water in our body, breaking the water apart. This creates highly reactive molecules free radicals that will quickly interact with another molecule in order to gain electrons. When these free radicals interact with important biomolecules, such as a protein or DNA, it causes damage that can keep that biomolecule from working properly. Some exposure to pollutants is unavoidable, but there are several lifestyle choices that increase exposure to pollution and thus increase free radicals in the body. Smoking, drinking and exposure to pesticides and other chemicals through occupational hazards all significantly increase free radicals.  A cigarette has over 10 to the 16th free radicals per puff, just from combusted carbon materials,  Kelley said. In addition to free radicals produced by pollutant exposure, the human body is constantly producing free radicals during a process used to turn food into energy, called oxidative phosphorylation.  We have mechanisms in the mitochondria that mop free radicals up for us, but if they become overwhelmed if we have over-nutrition, if we eat too much junk, if we smoke the defense mechanism absolutely cannot keep up,  Kelley said. As bodies age, the amount of damage caused by free-radical formation becomes greater than the antioxidant defenses. Eventually, the balance between the two tips over to the oxidant side, and damage starts to win out over repair. If we are exposed to a greater amount of pollutants and accumulate more free radicals, this balance will be disrupted even sooner, causing premature aging. The issue of premature aging due to free-radical damage is especially important in West Virginia. The state has the greatest percentage of obese citizens in the nation and a high rate of smokers and workers in high-pollution-exposure occupations.  I come from an Appalachian background,  Kelley said.  And, you know, I d go to funerals that were in some old house an in-the-living-room-with-a-casket kind of deal and I d look at people in there, and they d be 39 or 42 and look like they were 80 because of their occupation and their nutrition.  Many West Virginians also have comorbidities, such as diabetes, enhanced cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal issues, that complicate the situation further. Although there are drugs, called senolytics, that help to slow the aging process, Kelley believes it is best to prevent premature aging through lifestyle change. He says that focusing on slowing the aging process through preventive measures can improve the outcome for each comorbidity and add more healthy years to people s lives.  The impact is less on lifespan and more on healthspan,  he said.  If you could get people better access to healthcare, better education, easier ways for them to participate in healthier eating and a healthier lifestyle, then you could improve the overall economic burden on the population of West Virginia and have a much better outcome all the way around.

As the disease progresses, the damage accumulates, and their symptoms worsen.Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found that high levels of a normal protein associated with reduced heart disease also protect against Alzheimer's-like brain damage - at least in mice. The findings, published June 21 in Neuron, suggest that raising levels of the protein -- known as low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL receptor) -- could potentially be a way to slow or stop cognitive decline.The discovery of LDL receptor as a potential therapeutic target for dementia is surprising since the protein is much better known for its role in cholesterol metabolism. Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, two groups of drugs widely prescribed for cardiovascular disease, work in part by increasing levels of LDL receptor in the liver and some other tissues. It is not known whether they affect LDL receptor levels in the brain.""There are not yet clearly effective therapies to preserve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease,"" said senior author David Holtzman, MD, the Andrew B. and Gretchen P. Jones Professor and head of the Department of Neurology. ""We found that increasing LDL receptor in the brain strongly decreases neurodegeneration and protects against brain injury in mice. If you could increase LDL receptor in the brain with a small molecule or other approach, it could be a very attractive treatment strategy.""The key to the importance of LDL receptor lies in a different protein, APOE, that also is linked to both cholesterol metabolism and Alzheimer's disease. High cholesterol in the blood is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, although the exact nature of the association is unclear.During the long, slow development of Alzheimer's disease, plaques of a protein called amyloid gradually accumulate in the brain. After many years, another brain protein called tau starts forming tangles that become detectable just before Alzheimer's symptoms arise. The tangles are thought to be toxic to neurons, and their spread through the brain foretells the death of brain tissue and cognitive decline. First author Yang Shi, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher, and Holtzman previously showed that APOE drives tau-mediated degeneration in the brain by activating microglia, the brain's cellular janitorial crew. Once activated, microglia can injure neural tissue in their zeal to clean up molecular debris.Higher levels of LDL receptor limit the damage APOE can do in part by binding to APOE and degrading it. Higher levels of LDL receptor in the brain, therefore, should pull more APOE out of the fluid surrounding brain cells and mitigate damage even further, the researchers reasoned.As part of this study, Shi, Holtzman and colleagues including co-senior author Jason Ulrich, PhD, an associate professor of neurology, studied mice predisposed to develop Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration because they had been genetically modified to develop tau buildup in the brain, much like people with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The researchers bred the tau mice with mice genetically modified to express high levels of LDL receptor in their brains. The resulting offspring had high levels of LDL receptor and a propensity to develop Alzheimer's-like brain damage by the time they were 9 months old, which is similar to middle age in a person.Then, the researchers compared the four groups: normal mice, tau mice, mice with high levels of LDL receptor, and tau mice with high levels of LDL receptor. At 9 months, the normal mice and the mice with high levels of LDL receptor had healthy looking brains. The tau mice had severe brain atrophy and neurological damage. In comparison, the tau mice with high levels of LDL receptor were in much better shape. They had significantly less brain shrinkage and damage, their levels of certain forms of tau and APOE were significantly lower, and their microglia were shifted toward a less damaging pattern of activation.""Alzheimer's develops slowly through multiple phases, and the degeneration phase when tau is building up is when the symptoms arise and worsen,"" Holtzman said. ""In terms of quality of life for people with Alzheimer's, this is a phase in which it would be great if we could intervene. I think this LDL receptor pathway is a good candidate because it has a strong effect, and we know it can be targeted in other parts of the body. This has motivated us over the last few years to try to develop programs to modulate the receptor in other ways.""Reference: Shi Y, Andhey PS, Ising C, et al.

Recent advances in microscopic methods and availability of various mouse models allowed the research group of Marja Mikkola from HiLIFE Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki to address this question. This is the first time when live tissue imaging has been used to visualise the emergence of the mammary gland.Mammary gland is the class-defining organ of mammals, yet we know surprisingly little how its development commences. In their recent study published in Journal of Cell Biology, the research group of Marja Mikkola used time-lapse imaging to show that the growth of the mammary bud is primarily fueled by migration of cells to the bud. In contrast, although increase in cellular size and cell proliferation contribute to this process, the role of these mechanisms remains minor.""Interestingly, mammary bud cells, unlike most of other skin derivatives such as hair follicle and tooth bud, do not divide for several days, indicating that this might be a unique feature of early mammary gland development"" says graduate student Ewelina Trela, the lead author of the study. ""However, we do not yet know why this happens"", she continues.Mammary buds use a previously undescribed mechanism for invaginationTissue invagination, or tissue folding inwards into the underlying stroma, is a fundamental mechanism that occurs to generate the architecture of many organs. In the same piece of work, the authors describe a novel mechanism for tissue invagination.""Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we found thin and elongated epidermal keratinocytes surrounding mammary bud in a rim like fashion: their appearance and disappearance coincided with the invagination process suggesting that these cells, named ring cells, could be functionally important"" details principal investigator Marja Mikkola.Next, the Mikkola group teamed up with the group of Sara Wickstr m at HiLIFE and Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki to establish live imaging of the forming mammary bud, which confirmed that ring cells move circumferentially around the mammary bud.The study also revealed that the ring cells exert contractile force through the actomyosin network, via non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA). The functionality of ring cells was impaired in NMIIA deficient mice leading to compromised mammary bud shape. Whether other developing organs utilize a similar cellular mechanism for invagination remains an open question.Reference: Trela E, Lan Q, Myllym ki S-M, et al.

According to data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a majority of those implants needs to be replaced within 10 years due to the buildup of scar tissue and other complications.A team led by MIT researchers has now systematically analyzed how the varying surface architecture found in these implants influences the development of adverse effects, which in rare cases can include an unusual type of lymphoma.  The surface topography of an implant can drastically affect how the immune response perceives it, and this has important ramifications for the [implants ] design,  says Omid Veiseh, a former MIT postdoc.  We hope this paper provides a foundation for plastic surgeons to evaluate and better understand how implant choice can affect the patient experience.  The findings could also help scientists to design more biocompatible implants in the future, the researchers say.  We are pleased that we were able to bring new materials science approaches to better understand issues of biocompatibility in the area of breast implants. We also hope the studies that we conducted will be broadly useful in understanding how to design safer and more effective implants of any type,  says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and the senior author of the study. Veiseh, who is now an assistant professor at Rice University, and Joshua Doloff, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, are the lead authors of the paper, which appears today in Nature Biomedical Engineering. The research team also includes scientists from Rice University, Johns Hopkins, Establishment Labs, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, among other institutions.Silicone breast implants have been in use since the 1960s, and the earliest versions had smooth surfaces. However, with these implants, patients often experienced a complication called capsular contracture, in which scar tissue forms around the implant and squeezes it, creating pain or discomfort as well as visible deformation of the implant. These implants could also flip after implantation, requiring them to be surgically adjusted or removed. In the late 1980s, some companies began making implants with rougher surfaces, with the hopes of reducing capsular contracture rates and making them  stick  better to the tissue and stay in place. They did this by creating a surface with peaks extending up to hundreds of microns above the surface. However, in 2019, the FDA requested a breast implant manufacturer to recall all highly textured breast implants (about 80 microns) marketed in the United States due to risk of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. A new generation of breast implants that dates back a decade, having a unique and patented surface architecture that includes not only a slight degree of surface roughness, with an average of about 4 microns, but also other specific surface characteristics including skewness and the number, distribution, and size of contact points optimized to cellular dimensions, was designed to prevent those complications. In 2015, Doloff, Veiseh, and researchers from Establishment Labs teamed up to explore how this unique surface, as well as others commonly used, interact with the surrounding tissue and the immune system. They began by testing five commercially available implants with different topographies, including degree of roughness. These included the highly textured one that had been previously recalled, one that is completely smooth, and three that are somewhere in between. Two of these implants had the aforementioned novel surface architecture, one with a 4-micron roughness and one with a 15-micron roughness, manufactured by Establishment Labs. In a study of rabbits, the researchers found that tissue exposed to the roughest implant surfaces showed signs of increased activity from macrophages   immune cells that normally clear out foreign cells and debris. All of the implants stimulated immune cells called T cells, but in different ways. Implants with rougher surfaces stimulated more pro-inflammatory T cell responses, while implants with the unique surface topography, including 4-micron average roughness, stimulated T cells that appear to inhibit tissue inflammation. The researchers  findings suggest that rougher implants rub against the surrounding tissue and cause more irritation. This may offer an explanation for why the rougher implants can lead to lymphoma: The hypothesis is that some of the texture sloughs off and gets trapped in nearby tissue, where it provokes chronic inflammation that can eventually lead to cancer. The researchers also tested miniaturized versions of these implants in mice. They manufactured these implants using the same techniques used to manufacture the human-sized versions, and showed that more highly textured implants provoked more macrophage activity, more scar tissue formation, and higher levels of inflammatory T cells. The researchers also performed single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells from these tissues to confirm that the cells were expressing pro-inflammatory genes.  While completely smooth surface implants also had higher levels of macrophage response and fibrosis, it was very clear in mice that individual cells were more stressed and were expressing more of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in response to the highest surface roughness,  Doloff says. On the other hand, implants with the unique surface architecture, including an optimized degree or  sweet spot  of surface roughness, at about 4 microns on average, and other specific characteristics, appeared to significantly reduce the amount of scarring and inflammation, compared to either the implants with higher roughness or a completely smooth surface.  We believe that this is due to such surface architecture existing on the scale of individual cells of the body, allowing the cells to perceive them in a different way,  Doloff says. Rachel Brem, director of breast imaging and intervention and a professor of radiology at George Washington University Medical Center, notes that the study  investigates one of the most timely and increasingly perplexing problems in breast reconstruction   how to identify silicone breast implants with the least immunologic response to minimize the risk of implant-induced lymphoma.   The finding of a complex inflammatory and anti-inflammatory response is critically important, as is the finding that the 4-micron textured implant results in a thinner, translucent capsule than that found with smooth implants, and is the optimal formulation of a silicone breast implant to result in the least thick, least overall immunogenic response,  says Brem, who was not involved in the study.  This is a critically important finding which will allow for the development of the optimal implant for patients. After performing their animal studies, the researchers analyzed samples from a large bank of cancer tissue samples at MD Anderson to study how human patients respond to different types of silicone breast implants. In those samples, the researchers found evidence for the same types of immune responses that they had seen in the animal studies. Among their findings, they observed that tissue samples that had been host to highly textured implants for many years showed signs of a chronic, long-term immune response. They also found that scar tissue was thicker in patients who had more highly textured implants.  Doing across-the-board comparisons in mice, rabbits, and then in human [tissue samples] really provides a much more robust and substantial body of evidence about how these compare to one another,  Veiseh says. The authors hope that their datasets will help other researchers optimize the design of silicone breast implants and other types of medical silicone implants for better safety.  The importance of science-based design that can provide patients with safer breast implants was confirmed in this study,  says Roberto de Mezerville, an author of the paper and head of R&D at Establishment Labs.  By demonstrating for the first time that an optimal surface architecture allows for the least possible inflammation and foreign-body response, this work is a significant contribution to the entire medical device industry.

However despite this drop, airborne particles in London are still highly lead-enriched compared to natural background levels, according to new Imperial research published today in PNAS.The study found that up to 40 per cent of lead in airborne particles today comes from the legacy of leaded petrol. The researchers say this highlights the long-term persistence of contaminants introduced by human activities in the environment.Lead author of the study Dr El onore Resongles, who carried out the work at Imperial's Department of Earth Science and Engineering, said: ""Petrol-derived lead deposited decades ago remains an important pollutant in London. Despite the leaded petrol ban, historically combusted lead is still present in London's air more than 20 years later.""The researchers compared the chemical and isotopic composition of particulate matter in the air with samples of road dust and urban soil, which confirmed the role of the resuspension of dust contaminated from leaded petrol in lead's persistence in London today.They explained that lead from leaded petrol once settled in the environment and is steadily re-suspended into the air through wind and vehicle movement, providing a constant background level and remobilisation mechanism.They say this also highlights a potential hazard that warrants further investigation into its effects on Londoners' health as, despite air quality targets, there is no 'safe' threshold for lead in humans.Dr Resongles added: ""Long-term low-level exposure to lead can adversely affect health and, while we don't yet know the health implications of our findings, they suggest that leaded petrol might still be providing low level exposure which can have detrimental effects on health.""

The findings from the study, published in Nature, may change our understanding of cancer care following surgery.The study found that patients with urothelial cancer who had a particular cancer DNA marker in their blood following surgery to remove their tumour had a higher likelihood of cancer relapse. These patients could benefit from subsequent treatment with an immunotherapy called atezolizumab.Globally, there were approximately 573,000 cases of and 212,000 deaths from bladder cancer in 2020. Surgery is often among the first treatments for advanced bladder cancer that has grown into the muscle layer of the bladder wall (muscle-invasive). However, relapse rates after surgery are high as some cancer cells can be left behind when the tumour is removed. These remaining cancer cells, known as molecular residual disease (MRD), increase the chances of a patient's cancer reoccurring as the cells can spread and establish tumours elsewhere in the body.This study, funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd./Genentech, Inc, and Barts Cancer Institute/Queen Mary University of London evaluated treatment outcomes in a subgroup of patients (comprising 581 individuals) who were enrolled onto a randomised phase III trial (IMvigor010) and a phase II study (ABACUS) which investigated whether the drug atezolizumab could reduce cancer recurrence in high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma.To identify patients with increased likelihood of MRD following surgery, a blood test was used to detect the presence or absence of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) - tumour-derived fragments of genetic material that can escape into the bloodstream and are considered to be indicative of MRD. The team found that patients with ctDNA-positive blood tests after surgery were at higher risk of cancer recurrence than those who were ctDNA-negative.Treatment with atezolizumab did not significantly improve disease-free survival (DFS; the length of time after treatment during which no sign of cancer is found) nor overall survival (OS) in the whole IMvigor010 study population; however, in the ctDNA-positive subgroup of patients evaluated in this study, treatment with atezolizumab compared with observation alone significantly improved DFS (5.9 vs 4.4 months) and OS (25.8 vs 15.8 months). The outcomes in patients who were ctDNA-negative did not appear to differ whether they received atezolizumab or not.Lead researcher, Tom Powles, Professor of Genitourinary Oncology at Queen Mary's Barts Cancer Institute and Director of Barts Cancer Centre at Barts Health NHS Trust, said:""These novel findings demonstrate ctDNA as a marker for residual disease and response to atezolizumab. We also found ctDNA measurement to be more accurate than traditional radiology at identifying disease relapse. These findings may change our understanding of post-surgical cancer care and, if validated in this setting as well as across tumour types, they may also change clinical practice.""It is difficult to determine which patients harbour MRD and which are cured after surgery. As a result, many patients who are cured by surgery are unnecessarily exposed to toxicities from additional treatments, and other patients with residual disease may not receive potentially beneficial treatment until disease progression is detectable by imaging. The findings from this study suggest that detection of ctDNA shortly after surgery may overcome these clinical limitations by enabling early identification of patients harbouring MRD.Initiating personalised treatment based on the identification of MRD rather than treating unselected patients or waiting for relapse would be a significant change in cancer treatment. Further studies will now be required to validate and expand the clinical utility of this method, and to determine whether ctDNA measurement could aid in directing post-surgical treatment to those who need it.Reference: Powles T, Assaf ZJ, Davarpanah N, et al. ctDNA guiding adjuvant immunotherapy in urothelial carcinoma.

This may explain why 12 different publishers initially rejected the opportunity to publish  Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone    because it had no data to inform its potential.A recent survey revealed that 92 per cent of Fortune 1000 companies were reporting increased investment in data initiatives, although it appears this may not always be necessary.The authors asked managers how they made decisions on their most recent innovation project, including the extent to which they used data, instinct, and other simple heuristics (mental strategies). The findings outlined that among those decision-making methods were: Managers were asked whether they think they made the right decision and how fast they were in reaching that decision. Results showed that managers relied on their own instinct as much as data, using  tallying  more than any other metric.Dr Oguz A. Acar, Reader in Marketing at the Business School and co-author of the report, said:  This research shows that data-driven decision-making is not the panacea in all situations and may not result in increased accuracy when facing uncertainty. Under extreme uncertainty, managers, particularly those with more experience, should trust the expertise and instincts that have propelled them to such a position. The nous developed over years as a leader can be a more effective than an analytical tool which, in situations of extreme uncertainty, could act as a hindrance rather than a driver of success.

Researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology now show that although neurons in the mouse visual thalamus connect to both eyes, they establish strong functional connections only with one retina. These results settle partly contradictory results of earlier studies and demonstrate how important it can be to complement structural data with functional analyses.We have two eyes, but perceive the tree in front of us only once. Our brain therefore has the complicated task of combining the information of both eyes in a meaningful way. To do so, visual stimuli first travel from the retina via so-called ganglion cells to the visual thalamus. There, the information does end up in clearly defined areas   depending on the type and eye-of-origin of retinal ganglion cells transporting the visual stimuli. Signals from the right and left eye are thus clearly separated in the visual thalamus and independently transmitted to the visual cortex. Only in this brain region, the incoming information is combined   at least according to a long-standing theory.However, recent anatomical studies describe that a surprising number of neurons in the mouse visual thalamus has contact to both eyes. Does the separation of 'left eye' and 'right eye' information channels not hold true in mice? Scientists from Tobias Bonhoeffer's department wanted to shed more light on this newly raised question. They further developed an optogenetic method, so that they could activate ganglion cells of both eyes successively with light of different colors and measure the corresponding electrical responses in a thalamic cell.This analysis shows that indeed a multitude of neurons in the visual thalamus receive input from both retinas. But interestingly, there are only very few cells in which the signal strengths of both eyes are similar. In most cells, one eye dominates with a much higher input strength. The weak signals from the non-dominant eye did not trigger an action potential in the experiment and thus seem to not play a major role in the processing of visual information. ""With these results, we can explain the contradictory findings of previous research,"" says Tobias Rose, who led the study. ""The neurons in the visual thalamus do form connections with both eyes, but are functionally monocular or, so to speak, one-eyed. That means that only the signal strength of one eye is high enough for the cells to respond."" ","Published: June 21, 2021"

The test platform they created was so sensitive that the coronaviruses responsible for the common cold, SARS, MERS, and COVID could be distinguished from each other. This work may lead to rapid, portable, and accurate screening tests for COVID and other viral diseases.The global coronavirus pandemic has revealed the crucial need for rapid pathogen screening. However, the current gold-standard for detecting RNA viruses--including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID--is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. While accurate, this method is relatively slow, which hinders the timely interventions required to control an outbreak.Now, scientists led by Osaka University have developed an intelligent nanopore system that can be used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. Using machine-learning methods, the platform can accurately discriminate between similarly sized coronaviruses responsible for different respiratory diseases. ""Our innovative technology has high sensitivity and can even electrically identify single virus particles,"" first author Professor Masateru Taniguchi says. Using this platform, the researchers were able to achieve a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96% for SARS-CoV-2 detection in just five minutes using clinical saliva samples.To fabricate the device, nanopores just 300 nanometers in diameter were bored into a silicon nitride membrane. When a virus was pulled through a nanopore by the electrophoretic force, the opening became partially blocked. This temporarily decreased the ionic flow inside the nanopore, which was detected as a change in the electrical current. The current as a function of time provided information on the volume, structure, and surface charge of the target being analyzed. However, to interpret the subtle signals, which could be as small as a few nanoamps, machine learning was needed. The team used 40 PCR-positive and 40 PCR-negative saliva samples to train the algorithm.""We expect that this research will enable rapid point-of-care and screening tests for SARS-CoV-2 without the need for RNA extraction,"" Professor Masateru Taniguchi explains. ""A user-friendly and non-invasive method such as this is more amenable to immediate diagnosis in hospitals and screening in places where large crowds are gathered."" The complete test platform consists of machine learning software on a server, a portable high-precision current measuring instrument, and cost-effective semiconducting nanopore modules. By using a machine-learning method, the researchers expect that this system can be adapted for use in the detection of emerging infectious diseases in the future. The team hopes that this approach will revolutionize public health and disease control.Reference: Taniguchi M, Minami S, Ono C, et al.

Researchers modeled the collapse of various heights of ice cliffs near-vertical formations that occur where glaciers and ice shelves meet the ocean. They found that instability doesn t always lead to rapid disintegration.  What we found is that over long timescales, ice behaves like a viscous fluid, sort of like a pancake spreading out in a frying pan,  said Jeremy Bassis, U-M associate professor of climate and space sciences and engineering.  So the ice spreads out and thins faster than it can fail and this can stabilize collapse. But if the ice can t thin fast enough, that s when you have the possibility of rapid glacier collapse.  The researchers combined the variables of ice failure and ice flow for the first time, finding that stretching and thinning of ice, as well as buttressing from trapped chunks of ice, may moderate the effects of fracture-induced marine ice cliff instability. The new findings add nuance to a previous theory called marine ice cliff instability, which suggested that if the height of an ice cliff reaches a certain threshold, it can suddenly disintegrate under its own weight in a chain reaction of ice fractures. The Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica sometimes referred to as the  Doomsday Glacier is moving closer to this threshold and could contribute nearly 3 feet to sea level rise in the event of a complete collapse. At 74,000 square miles, it s roughly the size of Florida, and is particularly susceptible to climate and ocean changes. The research team also found that icebergs that crack and fall away from the main glacier in a process known as  iceberg calving  may actually stave off, rather than contribute to, catastrophic collapse. If the ice chunks get stuck on outcroppings in the ocean floor, they can exert back pressure on the glacier to help stabilize it. Bassis notes that even if the glacier doesn t catastrophically collapse, exposing a tall cliff could still trigger a retreat at a few kilometers per year equal to the length of about 20 football fields  and resulting in a large contribution to future sea level rise.While it s clear that Thwaites and other glaciers are melting, the speed of their demise is of keen interest to coastal areas as they develop strategies to adapt and build resilience. But predicting the retreat of glaciers is a mind-bendingly complex business, as they re affected by the interplay of myriad factors the stress and strain of billions of tons of shifting ice, changing air and water temperatures and the effects of flowing liquid water on ice, to name just a few. As a result, the predictions for the collapse of the Thwaites Glacier range from a few decades to many centuries. The new study, Bassis says, is an important step toward producing accurate, actionable predictions.  There s no doubt that sea levels are rising, and that it s going to continue in the coming decades,  Bassis said.  But I think this study offers hope that we re not approaching a complete collapse that there are measures that can mitigate and stabilize things. And we still have the opportunity to change things by making decisions about things like energy emissions methane and CO2. In addition to Bassis, the research team includes U-M graduate student research assistant Brandon Berg, and Anna Crawford and Doug Benn from the University of St. Andrews. Crawford says the study s findings will also be useful for predicting the fate of other glaciers and ice formations in the Arctic and Antarctica.  These important insights will inform future research into the retreat of Thwaites Glacier and other large outlet glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet that are vulnerable to retreat via ice cliff failure and marine ice cliff instability,  she said.  They highlight the conditions that facilitate retreat, demonstrate the potential for terminus restabilization and show how sea ice can actually put the brakes on the collapse process.  Bassis says the research team is already working to refine their models further by incorporating additional variables that affect glacial retreat, including how the shapes of individual glaciers affect their stability and the interaction between glacial ice and the liquid ocean around it.  The ocean is always there, sort of tickling the ice in a very complex way, and we ve only known for a decade or two just how important it is,  he said.  But we re beginning to understand that it s driving a lot of the changes we re seeing, and I think that s going to be the next big frontier in our research.

This increases the burden on the environment and the climate. One strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to grow so-called C4 crops. These carry out photosynthesis particularly efficiently, are therefore more effective in fixing carbon dioxide (CO2), and build up more biomass than other plants. Usually, they are native to sunny and warm places. One of the C4 plants is sorghum, also known as great millet, a species of the sorghum genus in the sweet grass family. The varieties that are particularly rich in sugar are called sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench). Other varieties include grain sorghum used as animal feed. Sorghum can be grown on so-called marginal land, which is difficult to cultivate, so it does not compete with other food or forage crops.A new sweet sorghum variety called KIT1 has been developed by Dr. Adnan Kanbar in the Molecular Cell Biology Division research group headed by Professor Peter Nick at the Botanical Institute of KIT. KIT1 accumulates particularly high amounts of sugar and thrives especially well under temperate climate conditions. It can be used both energetically, i.e. for the production of biogas and biofuels, and as a base material for the production of novel polymers. The estimated sugar yield per hectare is over 4.4 tons, which would correspond to almost 3,000 liters of bioethanol. In addition, the digestate produced during biogas production can be used for fertilizers to replace phosphate fertilizer, which will soon be in short supply. ","Published: June 21, 2021"

This inexpensive method with laboratory-grade equipment quickly reaches the crystal-structure model of even extremely thin films of less than 10 nm. Any problem can be solved with a little ingenuity . While they may not be the originators of this quote, recent work from researchers at Osaka Prefecture University into understanding the molecular orientation of hybrid thin-film material is a concrete example of its central message.  We wanted everyone to have access to this knowledge,  states research lead Professor Masahide Takahashi of the OPU Graduate School of Engineering. Using laboratory-grade equipment with 3D printable optical setups, his research group has established an easy, versatile, yet highly sensitive approach to identify the orientation of molecules and chemical bonds in crystalline organic-inorganic hybrid thin film deposited on a substrate as small as 10 nm,  even film with 3 molecular layers , continues the Professor. Their work was published on June 18th in Chemical Science. The equipment they used was a spectrometer that employs a technique called Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and polarized infrared light with an originally designed 3D-printed attenuated total reflectance (ATR) unit. FT-IR spectrometers are found in most laboratories in part because they show what molecules are found in a sample   but they have not been able to reveal the three-dimensional orientation of these molecules relative to the substrates. This is important to the manufacturing of thin-film devices that can be nanometers in size, as an unpredicted shift in molecular orientation at that level can cause the entire structure of the device to break down. Conventionally, in FT-IR spectroscopy in transmission configuration, infrared light penetrates from the top of the sample like a skewer. This narrow point of entry and exit does not allow the sample enough interaction with the light to excite the molecules in their chemically bonded states.  We realized that by re-orienting the sample, we could introduce polarized light directly into the substrate of the thin film, generating an evanescent wave that heats up the sample, exciting certain molecules and betraying their orientation,  states Bettina Baumgartner, a visiting researcher on the team,  we just needed a new kind of sample interface , adds Associate Professor Kenji Okada. This is where the team designed a brand-new ATR optical setup that bounces polarized infrared light through the entirety of the sample substrate allowing the team to observe the vibration of all molecules aligned with the electric field component of the infrared light, revealing their orientation. Any lab with a 3-D printer can make these ATR optical setups. This method, which the team used to obtain the structural information of metal-organic framework thin film with a degree of crystal orientation comparable to X-ray structural analysis, is expected to be a useful method in many situations in materials science, such as where orientation control is linked to controlling physical properties, the functional improvement of porous materials used for CO2 capture, and the development of new heterogeneous catalysts.ReferenceBaumgartner B, Ikigaki K, Okada K, Takahashi M.

Naturally very versatile, it can cause acute and chronic infections that are potentially fatal for people with weakened immune systems. The presence of P. aeruginosa in clinical settings, where it can colonise respirators and catheters, is a serious threat. In addition, its adaptability and resistance to many antibiotics make infections by P. aeruginosa increasingly difficult to treat. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new antibacterials. Scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, have identified a previously unknown regulator of gene expression in this bacterium, the absence of which significantly reduces the infectious power of P. aeruginosa and its dangerous nature. These results, to be published in the journal Nucleic Acid Research, could constitute an innovative target in the fight against this pathogen.RNA helicases perform essential regulatory functions by binding and unwinding various RNA molecules to perform their functions. RNA helicases are present in the genomes of almost all known living organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and humans; however, they have acquired specific properties depending on the organism in which they are found. ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa has an RNA helicase whose function was unknown, but which was found in other pathogens"", explains Martina Valentini, a researcher leading this research in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, and holder of an SNSF ""Ambizione  grant.

It s a grand calculation known as a life cycle assessment (LCA), and greenhouse gas emissions are a key component.For corn ethanol, most greenhouse gas emissions can be mapped to the fuel s production, transportation, and combustion, but a large portion of the greenhouse gas calculation can be traced right back to the farm. Because of privacy concerns, however, scientists can t access individual farm management decisions such as fertilizer type and rate. Nitrogen fertilizer data are an important piece of the calculation because a portion of these fertilizers wind up in the atmosphere in the form of nitrous oxide, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Corn nitrogen fertilizer data are publicly available at the national and state levels, but scientists argue this level of resolution masks what s really being applied on farms across the country and could lead to inaccurate LCAs for corn ethanol. In a new study from the University of Illinois and the U.S. Department of Energy s Argonne National Laboratory, researchers developed the first county-level nitrogen application datasets for corn, dramatically improving the accuracy of greenhouse gas calculations for the crop.  Having good data is really important to foster both a shared discussion and greater confidence in LCAs. We ve seen some abuses of life cycle analysis using really crude numbers, downscaling big averages that can really vary a lot. So even though the county level still isn t as precise as we would like, it's a big accomplishment to get to that scale,  says Michelle Wander, professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at Illinois and co-author on the study. Hoyoung Kwon, principal environmental scientist in the Systems Assessments Center at Argonne and co-author on the study, says the protocol and findings will help the agricultural and bioeconomy community better understand the impacts of high-resolution nitrogen fertilizer data on corn-based biofuel LCAs.  Nitrous oxide makes up about half of the total greenhouse gases associated with corn farming,  Kwon says.  Now we can differentiate nitrous oxide emission associated with corn farming on the county level, and can show how much these emissions vary with location and farming practice.  Yushu Xia, who led the analysis and recently finished her doctoral program with Wander, used two approaches to determine county-level nitrogen fertilizer and manure usage. The first, which Xia calls the top-down approach, was a bit like putting a puzzle together using different-sized pieces. At the county level, she found data for nitrogen fertilizer and manure inputs, but the numbers were aggregated across all crops, not corn specifically. The state level dataset included fertilized area in corn, so it was a matter of matching county with state. The state dataset also included nitrogen inputs, but aggregated them across fertilizer types. Data validation, or double-checking state and country information, therefore became another puzzle.  For the top-down approach, we used data derived from fertilizer sales, information compiled by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials. So we assume these numbers are relatively accurate; somebody actually bought that nitrogen. Yushu went through painstaking effort, basically using that crop data layer like a jigsaw puzzle to figure out how much corn is where and in what rotation over time. And then also for the manure: How many animals are there? Where are they? What kind of animal waste and how much? It's literally a budgeting effort to try to find out what's reasonable and true,  Wander says. Xia s second approach took corn yield, crop rotations, and soil properties from the county level and estimated nitrogen inputs based on the amount of nitrogen it would take to achieve that yield. Comparing the results of the two approaches told Xia farmers are applying nitrogen in excess of what s needed.  Nationally, the weighted averages of corn nitrogen inputs based on corn planted area exceeded nitrogen needs by 60 kilograms per hectare, with a nitrogen surplus found in 80% of all U.S. corn producing counties,  Xia says. Excess application was most pronounced in the Midwest, followed by the Northern Plains. The Southeast and Northwest had comparatively low nitrogen application rates and surplus levels. Western states were more variable overall. Xia says the technique can be useful beyond nitrous oxide emissions estimations.  Our approach can also be used to estimate nitrogen leaching, ammonia emissions, other greenhouse gas emissions, or the water and carbon footprint. These data improvements can really help to create and utilize better ecosystem models and life cycle analysis.  Kwon indicates the new approach could potentially be used by policymakers at the national level.  The EPA's national greenhouse gas inventory report currently uses state-level nitrogen fertilizer data to generate national estimates of nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer. If they apply these high-resolution county-level data, they can refine those numbers on a national scale.  The results could also help farmers make more informed management decisions.  Fertilizer prices are sky high right now, so since our results suggest some farmers are over-applying up to a third of their nitrogen, they could probably back off a bit and save some money,  Wander says.ReferenceXia Y, Kwon H, Wander M.

They circulate in our bodies and hunt in infected tissues to ingest, kill, and digest harmful pathogens. To become such effective killers in the very complex situation of an inflamed tissue, they work together as a collective. They release chemical signals to attract other cells to form impressive clusters of cells and attack as a swarm. Researchers from the MPI of Immunobiology and Epigenetics in Freiburg decipher the basic biology of neutrophil swarming and now show that the cells also evolved an intrinsic molecular program to self-limit their swarming activity. The study published in the scientific journal Science elucidates how swarming neutrophils become insensitive to their own secreted signals that brought the swarm together in the first place. This process is crucial for the efficient elimination of bacteria in tissues. The findings by the Max Planck Researchers in collaboration with scientists from several other research institutes open up new perspectives on the biological principles of self-organization, likely also relevant for other forms of collective behavior in cells and animals. Moreover, a better understanding of the biology of neutrophils is, therefore, a step towards targeted therapeutic intervention to address pathological inflammatory conditions.The body is well protected against invading pathogens by barriers such as the skin. But if you injure yourself and break your skin, pathogens can easily enter your body through the wound and cause severe infections. If this occurs, the innate immune system takes over the first rapid defense with an effective arsenal of cellular weapons infiltrating the wounded tissue in large numbers. As one of the first cell types on the spot, neutrophil granulocytes are recruited within few hours from the bloodstream to the infection site to eliminate potential microbial invaders. Neutrophils are very efficient in hunting and killing bacteria,  says Tim L mmermann. The group leader at the MPI of Immunobiology and Epigenetics in Freiburg studies this important cell type. Neutrophils are highly abundant cells that make up about 50-70% of white blood cells in the human body. It is estimated that 100 billion neutrophils are produced from stem cells in the bone marrow in an adult every day.  These cells patrol almost all corners of our body, and they are very efficient in sensing anything potentially harmful in our body. Once individual neutrophils detect damaged cells or invading microbes in the tissue, they start secreting attractive signals that act through cell-surface receptors on neighboring neutrophils to recruit more and more cells.  By using this intercellular communication, neutrophils can act together as a cell collective and coordinate effectively their clearance for pathogens as a swarm.However, this form of beneficial inflammation can also overshoot and lead to massive tissue damage. If the intensity or the duration of the response becomes dysregulated, the same mechanisms that serve to eliminate invading pathogens can also cause collateral damage to healthy tissues. For example, the substances that neutrophils release to kill invading pathogens also erode the meshwork of proteins and sugars, which provides structural support to tissues.  In this study, we started with the question what stops the swarming response to avoid uncontrolled neutrophil accumulation and prevent excessive inflammation, which can contribute to degenerative diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases,  says Tim L mmermann. In former studies, he and his team already discovered the molecular mechanisms initiating the collective-like swarming behavior. However, the processes that bring this response to an end have remained unknown. Neutrophil swarming is still a relatively novel topic in the inflammation and infection research fields, and the underlying mechanisms are just beginning to be investigated. The newest study by the lab of Tim L mmermann now reveals how neutrophils self-limit their swarming activity in bacteria-infected tissues and thus balance search versus destroy phases for efficient pathogen elimination. By using specialized microscopy for the real-time visualization of immune cell dynamics in living mouse tissues, the researchers demonstrate that swarming neutrophils become insensitive to their own secreted signals that initiated the swarm in the first place.  We identified a molecular break in neutrophils that stops their movement, once they sense high concentrations of accumulating swarm attractants in large neutrophil clusters  says Tim L mmermann.  This was surprising as the prevailing view suggested that external signals released from the tissue environment are critical for stopping neutrophil activity in the resolution phase of an inflammation,  comments Wolfgang Kastenm ller, collaborating scientist of the Max Planck Research Group Systems Immunology at the University of W rzburg.In light of the discovered start-stop system in neutrophils, the researchers re-evaluated current views on how neutrophils navigate in tissues to eliminate bacteria efficiently. In experiments with neutrophils lacking the stop mechanism, the team observed immune cells excessively swarming and scanning large areas of bacteria-infected tissue, which contrasted the behaviour of cells with functioning start-stop system. However, this amplified swarming and scanning did not make these cells better pathogen-killers.  Strikingly, we made the opposite finding. It is not beneficial when neutrophils move around too fast and run around like crazy. Instead, it appears more advantageous for them to stop and enjoy together a nice meal of bacteria   this is more efficient to contain bacterial growth in tissues,  explains Tim L mmermann. With these results, the team paves the way for a better understanding of neutrophil biology, which is essential for immune host defense against bacteria and could inform therapeutic approaches in the future. Moreover, the swarming behavior and underlying mechanisms could also inform other categories of collective behavior and self-organization in cells and insects.ReferenceKienle K, Glaser KM, Eickhoff S, et al.

This technique, called native state mass spectrometry, provides a quick way for scientists to identify the best candidates for effective clinical drugs, particularly in cases where bacteria can no longer be treated with antibiotics alone. This research will be presented at the American Society for Microbiology World Microbe Forum online conference on June 21, 2021.Overuse of antibiotics in the last century has led to a rise in bacterial resistance, leading to many bacterial infections that are no longer treatable with current antibiotics. In the United States each year, 2.8 million people are diagnosed with a bacterial infection that is resistant to one or more antibiotics, and 35,000 people die due to the resistant infection according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""One method of combatting antibiotic resistance is using a combination drug/inhibitor therapy,"" said Caitlyn Thomas, a Ph.D. candidate in chemistry, presenting author on the study. An example of this type of therapy is Augmentin, a prescription antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, which is composed of the antibiotic amoxicillin and the inhibitor clavulanic acid. Clavulanic acid inactivates a key protein that the bacterium uses to become resistant to amoxicillin. With the bacterial protein inactivated, the antibiotic -- amoxicillin -- is left to kill the bacteria, thereby treating the infection.Before any new inhibitor can be used in the clinic, scientists need to have a complete understanding of how the inhibitor works. In the current study, Thomas and her team studied a bacterial protein called metallo-beta-lactamase, which renders many clinical strains of bacteria resistant to all penicillin-like antibiotics. Penicillin-like antibiotics make up over 60% of the entire antibiotic arsenal that is available to treat bacterial infections.While many research labs throughout the world are attempting to create new inhibitors that inactivate metallo-beta-lactamases, Thomas and collaborators instead analyze how these new inhibitors work. ""Because metallo-beta-lactamases contain two metal ions we are able to use a variety of spectroscopic techniques to study them,"" said Thomas. ""These experiments give us more insight into how to inhibitor behaves and whether it could potentially be a candidate for clinical use in the future.""Hundreds of potential inhibitors have been reported in the literature, and several patents have been filed dealing with metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. Some of the reported inhibitors work by removing a required component of the metallo-beta-lactamase. These same inhibitors may remove this same required component of other proteins in humans, causing serious side effects. Other inhibitors bind directly to the metallo-beta-lactamase and inactivate the protein; inhibitors of this type are optimal for any new inhibitor that could be used in the clinic.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The findings, published in Current Biology, describe how the ""trash bags"" in a cell--called autophagosomes--are tagged to direct their movement to the cellular ""recycling plants"" where waste is processed. The research opens new paths to understanding the relationship between autophagy and age-related diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders.""Our latest study identifies how a chemical modification (phosphate-related tag) of a key autophagosome component, the protein called LCB3, helps direct the transport of autophagosomes within the cell in the right direction,"" says Malene Hansen, Ph.D., professor at Sanford Burnham Prebys and senior author of the study. ""We previously reported that LCB3, which is found on the surface of autophagosomes, needs to be tagged for autophagy to function effectively. Now we have a better understanding of how tagging happens and how important it is for autophagosome movement.""In addition to their own laboratory studies, the Hansen lab worked with colleagues in the lab of Sandra Encalada, Ph.D., at the Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, leaders in the field of transport of cellular components in neurons. Those investigations showed that blocking the chemical modification of the LC3B protein disrupted the efficient transport of autophagosomes toward the cellular recycling plants.""Waste transport in a cell is like moving garbage trucks down a highway,"" says Jose Luis Nieto-Torres, Ph.D., a postdoc in the Hansen laboratory and first author of the study. ""Together with our collaborators, we studied the process in nerve cells because they are long and flat, which helps us observe the directional aspects of transport, a critical aspect for waste recycling via autophagy.""We clearly saw that if phosphate tagging of LC3B was hampered, autophagosomes, or the trash bags filled with waste, failed to move in the direction of lysosomes--cell's recycling plant. This is potentially very harmful to the health of a cell. It's somewhat analogous to what would happen if a garbage truck didn't pick up your trash--your waste could accumulate, become scattered in the neighborhood and create a health hazard.""As a next step, the researchers want to figure out which waste products are selected for recycling and how a cell determines when to start moving the waste.""My lab's research efforts are focused on the relationship between aging and autophagy,"" concludes Hansen. ""Based on this discovery, we have a new, potential entry point to modulate the activity of recycling in a cell, which may prove relevant to understanding the diminished functions of autophagy that are known to occur in aging cells.

As reported in Science Advances, that mechanism involves spurring the release of small proteins known as chemokines which, in turn, recruit antitumor immune cells (CD8+ T cells) to the tumor site to block metastasis, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of a new generation of immunotherapies.""Immunotherapeutics have shown tremendous promise in recent years, but the fact is their response rate for many types of cancers is very low,"" says senior author Shadmehr (Shawn) Demehri, MD, PhD, an investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology and the Cutaneous Biology Research Center at MGH. ""We showed how cells exposed to certain carcinogens become immunogenic, that is, become targets for the immune attack, and how that exposure might be exploited to treat such major forms of cancer as breast and other epithelial cancers.""CD8+ T cells are known to effectively attack the cells exposed to environmental carcinogens. But in the past, science has focused mainly on the mutations caused by these exposures in a patient's heritable DNA as the reason for the immune attack. In their laboratory work with mice, the MGH team demonstrated for the first time another consequence of carcinogen exposure that can have significant immunologic implications, namely, the nongenetic alteration of cells through such harmful environmental factors as smoking, ultraviolet light and pollution.""This finding is particularly important because it could open the door to therapeutic interventions that aren't practical with a DNA approach, since no clinician wants to introduce even more genetic mutations into cancer cells just to make them more immunogenic,"" explains Demehri. ""We learned if there was another immunogenic element associated with carcinogen exposure independent of or even complementary to the presence of the mutation, then you could deliver that factor into a 'cold' tumor to make it 'hot,' meaning it would become immunogenic and responsive to immunotherapies.""That factor is a chemokine known as CCL21, which MGH researchers found to be expressed in breast cancer cells in mice that were exposed to DMBA, a carcinogen similar to that found in cigarette smoke. ""Through its signaling, CCL21 recruits CD8+ T cells which infiltrate the tumor, as previous work has shown, and are associated with a significant reduction in relative risk of distant metastasis,"" says lead author Kaiwen Li, MD, an investigator in MGH's Center for Cancer Immunology, MGH's Cutaneous Biology Research Center and the Department of Urology at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital at China's Sun Yat-sen University. ""Not only does CCL21 induce an antitumor immune response to prevent metastasis, but it overcomes other immune cells known as Tregs (immunosuppressive regulatory T cells) present in tumors from inhibiting the work of the CD8+ T cells.""As an example of how this unique mechanism could be used therapeutically, the MGH team reported that an injection of CCL21 into the tumor might be able to transform cold breast cancers into hot tumors responsive to current immunotherapies.""We hope that researchers will use these findings to open a much wider field of investigation into cancer immunology,"" emphasizes Demehri.

Their findings, published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, have indicated that regular urine tests could help early detection and treatment of brain tumors, possibly leading to improved patient survival.Early diagnosis of brain tumors is often difficult, partly because most people undergo a brain CT or MRI scan only after the onset of neurological deficits, such as immobility of limbs, and incapability of speech. When brain tumors are detected by CT or MRI, in many cases, they have already grown too large to be fully removed, which could lower patients' survival rate. From this perspective, accurate, easy, and inexpensive methods of early brain tumor detection are strongly desired.As a diagnostic biomarker of cancerous tumors, microRNAs (tiny molecules of nucleic acid) have recently received considerable attention. MicroRNAs are secreted from various cells, and exist in a stable and undamaged condition within extracellular vesicles in biological fluids like blood and urine. Nagoya University researchers focused on microRNAs in urine as a biomarker of brain tumors. ""Urine can be collected easily without putting a burden on the human body,"" says Nagoya University Associate Professor Atsushi Natsume, a corresponding author of the study.""Urine-based liquid biopsy hadn't been fully investigated for patients with brain tumors, because none of the conventional methodologies can extract microRNAs from urine efficiently in terms of varieties and quantities. So, we decided to develop a device capable of doing it.""The new device they developed is equipped with 100 million zinc oxide nanowires, which can be sterilized and mass-produced, and is therefore suitable for actual medical use. The device can extract a significantly greater variety and quantity of microRNAs from only a milliliter of urine compared to conventional methods.Their analysis of microRNAs collected using the device from the urine of patients with brain tumors and non-cancer individuals revealed that many microRNAs derived from brain tumors actually exist in urine in a stable condition.Next, the researchers examined whether urinary microRNAs can serve as a biomarker of brain tumors, using their diagnostic model based on the expression of microRNAs in urine samples from patients with brain tumors and non-cancer individuals. The results showed that the model can distinguish the patients from non-cancer individuals at a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97%, regardless of the malignancy and size of tumors. The researchers thus concluded that microRNAs in urine is a promising biomarker of brain tumors.The researchers hope that their findings will contribute to early diagnosis of aggressive types of brain cancer, like glioblastomas, as well as other types of cancer. Dr. Natsume says, ""In the future, by a combination of artificial intelligence and telemedicine, people will be able to know the presence of cancer, whereas doctors will be able to know the status of cancer patients just with a small amount of their daily urine.""Reference: Kitano Y, Aoki K, Ohka F, et al.

New research published today in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal proposes a new theory of human cognitive evolution entitled  Complementary Cognition  which suggests that in adapting to dramatic environmental and climactic variabilities our ancestors evolved to specialise in different, but complementary, ways of thinking. Lead author Dr Helen Taylor, Research Associate at the University of Strathclyde and Affiliated Scholar at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge, explained,  This system of complementary cognition functions in a way that is similar to evolution at the genetic level but instead of underlying physical adaptation, may underlay our species  immense ability to create behavioural, cultural and technological adaptations. It provides insights into the evolution of uniquely human adaptations like language suggesting that this evolved in concert with specialisation in human cognition. The theory of complementary cognition proposes that our species cooperatively adapt and evolve culturally through a system of collective cognitive search alongside genetic search which enables phenotypic adaptation (Darwin s theory of evolution through natural selection can be interpreted as a  search  process) and cognitive search which enables behavioural adaptation. Dr Taylor continued,  Each of these search systems is essentially a way of adapting using a mixture of building on and exploiting past solutions and exploring to update them; as a consequence, we see evolution in those solutions over time. This is the first study to explore the notion that individual members of our species are neurocognitively specialised in complementary cognitive search strategies. Complementary cognition could lie at the core of explaining the exceptional level of cultural adaptation in our species and provides an explanatory framework for the emergence of language. Language can be viewed as evolving both as a means of facilitating cooperative search and as an inheritance mechanism for sharing the more complex results of complementary cognitive search. Language is viewed as an integral part of the system of complementary cognition.The theory of complementary cognition brings together observations from disparate disciplines, showing that they can be viewed as various faces of the same underlying phenomenon. Dr Taylor continued,  For example, a form of cognition currently viewed as a disorder, dyslexia, is shown to be a neurocognitive specialisation whose nature in turn predicts that our species evolved in a highly variable environment. This concurs with the conclusions of many other disciplines including palaeoarchaeological evidence confirming that the crucible of our species  evolution was highly variable.  Nick Posford, CEO, British Dyslexia Association said,  As the leading charity for dyslexia, we welcome Dr Helen Taylor s ground-breaking research on the evolution of complementary cognition. Whilst our current education and work environments are often not designed to make the most of dyslexia-associated thinking, we hope this research provides a starting point for further exploration of the economic, cultural and social benefits the whole of society can gain from the unique abilities of people with dyslexia. At the same time, this may also provide insights into understanding the kind of cumulative cultural evolution seen in our species. Specialisation in complementary search strategies and cooperatively adapting would have vastly increased the ability of human groups to produce adaptive knowledge, enabling us to continually adapt to highly variable conditions. But in periods of greater stability and abundance when adaptive knowledge did not become obsolete at such a rate, it would have instead accumulated, and as such complementary cognition may also be a key factor in explaining cumulative cultural evolution.Complementary cognition has enabled us to adapt to different environments, and may be at the heart of our species  success, enabling us to adapt much faster and more effectively than any other highly complex organism. However, this may also be our species  greatest vulnerability. Dr Taylor concluded,  The impact of human activity on the environment is the most pressing and stark example of this. The challenge of collaborating and cooperatively adapting at scale creates many difficulties and we may have unwittingly put in place a number of cultural systems and practices, particularly in education, which are undermining our ability to adapt. These self-imposed limitations disrupt our complementary cognitive search capability and may restrict our capacity to find and act upon innovative and creative solutions.  Complementary cognition should be seen as a starting point in exploring a rich area of human evolution and as a valuable tool in helping to create an adaptive and sustainable society. Our species may owe our spectacular technological and cultural achievements to neurocognitive specialisation and cooperative cognitive search, but our adaptive success so far may belie the importance of attaining an equilibrium of approaches. If this system becomes maladjusted, it can quickly lead to equally spectacular failures to adapt   and to survive, it is critical that this system be explored and understood further.Reference: Taylor H, Fernandes B, Wraight S.

Multiple ongoing medical appointments and medications are burdensome for patients to manage on their own.""The problem is that most clinicians don't have the resources to keep track of every patient manually. This can lead to the patient relapsing and potentially becoming hospitalised.""Some estimates suggest that more than 80% of patients with severe mental illness will relapse several times within the firth five years of their initial treatment.Patients can relapse for a variety of reasons. They might experience intolerable side effects or little initial benefit from the medication, have a poor understanding of the need for ongoing treatment or suffer circumstances such as forgetfulness or homelessness.""This puts the patient on a downhill trajectory, can cause a worsening of symptoms and have an increased burden on the public health system,"" A/P Bidargaddi says.""AI2 delivers important data in real time, providing clinicians with an effective digital alternative to monitoring patients.""Patients included in the study had diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, bipolar or other mood disorders and had been prescribed ongoing psychotropic medications.If taken properly, antipsychotic, antidepressant and mood stabilising medications are highly effective in reducing the risk of relapse of severe mental illness.The AI2 software continuously analyses a clinician's consented patients' Medicare Benefit Scheme (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data, such as medication prescriptions, from the national My Health Records.Algorithms running on the cloud monitor the patients' data to detect gaps in continuity of care such as medical appointments attendance, prescription refills, or mental health care plan review.Once the gaps are detected, it triggers an intervention alert with the monitoring clinician, prompting them to intervene.A/P Bidargaddi says the study found that monitoring the AI dashboard is not onerous.""The two clinician monitors spend about two hours per week monitoring the dashboard, reviewing case notes and speaking with case managers,"" he says.""Feedback from the clinicians at this stage suggests they actually saved time on routine calls, as they would only contact the GP when necessary - such as if the software had detected a missed prescription refill.""While the rollout of AI2 is currently limited to SA, A/P Bidargaddi says the next step for AI2 is for a randomised controlled trial to be carried out across multiple sites.This will determine whether the technology leads to a reduction in hospitalisation over time, and whether it's cost effective.A/P Bidargaddi is working with Digital Health CRC to further refine the quality of algorithms further and explore its use in facilitating optimal care interactions for other chronic conditions such as diabetes.Reference: Bidargaddi N, Schrader G, Myles H, et al.

The research, by scientists at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, reveals new insights about vision development in the brain and could help inform prevention and treatment strategies for learning disorders. The study was funded by the National Eye Institute and is published in Nature Human Behaviour. Our study addresses how experiences, such as learning to read, shape the developing brain,  said Kalanit Grill-Spector, Ph.D., a professor at Stanford University s Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute.  Further, it sheds light on the initial functional role of brain regions that later in development process written words, before they support this important skill of reading. Grill-Spector s team used functional MRI to study areas in the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) that are stimulated by the recognition of images. About 30 children, ages 5 to 12 at their first MRI, participated in the study. While in the MRI scanner, the children viewed images from 10 different categories, including words, body parts, faces, objects, and places. The researchers mapped areas of VTC that exhibited stimulation and measured how they changed in intensity and volume on the children s subsequent MRI tests over the next one to five years.Results showed that VTC regions corresponding to face and word recognition increased with age. Compared to the 5-9-year-olds, teenagers had twice the volume of the word-selective region in VTC. Notably, as word-selective VTC volume doubled, limb-selective volume in the same region halved. According to the investigators, the decrease in limb-selectivity is directly linked to the increase in word- and face-selectivity, providing the first evidence for cortical recycling during childhood development. The loss of limb-selective volume surprised us,  said first author Marisa Nordt, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Grill-Spector s lab.   This challenges a theory of cortical development, which states that new representations, like emerging regions involved in word recognition, are sculpted on previously uncommitted cortex. Our study suggests that during childhood, cortical selectivity can change from one category to another. The study authors suggest that cortical recycling in VTC likely reflects adjustments to changing visual demands during childhood. For example, infants tend to look at faces. As they grow into toddlers and learn language, they are exploring objects and deciphering gestures. Word recognition becomes increasingly important as children learn to read.In future studies, Grill-Spector and colleagues will explore whether decreases in limb-selective VTC volume have behavioral implications, asking if deviations from observed trends have bearing on development disorders.Reference: Nordt M, Gomez J, Natu VS, et al.

Now, researchers from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) in collaboration with August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS) and have added some light to the subject: they succeeded for the first time in controlling neuronal activity in the brain using a molecule responsive to light.The study included participants from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) and was carried out in the frame of the Human Brain Project of the EU.

The gene, called TP73, produces a protein to help regulate the life cycle of a cell. Researchers found that some people with ALS have mutations in this gene and that the mutations may interfere with nerve cell health.ALS is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. People with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which often leads to total paralysis and death.Both genetic and environmental factors can contribute to the development of ALS. Approximately 15% of cases are diagnosed as familial ALS, which is when a person has more than one family member who also had the disease. Cases with no known genetic cause are called sporadic ALS.""Much remains unknown about the genetics and processes that lead to the development of ALS,"" said study author Lynn B. Jorde, PhD, of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. ""While known gene variants are critical determinants of 68% of familial ALS cases, they only account for 17% of sporadic ALS, yet up to 61% of sporadic ALS is believed to be influenced by genetic factors. Our study has identified a new genetic risk factor for sporadic ALS, rare mutations in the gene TP73. We also found that mutations of this gene have a damaging effect on protein function and that the protein created by this gene is necessary for nerve cell health.""For the study, 87 people with sporadic ALS provided blood samples. Researchers used a technique called exome sequencing to examine the protein-coding genes for each participant. In this group, researchers found that five people had rare mutations in the TP73 gene.Researchers then looked at two additional groups with sporadic ALS, totaling nearly 2,900 people, and found an additional 19 people with rare mutations in the TP73 gene.When researchers looked at the genes of a control group of 324 people without ALS, they found no mutations in TP73.In the lab, researchers did additional experiments on cells and found when there were mutations of the TP73 gene, it led to abnormal cell differentiation and increased cell death. They also used CRISPR gene editing technology to remove the TP73 gene and found it led to impaired development of nerve cells, similar to what is seen in ALS.""Together, our results strongly suggest that mutations in the gene TP73 increase the risk of ALS,"" said Jorde. ""Our research indicates that cell death linked to these mutations may be factor in the development of ALS. This discovery provides a new target for researchers working to develop therapies to slow or even stop the progression of ALS.""The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and Target ALS.Reference: Russell KL, Downie JM, Gibson SB, et al.

Or do you prefer the bold colors and abstract shapes of a Rothko? Individual art tastes have a certain mystique to them, but now a new Caltech study shows that a simple computer program can accurately predict which paintings a person will like.The new study, appearing in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, utilized Amazon's crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk to enlist more than 1,500 volunteers to rate paintings in the genres of impressionism, cubism, abstract, and color field. The volunteers' answers were fed into a computer program and then, after this training period, the computer could predict the volunteers' art preferences much better than would happen by chance.""I used to think the evaluation of art was personal and subjective, so I was surprised by this result,"" says lead author Kiyohito Iigaya, a postdoctoral scholar who works in the laboratory of Caltech professor of psychology John O'Doherty.The findings not only demonstrated that computers can make these predictions but also led to a new understanding about how people judge art.""The main point is that we are gaining an insight into the mechanism that people use to make aesthetic judgments,"" says O'Doherty. ""That is, that people appear to use elementary image features and combine over them. That's a first step to understanding how the process works.""In the study, the team programmed the computer to break a painting's visual attributes down into what they called low-level features--traits like contrast, saturation, and hue--as well as high-level features, which require human judgment and include traits such as whether the painting is dynamic or still.""The computer program then estimates how much a specific feature is taken into account when making a decision about how much to like a particular piece of art,"" explains Iigaya. ""Both the low- and high-level features are combined together when making these decisions. Once the computer has estimated that, then it can successfully predict a person's liking for another previously unseen piece of art.""The researchers also discovered that the volunteers tended to cluster into three general categories: those who like paintings with real-life objects, such as an impressionist painting; those who like colorful abstract paintings, such as a Rothko; and those who like complex paintings, such as Picasso's cubist portraits. The majority of people fell into the first ""real-life object"" category. ""Many people liked the impressionism paintings,"" says Iigaya.What is more, the researchers found that they could also train a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to learn to predict the volunteer's art preferences with a similar level of accuracy. A DCNN is a type of machine-learning program, in which a computer is fed a series of training images so that it can learn to classify objects, such as cats versus dogs. These neural networks have units that are connected to each other like neurons in a brain. By changing the strength of the connection of one unit to another, the network can ""learn.""In this case, the deep-learning approach did not include any of the selected low- or high-level visual features used in the first part of the study, so the computer had to ""decide"" what features to analyze on its own.""In deep-neural-network models, we do not actually know exactly how the network is solving a particular task because the models learn by themselves much like real brains do,"" explains Iigaya. ""It can be very mysterious, but when we looked inside the neural network, we were able to tell that it was constructing the same feature categories we selected ourselves."" These results hint at the possibility that features used for determining aesthetic preference might emerge naturally in a brain-like architecture.""We are now actively looking at whether this is indeed the case by looking at people's brains while they make these same types of decisions,"" says O'Doherty.In another part of the study, the researchers also demonstrated that their simple computer program, which had already been trained on art preferences, could accurately predict which photos volunteers would like. They showed the volunteers photographs of swimming pools, food, and other scenes, and saw similar results to those involving paintings. Additionally, the researchers showed that reversing the order also worked: after first training volunteers on photos, they could use the program to accurately predict the subjects' art preferences.While the computer program was successful at predicting the volunteers' art preferences, the researchers say there is still more to learn about the nuances that go into any one individual's taste.""There are aspects of preferences unique for a given individual that we have not succeeded in explaining using this method,"" says O'Doherty. ""This more idiosyncratic component may relate to semantic features, or the meaning of a painting, past experiences, and other individual personal traits that might influence valuation. It still may be possible to identify and learn about those features in a computer model, but to do so will involve a more detailed study of each individual's preferences in a way that may not generalize across individuals as we found here.""Reference: Iigaya K, Yi S, Wahle IA, Tanwisuth K, O Doherty JP.

It wasn't until 2010 that evolutionary biologist Professor Eske Willerslev was able to use pioneering shotgun DNA sequencing to reconstruct the genetic history of the hair.He found it came from a man from the earliest known people to settle in Greenland known as the Saqqaq culture. It was the first time scientists had recovered an entire ancient human genome.Now a review of the first decade of ancient genomics of the Americas published in Nature today (June 16 2021) written by Professor Willerslev a Fellow of St John's College, University of Cambridge, and director of The Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre, University of Copenhagen, with one of his longstanding collaborators Professor David Meltzer, an archaeologist based at Southern Methodist University, Texas, shows how the world's first analysis of an ancient genome sparked an incredible 'decade of discovery'.Professor Willerslev said: ""The last ten years has been full of surprises in the understanding of the peopling of the Americas - I often feel like a child at Christmas waiting to see what exciting DNA present I am about to unwrap! What has really blown my mind is how resilient and capable the early humans we have sequenced DNA from were - they occupied extremely different environments and often populated them in a short space of time.""We were taught in school that people would stay put until the population grew to a level where the resources were exhausted. But we found people were spreading around the world just to explore, to discover, to have adventures.""The last 10 years have shown us a lot about our history and what it means to be human. We won't ever see that depth of human experience on this planet again - people entered new areas with absolutely no idea of what was in front of them. It tells us a lot about human adaptability and how humans behave.""For decades, scientists relied on archaeological findings to reconstruct the past and theories weren't always accurate. It was previously thought, that there were early non-Native American people in the Americas but the ancient DNA analysis so far has shown that all of the ancient remains found are more closely related to contemporary Native Americans than to any other population anywhere else in the world.Professor Meltzer, who worked on the review with Professor Willerslev while the former was at St John's College as a Beaufort Visiting Scholar added: ""Genomic evidence has shown connections that we didn't know existed between different cultures and populations and the absence of connections that we thought did exist. Human population history been far more complex than previously thought.""A lot of what has been discovered about the peopling of the Americas could not have been predicted. We have seen how rapidly people were moving around the world when they have a continent to themselves, there was nothing to hold them back. There was a selective advantage to seeing what was over the next hill.""In 2013, scientists mapped the genome of a four-year-old boy who died in south-central Siberia 24,000 years ago. The burial of an Upper Palaeolithic Siberian child was discovered in the 1920s by Russian archaeologists near the village of Mal'ta, along the Belaya river. Sequencing of the Mal'ta genome was key as it showed the existence of a previously unsampled population that contributed to the ancestry of Siberian and Native American populations.Two years later, Professor Willerslev and his team published the first ancient Native American genome, sequenced from the remains of a baby boy ceremonially buried more than 12,000 years ago in Anzick, Montana.In 2015, their ancient genomic analysis was able to solve the mystery of Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most complete skeletons ever found in the Americas, and one of the most controversial.The 9,000-year-old remains had been surrounded by a storm of controversy when legal jurisdiction over the skeleton became the focus of a decade of lawsuits between five Native American tribes, who claimed ownership of the man they called Ancient One, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.Professor Willerslev, who has rightly learnt to be mindful of cultural sensitivities when searching for ancient DNA, has spent much of the past decade talking to tribal community members to explain his work in detail and seek their support.This meant he was able to agree with members of the Colville Tribe, based in Washington State where the remains were found, that they would donate some of their DNA to allow Professor Willerslev and his team to establish if there was a genetic link between them and Kennewick Man.Jackie Cook, a descendant of the Colville Tribe and the repatriation specialist for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, said: ""We had spent nearly 20 years trying to have the Ancient One repatriated to us. There has been a long history of distrust between scientists and our Native American tribes but when Eske presented to us about his DNA work on the Anzick child, the hair on my arms stood up.""We knew we shouldn't have to agree to DNA testing, and there were concerns that we would have to do it every time to prove cultural affiliation, but our Council members discussed it with the elders and it was agreed that any tribal member who wanted to provide DNA for the study could.""The Kennewick Man genome, like the Anzick baby, revealed the man was a direct ancestor of living Native Americans. The Ancient One was duly returned to the tribes and reburied.Cook added: ""We took a risk but it worked out. It was remarkable to work with Eske and we felt honoured, relieved and humbled to be able to resolve such an important case. We had oral stories that have passed down through the generations for thousands of years that we call coyote stories - teaching stories. These stories were from our ancestors about living alongside woolly mammoths and witnessing a series of floods and volcanoes erupting.

Scientists discovered the ancient human skeleton back in 1940 but it wasn't until 2018 that a striking discovery was made that unlocked the secrets of the Ice Age tribe in the Americas.The revelation came as part of a study that genetically analysed the DNA of a series of famous and controversial ancient remains across North and South America including Spirit Cave, the Lovelock skeletons, the Lagoa Santa remains, an Inca mummy, and the oldest remains in Chilean Patagonia.Scientists sequenced 15 ancient genomes spanning from Alaska to Patagonia and were able to track the movements of the first humans as they spread across the Americas at 'astonishing' speed during the Ice Age and also how they interacted with each other in the following millennia.The team of academics not only discovered that the Spirit Cave remains was a Native American but they were able to dismiss a longstanding theory that a group called Paleoamericans existed in North America before Native Americans. Spirit Cave was returned to The Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, a group of Native Americans based in Nevada, for burial.Professor Willerslev added: ""Over the past decade human history has been fundamentally changed thanks to ancient genomic analysis - and the incredible findings have only just begun.""Reference: Willerslev E, Meltzer DJ.

This is the first time a brain signal has been detected using a modular quantum brain sensor anywhere in the world. It's a major milestone for all researchers working on quantum brain imaging technology because modular sensors can be scaled up, like Lego bricks. The team have also connected two sensors like 'Lego bricks' proving that whole-brain scanning using this method is within reach - as detailed in their paper, which is published today in pre-print. This has not been possible with the currently commercially available quantum brain sensors from the United States.   The modular devices work like play bricks in that they can be connected together. This opens up the potential for whole-brain scanning using quantum technology, and potential advances for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.  The device, which was built at the Quantum Systems and Devices laboratory at the university, uses ultra-sensitive quantum sensors to pick up these tiniest of magnetic fields to see inside the brain in order to map the neural activity.   The team applied the sensors to outside of a participant s scalp, close to the visual cortex of the brain. They asked the participant to open and close their eyes at 10-20 second intervals, and were able to detect a signal. This is a very simple action, but to see it happening inside the brain   from the outside - requires hugely sophisticated quantum technology.  Thomas Coussens PhD student at the University of Sussex, who built the sensor, explained:  Our quantum sensor has to be exceptionally sensitive to pick up the magnetic fields in the brain which are very weak indeed.  To put it into context, the magnetic field of a brain is a trillion times lower than that of a fridge magnet.  ""Because our device is so-far unique in that it is modular - and we've shown the modularity works by connecting two sensors together - we now plan to scale up this project by building more sensors to turn this into an entire brain imaging system.  This could provide significant advancements in detecting and delivering treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s.  This is the culmination of many months of hard work and I am thrilled to see our first brain signal using our very own quantum sensors built entirely by us here at the University of Sussex."" Professor Peter Kr ger, Experimental Physicist and Director of the Sussex Programme for Quantum Research at the University of Sussex explained:  As our sensor works on a modular basis, we will now be able to scale it up to create much more detailed images of the brain or parts of the brain. You can t do that with the current commercial product available. This new sensor built at the University of Sussex opens the door for UK-produced quantum sensors, hugely important in the wider UK quantum technology landscape.       To have this sensor is a major step to further interdisciplinary studies involving researchers ranging from consciousness scientists and engineers to neuroscientists which is very much in the spirit of how we tackle research here at Sussex.  Professor Kai Bongs, Principal Investigator at the UK Quantum Technology Hub Sensors and Timing, said:  We are delighted with this ground-breaking development by Hub researchers at the University of Sussex. These successes are helping considerably to advance the UK quantum ecosystem, bringing us a step closer to exploiting quantum sensor technology in clinical applications that will have real societal impact. Building a strong quantum brain imaging capability in the UK is a great example of our collaboration.  The quantum magnetic sensor uses an optically pumped magnetometer inside a magnetic shield to reduce environmental magnetic fields and ensure they are not being detected.  In simple terms, the sensor works by putting a vapour into a quantum state, shining a laser beam through it and using a photo detector to see how much light has gone through.  How the atomic vapour interacts with the laser light very sensitively depends on the magnetic field.  The tiny electric currents in the neurons in the brain lead to very small magnetic fields even outside the brain which is what the sensor picks up. Reference: Coussens T, Abel C, Gialopsou A, et al.

The methods used to date for this purpose are mostly non-specific, making it difficult for scientists to control which cell will or will not take up a gene. For this gene transfer, the target genes are often packaged into  viral vectors.  These are viruses in which part of the genetic material has been replaced by the target genes. When researchers add these viral vectors to cells, the vectors introduce the genes into the cells. This is the principle behind some of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines such as those from AstraZeneca or Johnson&Johnson. However, it is difficult - even impossible - to control into which cells the target genes enter, since the viral vectors tend to dock non-specifically onto all cells of a certain cell type. A team of researchers from the Cluster of Excellence CIBSS - Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies at the University of Freiburg, led by Dr. Maximilian H rner, Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Schamel and Prof. Dr. Wilfried Weber, has developed a new technology that enables them to introduce target genes in a controlled manner and thereby control processes in individual selected cells.

On the other hand, papers that acknowledge mice in their titles result in limited media coverage.In addition, the study titled What s not in the news headlines or titles of Alzheimer disease articles? #Inmice conducted by Dr Marcia Triunfol of Humane Society International and Dr Fabio Gouveia of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil, and published in PLoS Biology, found that the resulting media coverage generated by papers with  missing mice  titles is also more likely to omit mice from their headlines.This is of concern because scientific findings obtained from animal experiments should be reported with caution due to their limited relevance to human health. The biology and physiology of mice and other animals differ significantly to that of humans, such that research results obtained in animals often fail to be replicated in people. Despite that, the scientific value of articles downplaying that they relied on animal models is actually inflated by their disproportionate media exposure, raising concerns that the public and patients are being misled.Dr Triunfol, one of the study s authors and Humane Society International s scientific advisor, says:  There are around 200 animal models to study Alzheimer s disease, and yet the vast majority of potential treatments discovered through experiments on mice are ineffective when tested in humans. Despite this significant flaw in the animal models, we show that articles glossing over the fact that the results were obtained using animals are given increased visibility and therefore implied credibility by the media. The reporting of animal research needs to be addressed with far greater caution and more prominent disclaimers in mainstream media to ensure the public understands that the results of animal experiments may have little to no relevance to human patients. The study s authors looked at research published in 2018 and 2019 in open-access journals and indexed in PubMed. Of the 623 papers reviewed, 405 added  mice  in the titles but 218 made no mention of mice, despite the fact that in both groups mice were the main research subjects. Using Altmetric Explorer, a web-based platform that allows users to browse a report on digital attention data for research papers, Dr. Gouveia reported that he and Dr. Triunfol found that  when authors omit mice from the paper s title, writers of news stories reporting on these papers tend to follow suit. What we see is that in most cases their headlines do not mention mice either. The study also shows that papers that omit mice from their titles generate twice the number of social media tweets compared to papers that do mention mice in the title (18.8 tweets against 9.7 tweets, on average).Some examples of media stories based on mouse results but without mentioning mice in their headlines are  Common nutrient supplementation may hold the answers to combating Alzheimer s disease ,  How flashing lights could treat Alzheimer s disease  and  How Exercise Might  Clean  the Alzheimer s Brain,  among many others. Such headlines risk giving the impression that these findings apply to people with Alzheimer s disease, when in reality they apply to mice only, until/unless new scientific evidence is produced. The problem of  missing mice  in the media is so common, that in March 2019 @justsaysinmice burst onto Twitter (now with 70.5K followers) with the aim of drawing attention to headline news stories in which mice   the subject of the breakthrough   go unacknowledged.Drs Triunfol and Gouveia call for implementation of editorial policies, such as the ARRIVE guidelines (an internationally accepted checklist of recommendations to improve the reporting of research involving animals), to require that titles of experimental articles identify the species and/or tissue sources used in the research, if not derived from humans. By improving the quality of scientific reporting, we can improve the accuracy of science media news and encourage greater transparency concerning the true state of affairs in Alzheimer s disease research.Reference: Triunfol M, Gouveia FC.

The peptides might someday be used to treat degenerative retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study published today in the Journal of Neurochemistry. NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health.A team led by Patricia Becerra, Ph.D., chief of the NEI Section on Protein Structure and Function, had previously derived these peptides from a protein called pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), which is produced by retinal pigment epithelial cells that line the back of the eye. In the eye, PEDF protects neurons from dying. It prevents the invasion of blood vessels, it prevents inflammation, it has antioxidant properties all these are beneficial properties,  said Becerra, the senior author of the study. Her studies suggest that PEDF is part of the eye s natural mechanism for maintaining eye health.  PEDF may have a role for treating eye disease. If we want to exploit the protein for therapeutics, we need to separate out the regions responsible for its various properties and determine how each of them works. The team used a well-known cell culture model system where immature retinal cells are isolated from the eyes of newborn rats and grown in a dish with minimal nutrients. The system includes not only the retina s light-sensing photoreceptors, but additional types of neurons that help the retina process and transmit visual information to the brain. Our model system   using cells isolated from the animal   lets us tease out the individual processes and mechanisms behind PEDF s protective effects,  said Germ n Michelis, graduate student and the study s first author.The PEDF protein has functionally distinct domains. The Becerra lab previously found that each domain can work independently. One area, which is called the 34-mer because it is formed by 34 amino acid building blocks, halts blood vessel growth. Aberrant blood vessel growth is central to retinal diseases such as AMD and diabetic retinopathy. The second PEDF domain, called the 44-mer, provides anti-death signals to retinal neurons. The 44-mer can also stimulate neurons to grow neurites, finger-like projections that help the neurons communicate with their neighbors. A shorter version of the 44-mer of only 17 amino acids (17-mer) has identical activities.Michelis and colleagues tested whether the 44-mer could protect immature retinal cells in a dish. Without the presence of proteins and other cells in their usual retinal environment, immature photoreceptors quickly die but can be preserved with PEDF.They found that both the 44-mer and 17-mer were as capable of saving these photoreceptors as full length PEDF.The researchers also found that PEDF activity appears to be most needed at a specific point in photoreceptor cell development. Light detection takes place in a part of the photoreceptor known as the outer segment, where light-sensing opsin proteins are concentrated. The scientists found that when a photoreceptor cell is just beginning to create its outer segments, PEDF triggers the movement of opsin into the budding outer segment, where it belongs.Along with photoreceptors, the retina is packed with several other types of neurons, which work together to process visual signals. Via neurites, amacrine neurons form connections, called synapses, to the cells that forward these visual signals to the brain. Becerra and colleagues found that PEDF stimulates amacrine cells to develop neurites in their cell culture model and that the 44-mer and 17-mer were at least as effective - or better - at stimulating these connections than the native protein.Further, the 44-mer and 17-mer peptides work by binding to a protein receptor (PEDF-R) on the surface of neurons. PEDF activates PEDF-R, which processes molecules like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid critical for babies  development and for eye health. PEDF-R was discovered previously by the Becerra lab. We ve known for a long time that DHA is important for retinal health. We think PEDF signaling might be a key component of regulating omega-3 fatty acids like DHA, both during eye development and in maintaining the eye s health over time,  said Becerra.  We re hoping that we can harness some of these protective effects in a peptide-based therapeutic approach in the near future. Reference: Michelis G, German OL, Villasmil R, et al.

""Once you take tumors out of their natural environment, cell lines start to change,"" says Cahan.Scientists worldwide rely on a range of research models to improve their understanding of cancer and other disease biology and develop treatments for conditions. Among the most widely used cancer research models are cell lines created by extracting cells from human tumors and growing them with various nutrients in laboratory flasks.Researchers also use mice that have been genetically engineered to develop cancer. In other cases, they implant human tumors into mice, a process called xenografting, or use tumoroids.To evaluate how well any of these research models align with what may be happening in people, scientists often transplant lab-cultured cells or cells from tumoroids or xenografts into mice and see if the cells behave as they should -- that is, grow and spread and retain the genetic hallmarks of cancer. However, the Johns Hopkins researchers say this process is expensive, time-consuming and scientifically challenging.The goal of the new work was to develop a computational approach to evaluating research models in a less cumbersome and accurate way. A report on the work was published April 29 in Genome Medicine, and the researchers have filed for a provisional patent on what they named CancerCellNet.The new technique is based on genetic information about cellular RNA, a molecular string of chemicals similar to DNA and an intermediate set of instructions cells used to translate DNA into the manufacture of proteins.""RNA is a pretty good surrogate for cell type and cell identity, which are key to determining whether lab-developed cells resemble their human counterparts,"" says Cahan. ""RNA expression data is very standardized and available to researchers, and less subject to technical variation that can confound a study's results.""First, Cahan and his team had to choose a standard set of data that acted as a baseline to compare the research models. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas served as the so-called ""training"" data, which includes RNA expression information of hundreds of patient tumor samples, and their corresponding stage, grade and other tumor information.They also tested their CancerCellNet tool by applying it to data where the tumor type was already known, such as from the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium.Members of the research team combed through The Cancer Genome Atlas data to determine 22 types of tumors to study. They used the genome atlas data as the baseline for comparing RNA expression data from 657 cancer cell lines grown in labs worldwide, some of which were established decades ago, 415 xenografts, 26 genetically engineered mouse models and 131 tumoroids.In one example from the study, prostate cancer cells from a line called PC3 start to look genetically more like bladder cancer, he notes. It's also possible, he says, that the cell line was originally labeled incorrectly or it could have actually been derived from bladder cancer. But the bottom line was that from a genetic standpoint, the prostate cancer cell line was not a representative surrogate for what happens in a typical human with prostate cancer.The investigators found that, using a 0-1 scoring method, cell lines had, on average, lower scoring alignment to atlas data than tumoroids and xenografts.Cahan says he and his team will be adding additional RNA sequencing data to improve the reliability of CancerCellNet.Reference: Peng D, Gleyzer R, Tai W-H, et al.

Characterized by excessive inflammation that can cause tissue decay in the bowels, the disease provides a pathway for infectious and deadly bacteria to enter the bloodstream.Despite four decades of research, effective treatments remain elusive, and mortality rates in babies who develop the disease have remained essentially unchanged, hovering at about 30%.Now, a study led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has identified, in mice, a protein in the immune system that may protect babies from necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and lead to the development of new treatments.The findings are published online June 15 in Cell Reports Medicine.""Necrotizing enterocolitis is a serious, fast-acting condition that can lead to death within hours,"" said the study's senior author, Misty Good, MD, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the Division of Newborn Medicine. ""We don't know why NEC happens, and we can try to treat it with antibiotics and surgical removal of the dead tissue; however, in severe cases, many babies will still die. No treatments stop the disease from progressing, but our hope is that the protein we've identified will change that.""The scientists focused on Interleukin-22 (IL-22), a protein that regulates immune responses and helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome in adults.Over the years, research has suggested that IL-22 has a critical role in adult gastrointestinal diseases. Consequently, potential treatments involving IL-22 are being studied in COVID-19 illness, alcohol-induced liver disease, and graft-versus-host disease that develops after organ or bone marrow transplants. However, IL-22's role in newborns' intestines has been unclear.To better understand the protein's role, the researchers created a mouse model to examine IL-22 signaling and production in healthy intestines and in intestines damaged by NEC. They analyzed IL-22 levels before and after birth and into adulthood, which for mice begins when they are weaned, at about 28 days old. In both the healthy and diseased intestines, the researchers documented low postnatal IL-22 production up until day 21, when production skyrocketed for the mice and continued into adulthood.The researchers also studied tissue samples from preemies who did and did not develop NEC. The scientists found low levels of IL-22 in all of the intestinal samples. And in the babies who had developed NEC, an appropriate immune response had not been mounted in the intestines.""Immune cells in the neonatal intestine have shown an inability to produce adequate amounts of IL-22 to control the progression of NEC,"" said Good, who treats patients at St. Louis Children's Hospital and is also co-program director of the university's Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine Fellowship. As a member of the scientific advisory council of the Necrotizing Enterocolitis Society, Good has led an effort involving seven medical centers that have developed a large biorepository of samples from infants affected by NEC.Good surmised that immature intestines are associated with a lack of IL-22 production, a theory strengthened by the fact that premature infants weighing less than 3 pounds 5 ounces are most at risk for NEC. Typically, the more premature a baby is, the lower the baby's weight and the more undeveloped a baby's gastrointestinal immune system is. Harmful bacteria can get cross the gut barrier and activate the immune system. And because the immune system of preemies isn't fully developed, it leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to tissue death.The researchers' findings of low levels of IL-22 in neonatal tissues led to their next step: injecting the mice with IL-22. The protein aids in controlling inflammation while promoting regeneration of tightly packed cells lining the intestine. IL-22 can help strengthen the intestinal walls, creating a barrier in the gut that allows for nutrient absorption while preventing toxic or otherwise hostile microorganisms from seeping into the bloodstream.""Interestingly, our work demonstrated that treatment with IL-22, in mice, protects the newborn intestine against damage caused by NEC,"" Good said. ""Our study represents a substantial advance in understanding the role of IL-22 in early life and sets the stage for new ways to treat NEC in the future.""Reference: Mihi B, Gong Q, Nolan LS, et al.

If the trials are successful, POLQ inhibitors could enter the clinic as a new approach to treating a range of cancers with BRCA mutations, such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer.Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and the pharmaceutical company Artios, explored the potential of using POLQ inhibitors in treating cancer cells with defects in the BRCA genes.Their study, published in Nature Communications, was funded by Artios, Cancer Research UK and Breast Cancer Now. For some time now, scientists have known that genetically removing a protein known as POLQ killed cells with BRCA gene defects, although drugs that prevent POLQ from working had not been identified.In this new work, the researchers identified prototype drugs that not only stop POLQ from working, but which also kill cancer cells with BRCA gene mutations.Both BRCA genes and POLQ are involved in repairing DNA. Cancer cells can survive without one or other of them, but if both are blocked or their genes switched off, cancer cells can no longer repair their DNA and they die.Researchers found that when cells were treated with POLQ inhibitors, cancer cells with BRCA gene mutations were stripped of their ability to repair their DNA and died, but normal cells did not. By killing cancer cells with BRCA gene mutations, while leaving normal cells unharmed, POLQ inhibitors could offer a treatment for cancer with relatively few side effects. Researchers also found that POLQ inhibitors work very well when used together in combination with PARP inhibitors.The addition of POLQ inhibitors meant that PARP inhibitors were effective when used at a lower dose. And in laboratory tests in rats and in organoids   three-dimensional mini-tumours grown in the lab   POLQ inhibitors were able to shrink BRCA-mutant cancers that had stopped responding to PARP inhibitors because of a defect in a set of genes known as the  Shieldins .This suggests that POLQ inhibitors could offer an alternative treatment where PARP inhibitors are no longer working. Researchers believe that using a POLQ inhibitor in combination with a PARP inhibitor in patients with cancers that have faulty BRCA genes could prevent resistance from emerging in the first place.Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), funded by Breast Cancer Now and Cancer Research UK, discovered how to genetically target PARP inhibitors against BRCA-mutant cancers and, with colleagues at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, helped run clinical trials leading to the first PARP inhibitor being approved for use.The next step will now be to test POLQ inhibitors in clinical trials led by Artios. Study co-leader, Professor Chris Lord, Professor of Cancer Genomics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Deputy Director of the Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre at the ICR, said: All cells have to be able to repair damage to their DNA to stay healthy   otherwise mutations build up and eventually kill them. We have identified a new class of precision medicine that strips cancers of their ability to repair their DNA. This new type of treatment has the potential to be effective against cancers which already have weaknesses in their ability to repair their DNA, through defects in their BRCA genes. And excitingly, the new drugs also seem to work against cancer cells that have stopped responding to an existing treatment called PARP inhibitors   potentially opening up a new way of overcoming drug resistance. I m very keen to see how they perform in clinical trials.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: It s exciting that the new POLQ inhibitors should provide a different approach to treating cancers with BRCA gene defects   and particularly that this class of drugs should retain their activity in cancers that have developed resistance to PARP inhibitors. Most exciting of all is the potential of combining POLQ and PARP inhibitor drugs to prevent the evolution of BRCA-mutant cancers into more aggressive, drug-resistant forms   a major challenge that we see in the clinic. Study Co-Leader, Dr Graeme Smith, Chief Scientific Officer at Artios Pharma, Cambridge, said: These exciting preclinical results provide a clear rationale for future clinical studies with a POLQ inhibitor. At Artios, we are on track to initiate our POLQ clinical programme before the year end to explore POLQ inhibition in the sensitive cancer types that this study has uncovered. Our planned POLQ inhibitor clinical studies will leverage these results, exploring combination treatment with PARP inhibitors and different types of DNA damaging agents. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive at Cancer Research UK said: More than 25 years ago we helped discover the BRCA gene, which spurred on our scientists to work with others to develop PARP inhibitors, which are now benefiting many patients. But we are always trying to find newer and better ways to outstep cancer, especially when it stops responding to current treatments. By revisiting weaknesses in the BRCA repair pathway, researchers have not only found a way to make PARP inhibitors more effective, but they may have also identified an entirely new class of targeted drugs for BRCA cancers, which could include pancreatic cancer which has limited treated options. We look forward to seeing if these promising results in the lab transfer into benefits for patients when tested in trials. Dr Simon Vincent, Director of Research, Support and Influencing at Breast Cancer Now, said: Men and women with a change in one of their BRCA genes are at greater risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer, and around 5% of the 55,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed in UK each year are caused by an inherited altered gene, which includes BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. It s therefore hugely exciting that POLQ inhibitors could provide a targeted treatment option for people whose cancer is caused by altered BRCA genes. As a targeted treatment, we hope that POLQ inhibitors could be a kinder alternative, with less side effects than current treatment options. Drug resistance is a major hurdle that we must tackle to stop women dying from breast cancer, so it is also exciting that POLQ inhibitors offer a hope of overcoming resistance in some cases.   We hope that future research will confirm that POLQ inhibitors can benefit people with breast cancer in these ways. Reference: Zatreanu D, Robinson HMR, Alkhatib O, et al.

But before that, they interbred with the ancestors of present-day humans, who still to this day carry genetic mutations from the extinct species.Over 40 percent of the Neanderthal genome is thought to have survived in different present-day humans of non-African descent, but spread out so that any individual genome is only composed of up to two percent Neanderthal material. Some human populations also carry genetic material from Denisovans   a mysterious group of archaic humans that may have lived in Eastern Eurasia and Oceania thousands of years ago.The introduction of beneficial genetic material into our gene pool, a process known as adaptive introgression, often happened because it was advantageous to humans after they expanded across the globe. To name a few examples, scientists believe some of the mutations affected skin development and metabolism. But many mutations are yet still undiscovered.Now, researchers from GLOBE Institute at the University of Copenhagen have developed a new method using deep learning techniques to search the human genome for undiscovered mutations. We developed a deep learning method called  genomatnn  that jointly models introgression, which is the transfer of genetic information between species, and natural selection. The model was developed in order to identify regions in the human genome where this introgression could have happened,  says Associate Professor Fernando Racimo, GLOBE Institute, corresponding author of the new study. Our method is highly accurate and outcompetes previous approaches in power. We applied it to various human genomic datasets and found several candidate beneficial gene variants that were introduced into the human gene pool,  he says. In Melanesian genomes, we found candidate variants introgressed from Denisovans that potentially affected a wide range of traits, such as blood-related diseases, tumor suppression, skin development, metabolism, and various neurological diseases. The new method is based on a so-called convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning framework commonly used in image and video recognition.Using hundreds of thousands of simulations, the researchers at the University of Copenhagen trained the CNN to identify patterns in images of the genome that would be produced by adaptive introgression with archaic humans.Besides confirming already suggested genetic mutations from adaptive introgression, the researchers also discovered possible mutations that were not known to be introgressed. We recovered previously identified candidates for adaptive introgression in modern humans, as well as several candidates which have not previously been described,  says postdoc Graham Gower, first author of the new study.Some of the previously undescribed mutations are involved in core pathways in human metabolism and immunity. In European genomes, we found two strong candidates for adaptive introgression from Neanderthals in regions of the genome that affect phenotypes related to blood, including blood cell counts. In Melanesian genomes, we found candidate variants introgressed from Denisovans that potentially affected a wide range of traits, such as blood-related diseases, tumor suppression, skin development, metabolism, and various neurological diseases. It s not clear how such traits are affected in present-day carriers of the archaic variants, e.g. neutrally, positively or negatively, although historically the introgressed genetic material is assumed to have had a positive effect on those individuals carrying them,  he explains.The next stage for the research team is to adapt the method to more complex demographic and selection scenarios to understand the overall fate of Neanderthal genetic material. Graham Gower points out that the team aims to follow up on the function of the candidate variants in the genome that they found in this study.Looking forward, it remains a challenge to search the human genome for genetic material from as yet unsampled populations, so-called ghost populations. However, the researchers are hopeful that they can further train the neural network to recognize mutations from these unsampled populations. Future work could also involve developing a CNN that can detect adaptive introgression from a ghost population, for cases in which genomic data from the source is unavailable,  says Graham Gower.Reference: Gower G, Picazo PI, Fumagalli M, Racimo F.

In particular, nanoparticles entering the soil through irrigation, fertilizers and other sources have raised concerns about whether plants absorb these minute particles enough to cause toxicity.In a new study published online in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, researchers at Texas A&M University have used machine learning to evaluate the salient properties of metallic nanoparticles that make them more susceptible for plant uptake. The researchers said their algorithm could indicate how much plants accumulate nanoparticles in their roots and shoots.Nanoparticles are a burgeoning trend in several fields, including medicine, consumer products and agriculture. Depending on the type of nanoparticle, some have favorable surface properties, charge and magnetism, among other features. These qualities make them ideal for a number of applications. For example, in agriculture, nanoparticles may be used as antimicrobials to protect plants from pathogens. Alternatively, they can be used to bind to fertilizers or insecticides and then programmed for slow release to increase plant absorption.These agricultural practices and others, like irrigation, can cause nanoparticles to accumulate in the soil. However, with the different types of nanoparticles that could exist in the ground and a staggeringly large number of terrestrial plant species, including food crops, it is not clearly known if certain properties of nanoparticles make them more likely to be absorbed by some plant species than others.""As you can imagine, if we have to test the presence of each nanoparticle for every plant species, it is a huge number of experiments, which is very time-consuming and expensive,"" said Xingmao ""Samuel"" Ma, associate professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. ""To give you an idea, silver nanoparticles alone can have hundreds of different sizes, shapes and surface coatings, and so, experimentally testing each one, even for a single plant species, is impractical.""Instead, for their study, the researchers chose two different machine learning algorithms, an artificial neural network and gene-expression programming. They first trained these algorithms on a database created from past research on different metallic nanoparticles and the specific plants in which they accumulated. In particular, their database contained the size, shape and other characteristics of different nanoparticles, along with information on how much of these particles were absorbed from soil or nutrient-enriched water into the plant body.Once trained, their machine learning algorithms could correctly predict the likelihood of a given metallic nanoparticle to accumulate in a plant species. Also, their algorithms revealed that when plants are in a nutrient-enriched or hydroponic solution, the chemical makeup of the metallic nanoparticle determines the propensity of accumulation in the roots and shoots. But if plants are grown in soil, the contents of organic matter and the clay in soil are key to nanoparticle uptake.Ma said that while the machine learning algorithms could make predictions for most food crops and terrestrial plants, they might not yet be ready for aquatic plants. He also noted that the next step in his research would be to investigate if the machine learning algorithms could predict nanoparticle uptake from leaves rather than through the roots.""It is quite understandable that people are concerned about the presence of nanoparticles in their fruits, vegetables and grains,"" said Ma. ""But instead of not using nanotechnology altogether, we would like farmers to reap the many benefits provided by this technology but avoid the potential food safety concerns.""Reference: Wang X, Liu L, Zhang W, Ma X.

The element is deposited in the soil via the air and has an impact on vegetation   to the detriment of the butterflies, as researchers at the University of Basel have discovered.More than half of butterfly species in Switzerland are considered to be at risk or potentially at risk. Usually, the search for causes focuses on intensive agriculture, pesticide use and climate change. A research team led by Professor Valentin Amrhein from the University of Basel, however, has been investigating another factor   the depositing of nitrogen from agriculture and exhaust fumes from industry and traffic in soils via the air. In the journal Conservation Biology, the research team reports a connection between this unintentional fertilization and the low diversity of butterflies in Switzerland.It was already known from previous studies that too much nitrogen leads to denser vegetation, but with a smaller selection of plant species. Nitrogen stimulates the growth of less demanding plants in particular, with more specialized species being displaced.  We wanted to find out whether a nitrogen surplus also indirectly affects the diversity of butterflies via this change in vegetation,  explains Dr. Tobias Roth, lead author of the study. The team analyzed data from Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland on the diversity and prevalence of plants and butterflies on 383 plots throughout Switzerland. The result was clear: the more nitrogen introduced via the air to the areas studied, the less diverse the vegetation and hence the butterfly species. As caterpillars, some butterfly species need certain plant species as food, or are dependent on a certain microclimate,  Roth explains. Over-fertilization results in open, warm and dry places becoming cooler, shadier and damper due to stronger plant growth. The nitrogen surplus impacts the prevalence of a large number of butterfly species in Switzerland, such as those that prefer open and dry sites. The researchers saw the clearest effect in rare and endangered species.  Nitrogen from the air is likely to be an important factor in the reason why these species are endangered,  Roth remarks.Existing literature on the diversity of butterflies explains the presence or absence of species primarily in terms of habitat quality or climate. A literature review by the research team revealed that plant diversity and vegetation density have so far received less attention.  We believe that the impact of nitrogen enrichment on butterflies has been underestimated,  says Amrhein. Nitrogen appears to play a similarly extensive role as climate change when it comes to butterfly diversity. While the researchers do not see a simple approach for improving the situation, technical improvements continue to offer a certain potential.  In the past, slurry was sprayed on farmland, for example, and some of this was transferred to other areas of land by the wind,  Roth explains. Today, he says, drag hoses are used increasingly to apply the slurry directly to the soil. This reduces nitrogen input via the air to other areas where it is not wanted. In addition, buffer zones and adapted landscape management can also help to partially mitigate the negative impact on sensitive habitats: this includes measures to prevent scrub encroachment, such as grazing or more frequent mowing. This is beneficial not only for demanding plant species, but also for butterflies. According to the researchers, however, there is ultimately no way around environmentally friendly consumer behavior when it comes to reducing unwanted nitrogen input, for example through the reduction of vehicle emissions and livestock farming. Around two thirds of nitrogen input into sensitive ecosystems in Switzerland today originate from ammonia emissions from livestock farming.ReferenceRoth T, Kohli L, Rihm B, Meier R, Amrhein V.

The focus is on pesticides such as lindane or brominated flame retardants, which accumulate in nature and in food chains. Researchers at Empa and Eawag used these bacteria to generate enzymes that can break down these dangerous chemicals.The production of chemicals is a cumbersome business. Often, only a small part of what is actually wanted is produced in the factory. The large remainder is unusable   or even worse. Examples? The defoliant ""Agent Orange"" used by the US army in the Vietnam War was produced in great hurry. It contained dioxin as an impurity. As a result, not only did trees in the combat zone lose their foliage, but US soldiers and Vietnamese civilians also fell ill with cancer years later. There are also examples from agriculture: In the production of the insecticide lindane, a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), only less than 15 percent of the desired substance is produced; 85 percent of the reaction broth is hazardous waste. In the 1950s, this toxic mixture was still sprayed in its entirety on fields and orchards. Later on the effective lindane was separated and sold pure, the rest being dumped in landfills. There the chemicals often still lie today. Lindane has been banned in the EU since 2007, and it has not been used in Switzerland for some time. The flame retardant hexabromocyclodecane (HBCD) is also a mixture of several substances. It was invented in the 1970s, produced on a scale of several 10,000 tons per year and used in polystyrene insulation boards for house facades, in textiles and in plastics for electrical appliances. It has been banned worldwide since 2014. In Switzerland, plastic containing HBCD is not recycled, but must be destroyed in waste incineration.Since 2004, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants has regulated the handling of such long-lived environmental toxins. Switzerland ratified the agreement in 2003, but all these substances are already in the environment   and finely distributed. HBCD is found in sewage sludge, in fish, in air, water and soil. In 2004, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) took blood samples from eleven European environment ministers and three health ministers and detected HBCD and lindane in the blood of every single one of them.It begs the question: Can we recapture or detoxify the chemical waste of past generations? Fortunately, scientists aren't shying away from icky places in their search for solutions. In 1991, they discovered three strains of bacteria that could consume lindane and its useless chemical siblings in chemical waste sites in France, Japan and India almost simultaneously: Sphingobium francense, Sphingobium japonicum and Sphingobium indicum. Could these bio-cleaners perhaps also digest the flame retardant HBCD and other toxins? Empa chemist Norbert Heeb and Eawag microbiologist Hans-Peter Kohler, together with researchers from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) and two Indian institutes, put them to the test. They modified the genes of the Indian bacteria and produced HCH-degrading enzymes in pure form. An enzyme is a protein molecule, a bio-catalyst so to speak, with which bacteria, but also other living cells, can build up or break down chemical substances. The pollutant molecule HCH inserts itself into the enzyme like a key into a lock. Then part of the molecule is split off. The now harmless fragments are released again, and the enzyme is ready to take up the next pollutant molecule.Together with undergraduate student Jasmin Hubeli, Heeb investigated not only the enzyme variants found in landfills, but also an enzyme obtained from a genetically modified bacterial strain. Here, the researchers had deliberately enlarged the ""keyhole"" so that the larger HBCD molecules could be broken down more easily. The result: The genetic modification influenced the rate, at which the pollutant was broken down. Empa researcher Heeb is hopeful about their results: ""This means that we now actually have a chance to use biological methods to render harmless these long-lived toxins produced by mankind and distributed over large areas."" There is still a long way to go, however. The lock-and-key principle of helpful enzymes still needs to be figured out in more detail before tailor-made enzymes for chemical toxins are available in the future.ReferenceHeeb NV et al.

To date, the mechanisms behind the development of the immune system have not been fully understood. Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet show a connection between breast milk, beneficial gut bacteria and the development of the immune system. The study is published in Cell. A possible application of our results is a preventative method for reducing the risk of allergies, asthma and autoimmune disease later in life by helping the immune system to establish its regulatory mechanisms,  says the paper s last author Petter Brodin, paediatrician and researcher at the Department of Women s and Children s Health, Karolinska Institutet.  We also believe that certain mechanisms that the study identifies can eventually lead to other types of treatment for such diseases, not just a prophylactic.  The incidence of autoimmune diseases such as asthma, type 1 diabetes and Crohn s disease is increasing in children and adolescents in parts of the world. These diseases are debilitating, but not as common in low-income countries as they are in Europe and the USA. It has long been known that the risk of developing these diseases is largely determined by early life events; for instance, there is a correlation between the early use of antibiotics and a higher risk of asthma. It is also known that breastfeeding protects against most of these disorders.There is a link between specific, protective bacteria on the skin and in the airways and gut and a lower risk of immunological diseases. However, there is still much to learn about how these bacteria form the immune system. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Evolve Biosystems, Inc, the University of California Davis, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and University of Nevada, Reno studied how the neonatal immune system adapts to and is shaped by the many bacteria, viruses, nutrients and other environmental factors to which the baby is exposed during the first few months of life. Earlier research has shown that bifidobacteria are common in breastfed babies in countries with a low incidence of autoimmune diseases. Breast milk is rich in HMOs (Human milk oligosaccharides), which babies are unable to metabolise on their own. The production of these complex sugars are instead associated with the evolutionary advantage of nourishing specific gut bacteria that play an important part in their immune system. Bifidobacteria are one such bacterial class.  We found that babies whose intestinal flora can break down HMOs have less inflammation in the blood and gut,  says professor Brodin.  This is probably because of the uniquely good ability of the bifidobacteria to break down HMOs, to expand in nursing babies and to have a beneficial effect on the developing immune system early in life.  Babies who were breastfed and received additional bifidobacteria had higher intestinal levels of the molecules ILA and Galectin-1. ILA (indole-3-lactic acid) is needed to convert HMO molecules into nutrition; Galectin-1 is central to the activation of the immune response to threats and attacks.According to the researchers, Galectin-1 is a newly discovered and critical mechanism for preserving bacteria with beneficial, anti-inflammatory properties in the intestinal flora. The results are based on 208 breastfed babies born at Karolinska University Hospital between 2014 and 2019. The researchers also used novel methods to analyse the immune system even from small blood samples. Additionally, a second cohort developed by the University of California in which infants were exclusively breastfed and half were fed B. infantis supplement were analyzed for enteric inflammation. One limitation of the study is that the researchers were unable to study the immune system direct in the gut and had to resort to blood samples. Not all aspects of the gut immune system can be seen in the blood, but it is not ethically defensible to take intestinal biopsies from healthy neonates. The researchers now hope to follow the participant babies for a longer time to see which ones develop atopic eczema, asthma and allergies.  We re planning a new experiment using bacterial substitution to see if we can help all babies have a healthier immunological start in life,  says professor Brodin.  We re also working with other researchers to compare the development of the immune system in Swedish babies with babies who grow up in rural sub-Saharan Africa, where the incidence of allergies is much lower.

In this structure, we can see how omega-3s bind to the transporter. This information may allow for the design of drugs that mimic omega-3s to hijack this system and get into the brain,"" says first author Rosemary J. Cater, PhD, a Simons Society Fellow in the Mancia Lab at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.The study was published online on June 16 in the journal Nature.A major challenge in treating neurological diseases is getting drugs across the blood-brain barrier--a layer of tightly packed cells that lines the brain's blood vessels and zealously blocks toxins, pathogens, and some nutrients from entering the brain. Unfortunately, the layer also blocks many drugs that are otherwise promising candidates to treat neurological disorders.Essential nutrients like omega-3s require the assistance of dedicated transporter proteins that specifically recognize them and get them across this barrier. ""The transporters are like bouncers at a club, only letting molecules with invites or backstage passes in,"" Cater says.The transporter--or bouncer--that lets omega-3s in is called MFSD2A and is the focus of Cater's research. ""Understanding what MFSD2A looks like and how it pulls omega-3s across the blood-brain barrier may provide us with the information we need to design drugs that can trick this bouncer and gain entry passes.""To visualize MFSD2A, Cater used a technique called single-particle cryo-electron microscopy.""The beauty of this technique is that we're able to see the shape of the transporter with details down to a fraction of a billionth of a meter,"" says study co-leader Filippo Mancia, PhD, associate professor of physiology & cellular biophysics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and an expert in the structure and function of membrane proteins. ""This information is critical for understanding how the transporter works at a molecular level.""For cryo-EM analysis, protein molecules are suspended in a thin layer of ice under an electron microscope. Powerful cameras take millions of pictures of the proteins from countless angles which can then be pieced together to construct a 3D map.Into this map researchers can build a 3D model of the protein, putting each atom in its place. ""It reminds me of solving a jigsaw puzzle,"" Mancia explains. This technique has become remarkably powerful in visualizing biological molecules in recent years, thanks in part to Joachim Frank, PhD, professor of biochemistry & molecular biophysics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, who won the Nobel Prize in 2017 for his role in developing cryo-electron microscopy data analysis algorithms.""Our structure shows that MFSD2A has a bowl-like shape and that omega-3s bind to a specific side of this bowl,"" Cater explains. ""The bowl is upside down and faces the inside of the cell, but this is just a single 3D snapshot of the protein, which in real life has to move to transport the omega-3s. To understand exactly how it works, we need either multiple different snapshots or, better yet, a movie of the transporter in motion.""To understand what these movements might look like, a second co-leader of the study, George Khelashvili, PhD, assistant professor of physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine, used the 3D model of the protein as a starting point to run computational simulations that revealed how the transporter moves and adapts its shape to release omega-3s into the brain. A third co-leader of the study, David Silver, PhD, professor at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and pioneer in MFSD2A biology, together with his team tested and confirmed hypotheses derived from the structure and the computational simulations on how MFSD2A works to pinpoint specific parts of the protein that are important.The team also included researchers from the New York Structural Biology Center, the University of Chicago, and the University of Arizona, all using their specific skills to make this project possible.The team is now investigating how the transporter first recognizes omega-3s from the bloodstream. ""But our study has already given us tremendous insight into how MFSD2A delivers omega-3s to the brain, and we are really excited to see where our results lead to,"" Cater says.Reference: Cater RJ, Chua GL, Erramilli SK, et al.

They are complex, and they are learned behaviors.""In many people's minds, going from a songbird model to a system that will eventually go into humans is a pretty big evolutionary jump,"" said Vikash Gilja, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC San Diego who is a co-author on the study. ""But it's a model that gives us a complex behavior that we don't have access to in typical primate models that are commonly used for neural prosthesis research.""The research is a cross-collaborative effort between engineers and neuroscientists at UC San Diego, with the Gilja and Gentner labs working together to develop neural recording technologies and neural decoding strategies that leverage both teams' expertise in neurobiological and behavioral experiments.The team implanted silicon electrodes in male adult zebra finches and monitored the birds' neural activity while they sang. Specifically, they recorded the electrical activity of multiple populations of neurons in the sensorimotor part of the brain that ultimately controls the muscles responsible for singing.The researchers fed the neural recordings into machine learning algorithms. The idea was that these algorithms would be able to make computer-generated copies of actual zebra finch songs just based on the birds' neural activity. But translating patterns of neural activity into patterns of sounds is no easy task.""There are just too many neural patterns and too many sound patterns to ever find a single solution for how to directly map one signal onto the other,"" said Gentner.To accomplish this feat, the team used simple representations of the birds' vocalization patterns. These are essentially mathematical equations modeling the physical changes--that is, changes in pressure and tension--that happen in the finches' vocal organ, called a syrinx, when they sing. The researchers then trained their algorithms to map neural activity directly to these representations.This approach, the researchers said, is more efficient than having to map neural activity to the actual songs themselves.""If you need to model every little nuance, every little detail of the underlying sound, then the mapping problem becomes a lot more challenging,"" said Gilja. ""By having this simple representation of the songbirds' complex vocal behavior, our system can learn mappings that are more robust and more generalizable to a wider range of conditions and behaviors.""The team's next step is to demonstrate that their system can reconstruct birdsong from neural activity in real time.Part of the challenge is that songbirds' vocal production, like humans', involves not just output of the sound but a constant monitoring of the environment and constant monitoring of the feedback. If you put headphones on humans, for example, and delay when they hear their own voice, disrupting just the temporal feedback, they'll start to stutter. Birds do the same thing. They're listening to their own song. They make adjustments based on what they just heard themselves singing and what they hope to sing next, Gentner explained. A successful vocal prosthesis will ultimately need to work on a timescale that is similarly fast and also intricate enough to accommodate the entire feedback loop, including making adjustments for errors.""With our collaboration,"" said Gentner, ""we are leveraging 40 years of research in birds to build a speech prosthesis for humans--a device that would not simply convert a person's brain signals into a rudimentary set of whole words but give them the ability to make any sound, and so any word, they can imagine, freeing them to communicate whatever they wish.""Reference: Arneodo EM, Chen S, Brown DE, Gilja V, Gentner TQ.

In a novel study scientists report in The American Journal of Pathology that infection with a specific coronavirus strain reactivated dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in mice. This knowledge may help to develop new vaccines for COVID-19 and avoid a potential global tuberculosis epidemic.The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus demonstrates the ability of an emerging virus to affect masses and strain and disrupt the workings of modern healthcare systems around the world. A significant number of infected COVID-19 individuals have recovered. However, a possible host defense or antiviral mechanism against the virus is yet to be identified. There are concerns that in the long-term, the virus might activate dormant bacterial infections such as TB in select infected individuals, as alarmingly, TB is already present in one quarter of the world population. Viral infections such as the influenza virus or SARS-CoV-1 are known to cause transient immune suppression that leads to reactivation of dormant bacterial infection. The highest death rate during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 was in patients with TB, and patients with TB or multidrug-resistant TB had a worse prognosis than others during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009.""There is an urgent need to study the association of COVID-19 with dormant TB reactivation to avoid a potential global TB pandemic,"" explained lead investigator Bikul Das, MD, PhD, Department of Stem Cell and Infectious Diseases, KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India; and Department of Stem Cell and Infection, Thoreau Lab for Global Health, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA. ""It is important to understand the host defense mechanism against this disease to develop a better vaccine and/or treatment. We therefore postulated that, similar to bacteria, adult stem cells may also exhibit an altruistic defense mechanism to protect their niche against external threat.""Investigators studied the coronavirus strain murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection in the lung in a mouse model (dMtb) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated MTB dormancy. This showed 20-fold lower viral loads than the dMtb-free control mice by the third week of viral infection and a six-fold increase of altruistic stem cells (ASCs), thereby enhancing the defense. Tuberculosis was reactivated in the dMtb mice, suggesting that dormant TB bacteria hijack these ASCs to replicate in the lung to cause pulmonary TB. Results suggest that these ASCs are transient (they expand for two weeks and then undergo apoptosis or cellular suicide) and exhibit antiviral activities against MHV-1 by secreting soluble factors.""These findings are important because they reveal a novel ASC defense mechanism against mouse coronavirus infection, which could be used to develop novel therapeutic approaches against COVID-19,"" noted Bikul Das. ""The finding of TB reactivation in a stem cell-mediated Mtb dormancy mouse model during MHV-1 coronavirus infection indicates that in the long-term, post-pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus might activate dormant bacterial infections. This is a significant finding considering the current coronavirus pandemic, where many individuals in India and other developing countries with dormant TB infection may see an increase in active TB cases post COVID-19. The ASC-mediated defense mechanism may be targeted to develop vaccines against viral infections and avoid a potential global TB pandemic.""Reference: Pathak L, Gayan S, Pal B, et al.

Maybe those work: human average life expectancy has gone from a meager 40-ish years to a whopping 70-something since 1850. Does this mean we are slowing down death?A new study comparing data from nine human populations and 30 populations of non-human primates says that we are probably not cheating the reaper. The researchers say the increase in human life expectancy is more likely the statistical outcome of improved survival for children and young adults, not slowing the aging clock.""Populations get older mostly because more individuals get through those early stages of life,"" said Susan Alberts, professor of Biology and Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and senior author of the paper. ""Early life used to be so risky for humans, whereas now we prevent most early deaths.""The research team, comprising scientists from 14 different countries, analyzed patterns of births and deaths in the 39 populations, looking at the relationship between life expectancy and lifespan equality.Lifespan equality tell us how much the age of death varies in a population. If everyone tends to die at around the same age -- for instance, if almost everyone can expect to live a long life and die in their 70s or 80s -- lifespan equality is very high. If death could happen at any age -- because of disease, for example -- lifespan equality is very low.In humans, lifespan equality is closely related to life expectancy: people from populations that live longer also tend to die at a similarly old age, while populations with shorter life-expectancies tend to die at a wider range of ages.To understand if this pattern is uniquely human, the researchers turned to our closest cousins: non-human primates. What they found is that the tight relationship between life expectancy and lifespan equality is widespread among primates as well as humans. But why?In most mammals, risk of death is high at very young ages and relatively low at adulthood, then it increases again after the onset of aging. Could higher life-expectancy be due to individuals ageing slower and living longer?The pimate populations tell us that the answer is probably no. The main sources of variation in the average age of death in different primate populations were infant, juvenile and young adult deaths. In other words, life expectancy and lifespan equality are not driven by the rate at which individuals senesce and become old, but by how many kids and young adults die for reasons unrelated to old age.Using mathematical modeling, the researchers also found that small changes in the rate of ageing would drastically alter the relationship between life expectancy and lifespan equality. Changes in the parameters representing early deaths, on the other hand, led to variations very similar to what was observed.""When we change the parameters representing early deaths, we can explain almost all of the variation among populations, for all of these species,"" said Alberts. ""Changes in the onset of aging and rate of ageing do not explain this variation.""These results support the 'invariant rate of ageing' hypothesis.""The rate of ageing is relatively fixed for a species,"" said Alberts. ""That's why the relationship between life expectancy and lifespan equality is so tight within each species.""The researchers point out that there is some individual variation within species in the rate of ageing and on the onset of senescence, but that this variation is contained to a fairly narrow range, unlike death rates at younger ages.""We can't slow down the rate at which we're going to age,"" Alberts said.

An epigenome consists of chemical compounds and proteins that can bind to DNA and regulate gene action, either by activating or deactivating them or producing organ- or tissue-specific proteins. As it is a highly dynamic material, it can provide a large amount of information to shed light on the evolution of the various tissues and organs that make up the body.Now, a team from the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE), a joint centre of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and Pompeu Fabra University, has carried out the largest study to date on the regulatory elements in the genome of primates. The exhaustive analysis conducted by the research team led by Tomas Marqu s-Bonet, principal investigator of the Comparative Genomics research group at the IBE, has analysed a wide spectrum of signals regulating genes in the great apes and in humans, including weak activity signals that have been overlooked in previous studies. The study, co-led by the researcher David Juan of the IBE, has revealed that in humans, the weakest regulatory signals, that are not usually studied, play an important role in the regulation of genes linked to brain. The research opens the door to deciphering the impact that these signals may have on the evolution of humans and other primates.The research lab has carried out the largest study to date on the regulatory elements in the genome of primates.The research team used high resolution to analyse epigenomic signals in cell lines of great apes and humans. In particular, the research provides new epigenomic data for four species of great apes and other primates: chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and macaques.""In the study we used lymphoblastoid cell lines from humans and other primates because they provide a solid foundation as a model. Then we compared epigenomic signals between the different species, including the weakest activity signals in our analysis"", comments Raquel Garc a, a PhD with the Comparative Genomics group of the IBE and first author of the article.""When we focused on detecting those specific characteristics of humans in the weakest epigenomic signals, we saw that they are related to brain functions"", explains Paula Esteller, a PhD student with Marqu s-Bonet's group and study co-author. ""This opens the door to studying the role of weak epigenomic signals in depth, as they may play an important role in various organs of humans and of other primates"".The study includes weak epigenomic signals, usually ignored, and it has been seen that in humans they are related to brain functions.The study, carried out using lymphoblastoid cells, which are easily accessible and easy to culture, suggests that this model could provide information on other more inaccessible tissues, such as the brain. The research could help understand how primates' cells are regulated and which of these mechanisms have been conserved over the course of evolution.

They also mapped out the process, or program, of how the macrophages allows a tumor to hurt the tissues the macrophage normally repairs. This process allows the tumor to hide from the immune system and proliferate into later, deadly stages of cancer.Macrophages play a key role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, the ecosystem that surrounds tumors in the body. By investigating this microenvironment, researchers can find key players that drive tumor growth that can be tested as targets for immunotherapy. But modifying macrophages therapeutically has proven difficult.In this study, scientists studied tissue samples from lung cancer tumors and surrounding lung tissue in 35 patients to see the role of macrophages in the development of the tumors.The study's lead author, Miriam Merad, MD, PhD, Director of the Precision Immunology Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and a multidisciplinary team of thoracic surgeons, pathologists, and medical oncologists within the Institute of Thoracic Oncology devised a comprehensive study that began when patients went into surgery to have cancerous lesions removed. The patients' lung tumor samples, samples of surrounding healthy lung tissue, and blood samples were immediately analyzed on a cellular level at Mount Sinai's Human Immune Monitoring Center to map out the immune system components they contained.Researchers identified the macrophages at play in the early development of lung cancer, identifying a potential target for future drug development. They also found that the process that allows the macrophages to help tumors invade lung tissues is present in mice as well, which will allow them to manipulate the macrophages in future mouse models knowing that the manipulation is relevant to humans.Half of all early-stage lung cancers relapse, and once they do and reach later stages, it is deadly and irreversible. Knowing how to attack the cancer at an early stage could have huge impacts on the number of patients relapsing and their overall survival.""These findings are very important for Mount Sinai in the future as we have a very strong lung cancer screening program that identifies patients with early lung cancer lesions before they become fully invasive,"" said Dr. Merad, who is also the Director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center and a member of the Institute of Thoracic Oncology and The Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai.

Working with their research collaborators, the scientists found that 'enabler cells' comprise about 20 percent or less of the cells in an aggressive tumor; their small numbers may account for why they are often missed when bulk tissue analyses are used to inform therapeutic decisions.The finding appears online June 16, 2021, in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. ""Our novel finding goes beyond the common understanding of cancer progression as one modeled on Darwinian selection where 'survival of the fittest' means the predominant type of cell in a tumor dictates its outcome,"" noted Anna Riegel, PhD, Professor of Oncology and Pharmacology at Georgetown Lombardi and the corresponding author of the study. ""This could have major implications for our understanding of how best to diagnosis and treat certain cancers as blocking key cancer-promoting subpopulations of cells might be a way to defeat the cancer.""The advent of advanced gene sequencing technology coupled with the use of CRISPR, a tool that allows for easy gene editing, made this finding possible; it is a collaborative effort with researchers at The Ohio State University and Hackensack University Medical Center's John Theurer Cancer Center, a part of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. These tools aided the scientists in building on their knowledge of alternative splicing, or cutting, of genes whereby a single gene can be spliced to code for multiple proteins.The researchers' work using CRISPR in both zebrafish and mice zeroed in on cell subpopulations responsible for enabling metastasis. This led researchers to the discovery of a single RNA splicing event in the AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) gene. One splice variant of the gene produced the AIB1-Delta4 protein, which was found to be responsible for promoting communication and recruitment of surrounding cells, eventually leading to metastasis.""We propose that the detection of these enabler cells in early-stage breast cancers could predict which tumors are more aggressive and destined to metastasize,"" said Ghada M Sharif, PhD, Research Assistant Professor at Georgetown Lombardi and first author of this finding. ""Therapeutic targeting of vulnerabilities uncovered in the enabler cells, such as the splice variants, could represent a new approach to preventing malignant progression of breast cancer.""This finding is particularly relevant in triple-negative breast cancers which can be aggressive and hard to treat. These types of cancer usually start as non-malignant tumors, called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but in about 5 to 10 percent of women, they can quickly progress to malignant tumors. The investigators found that AIB1-Delta4 is found at increased levels in women with higher-risk DCIS.The researchers' next step will be to conduct various single cell analyses in human tissue samples. ""We are at a turning point in how we analyze tumor samples,"" said Riegel. ""It was unthinkable and impractical just a few years ago to look at every single cell in a tissue sample. But technology is racing ahead and we believe that in the next few years, looking at each cell will allow us to determine which cells, even if they are small in number, are truly driving cancer progression.""Reference: Sharif GM, Campbell MJ, Nasir A, et al.

Past studies have examined ozone levels in the Southern Hemisphere, but little is known about levels of the molecule in Antarctica over long periods. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology have analyzed more than 25 years of Antarctic data, finding that concentrations near the ground arose from both natural and human-related sources.Ozone gas has a sharp or acrid scent that sometimes accompanies smog or summer storms. It forms when sunlight reacts with gases produced by industrial and transportation activities, biomass burning or with naturally produced gases originating from lightning and microorganisms. However, when sunlight is very strong, it breaks down the molecule. Most ozone resides about 9-18 miles above Earth in the ozone layer, an atmospheric band within the stratosphere that protects the Earth from harmful UV radiation. But ozone in the lower atmosphere, or troposphere, is harmful and causes smog and throat and lung irritation. It s also a concern because the molecule traps heat 1,000 times better than carbon dioxide, and therefore, can have a large impact on global warming. While previous researchers have shown the rise of ozone in the troposphere across the Southern Hemisphere, there has not been a regional study reported for the remote Antarctic continent over a long period. So, Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath and colleagues wanted to use measurements made over Antarctica to determine where the ozone comes from and how levels have changed over time. The researchers compiled ozone data measured between 1992 and 2018 at ground level and through the atmosphere, from the lower atmosphere into the ozone layer, at eight stations across Antarctica. Their analyses showed the amount of ozone throughout the troposphere was lowest during December, January and February, corresponding to summer in the Southern Hemisphere when the sun is intense enough that it breaks apart more ozone than it creates. Dominant sources of ozone were both natural   from snow-pack on the large plateau in Eastern Antarctica and air mixing from the upper stratosphere to the troposphere   and from humans, as some originated from the southern tip of South America. The researchers also found that ozone at ground level had risen up to 0.14 ppb per year over the 26 years that were reviewed, even when accounting for seasonal and natural patterns. Because of ozone s ability to hold heat near Earth s surface, the increasing trend could have negative impacts on the region in the future, the researchers say.ReferenceKumar P et al.

Until now, COVID vaccines have been focused on activating a different type of immune cell, B cells, which are responsible for creating antibodies. Developing vaccines to activate the other arm of the immune system the T cells could dramatically increase immunity against coronavirus, and importantly, its variants.In their findings, published in Cell, the researchers say current vaccines might lack some important bits of viral material capable of triggering a holistic immune response in the human body. Based on the new information,  companies should reevaluate their vaccine designs,  says Mohsan Saeed, a NEIDL virologist and the co-corresponding author of the paper.Saeed, a BU School of Medicine assistant professor of biochemistry, performed experiments on human cells infected with coronavirus. He isolated and identified those missing pieces of SARS-CoV-2 proteins inside one of the NEIDL s Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) labs.  This was a big undertaking because many research techniques are difficult to adapt for high containment levels [such as BSL-3],  Saeed says.  The overall coronavirus research pipeline we ve created at the NEIDL, and the support of our entire NEIDL team, has helped us along the way. Saeed got involved after he was contacted by genetic sequencing experts at the Broad Institute, computational geneticists Pardis Sabeti and Shira Weingarten-Gabbay. They hoped to identify fragments of SARS-CoV-2 that activate the immune system s T cells.  The emergence of viral variants, an active area of research in my lab, is a major concern for vaccine development,  says Sabeti, a leader in the Broad Institute s Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program. She is also a Harvard University professor of systems biology, organismic and evolutionary biology, and immunology and infectious disease, as well as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. We swung into full action right away because my laboratory had [already] generated human cell lines that could be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2,  Saeed says. The group s efforts were spearheaded by two members of the Saeed lab: Da-Yuan Chen, a postdoctoral associate, and Hasahn Conway, a lab technician.From the outset of COVID pandemic in early 2020, scientists around the world knew the identity of 29 proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 virus in infected cells viral fragments that now make up the spike protein in some coronavirus vaccines, such as the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Later, scientists discovered another 23 proteins hidden inside the virus  genetic sequence; however, the function of these additional proteins was a mystery until now. The new findings of Saeed and his collaborators reveal unexpectedly and critically that 25 percent of the viral protein fragments that trigger the human immune system to attack a virus come from these hidden viral proteins.How exactly does the immune system detect these fragments? Human cells contain molecular  scissors called proteases that, when the cells are invaded, hack off bits of viral proteins produced during infection. Those bits, containing internal proteins exposed by the chopping-up process like the way the core of an apple is exposed when the fruit is segmented are then transported to the cell membrane and pushed through special doorways. There, they stick outside the cell acting almost like a hitchhiker, waving down the help of passing T cells. Once T cells notice these viral flags poking through infected cells, they launch an attack and try to eliminate those cells from the body. And this T cell response isn t insignificant Saeed says there are links between the strength of this response and whether or not people infected with coronavirus go on to develop serious disease. It s quite remarkable that such a strong immune signature of the virus is coming from regions [of the virus  genetic sequence] that we were blind to,  says Weingarten-Gabby, the paper s lead author and postdoctoral fellow in the Sabeti lab.  This is a striking reminder that curiosity-driven research stands at the basis of discoveries that can transform the development of vaccines and therapies. Our discovery   can assist in the development of new vaccines that will mimic more accurately the response of our immune system to the virus,  Sabeti says.T cells not only destroy infected cells but also memorize the virus  flags so that they can launch an attack, stronger and faster, the next time the same or a different variant of the virus appears. That s a crucial advantage, because Saeed and his collaborators say the coronavirus appears to delay the cell s ability to call in immune help. This virus wants to go undetected by the immune system for as long as possible,  Saeed says.  Once it s noticed by the immune system, it s going to be eliminated, and it doesn t want that. Based on their findings, Saeed says, a new vaccine recipe, incorporating some of the newly discovered internal proteins making up the SARS-CoV-2 virus, would be effective in stimulating an immune response capable of tackling a wide swath of newly emerging coronavirus variants. And given the speed with which these variants continue to appear around the world, a vaccine that can provide protection against all of them would be a game changer.

In a study published in the journal Chemosphere, the researchers urge decision makers to consider the combined impact of the mix of chemicals that accumulate in people and nature.""These are important findings that call for regulators to consider the collective impact of exposure to multiple chemicals rather than evaluating just one chemical at a time,"" says first author Richelle Duque Bj rvang, PhD student at the Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology at Karolinska Institutet. The researchers studied concentrations of 22 persistent organic pollutants (POPs). These are toxic chemicals that remain in the environment for long periods of time and accumulate in humans through food, drinking water and air particles. EU's members and many other countries have signed a treaty that prohibits or restricts manufacturing and use of these chemicals. In the study, the researchers examined samples of fetal fat tissue, liver, heart, lung and brain from 20 pregnancies that for various reasons had ended in stillbirth in the third trimester in 2015-2016. The researchers identified at least 15 of the 22 POPs in every organ. Four chemicals were found in all tissues in all fetuses. The most pervasive chemicals were: - HCB, a pesticide previously used to protect food crops from fungi; - DDE, a metabolite of DDT, an insect killer used in the mid-1900s; - Variants of PCBs, chemicals formerly used in a range of electrical products. Most current methods for estimating fetal exposure to chemicals rely on maternal blood and placenta samples as proxies. The new study found that, for some of the chemicals, the concentrations in the fetal tissues exceeded those found in the maternal blood and placenta. This can be explained by the fact that these chemicals tend to accumulate in fat tissue due to their structure. However, levels in fetal liver and lung also exceeded those found in the mother. Some pesticides - PeCB,  -HCH,  -HCH and oxychlordane - were detected in fetal tissue even when they were not quantified in maternal blood samples or the placenta. According to the researchers, these latest findings suggest that blood and placenta samples may give a misleading picture on the diversity and concentration of chemicals that babies are exposed to during early development. This study only investigated the presence and concentration of the various chemicals but not their links to potential health risks. However, the researchers point out that several previous studies have linked early life exposure to POPs to adverse health outcomes such as low birth weight, gestational diabetes, ADHD, infertility, obesity and reduced sperm production. For example, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recently revised their risk assessment of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, and concluded that the dietary intake in Europe is currently at a level that can disrupt fertility in men. ""Getting an accurate picture of chemical exposure in early human development is critical to assessing both short and long-term health consequences for future generations,"" says last author Pauliina Damdimopoulou, researcher in the Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology at Karolinska Institutet. ""Therefore, we believe today's approaches estimating fetal chemical exposure, for example in birth cohort studies, need to be updated to better reflect the likelihood that for some chemicals, fetal exposure is actually greater than what the blood and placenta samples show.""""Studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, when POPs were widely in use, found higher levels compared to ours,"" Richelle Duque Bj rvang says. ""This shows that political action leading to restrictions in the use of chemicals has an impact on population exposures, although in the case of persistent chemicals it will take multiple generations to get rid of the exposure."" The researchers recognize that the study has some limitations, including a relatively modest sample size and that it only included fetuses who had died in the womb late in the pregnancy. Thus, it may not be fully representative of babies born alive.ReferenceBj rvang RD, Vinnars M-T, Papadogiannakis N, et al.

The triggers are fusion proteins developed by Clemson University researchers that link the two together.""The idea is to use this bifunctional protein to bridge the natural killer cells and breast cancer tumor cells,"" said Yanzhang (Charlie) Wei, a professor in the College of Science's Department of Biological Sciences. ""If the two cells are brought close enough together through this receptor ligand connection, the natural killer cells can release what I call killing machinery to have the tumor cells killed.""It's a novel approach to developing breast cancer-specific immunotherapy and could lead to new treatment options for the world's most common cancer.About one in eight women in the U.S. and one in 1,000 men will develop invasive breast cancer during their lives. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the U.S., trailing only lung cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 43,600 U.S. women will die from the disease this year.Immunotherapy harnesses the power of the body's immune system to kill cancer cells.""Very simply, cancer is uncontrolled cell growth. Some cells will become abnormal and have the potential to become cancer,"" Wei said. ""The immune system can recognize these abnormal cells and destroy them before they become cancer cells. Unfortunately for those who develop cancer, the immune system is not working very well because of gene mutations and environmental factors. The result is that the cancer cells won the fight between the immune system and the tumors.""Most breast cancer targeting therapies target one of three receptors: estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or epidermal growth factor receptors. However, up to 20 percent of breast cancers do not express these receptors. These cancers are known as triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer because of high heterogeneity, high metastasis frequency, early relapse after standard chemotherapy and lack of efficient treatment options.In this novel research, Wei and his researchers targeted prolactin receptors. Prolactin is a natural hormone in the body and plays a role in breast growth and milk production during breastfeeding. Breast cancer cells overexpress prolactin receptors.""When people are diagnosed with breast cancer, and it's called triple-negative, it is not good news,"" Wei said. ""This has the potential to give patients another option.""Over 90 percent of breast cancer cells express prolactin receptors, including triple-negative breast cancer cells.Wei and his team developed a bifunctional protein. One part is a mutated form of prolactin that can still bind to the prolactin receptor but blocks signal transduction that would promote tumor growth. The other part is an extracellular domain of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related protein (MICA).When the MICA binds to the prolactin receptor, it activates the natural killer cells.""One of the things tumor cells do is to inhibit natural killer cell activation, so we use these artificial bifunctional proteins to connect natural killer cells and activate them to enhance the killing of the breast cancer cells without increased cytotoxicity,"" Wei said.Wei is now seeking funding for an animal model study to confirm the results.One big question is whether the bifunctional protein will bring natural killer cells to healthy cells in the body that also express prolactin receptors and kill them, too, causing severe side effects.If the animal model studies are successful, the potential new treatment could move to human clinical trials.""If we had the funding now and everything is what we expected in the animal model study, we could be in clinical trials in five or six years,"" he said. Wei said he expects the conversion from in-vitro and animal studies to clinical trials to be easier for this potential immunotherapy than others in the past because the protein created by the Clemson researchers uses human natural killer cells and breast cancer cells.Developing new immunotherapy for cancer is nothing new to Wei. His research combining tumor cells with dendritic cells, an important part of the body's adaptive immune system, led to a dendritoma vaccine that proved effective in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and neuroblastoma patients. The vaccine was patented and licensed to three biotech companies. Two companies are still pursuing the vaccine therapy or related therapy.""It is my dream that someday we can create a group of these bifunctional proteins that could be used for other cancers by shifting the target molecule. We'd have the one part of the bifunctional protein that targets natural killer cells. The other part would target other cancer types that have unique markers,"" Wei said.Reference: Ding H, Buzzard GW, Huang S, Sehorn MG, Marcus RK, Wei Y.

Chemokines are small proteins that bind to these receptors and control the movement and behaviour of white blood cells. However, despite the importance of this family of receptors, their activation mechanism remains poorly understood. In Switzerland, a research consortium from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Villigen has succeeded in decoding the activation mechanism of the CCR5 receptor, a member of this family implicated in several diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and the respiratory complications of COVID-19. This discovery represents an important step in the understanding of chemokine receptor biology, providing valuable insights for improving new drugs that this important family of receptors.  This work can be found in the journal Science Advances.The CCR5 receptor plays a major role in inflammation and immune defence, and has long been an important target for anti-HIV drugs.   Research on CCR5 began almost 25 years ago as part of the fight against AIDS , explains Stephan Grzesiek, a professor at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, who co-directed this work with Professor Oliver Hartley of the Department of Pathology and Immunology at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, and colleagues from the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI).  It is indeed fundamental to the HIV infection mechanism, but also seems to be very important in many other pathological processes, notably in cancers and inflammatory diseases. However, in order to better exploit it for therapeutic purposes, we needed to understand, at an atomic level, how activation through its binding to chemokines works.  Chemokines are small signalling molecules that play a central role in the circulation and activation of immune cells. By binding to receptors on the membrane of white blood cells, they act as guides, ensuring that the cells reach the right place at the right time, to both maintain the immune system and respond to infection or injury. But how is the receptor able to sense the docking of a chemokine at the outside the cell? And how is this activation message transmitted to the inside of the cell so that it can respond.Until now, the study of this phenomenon has been hampered by the difficulty of observing the 3D structures of the receptors when bound to the molecules that activate them. To this end, the Basel team, which specialises in structural biology, used cryo-electron microscopy tools that make it possible to preserve and observe the structure of the smallest elements of living organisms.  However, in order to understand the entire process, it is necessary to make use of engineered chemokines that bind to receptors more stably than the natural ones , says Oliver Hartley.  For this, we were able to exploit the molecules that we had discovered in the course of our HIV drug research.  And indeed, some of these variants over-activate the receptor while others block them entirely.The receptor, which is embedded in the cell membrane, works like a  lock and key  mechanism. A specific part of the chemokine structure must fit into the CCR5 lock to activate a change in the structure of the receptor, which then lets it trigger the activation and migration of white blood cells.  The activation capacity of chemokines is determined by certain amino acids (protein building blocks) that must arrange themselves in a specific pattern. If this part of the chemokine adopts a straight shape, it succeeds in activating the receptor. But if the amino acids are changed, the molecule adopts a slightly different shape which, although it maintains a very strong bond with the receptor, prevents its activation , explains Oliver Hartley. These small changes thus make the difference between receptor activators and inhibitors. Despite an almost identical architecture, minute structural differences between engineered chemokines determine their ability to activate or inhibit the receptor. A detailed understanding of this mechanism will allow for the improvement of drugs by developing new compounds capable of fine-tuning the the immune system.ReferenceScience Advances. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.eabg8685This article has been republished from the following materials.

This means it could enable screening of workers, at very low cost, for example in their place of work, identifying and isolating those with the disease and enabling those recovered to go back to work.

The calorie restriction technique has been boosted by celebrity practitioners ranging from the Tonight Show host Jimmy Kimmel to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. IF is an umbrella term for various planned eating schedules: some routines dictate not eating between certain hours of the day, while the 5:2 diet, popularized over the last decade, mandates a heavily restricted diet for two days of the week.Despite IF s popularity, its health benefits remain unclear. Advocates suggest that IF should stimulate evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that could help burn fat. Studies conducted in mice have shown clear metabolic benefits from restricted food availability in certain periods. Small studies in humans have repeatedly shown that improvements to insulin sensitivity, a metabolic marker that can protect against diabetes, can be realized with just a few weeks of IF. Nevertheless, a review article from the National Institute on Aging points out that large scale studies of fasting remain scarce and that calorie restriction diets should be clinically monitored.In a new study, researchers led by the University of Bath s Professor James Betts examined the effects of a type of IF called alternate day fasting, where calorie intake is reduced every other day. They wanted to discover whether alternate day IF would have health benefits in humans, and, importantly, whether those benefits would go above and beyond any improvements seen through normal daily calorie restriction. To do so, they designed a first-of-its-kind trial. The authors recruited study participants who were all lean and of healthy weight   most IF studies look at people who are overweight. For three weeks, 36 volunteers were separated into three equal groups: The three groups were monitored for their body mass, fat mass and metabolomic performance. The daily energy restriction group lost weight, on average 1.91 kg. This was almost entirely due to loss of fat, which decreased by 1.75 kg (which translated to a 1.8% body fat reduction). While the body mass of the second group, who reduced their overall calories in an alternate fasting regimen, also dropped, just 0.74 kg of their average 1.6 kg weight loss was through fat loss (a 0.6% reduction in body fat). The group who practiced alternate fasting, but did not reduce their overall calorie intake, unsurprisingly lost neither body weight nor fat. The three groups  cardiometabolic measures, which included assessments of gut hormones, showed no differences between groups.So why might IF be a less efficient way of burning fat? On average, the group that fasted and reduced their total energy intake also reduced their low-to-moderate physical activity levels over the three-week period, meaning they somewhat offset their reduced energy intake with lower calorie burning. They suggest that maintaining energy expenditure should be a critical part of IF dieting.One mystery of this study s findings is the lack of additional change among cardiovascular and metabolic health measures in the fasting participants compared to regularly dieting individuals. Supposedly, fasting-induced changes have been noted repeatedly in other studies. The authors think the most likely explanation is that their participants were too healthy at the start of the study to record any significant improvement to these measures, whereas previous studies have used overweight participants.Finally, they speculate that alternate-day fasting might not entrain the body s circadian rhythms to produce fasting responses in the same way that an everyday time restriction fast may do. There still could be a place, the authors suggest, for this kind of diet for people who find daily dieting to be unsustainable.  Given that human physiology operates to defend against the desired energy deficit that is the objective of dieting, there may still be some value in deliberately misaligning and, thus, impairing that natural protective response via a more erratic fasting schedule, perhaps in overweight or obese individuals for whom there is more excess body fat to lose or preexisting health conditions to rectify,  they write.

These amyloid beta plaques are protein fragments that clump together and clog the junctions between nerve cells (neurons).Brains of treated animals also had a drop in levels of toxic tau. This nerve fiber protein can destroy neighboring tissue when disease-related changes to its chemical structure cause it to catch on other cells. Our findings illustrate that this therapy is an effective way of manipulating the immune system to slow neurodegeneration,  says Akash Patel, MS, an assistant research scientist in the Center for Cognitive Neurology at NYU Langone Health.The investigators say the treatment led to cognitive benefits as well. When presented with a series of puzzles, elderly monkeys given the drug performed similarly to young adult animals and much better than those in their age group that had remained untreated. The treated monkeys also learned new puzzle-solving skills faster than their untreated peers.According to researchers, past treatment efforts targeting the immune system failed because the drugs overstimulated the system, causing dangerous levels of inflammation, which can kill brain cells. Our new treatment avoids the pitfalls of earlier attempts because it is delivered in cycles, giving the immune system a chance to rest between doses,  says study co-senior author Thomas M. Wisniewski, MD. He notes that no additional inflammation was seen in the treated monkeys. Dr. Wisniewski is the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman Professor in the Department of Neurology and director of the Center for Cognitive Neurology at NYU Langone.Alzheimer s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and has no known cure. Drug therapies designed to slow or manage the symptoms have failed, says Dr. Wisniewski, who is also director of the Alzheimer s Disease Research Center and the Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment at NYU Langone. A growing body of evidence has implicated the immune system, the set of cells and proteins that defend the body from invading bacteria and viruses, as a contributor to Alzheimer s disease. A subset of immune cells, those within the innate immune system, swallow and clear away debris and toxins from bodily tissues along with invading microbes. Studies have shown that these immune custodians become sluggish as a person ages and fail to clear toxins that cause neurodegeneration.The new investigation, published as a cover article June 15 in the journal Brain, is the first to target the innate immune system with a potential therapy for the disorder in monkeys, according to Dr. Wisniewski. The CpG ODN drugs are part of a class of innate immune regulators that quicken these worn out immune custodians. He says the research team is also the first to use the  pulsing  drug administration technique to avoid excess inflammation, the immune-driven responses like swelling and pain that result from the homing in by immune cells on sites of injury or infection. While necessary to immune defenses and healing, too much inflammation contributes to many disease mechanisms.For the investigation, the research team studied 15 female squirrel monkeys between 17 and 19 years old. Eight received a single dose of the drug once a month for two years while the rest were instead given a saline solution. The researchers observed the behavior of the two groups and compared brain tissue and blood samples for plaque deposits, tau protein levels, and evidence of inflammation.Dr. Wisniewski notes that as they age, virtually all squirrel monkeys naturally develop a form of neurodegeneration that mimics Alzheimer s disease in humans, which makes them ideal for studying the disease. The similarities in aging between the animals studied and our own species give us hope that this therapy will work in human patients as well,  says study co-senior author Henrieta Scholtzova, MD, PhD.Dr. Scholtzova, an associate professor in the Department of Neurology at NYU Langone, cautions that the researchers only evaluated elderly monkeys who already showed significant signs of neurodegeneration. Further testing on younger animals, she notes, would allow them to assess the effectiveness of the treatment in earlier stages of the disease.Dr. Scholtzova says the team next plans to begin testing CpG ODN therapy on human patients with mild cognitive impairments or in early stages of dementia. They also intend to study this treatment in related neurodegenerative illnesses.Reference: Patel AG, Nehete PN, Krivoshik SR, et al.

While heavy drinking is often associated with liver problems, people with little or no history of alcohol use comprise that 25%, which is why their illness is known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.Resistance to insulin, the hormone that helps control blood sugar levels, is a risk factor for NAFLD, as are obesity, a high-fat diet and elevated levels of fat in the blood. The liver helps the body process nutrients and also acts as a filter for the circulatory system, and too much fat in the liver can lead to inflammation and liver failure.In a mouse-model study, Oregon State researchers led by Adrian Gombart showed that the compounds xanthohumol and tetrahydroxanthohumol, abbreviated to XN and TXN, can mitigate diet-induced accumulation of fat in the liver.XN is a prenylated flavonoid produced by hops, the plant that gives beer its flavor and color, and TXN is a hydrogenated derivative of XN.In the study, 60 mice were randomly assigned to one of five groups - low-fat diet, high-fat diet, high-fat diet supplemented by XN, high-fat diet supplemented by more XN, and high-fat diet supplemented by TXN.The scientists found that TXN helped put the brakes on the weight gain associated with a high-fat diet and also helped stabilize blood sugar levels, both factors in thwarting the buildup of fat in the liver.""We demonstrated that TXN was very effective in suppressing the development and progression of hepatic steatosis caused by diet,"" said Gombart, professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the OSU College of Science and a principal investigator at the Linus Pauling Institute. ""TXN appeared to be more effective than XN perhaps because significantly higher levels of TXN are able to accumulate in the liver, but XN can slow progression of the condition as well, at the higher dose.""The mechanism behind the compounds' effectiveness involves PPAR , a nuclear receptor protein - one that regulates gene expression. PPAR  controls glucose metabolism and the storage of fatty acids, and the genes it activates stimulate the creation of fat cells from stem cells.XN and TXN act as ""antagonists"" for PPAR  - they bind to the protein without sending it into action, unlike a PPAR  agonist, which would activate it as well as bind to it. The upshot of antagonism in this case is less fat collecting in the liver.""Activated PPAR? in liver stimulates storage of lipids and our data suggest that XN and TXN block activation and greatly reduce expression of the genes the promote lipid storage in the liver,"" Gombart elaborated. ""These findings are consistent with studies that show weaker PPAR  agonists are more effective at treating hepatic steatosis than strong agonists. In other words, lower PPAR  activation in the liver may be beneficial.""TXN was better at accumulating in the liver than XN, which may explain why it was more effective in reducing lipids, but the difference in tissue accumulation is not fully understood.""It may be because XN is metabolized by the host and its gut microbiota more than TXN is, but additional studies are needed to figure that out,"" Gombart said. ""Also, while XN and TXN are effective preventative approaches in rodents, future studies need to determine if the compounds can treat existing obesity in humans. But our findings suggest antagonism of PPAR  in the liver is a logical approach to prevent and treat diet-induced liver steatosis and related metabolic disorders, and they support further development of XN and TXN as low-cost therapeutic compounds.""Reference: Zhang Y, Bobe G, Miranda CL, et al.

For American Indian residents, that drops to just 29.5 percent   and even lower for Black populations, at 23.2 percent. Black and Indigenous people, and people of color, have suffered greater burdens of COVID-19 and are also potentially more skeptical of healthcare and therefore the vaccine,  says Mary Hayney, professor in the School of Pharmacy s Pharmacy Practice Division.Members of the School of Pharmacy have been supporting three projects geared toward addressing those issues and reducing racial disparities in care. In one, the School of Pharmacy partnered with the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County to host a series of vaccine clinics and expert panel discussions. A second project, led by School of Pharmacy Professor Eva Vivian through her work with the African American Health Network of Dane County, is also using vaccine clinics and information campaigns in under-resourced Madison neighborhoods. The third opportunity sees students and faculty from the School volunteering in vaccine clinics organized by the Ho-Chunk Nation healthcare team.Student pharmacists are playing a key role in all of these initiatives, and faculty at the School are equipping them to respectfully serve diverse populations through changes in the curriculum, including a new lecture about the history of racism in medical research. That context is key to relating to patients and earning trust, says Lisa Imhoff, associate dean for Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives at the School of Pharmacy. When we come into communities with a culturally humble lens, we show pharmacy students the power of community outreach and why it s important to build trust with patients,  says Imhoff.

New research from UC Davis suggests these experiences are more than a passing nuisance -- they play an important role in helping memories form, not only for the song, but also related life events like hanging out with friends -- or watching other people hang with their friends on the '90s television show, Friends.""Scientists have known for some time that music evokes autobiographical memories, and that those are among the emotional experiences with music that people cherish most,"" said Petr Janata, UC Davis professor of psychology and co-author on a new study.""What hasn't been understood to date is how those memories form in the first place and how they become so durable, such that just hearing a bit of a song can trigger vivid remembering,"" said Janata.The paper, ""Spontaneous Mental Replay of Music Improves Memory for Incidentally Associated Event Knowledge,"" was published online in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. Co-authors are Janata and Benjamin Kubit, a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience, both of the UC Davis Department of Psychology, and Center for Mind and Brain.This new research offers an initial glimpse into these mechanisms and, somewhat surprisingly, finds that the songs that get stuck in your head help that process of strengthening memories as they first form, the authors said. Thus, this is the first research to link two of the most common phenomena people experience with music -- earworms (having a song stuck in your head) and music-evoked remembering.For their latest study, the researchers worked with 25 to 31 different people in each of three experiments, over three different days, spaced weeks apart. Subjects first listened to unfamiliar music, and then, a week later, listened to the music again, this time paired with likewise unfamiliar movie clips. In one instance, movies were played without music. The research subjects, all UC Davis undergraduate and graduate students, were subsequently asked to remember as many details as they could from each movie as the music played. They were also quizzed about their recollection of the associated tunes and how often they experienced each of the tunes as an earworm. None of them had formal music training.

In a small trial in hospitalised patients, preliminary evidence suggested a clinical benefit in patients who had not mounted a natural antibody response of their own when they entered the trial (were seronegative). RECOVERY is the first trial large enough to determine definitively whether this treatment reduces mortality in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19.Between 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021, 9785 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus the antibody combination treatment (casirivimab 4g with imdevimab 4g by intravenous infusion) or usual care alone as part of the RECOVERY trial. Of these, about one-third were seronegative at baseline (ie they had not mounted a natural antibody response of their own), one-half were seropositive (ie they had already developed natural antibodies), and one-sixth had unknown serostatus. Among patients who received usual care alone, 28-day mortality was twice as high in those who were seronegative (30%) vs. those who were seropositive (15%) at study entry. Follow-up is complete for 99% of participants and preliminary results are announced today.Among patients who were seronegative at baseline (the primary analysis population for this comparison), the antibody combination significantly reduced the primary outcome of 28-day mortality by one-fifth compared with usual care alone (24% of patients in the antibody combination group died vs 30% of patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0 80; 95% confidence interval 0 70 0 91; p=0 001). Thus, for every 100 such patients treated with the antibody combination, there would be six fewer deaths.There was clear evidence that the effect of treatment in seronegative patients differed from that in seropositive patients (test for heterogeneity p=0 001). When combining the larger seropositive group (as well as those with unknown status) with the seronegative patients, there was no longer a significant effect on 28-day mortality (overall 20% of patients in the antibody combination group died vs 21% of patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0 96; 95% confidence interval 0 86 1 03; p=0 17).For the seronegative patients, the duration of hospital stay was four days shorter (median 13 days vs. 17 days) among those allocated to the antibody combination than the usual care group, and the proportion of patients discharged alive by day 28 was greater (64% vs. 58%; rate ratio 1 19, 95% confidence interval 1 08 to 1 30). Among the seronegative patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, the risk of progressing to the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death was lower among those allocated to the antibody combination than the usual care group (30% vs. 37%; risk ratio 0 83, 95% confidence interval 0 75 to 0 92). No such benefits were seen in the overall study population (combining patients with negative, positive, or unknown serostatus).Sir Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, and Joint Chief Investigator for the RECOVERY trial, said:  These results are very exciting. The hope was that by giving a combination of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus we would be able to reduce the worst manifestations of COVID-19. There was, however, great uncertainty about the value of antiviral therapies in late-stage COVID-19 disease. It is wonderful to learn that even in advanced COVID-19 disease, targeting the virus can reduce mortality in patients who have failed to mount an antibody response of their own. Sir Martin Landray, Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, and Joint Chief Investigator, said  We now know that this antibody combination is not only bad for the virus but it is also good for the sickest patients who have failed to mount a natural immune response of their own. That is excellent news   it is the first time that any antiviral treatment has been shown to save lives in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. We are incredibly grateful to the many NHS staff and patients who have contributed to today s discovery. RECOVERY participant, Kimberley Featherstone (37), was treated at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and Calderdale Royal Hospital and randomly allocated to the monoclonal antiviral antibody combination. She said  I was certainly glad to take part in the RECOVERY trial. I feel very lucky that the trial was up and running by the time I was taken to hospital with COVID-19, and I was able to receive this ground-breaking treatment. I m happy that by participating, I played a part in finding out this treatment is successful. The preliminary results of this evaluation of the monoclonal antibody combination will be available as a pre-print on medRxiv later on 16 June 2021 and will be submitted to a leading peer-reviewed medical journal.Professor Fiona Watt, Executive Chair, Medical Research Council, which helped fund the study, said The flagship RECOVERY trial once again leads the way in showing the importance of well-designed clinical trials to identify life-saving treatments. This very important finding means, for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who do not make their own antibodies to the virus, being treated with antibody-based drugs to the spike protein can reduce their risk of death and time spent in hospital. Patients who have made their own antibodies to the virus do not benefit from the new treatment, which is also important information given the cost of drugs. Professor Nick Lemoine, Medical Director at the NIHR Clinical Research Network said  It is fantastic news that the RECOVERY trial has provided evidence to establish another lifesaving treatment against COVID-19 through this monoclonal antiviral antibody combination. The incredible impact the trial continues to have is testament to the scientists and healthcare professionals   but equally the tens of thousands of patients who have taken part.

The study was published today online in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight.""These findings are very encouraging as the BBB prevents most antibodies from penetrating the central nervous system and limits conventional antibody-based approaches to brain tumors,"" said James E. Hansen, MD, associate professor of therapeutic radiology, radiation oncology chief of the Yale Gamma Knife Center at Smilow Cancer Hospital, and corresponding author of the study.Deoxymab-1 (DX1) is an unusual cell-penetrating autoantibody that localizes into live cell nuclei, inhibits DNA repair, and is synthetically lethal to cancer cells with defects in the DNA damage response (DDR).

In efficacy studies in mice models, DX1 crossed the BBB to suppress orthotopic glioblastoma and breast cancer brain metastases.""Our data demonstrate the ability of DX1 to cross the BBB and suppress brain tumors in multiple models, and we are particularly impressed that DX1 was able to yield these results as a single agent in these difficult to treat tumor models,"" said Jiangbing Zhou, associate professor of neurosurgery at Yale School of Medicine and co-corresponding author of the study.""We believe that the ENT2-linked mechanism that transports DX1 across the BBB and into tumors has potential to contribute to multiple new strategies in brain tumor therapy,"" added Hansen.

Typically, the accumulation of harmful cells is prevented by active competition between multiple stem cells in intestinal glands, called crypts.""The functioning of intestinal stem cells relies on growth factors, named Wnts, produced by the surrounding environment. Intestinal cancers typically originate from stem cells where mutations allow growth independent of these factors. When we removed a gene called Notum, which renders Wnts inactive, from mutated stem cells, the number of precancerous adenomas in the intestine was greatly reduced. We found that mutated cells use this gene to block environmental factors critical to normal stem cells gaining advantage in competition,"" says Postdoctoral Researcher Nalle Pentinmikko.The research group of Assistant Professor Pekka Katajisto at the Institute of Biotechnology of the University of Helsinki had already previously discovered that the same gene, also called an 'ageing gene', is expressed in normal tissue when we age, reducing the ability of stem cells to repair damage. The current study shows that mutated cells use the same gene in order to establish a permanent footing in the tissue.""Mutated cells kind of hijack the ageing gene and use it against the healthy stem cells,"" Katajisto says.The results from this study may lead to the development of new therapies, because the function of the enzyme encoded by the ageing gene can be blocked pharmacologically. The research group led by Katajisto has previously used a compound for this purpose in aged research animals to enhance the function of aged stem cells. In the current study, researchers used the same method to reduce the chance of mutated cells winning in competition. A three-week treatment reduced the number of adenomas in animal models.""The results are promising and create a foundation for developing new therapies for patients predisposed to intestinal cancers. This research demonstrates that by enhancing the natural mechanisms of how tissues remove damaged cells, we could also reduce cancer risk in other tissues,"" Pekka Katajisto concludes.Reference: Flanagan DJ, Pentinmikko N, Luopaj rvi K, et al.

The research has provided critical new information about malaria parasite biology that may have applications for the development of much-needed new antimalarial medicines. The research, which was published today in Nature Communications, was led by Ms Cindy Evelyn, Dr Niall Geoghegan, Dr Lachlan Whitehead, Professor Alan Cowman and Dr Kelly Rogers.Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that kills around 400,000 people globally each year. Many of the serious symptoms of malaria occur because of the invasion and growth of the Plasmodium parasite in an infected person s red blood cells, said Dr Rogers, who is the head of WEHI s Centre for Dynamic Imaging.  Understanding in better detail exactly how the parasite invades red blood cells may reveal new ways to stop this stage of the parasite life cycle, potentially leading to much-needed new therapies,  she said.  We used microscopy   specifically a state-of-the-art approach, lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM)   to follow the intricate cellular and molecular changes that occur when the malaria parasite invades red blood cells. We captured the first ever high-resolution, real time and dynamic views of the parasite in action.  Ms Evelyn, who began the research as an Honours student, said the research revealed many previously unrecognised aspects of parasite invasion.  The videos we recorded showed the 'push and pull' interactions as the parasite landed on the red blood cell, and then entered the cell in an enclosed chamber   called a vacuole   where it grew and multiplied.There has long been contention in the field about whether the vacuole is derived from the parasite or the host cell. Our research resolved this question, revealing it was created from the red blood cell s membrane,  she said. Most antimalarial therapies and vaccines target the initial binding of malaria to red blood cells.  By visualising these processes in more detail, our research may contribute in several ways to the development of new antimalarial therapies. For example, now that we know that the parasite vacuole relies on components of the red blood cell membrane, it might be possible to target these components with medicines to disrupt the parasite life cycle. This host-directed approach could be one way to bypass the malaria parasite s propensity to rapidly develop drug resistance,  Dr Rogers said.  LLSM may also have applications for observing the specific steps of parasite invasion that are blocked by potential new drugs   an area we are now very interested in pursuing.  LLSM is an advanced imaging technology that enables researchers to visualise cells and organs in unprecedented detail and in real time. Dr Geoghegan said LLSM had changed how cells could be studied.  In the past, the choice of microscope for an experiment had to be a compromise between capturing a lower resolution video, which revealed dynamic processes like shape changes or movement, and capturing much higher-definition still images, which provided much more detail about how the cells and molecules are functioning,  he said.  LLSM allows us to obtain high-resolution videos of cells, which has been a game-changer for many fields of biological research. We custom built a LLSM at WEHI   the first version of this technology in Australia. This groundbreaking microscopy has enabled us to progress multiple areas of research, including this malaria study. To achieve this, we brought together a multidisciplinary team with expertise in physics, engineering and biology   and the results of this current study have vindicated our approach.

It's more complicated than that,"" said senior author Tanya Alderete, an assistant professor in the Department of Integrative Physiology. ""This study and others suggest it can also relate to how much of an environmental burden one carries.""Previous research has shown pregnant women who smoke or are chronically exposed to air pollution tend to have smaller birthweight babies. In the first year of life, those babies tend to race to catch up, gaining weight unusually fast. Accelerated weight gain in early life has been linked to diabetes, heart disease and weight problems in childhood and adolescence.""This period, either during pregnancy or shortly after birth, is a critical window of development and adverse exposures can program the infant to have a host of problems later in life,"" said lead author William Patterson, a doctoral student.To more closely examine how specific pollutants impact a baby's growth trajectory, the researchers followed 123 mother-infant pairs from the Mother's Milk Study, an ongoing trial in the Los Angeles region. About one-third were of normal weight pre-pregnancy, one-third overweight and one-third obese.The researchers used data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System, which records hourly air quality data from ambient monitoring stations, to quantify their prenatal exposure to four classes of pollutants: PM2.5 and PM10 (inhalable particles from factories, cars and construction sites), nitrogen dioxide (an odorless gas emitted from cars and power plants) and ozone (the main ingredient in smog).Then they followed the babies, periodically measuring not only their weight and height, but also how much fat they carried and where.""We found that greater exposure to prenatal ambient air pollution was associated with greater changes in weight and adiposity, or body fatness, in the first six months of life,"" said Patterson.In some cases, pollutants seemed to impact males and females differently.For instance, exposure to a combination of ozone and nitrogen dioxide in utero was associated with faster growth around the waist in females, while in males it was associated with slower growth in length and greater fat accumulation around the midsection.In adults, excess fat around the midsection has been linked to heart disease and diabetes.""It's not just how much fat you carry but where--that matters,"" said Patterson.How can inhaling pollutants impact growth patterns of a mother's unborn child?Researchers believe those pollutants can inflame the lungs and, in turn, cause systemic inflammation of organs, impacting metabolic processes, such as insulin sensitivity, that can influence fetal development. Pollutants have also been shown to impact gene expression in infants, potentially having life-long impacts that could transcend generations.The authors note that the study includes a relatively small sample size. And because the study included only Hispanic mothers, a larger trial is necessary to confirm results apply to other populations.But Alderete said that in an increasingly diverse country, where racial minorities have been shown repeatedly to shoulder a higher burden of pollutions, it's important to study how those toxins are influencing them.In 2018, the EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment published a study showing that poor people and people of color are exposed to as much as 1.5 times more airborne pollutants than their white counterparts.""Generally speaking, there have not been very many studies that really represent the diversity we have in the United States,"" she said. ""We want to fill that gap.""Meantime, the researchers recommend pregnant women take extra precautions to minimize their exposure to air pollution by closing windows on high ozone days, not exercising outdoors at times of high air pollution and steering clear of activities alongside busy roadways.Reference: Patterson WB, Glasson J, Naik N, et al.

What we re seeing is that if you don t eat the foods that are commonly consumed at breakfast, you have a tendency not to eat them the rest of the day. So those common breakfast nutrients become a nutritional gap,  said Christopher Taylor, professor of medical dietetics in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture s latest dietary guidelines, calcium, potassium, fiber and vitamin D are considered  dietary components of public health concern  for the general U.S. population   with iron added for pregnant women   because shortages of those nutrients are associated with health problems. Most research related to breakfast has focused on the effects of the missed morning meal on children in school, which includes difficulty focusing and behavioral problems.  With adults, it s more like,  You know how important breakfast is.  But now we see what the implications really are if they miss breakfast,  Taylor said. He completed the study with Ohio State College of Medicine graduate students Stephanie Fanelli and Christopher Walls. The research, which was supported by a regional dairy association, is published online in Proceedings of the Nutrition Society. The team used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which collects health information on a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 people every year through interviews, laboratory tests and physical exams. The sample for this study included 30,889 adults age 19 and older who had participated in the survey between 2005 and 2016. The Ohio State researchers analyzed data from 24-hour dietary recalls participants completed as part of the NHANES survey.  During the recall, participants self-designate their eating occasions as a meal or a snack, and they tell you at what point in time they ate whatever food they report,  said Fanelli, first author of the study.  That s how we determined whether someone was a breakfast eater or a breakfast skipper.  In this sample, 15.2% of participants, or 4,924 adults, had reported skipping breakfast. The researchers translated the food data into nutrient estimates and MyPlate equivalents using the federal Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies and daily dietary guidelines, and then compared those estimates to recommended nutrient intakes established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academies. On several key recommendations measured, from fiber and magnesium to copper and zinc, breakfast skippers had taken in fewer vitamins and minerals than people who had eaten breakfast. The differences were most pronounced for folate, calcium, iron, and vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C and D.  We found those who skipped breakfast were significantly more likely not to meet the bottom threshold of what we hope to see people eat,  Fanelli said. Compared to the Healthy Eating Index-2015, which assesses how well a set of foods aligns with federal recommendations, breakfast skippers also had an overall lower-quality diet than those who ate breakfast. For example, breakfast skippers were more likely than those who noshed in the morning to eat more added sugars, carbohydrates and total fat over the course of the day   in part because of higher levels of snacking.  Snacking is basically contributing a meal s worth of calorie intakes for people who skipped breakfast,  Taylor said.  People who ate breakfast ate more total calories than people who didn t eat breakfast, but the lunch, dinner and snacks were much larger for people who skipped breakfast, and tended to be of a lower diet quality.  While the data represent a single day in each participant s life, the huge sample provides a  nationally representative snapshot for the day,  Taylor said.

And yet these amphibious megafauna offered UC Santa Barbara ecologist Keenan Stears a window into the progression of an anthrax outbreak that struck Ruaha National Park, Tanzania, in the dry season of 2017.Through surveys and GPS monitoring, Stears and his colleagues, Wendy Turner, Doug McCauley and Melissa Schmitt, revealed that reduced dry-season flows in the Great Ruaha River indirectly spread the disease by affecting hippo movement. The results, which appear in the journal Ecosphere, present a unique perspective on disease ecology and illustrate how anthropogenic changes can impact wildlife and human health.The ecology of wildlife disease was far out of mind during the dry season in 2016, when Stears and his team outfitted 10 male hippos with GPS collars. The researchers sought to track the animals' movements to better understand their behavior and ecology, especially in light of reduced flows along many of Africa's major rivers. The resulting study was the first to track hippo movement and land use, and finally uncovered some of the basic facts about hippos' spatial ecology.Then the anthrax came.""This wasn't something I actually set out to study,"" said Stears, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology. ""You can't plan for an outbreak to occur; it just happens.""Stears was in the field from 2016 to 2017 conducting hippo counts and maintaining equipment. The GPS tracking collars had been on the animals for about a year, roughly as long as they're supposed to last before dropping off. Noticing one of the collars hadn't moved for a couple of days, he figured it had fallen off. It appeared to be in a nearby pool, so Stears hiked out to retrieve it. ""I turned around a bend in the river, and there was a hippo pool with about six or so hippo carcasses,"" he recalled. Stears had stumbled upon an anthrax outbreak.Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which can manifest in a variety of ways depending on how it's contracted. The bacterium is notable for its ability to produce spores that can lie dormant in the soil for years. Notably, in outbreaks like the one in this study, animals can only spread the disease once they die.Although he isn't a disease ecologist, Stears quickly realized his GPS data could illuminate aspects of the outbreak. There didn't seem to be any existing studies that combined a spatio-temporal account of an active anthrax outbreak with wildlife movement, he explained. ""So this was really a unique opportunity to answer some questions that hadn't really been answered before.""""We can't predict when an anthrax outbreak will occur, so it's impossible to plan such a study,"" added co-author Wendy Turner of the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""This project is in part a fantastic bit of luck (for understanding disease transmission, not for the hippos), and in part very clever and quick thinking by Keenan and Melissa at UCSB, to capitalize on such a unique opportunity.""I have been studying anthrax for years in Namibia, with many more GPS-collared hosts monitored than the 10 in this study,"" she continued, ""and I still haven't had any of our individuals succumb to the disease.""The team first had to determine how many hippos in this population had interacted with potentially infected pools. That meant identifying which of the many disconnected pools along this stretch of the Great Ruaha River were infected. Stears' colleagues at Ruaha National Park conducted sampling for the pathology to confirm the anthrax outbreak.Stears and his team conducted daily counts of both live and dead hippos in these pools. The surveys enabled them to track the disease's spread, its rate and direction. The scientists were also curious where the hippos were coming from, where they were going and whether the outbreak was influencing their behavior.The researchers linked this information with the hippo movement data they had from the GPS collars. Four of the 10 hippos they had tracked could have caught the disease, Stears said, and of those, three died.The team found that infection had no noticeable effect on a hippo's movement. Infected individuals roamed just as much as healthy hippos. ""This has important implications for how far a single individual could potentially vector the disease before its death and create new infectious reservoirs,"" Stears said. Under certain conditions, wildlife can succumb to infection within a few days. Even if this is the case, a hippo can walk about seven kilometers over the course of a night in search of water. Thus, hippos can quickly move the disease over large distances.What's more, the animals didn't appear to actively avoid carcasses. Why? Well, dry times are not good times to be a hippo. Normally, species avoid the bodies of their own kind. But with suitable ponds so scarce, the amphibious animals were forced to remain in pools alongside the dead.""The drying of rivers is one of the major reasons why these outbreaks have gotten so bad over the years,"" Stears explained. ""As the river dries, hippos are forced to congregate in the remaining river pools. Now this paper's showing that their movements spread the disease as well.""Anthrax outbreaks are a natural occurrence, but drying rivers are making them worse. As pools dry up, hippos either pack into those that remain or move to find new ones. Increased crowding and social interactions can drive up physiological stress, which scientists have linked to a greater susceptibility to infection.Additionally, altered hippo movements as they search for new pools raise the risk of exposure to anthrax reservoirs as well as the duration that they interact with these reservoirs. Aggressive interactions around the remaining pools mean that hippos frequently visit several in a given night. All these factors have exacerbated anthrax outbreaks in hippo populations.Stears noted that hippos also appear particularly susceptible to these outbreaks, aggregating as they do in small, dirty pools during the dry season. Other animals avoid drinking from hippo pools during these times because of all the dung that has accumulated due to the lack of river flow. Instead, they seek out shallower puddles that are cleaner, which potentially protects them from contracting lethal doses of the disease.""Understanding disease outbreaks in hippos is especially important,"" said co-author Doug McCauley, an associate professor of ecology, evolution, and marine biology (EEMB) at UC Santa Barbara. ""People don't often realize that hippos are a vulnerable species that has declined in many areas. There are far less hippos, for example, than African elephants. Their outlook is further complicated by potential impacts that climate change may have on rivers and how this change might amplify disease outbreak risk.""Stears plans to start looking at historical records of river flow across Africa and linking changes in hydrology to past anthrax outbreak timing and severity. There hasn't been much research on anthrax and river flow, he said; most of the work has been terrestrial. The historical records could be a treasure chest of information.Shedding light on the factors that influence disease dynamics helps scientists predict how disturbances might affect future outbreaks. With this information, they can begin to assess how future circumstances could affect the extent and severity of an anthrax outbreak, as well as the probability that it jumps to other species of wildlife, livestock and even humans.""Hippos can be considered the canary in the coal mine,"" added co-author Melissa Schmitt(link is external), an EEMB postdoctoral researcher. ""Their sensitivity to adverse conditions makes them a good indicator of how global change may influence disease dynamics and overall wildlife health.In all, the paper represents a confluence of events that offered an unparalleled opportunity to explore novel disease dynamics. ""You can only get this kind of information from having an animal that is collared and actually infected,"" Stears said. ""So this unique situation allowed us to answer questions that you just can't normally answer without having everything lined up.""Reference: Stears K, Schmitt MH, Turner WC, et al.

Studies have shown that varenicline, marketed under the brand name Chantix, may also be effective in reducing alcohol consumption.Participants, who ranged in age from 21 to 65, smoked at least five cigarettes a day, with male participants generally consuming more than 14 drinks a week and women more than seven per week.Over the 12-week study period, each participant received 2 milligrams of varenicline twice a day. Roughly half the group   83 participants   also received a 50-milligram dose of naltrexone daily, while the other 82 received placebo pills. They were all told to quit smoking and drink less.When researchers followed up 26 weeks after the study s conclusion, they found that nearly 36%   59 participants   had quit smoking. The overall smoking quit rate in the trial is impressive,  said lead author Lara Ray, a professor of psychology and of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences who holds UCLA s Shirley M. Hatos Chair in Clinical Neuropharmacology. She noted that previous studies have suggested varenicline has a success rate at six months of about 25% to 30%. We exceeded the overall expectation for this medication,  she said.  This is especially important in a diverse group of people.  Ray said that while some previous studies have shown lower-than-average smoking cessation rates among Black participants, that was not the case in the current trial, in which more than half of participants were Black.Surprisingly, the researchers said, those who had received varenicline plus a placebo had a significantly higher smoking quit rate (45%, or 37 of 82 participants) than those who were given varenicline and naltrexone (27%, or 22 of 83 participants). The quit rate for varenicline alone in this sample is highly encouraging, as this is the first large-scale trial of varenicline efficacy focused solely on heavy-drinking smokers,  Ray said.While participants who received varenicline plus naltrexone had a lower smoking quit rate, they had slightly better success than the placebo group at curbing their drinking. At the start of the study, participants averaged nearly seven drinks per drinking day; those on the varenicline-naltrexone combination reduced their consumption to three drinks per drinking day over the 12-week study period, while those receiving the varenicline-placebo combination cut down to four drinks  both impressive decreases, Ray said. I am excited about both the smoking cessation rates and the drinking reductions,  said Ray, who is also a member of UCLA s Brain Research Institute. These findings suggests that desirable outcomes for smoking cessation and drinking reduction are achievable. The study, which found no difference in quit and reduction rates between men and women, was published online in the American Journal of Psychiatry June 3 and is scheduled for publication in the journal s September print issue.Approximately 20% to 25% of smokers are also heavy drinkers. Smoking and heavy drinking are major public health concerns that reduce people s life span and quality of life, and both have also been linked to worse health outcomes for COVID-19.As with all addictions, quitting smoking and reducing drinking are difficult and complex processes. This study confirms that medications can play a role, Ray said, but she noted that it can be challenging for patients to take more than one prescribed medication. Varenicline alone is doing a great job, and this trial indicates that there is not much room for naltrexone to make a difference,  Ray said.  But even medications like varenicline have their limitations. Medication is only part of the solution. There remains much research to be done on addictions and how to treat them. Ray says that those who wish to quit smoking and reduce drinking may consider talking to their doctor about the possibility of using varenicline, and she recommends that they try to quit smoking and reduce their drinking at the same time. There is evidence that varenicline can help them with both,  Ray said.  Varenicline appears quite effective at reducing drinking and helping people to quit smoking. Given that varenicline has been found to reduce drinking in trials for alcohol use disorder, it is possible that its effects on both drinking and smoking present an optimal alternative for this group of heavy-drinking smokers. ReJoyce Green, a UCLA doctoral student in clinical psychology who works with Ray, and Karen Miotto, a UCLA clinical professor of psychiatry and the medical director of the clinical trial, are among the study s 14 authors.The clinical trial and Ray s research are funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, both part of the National Institutes of Health.The study was conducted between July 2015 and December 2019 at an outpatient research facility at UCLA.Reference: Ray LA, Green R, Enders C, et al.

According to the study, 56 percent of foundations and eye products, 48 percent of lip products and 47 percent of mascaras tested were found to contain high levels of fluorine, which is an indicator of PFAS use in the product. The study was recently published in the journal of Environmental Science and Technology Letters. ""These results are particularly concerning when you consider the risk of exposure to the consumer combined with the size and scale of a multibillion-dollar industry that provides these products to millions of consumers daily,"" Graham Peaslee, professor of physics at Notre Dame and principal investigator of the study, said. ""There's the individual risk -- these are products that are applied around the eyes and mouth with the potential for absorption through the skin or at the tear duct, as well as possible inhalation or ingestion. PFAS is a persistent chemical -- when it gets into the bloodstream, it stays there and accumulates. There's also the additional risk of environmental contamination associated with the manufacture and disposal of these products, which could affect many more people."" Previously found in nonstick cookware, treated fabrics, fast food wrappers and, most recently, the personal protective equipment used by firefighters across the country, PFAS are known as ""forever chemicals,"" because the chemical compounds don't naturally degrade -- which means they end up contaminating groundwater for decades after their release into the environment. Use of PFAS in foam fire suppressants has been linked to contaminated drinking water systems, prompting the Department of Defense to switch to environmentally safer alternatives, for example. Studies have linked certain PFAS to kidney cancer, testicular cancer, hypertension, thyroid disease, low birth weight and immunotoxicity in children. Peaslee and the research team tested products purchased at retail locations in the United States as well as products purchased online in Canada. The study found high levels of fluorine in liquid lipsticks, waterproof mascaras and foundations often advertised as ""long-lasting"" and ""wear-resistant."" Peaslee said this not entirely surprising, given PFAS are often used for their water resistance and film-forming properties. What is more concerning is that 29 products with high fluorine concentrations were tested further and found to contain between four and 13 specific PFAS, only one of these items tested listed PFAS as an ingredient on the product label. ""This is a red flag,"" Peaslee said. ""Our measurements indicate widespread use of PFAS in these products -- but it's important to note that the full extent of use of fluorinated chemicals in cosmetics is hard to estimate due to lack of strict labeling requirements in both countries."" Peaslee's novel method of detecting PFAS in a wide variety of materials has helped reduce the use of ""forever chemicals"" in consumer and industrial products. Following a study from his lab in 2017, fast food chains that discovered their wrappers contained PFAS switched to alternative options. Peaslee continues to receive samples of firefighter turnout gear from fire departments around the world to test for PFAS, and his research has spurred conversations within the firefighter community to eliminate use of ""forever chemicals"" in various articles of personal protective equipment.ReferenceWhitehead HD, Venier M, Wu Y, et al.

This is in contrast to currently available tests that are around 60-93% accurate and cannot differentiate unique variants.  For the first time, the new tests can be used to estimate the prevalence of circulating variant strains in the community, including the variants first identified in Kent and in India, now known as the Alpha and Delta variants. The tests can also assess the long-term immunity of an individual and whether immunity is vaccine-induced or is a result of previous exposure to the infection   information that is invaluable in helping to prevent the spread of infection.  In addition to this, the tests can also provide information that can be used to estimate the duration of the immunity provided by the vaccine as well as the effectiveness of the vaccine on emerging variants.  This is an improvement on the currently available tests that struggle to detect variants and give little or no information on the impact of virus mutations on vaccine performance.  Professor Mirela Delibegovic from the University of Aberdeen and academic lead on the project explains:  Accurate antibody tests will become increasingly important in the management of the pandemic and this is a truly game-changing technology with the potential to dramatically change the trajectory of global recovery from the pandemic.  Professor Delibegovic worked alongside industry partners, Vertebrate Antibodies and colleagues in NHS Grampian to develop the new tests using the innovative antibody technology known as Epitogen. Funded by the Scottish Government Chief Scientist Office Rapid Response in COVID-19 (RARC-19) research programme, the team used artificial intelligence called EpitopePredikt, to identify specific elements, or  hot spots  of the virus that trigger the body s immune defence. The researchers were then able to develop a new way to display these viral elements as they would appear naturally in the virus, using a biological platform they named EpitoGen Technology. This approach enhances the test s performance which means only relevant viral elements are included to allow improved sensitivity. Importantly, this approach is capable of incorporating emerging mutants into the tests thus enhancing the test detection rates.  As well as Covid-19, the EpitoGen platform can be used for the development of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for infectious and auto-immune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes. Dr Abdo Alnabulsi, Chief Operating Officer of AiBIOLOGICS, who helped develop the technology said:  Our tests have been designed in line with the gold standard requirements for such tests and in our trials they have proven to be more accurate while giving more useful information than existing tests.  Dr Tiehui Wang, Director of Biologics at Vertebrate Antibodies Ltd, added:  We are extremely proud that our technologies have made such a contribution in a very challenging year.   The EpitoGen tests are the first of their kind and will play a significant role in combating the pandemic and pave the way for future diagnostics . Professor Delibegovic adds:  As we move through the pandemic we are seeing the virus mutate into more transmissible variants such as the Delta variant whereby they impact negatively on vaccine performance and overall immunity. Currently available tests cannot detect these variants.  As the virus mutates, existing antibody tests will become even less accurate hence the urgent need for a novel approach to incorporate mutant strains into the test   this is exactly what we have achieved.  Looking ahead, discussions are already underway to explore a possible roll-out of the tests to the NHS which we hope to see happen soon. Dr Brittain-Long, Consultant in Infectious Diseases in NHS Grampian and a member of the research team adds:  This new testing platform adds crucial sensitivity and specificity to the current available serology tests and has the potential to monitor individual and population based immunity in a way that has not been possible before.   In my work I have experienced first-hand the detrimental effects this virus can have on people, and I am very excited to add another tool in the toolbox to fight this pandemic.

In a new study in Nature Communications, Zhongwei Li and his colleagues describe how they can generate rudimentary kidney structures, known as organoids, that resemble the collecting duct system that helps maintain the body's fluid and pH balance by concentrating and transporting urine.""Our progress in creating new types of kidney organoids provides powerful tools for not only understanding development and disease, but also finding new treatments and regenerative approaches for patients,"" said Li, the study's corresponding author and an assistant professor of medicine, and of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.Creating the building blocksThe first authors of the study, PhD student Zipeng Zeng and postdoc Biao Huang, and the team started with a population of what are known as ureteric bud progenitor cells, or UPCs, that play an important role in early kidney development. Using first mouse and then human UPCs, the scientists were able to develop cocktails of molecules that encourage the cells to form organoids resembling uretic buds--the branching tubes that eventually give rise to the collecting duct system. The scientists also succeeded in finding a different cocktail to induce human stem cells to develop into ureteric bud organoids.An additional molecular cocktail pushed ureteric bud organoids--grown from either mouse UPCs or human stem cells--to reliably develop into even more mature and complex collecting duct organoids.The human and mouse ureteric bud organoids can also be genetically engineered to harbor mutations that cause disease in patients, providing better models for understanding kidney problems, as well as for screening potential therapeutic drugs. As one example, the scientists knocked out a gene to create an organoid model of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, known as CAKUT.In addition to serving as models of disease, ureteric bud organoids could also prove to be an essential ingredient in the recipe for a synthetic kidney. To explore this possibility, the scientists combined mouse ureteric bud organoids with a second population of mouse cells: the progenitor cells that form nephrons, which are the filtering units of the kidney. After inserting the tip of a lab-grown ureteric bud into a clump of NPCs, the team observed the growth of an extensive network of branching tubes reminiscent of a collecting duct system, fused with rudimentary nephrons.""Our engineered mouse kidney established a connection between nephron and collecting duct--an essential milestone towards building a functional organ in the future,"" said Li.Reference: Zeng Z, Huang B, Parvez RK, et al.

But while the GRCh38 (hg38) human reference genome was released more than seven years ago, the older GRCh37 (hg19) reference remains widely used by most research and clinical laboratories. In a new study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers at the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine identify genetic variant discrepancies between the two references, creating guidance for laboratories to take advantage of an improved human reference genome.""There's a big push to update genomic sequencing resources to use the hg38 reference because the belief is that hg38 is a significant improvement over hg19,"" said Moez Dawood, co-first author of the study and student in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Baylor. ""We wanted to identify the differences in sequencing readouts between the two references for labs that are still using hg19.""The Baylor researchers analyzed exome sequencing samples from more than 1,500 participants in the Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics program. They found 206 genes with discordant variants between hg19 and hg38, including eight genes implicated in Mendelian diseases and 53 associated with common disease phenotypes. They found 73% of the discordant variants were clustered within sections of the genome with known assembly problems that the researchers called DISCordant Reference Patches (DISCREPs).""This study isn't a theoretical comparison of the two references; we looked at exome data from study participants and examined the impact of using the updated reference on Mendelian genes and pathogenic variants,"" said Dr. Aniko Sabo, a senior author of the study and assistant professor at the Human Genome Sequencing Center.

They found that the grandchildren of the sulfidic-adapted fish had more epigenetic marks in common with their wild, toxic-water-living grandparents than other Atlantic molly that had always lived in freshwater. After two generations in laboratory conditions, the fish generally retained their same epigenetic marks, which was really unexpected,  said Joanna Kelley, WSU associate professor of evolutionary genomics and a corresponding author on the study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  In an evolutionary context, the study shows that these epigenetic marks are fairly stable. Hydrogen sulfide is found in nature and as a by-product generated by many human activities, such as paper manufacturing, sewage treatment and gas exploration. For most animals, including humans, it is usually toxic at relatively low concentrations and fatal at high levels. Yet some populations of Atlantic molly have adapted to living in springs with high levels of hydrogen sulfide, while other groups of the same species have remained in freshwater. To Kelley and her colleagues, these fish presented a natural experiment to help address questions of how evolutionary adaptations occur.For this study, Kelley collaborated with WSU environmental epigenetics and reproductive biologist Michael Skinner, to do the epigenetic analysis. The researchers raised a sample of sulfidic and non-sulfidic fish  in freshwater environments. When the fish produced two generations of offspring, they measured their epigenetic similarities, specifically regions of DNA methylation, a type of chemical modification that can regulate gene expression, turning a gene on or off, without changing the DNA sequence string itself.They found that the grand-offspring of the sulfidic fish had an 80% overlap in DNA methylation regions with the grandparent fish even though they had been raised in freshwater. This compares to only 20% overlap with the non-sulfidic fish that had always lived in freshwater. It s really one of the first examples where we ve taken an organism out of its normal environment and put it into a different environment and showed that the epigenetics keep being inherited going forward,  said Skinner, also a corresponding author on the paper.The study also adds to evidence from previous animal research showing that exposure to toxins has epigenetic effects that can last for generations. Skinner s lab has conducted studies on other wild species, including Darwin Finch in the Galapagos and the New Zealand mud snail as well as laboratory animals, showing that epigenetic changes resulting from environmental toxicants are passed down. This is not a one-off, unique species event. This has an impact on everything, including humans,  said Skinner.  Although this is an animal model, it s a demonstration of how an environmental toxicant can actually shift the epigenetics, and it becomes programmed for subsequent generations.

It supports our wellbeing, immune system and mental health - but how is it sustained?Researchers in the UK and Germany, alongside other international collaborators, have investigated the evolution of bacteria in the human gut microbiome - asking how these microbes persist throughout their lifetimes - taking into account internal and external influencing factors.The results of the study will help inform tailored probiotics, live bacteria found in particular foods or supplements, as well as dietary or medical interventions, to treat gut disease and maintain a healthy gut microbiome.Keeping a stable, healthy gut microbial population is mutually beneficial to us and the bacteria. In exchange for nutrition and a comfortable habitat, the microbe community returns the favour by providing us with health benefits, which we are now starting to understand.Lead author and Group Leader Dr Falk Hildebrand from the Quadram Institute and Earlham Institute, explains: ""We know that certain microbes colonise us at birth, and some can live with us for decades. Yet, although studies have looked at individual microbe species, the mechanisms and scale of persistence in the microbiome as a whole haven't been explored.""To examine this, a team of scientists at the Earlham Institute and Quadram Institute on the Norwich Research Park, along with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Germany, used metagenomics to analyse the evolutionary strategies and persistence of different bacteria in the human gut microbiome.Metagenomics is the study of all of the genes from many different organisms in a population. In terms of the human gut microbiome, this process not only provides detailed information about the bacteria strains present but also indicates the enhancing capabilities of those different strains, based on their genetics, to keep the gut in good working order.From analysing stool samples, the team re-examined metagenomes from over 2,000 adult and infant samples, including several from the same families and found three major dispersal strategies underlying human gut bacterial persistence. The data came from previously published studies looking at microbiome changes over time, with each individual providing on average 2-3 samples several months apart.Last author and Director EMBL Heidelberg (Scientific Activities) Prof Peer Bork, said: ""By looking into time series from individuals and family members and overlaying this with geographic information, ranging from household via city to country, we identified groups of bacterial strains that show different dispersal strategies. This presented very different persistence patterns in the host, regional spreading and the geographical distributions of hundreds of bacterial species.""The data was built into a diverse dataset of 5,278 metagenomes, which were probed to analyse patterns of persistence in the different types of bacteria and how these were influenced by the common factors: age, family members, geographic region, and antibiotic usage.""Our analysis shows that most strains of bacteria present in the microbiome are very persistent - with the chances of a strain persisting for at least a year being over 90%,"" said Dr Hildebrand.""Some microbe species did show consistent differences being either highly persistent taxonomic groups, or being low-persistent, relying more on exchanges between family members. In babies, however, the average persistence of bacterial strains dropped to 80%. This isn't unexpected; we know that especially in newborn babies there is an ongoing exchange of gut microbes.""Prof Bork, added: ""What the study shows is that the intrinsic persistence levels of bacteria seen in adults are also reflected in children, and gradually we start to acquire those persistent bacteria up to about ten-years-old at which point the microbiome reaches a steady state. """"Antibiotics had different effects of different types of bacteria, with the overall effect depending on how resilient different bacteria are, their intrinsic persistence, and to what extent they were replaceable within the microbiome.""To delve deeper into what drives persistence, the researchers compared microbiome communities beyond an individual level, but also across families, countries and regions. This allowed them to group bacteria based on their persistence characteristics and, through genomic analysis, look for clues to the evolution of these groups' strategies in dispersing among new human hosts.","Published: June 15, 2021"

While opioid dependence has been extensively studied in preclinical models, an understanding of the biological alterations that occur in the brains of people who chronically use opioids and who are diagnosed with OUD has remained elusive. To address this issue, researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) have conducted the largest transcriptomic (the study of all the RNA molecules within a cell) study to date using postmortem brains from people with OUD.Their findings for the first time show a critical role for neuroinflammation as the driver of the pathological brain alterations produced by chronic opioid use. They also identify microglia (the most prominent immune cells of the central nervous system and the first to respond when something goes wrong in the brain) as the cell type responsible for many of these changes.""Our study has yielded a number of surprising and important findings, including how two of the most critical brain regions associated with opioid dependence, the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, communicate with one another under ""healthy"" conditions, as well as how opioids alter fundamental brain processes contributing to opioid dependence,"" explained corresponding author Ryan W. Logan, PhD, associate professor of pharmacology & experimental therapeutics at BUSM.To investigate the molecular changes in the human brain associated with opioid dependence, the researchers used transcriptomic and computational approaches to examine gene changes in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens and discovered changes associated with inflammation and synaptic structure/function in the brains of people who are diagnosed with OUD. ""The data reveals a new mechanism by which opioids may alter the brains' structure to change synaptic plasticity, ultimately resulting in behavioral changes,"" said Logan.According to the researchers, inflammation in the brain is related to several psychiatric disorders and neurological disorders including neurodegeneration and aging-related brain diseases. ""Our findings highlight the potential role for activation of specific inflammatory pathways in the brain and their interplay in brain processes related to cognition, impulsivity, risk-taking and substance use,"" he added.The researcher believe this this work offers a new context for neuroinflammatory actions in the human brain that may explain how opioids produce circuit dysfunction.

They say that action is needed urgently to reduce UPF consumption among children.Professor Christopher Millett, NIHR Professor of Public Health at Imperial College London, said: ""We often ask why obesity rates are so high among British children and this study provides a window into this. Our findings show that an exceptionally high proportion of their diet is made up of ultra-processed foods, with one in five children consuming 78% of their calories from ultra-processed foods.""Through a lack of regulation, and enabling the low cost and ready availability of these foods, we are damaging our children's long-term health. We urgently need effective policy change to redress the balance, to protect the health of children and reduce the proportion of these foods in their diet.""Dr Eszter Vamos, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Public Health Medicine at Imperial, said: ""One of the key things we uncover here is a dose-response relationship. This means that it's not only the children who eat the most ultra-processed foods have the worst weight gain, but also the more they eat, the worse this gets.""""Childhood is a critical time when food preferences and eating habits are formed with long-lasting effects on health. We know that if children have an unhealthy weight early in life, this tends to trace into adolescence and then adulthood. We also know that an excessive consumption of ultra-processed foods is linked to a number of health issues including being overweight or obese, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, type two diabetes and cancer later in life, so the implications are enormous.""This latest study provides new, important data on the impact of industrial food processing, in which foods are modified to change their consistency, taste, colour, shelf life or other attributes through mechanical or chemical alteration - typically lacking in traditional, home-prepared meals - on child health.Led by a team from Imperial's School of Public Health, the work is the first to look at the link between the consumption of UPFs and obesity in children over a long period of time, with findings broadly applicable to children across the UK.Using data from a cohort of 9,000 children in the Avon area in the West of England born in the early 1990s, researchers were able to follow the life course of children from the age of 7 until the age of 24. As part of this cohort, food diaries were completed at age 7, 10 and 13, recording the food and beverages children consumed over three days. Data measures were also collected over 17 years, covering areas including body mass index (BMI), weight, waist circumference and measurements of body fat.Researchers categorised children into five equally-sized groups based on the consumption of UPFs in their diet - in the lowest group UPFs accounted for one fifth (23.2% of grams) of total diet, while the highest group consumed more than two-thirds of UPFs (67.8% of grams). Major sources of UPFs in the highest consumption group included fruit-based or fizzy drinks, ready meals, and mass-produced packaged bread and cakes. Comparatively, diets in the lowest consumption group were based on minimally processed foods and beverages, such as plain yogurt, water and fruit.The analysis revealed that on average, children in the higher consumption groups saw a more rapid progression of their BMI, weight, waist circumference and body fat into adolescence and early adulthood. By 24 years of age, those in the highest UPF group had, on average, a higher level of BMI by 1.2 kg/m2, body fat by 1.5%, weight by 3.7 kg and waist circumference by 3.1 cm.Kiara Chang, Research Fellow and first author on the paper, said: ""During the 17 years of follow up, we saw a very consistent increase in all measures of unhealthy weight among children who consumed greater amounts of ultra-processed foods as part of their diet. Their BMI, weight gain, and body fat gain was much quicker than those children consuming less ultra-processed foods. We actually see it making a difference from as young as 9 years old, between those consuming the most compared with those consuming the least ultra-processed foods.""The researchers highlight that a limitation of the study is its observational nature, and that they are unable to definitively show direct causation between consumption of UPFs and increases in BMI and body fat.According to the researchers, more radical and effective public health actions are needed urgently to reduce children's exposure and consumption of UPFs and to address childhood obesity in the UK and internationally. These actions should include:National dietary guidelines should be updated to emphasise preference for fresh or minimally processed foods and avoidance of ultra-processed foods, in line with guidelines developed in Brazil, Uruguay, France, Belgium and Israel.UPFs should be taxed and minimally processed foods should be subsidised to make healthier food choices more affordable. Other actions include restricting promotions and all forms of advertising of UPFs, especially those targeting children, and mandatory bold front-of-pack product labelling.They add that further studies are now needed to determine the underlying mechanisms linking UPF consumption to worse health outcomes. Hypotheses include that UPFs produce lower satiety, meaning that people do not feel full after eating these products, encouraging excess consumption. More research is also needed to explore whether additives in highly processed food interfere with biological processes, such as hormones influencing appetite and glucose control.Professor Millett featured in the recent BBC One documentary 'What Are We Feeding Our Kids?', in which he said: ""Today in Britain, two in every three calories consumed amongst children and adolescents is derived from this group [of ultra-processed foods]. They're everywhere, they're cheap, and they're heavily marketed. So they're very difficult to resist and very difficult to avoid.""Reference: Chang K, Khandpur N, Neri D, et al.

New research aims to understand how this fish waste can be treated for use in aquaponics systems, by removing excessive carbon, yet preserving the mineral nutrients required by plants to grow.In this study in Frontiers in Plant Science, researchers from the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, demonstrate a novel and effective way to convert this fish sludge into plant fertilizer and therefore improving the nutrients available for plants in hydroponic plant cultivation. The lead author, Mr Victor Lobanov explains: ""Fish sludge is a waste product made up of uneaten food and fish feces and is normally broken down by bacteria in the water. In addition to physically harming fish gills, excess carbon in the solids leads to excessive bacterial growth - diminishing oxygen in the water and hampering the ability of the fish to breathe. We wanted to find out whether this waste could be used to fertilize plants in aquaponics systems by removing the excessive carbon, yet preserving the minerals needed for growing crops.""The researchers investigated a potential solution inspired by sewage and wastewater treatment plants found around the world, called enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). This process was adapted by the researchers so that the risk of bacteria build up in the water was reduced, but the minerals from the fish waste were soluble in the water and could therefore be biologically available for plants to take up. They found that the solid treatment system they developed was highly effective at delivering nutrients from the fish waste to the aquaponic system in the form of a liquid fertilizer equally as efficiently as a commercial nutrient solution. Although the fertilizer did not meet plant needs entirely as some nutrients such as manganese were missing, the researchers hope to optimize this system in future studies: ""Hopefully we can scale the system more efficiently in the future, not just for lettuce as used in this study but as well as for other plants, with the right number of fish corresponding to the size of the system. By further optimizing the breakdown of fish solids by the solid treatment system, we can also achieve a faster treatment rate and make the whole process more efficient,"" explains Mr Lobanov. Commercial fertilizer solutions often have very high levels of nitrogen, stimulating crops to swell and absorb large amounts of water and giving the appearance of improved growth but often decreasing the amounts of minerals in the plant. Despite the fertilizer created by the solids treatment system containing lower levels of nitrogen than commercially available chemical fertilizers, plants were not nutrient deficient. This suggests that the high nitrogen levels commonly used are in excess of what the plants need. The authors hope that this finding will stimulate further research into the connections between plant nutrients, health and taste: ""Our work shows that this type of cultivation is not only more sustainable, but it is also capable of providing nutrients in a form that is easily accessible to plants. Farmers can take this system and optimize it for their specific crops and production volumes, potentially even supplementing with additional nutrients if required.""ReferenceLobanov VP, Combot D, Pelissier P, Labb  L, Joyce A.

Because pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect early, it is associated with a low survival rate, accounting for just over 3% of all new cancer cases in the U.S., but leading to nearly 8% of all cancer deaths, according to the National Cancer Institute.Through a pre-clinical study conducted in his former role at Moffitt Cancer Center and published in Clinical Cancer Research, Said Sebti, Ph.D., associate director for basic research at VCU Massey Cancer Center, identified a novel drug that effectively thwarts pancreatic tumors that are addicted to the cancer-causing mutant KRAS gene. Sebti recently met with clinical colleagues at Massey to discuss evaluating the drug in clinical trials in patients whose pancreatic tumors harbor mutant KRAS.""We discovered a link between hyperactivation of the CDK protein and mutant KRAS addiction, and we exploited this link preclinically to counter mutant KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer, warranting clinical investigation in patients afflicted with this deadly disease,"" said Sebti, who is also the Lacy Family Chair in Cancer Research at Massey and a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the VCU School of Medicine. ""Our findings are highly significant as they revealed a new avenue to combat an aggressive form of pancreatic cancer with very poor prognosis due mainly to its resistance to conventional therapies.""KRAS is mutated in 90 percent of pancreatic cancers. Previous research from the Sebti lab and other labs has demonstrated that some tumors that harbor mutant KRAS are actually addicted to the mutant gene, meaning they cannot survive or grow without it. Sebti set out to discover if there is a drug that can specifically kill tumors that are addicted to mutant KRAS.Sebti and collaborators used three scientific approaches to try and answer this question.First, they mapped out the blueprint of pancreatic cancer cells through global phosphoproteomics, which gave them a snapshot of how the addicted and non-addicted tumors differ at the phosphoprotein level. They found two proteins -- CDK1 and CDK2 -- which were indicative of which cells were addicted to mutant KRAS.Additionally, they analyzed a comprehensive database from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that contains genome-wide CRISPR gRNA screening datasets. They found that CDK1 and CDK2 as well as CDK7 and CDK9 proteins were associated with mutant KRAS-addicted tumors.Lastly, they evaluated the ability of a library of 294 FDA drugs to selectively kill mutant KRAS-addicted cancer cells over non-KRAS-addicted cancer cells in the lab and determined the most effective drug in preclinical experiments was AT7519, an inhibitor of CDK1, CDK2, CDK7 and CDK9.""Using three entirely different approaches, the same conclusion presented itself clearly to us: pancreatic cancer patients whose tumors are addicted to mutant KRAS could benefit greatly from treatment with the CDK inhibitor AT7519,"" Sebti said.To further validate these findings in fresh patient-derived tumors from pancreatic cancer patients, Sebti collaborated on this study with Jose Trevino, M.D., surgeon-in-chief and the Walter Lawrence, Jr., Distinguished Professorship in Oncology at Massey who was at the University of Florida at the time. They found that AT7519 suppressed the growth of xenograft cells from five mutant KRAS pancreatic cancer patients who relapsed on chemotherapy and/or radiation therapies.AT7519 has previously been tested unsuccessfully in a number of clinical trials, but none of the trials targeted pancreatic cancer.""If our findings are correct and translate in humans, then we should be able to see a positive response in pancreatic cancer patients whose tumors are addicted to mutant KRAS,"" Sebti said.The study authors believe that, in addition to pancreatic cancer, these findings may also have clinical implications for colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer patients where mutations in KRAS are prevalent.Reference: Kazi A, Chen L, Xiang S, et al.

Researchers at NC State University found that differences between the elemental composition of foods and the elemental needs of animals can explain the development of pleasing tastes like salty, umami and sweet.Taste tells us a lot about foods before they are swallowed and digested, and some tastes correspond with the elemental composition of foods. For example, an aged steak lights up the umami taste receptors, because it has a high concentration of the element nitrogen, which occurs in amino acid molecules. Nitrogen is essential for survival, but often occurs in low concentrations relative to the demand by animals. Likewise, sodium is limited in many foods in nature   think of life before supermarkets. So if you need sodium to survive   and all animals do   you are more likely to have adapted a taste for, and seek out, salty foods.  Nutritional imbalances, even at the elemental level, can limit the growth and metabolism of animals,  says Lee Demi, a co-author of the study and postdoctoral researcher in NC State s Department of Applied Ecology.  We posited that animals should have evolved the ability to taste, and enjoy, certain elements and nutrients that are most likely to be limiting for growth, due to their low concentrations in typical foods.  To investigate this hypothesis, Demi and colleagues compared the body elemental composition of three animal groups (mammals, fish, and insects) to the elemental composition of plants, the base of most food webs. They predicted that animals who eat foods composed of particular elements that are rare or unpredictable are more likely to have taste receptors that reward them for finding those same elements.  Because animals have very limited ability to change their elemental composition, the old adage that  You are what you eat  doesn t really apply,  says Demi.  Rather, animals are rewarded with pleasing tastes for  eating what they are , at least from an elemental composition perspective, which helps reduce the prospect of dietary nutrient limitation.  This is particularly important for omnivorous and herbivorous animals that eat a variety of different foods which vary in nutritional quality. Within this framework, taste becomes a tool that helps consumers prioritize which foods they should search for and consume, so they don t waste time on foods that have less of these necessary elements. Equally, taste can also inform consumers to avoid foods that contain too much of an element they need. This is why eating a handful of chips is more attractive than eating a handful of table salt. Where you are on the food chain can predict the complexity of your taste systems. Some top predators, like orcas, have lost many taste receptors over evolutionary time. This study suggests that predators are less likely to experience strong elemental imbalances in their diet than herbivores or omnivores. Because their prey already match their elemental needs, predators experience less selective pressure to maintain elaborate taste systems. However, these top predators have kept their taste for salt, which can be harmful if overconsumed.     Affinity for certain foods must have strong evolutionary drivers, because without taste, animals would be forced to overconsume everything in the hopes of hitting the magic ratio of elements needed for growth and development,  says Benjamin Reading, co-author of the study and a professor in NC State s Department of Applied Ecology.  They would need to eat way too much and end up excreting huge quantities of those things they need less of, which is not efficient.  The research team also found strong evidence of convergent taste evolution in mammals, fish, and insects. Each group, although far apart on the phylogenetic tree, all have adapted tastes that prioritize the same infrequent elements, including sodium, nitrogen and phosphorus.  Phosphorus is particularly intriguing because this recently discovered taste is most strongly linked to phosphate, which is also the primary form of phosphorus in many nucleic acids, ATP, phospholipids, etc.,  says Brad Taylor, a co-author of the study and professor in NC State s Department of Applied Ecology.  Phosphate is the most readily available form of phosphorus for uptake by plants, and often the primary growth limiting element in organisms and ecosystems. So, links between the elemental form, taste receptors, organismal needs, and ecosystem are really direct.  While the neurobiological process of taste has been extensively researched, this study is the first to explore taste as an evolutionary tool for optimal foraging. The researchers suggest that this may open a new area of thought on how taste can indicate how animals impact their environments through foraging, nutrient-cycling, and other core principles of ecology.ReferenceDemi LM, Taylor BW, Reading BJ, Tordoff MG, Dunn RR.

Drugs that work on other liver cancers are not effective, and although progress has been made in identifying the specific genes involved in driving the growth of fibrolamellar tumors, these findings have yet to translate into any treatment. For now, surgery is the only option for those affected--mostly children and young adults with no prior liver conditions.Sanford M. Simon and his group understood that patients dying of fibrolamellar could not afford to wait. ""There are people who need therapy now,"" he says. So his group threw the kitchen sink at the problem and tested over 5,000 compounds, either already approved for other clinical uses or in clinical trials, to see whether any of the compounds could be repurposed to treat fibrolamellar. The team ultimately discovered a few classes of therapeutics that destroy fibrolamellar tumor cells growing in mice. Their findings are published in Cancer Discovery.""We decided to be completely agnostic about what we thought would work--we tried everything,"" says Simon, head of the Laboratory of Cellular Biophysics. ""To our surprise, we found a few compounds that work really well.""","Published: June 15, 2021"

A research team at KTH Royal Institute of Technology reports that the material, which may be used for example in catalysts for cars, fuel filters or packaging foam, actually improves its mechanical performance after days of exposure to high temperatures.Reporting in Advanced Sustainable Systems, researchers from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm say the research opens the door to using protein-based foam materials in potentially tough environments, such as filtration, thermal insulation and fluid absorption. The basic building blocks of the material are protein nanofibrils, or PNFs, which are self-assembled from hydrolyzed whey proteins a product from cheese-processing under specific temperature and pH conditions. In tests the foams improved with aging. After one month of exposure to a temperature of 150C, the material became stiffer, tougher and stronger, says the study s co-author, Mikael Hedenqvist, professor in the Division of Polymeric Materials at KTH.  This material only gets stronger with time,  he says.  If we compare with petroleum-based, commercial foam materials made of polyethylene and polystyrene, they melt instantly and decompose under the same harsh conditions.  Proteins are often water-soluble, which poses a challenge when developing protein-based materials. Despite this, the material proved water-resistant after the aging process, which polymerized the protein, creating new covalent bonds that stabilized the foams. The foam also resisted even more aggressive substances such as surfactants and reducing agents  that normally decompose or dissolve proteins. The crosslinking also made the foam unaffected by diesel fuel or hot oil. The material also showed better fire resistance than commonly used polyurethane thermoset.  This biodegradable, sustainable material can be a viable option for use in aggressive environments where fire resistance is important,  Hedenqvist says. Potential applications include providing support for catalytic metals that operate at higher temperatures, such as platinum catalysts for automobiles. The material could conceivably work as a fuel filter, too. Other possibilities are to use it as packaging foam and in applications for sound and thermal insulation where higher temperatures may occur and where there is a risk of an aggressive environment.ReferenceYe X, Capezza AJ, Gowda V, Olsson RT, Lendel C, Hedenqvist MS.

But they don't know how the cells do it.A Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) study in Cell Reports led by Stephen Duncan, D.Phil., examines how an endodermal cell - a type of developing cell - becomes a liver cell and not some other type of cell. Duncan and his team found that the development of naive cells into differentiated liver cells was dependent on the transcription factor GATA6. Duncan is the SmartState Endowed Chair in Regenerative Medicine and chair of the Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology at MUSC.""What we found is that this specific transcription factor, GATA6, has an unusual mechanism because it can recognize regulatory regions on DNA before a specific gene is turned on,"" explained Duncan. ""It doesn't directly turn on expression of a gene but marks a gene as being capable of being turned on if the cell encounters the right developmental cues.""Duncan's laboratory used human pluripotent stem cells, which can differentiate into any human cell type, to model different stages of development. To pick apart the molecular basis of cell differentiation, the human pluripotent stem cells were fed growth factors and exposed to cues specific to the development of liver cells. Duncan and his team used the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool like a set of molecular scissors, cutting GATA6 from the genome. They then examined the impact the loss of GATA6 had on the cell differentiation pathway.""We found that, in the absence of GATA6, regions surrounding genes remained closed and inaccessible,"" said Duncan. ""GATA6 can open up chromatin around regulatory regions of genes that are ultimately expressed as the cell begins to differentiate.""Duncan believes this finding could offer insight into how inherited liver diseases, such as metabolic liver disease, occur in children.""This gives us unique insight into how the human liver develops and what can go wrong, particularly in the case of inherited liver disease,"" he said.Reference: Heslop JA, Pournasr B, Liu J-T, Duncan SA.

However, there remain some specific types of skin injuries where the healing process is not well understood.A team of scientists from Japan and Italy, including Associate Professor Ken Natsuga from the Graduate School of Medicine at Hokkaido University, have used models of skin blisters to explore the effects of injury on developing skin tissue. Their discoveries were published in the journal EMBO Reports.The scientists performed their tests on mice which had artificially generated epidermal detachment, or skin blisters. They investigated the healing process by monitoring gene expressions and cell proliferation, tracing cell lineages, and employing mathematical models.The team found that a type of stem cells (SCs), hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), play an outsize role in blister healing. The HFSCs are mainly responsible for the healing of subepidermal blisters, from the base of the wound. The wound-healing activity of HFSCs is accompanied by delayed growth of hair follicles in the regenerated skin tissue. When HFSCs are reduced, another group of SCs, the interfollicular epidermal stem cells (IFESCs), can also contribute to healing, but only from the blister margins. They also confirmed that blister healing was affected by the shapes of keratinocytes, the primary skin cells, although the mechanism by which the shapes affect healing is still unclear.The findings have revealed the balance between wound healing and development in skin, indicating many possibilities for the treatment of skin blistering in humans. The models used in this study may themselves be used for the development of new therapies for blister healing. The role of sweat glands could not be investigated, as mice lack sweat glands, and the role of mesenchymal cells, which have previously been shown to be involved in healing of skin wounds, was not examined. Future work will focus on these aspects.""Our findings of the healing processes pave the way for tailored therapeutic interventions for epidermolysis bullosa, pemphigoid diseases and other blistering diseases,"" says Ken Natsuga.Reference: Fujimura Y, Watanabe M, Ohno K, et al.

Keck School of Medicine of USC researchers found that APOE4 is associated with the activation of an inflammatory protein that causes a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier which protects the brain.This research builds on a recent USC study that revealed APOE4 triggers leaks in the blood-brain barrier in humans, which lets toxic substances from the blood stream into the brain, damaging brain cells and disrupting cognitive functions. This process causes memory problems in patients whether or not their brain shows signs of amyloid- , the sticky plaque peptide considered a hallmark of the disease.The latest findings also suggest a new potential treatment to slow down or prevent the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease in patients with the APOE4 gene, independently of amyloid-  pathology.""We're further focusing on therapeutics targets in blood vessels that could bring innovative treatments to people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, both early and late stages of the disease.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests -- often considered the ""gold standard"" of testing -- also have enzymes and reagents that need to be frozen.Northwestern University researchers have discovered that commercially available PCR tests can withstand the freeze-drying process, making them shelf-stable for up to 30 days and 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), without sacrificing sensitivity and accuracy.The researchers found that the testing reagents could be pre-mixed with a standard preservative, freeze-dried and then distributed and stored at room temperatures. When the test is needed, health care workers then add water to rehydrate the test for immediate use.The new strategy could help ease logistical challenges, making tests more available to help schools, businesses and sporting events safely reopen. It also could be a particularly powerful option for low-resource settings that lack access to reliable electricity and refrigeration.""At different points in time, the COVID-19 pandemic nearly broke our health care system,"" said Northwestern's Michael Jewett, who led the study. ""With our strategy, we can eliminate the need for cold-chain shipping and reduce labor costs needed for on-site mixing of diagnostic reagents. It would be extremely gratifying if this could allow testing to be developed and deployed much more broadly around the globe.""The research, which includes instructions health care and lab workers can use to start freeze-drying PCR tests immediately, was published June 10 in the Biotechnology Journal.Jewett is a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and director of Northwestern's Center for Synthetic Biology. He also is a member of the Simpson Querrey Institute, Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.The same process used to make astronaut ice cream, freeze drying extends the shelf-life of perishable materials by freezing them and then dehydrating them by removing the ice. Earlier this year, Jewett led studies to develop shelf-stable vaccines with freeze-dried components. Now, his team uses a similar philosophy to help expand access to gold-standard testing.""The pandemic has highlighted the challenges and limitations of centralized laboratory testing,"" Jewett said. ""Testing relies on trained personnel with a significant amount of expertise, expensive equipment and complicated logistics that require a stable cold chain. There is a pressing need for testing strategies that are easy to use, reduce labor at the point-of-care and are inexpensive to deploy anywhere in the world.""In their new study, Jewett and his team bought five PCR kits directly from vendors. After fully assembling the reactions, they added simple preservatives to stabilize the mix and then stored the tests at varying lengths, conditions and temperatures.""We needed to make sure the tests still worked in the presence of the preservatives,"" Jewett said. ""PCR kits are based on proteins, which can fall apart when exposed to elevated temperatures or oxygen, so we have to keep them cold. If we add a preservative, it stabilizes the proteins to keep them from falling apart. But we also needed to make sure the preservative didn't interfere with the biological machinery in the test.""Of the mixes tested, the researchers showed that one commercial test maintained activity and sensitivity after storage for 30 days at both ambient and elevated temperatures. With this strategy, tests can be distributed and stored as a dry powder at room temperature and rehydrated on-demand.""We could stockpile these tests and distribute them without a cold chain,"" Jewett said. ""And that's the important thing. It's now an all-in-one kit -- no longer multiple parts that need to be mixed together in a cocktail. It's one test that's freeze-dried and activated with water.""Reference: Hammerling MJ, Warfel KF, Jewett MC.

Results are therefore regarded as preliminary and should be interpreted as such. Find out about the role of the peer review process in research here. For further information, please contact the cited source.Technology developed for COVID-19 detection and monitoring can distinguish between individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and uninfected individuals from body odour samples with up to 100% accuracy, according to new research.Led by researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the biotech company RoboScientific Ltd. with Durham University, the study tested devices with organic semi-conducting (OSC) sensors which could potentially be used as a COVID-19 screening tool.The pre-print, which is not yet peer-reviewed, shows that COVID-19 infection has a distinct smell, resulting from changes in the volatile organic compounds (VOC) which make up the body odour   generating an odour  fingerprint  that the sensors can detect.This study used body odour samples from socks worn and donated to the team by 54 individuals   27 COVID-19 positive individuals who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, and 27 uninfected individuals. These samples were analysed by RoboScientific s Model 307B VOC analyser fitted with an array of 12 OSC sensors.The samples were collected as part of a wider study led by LSHTM, in collaboration with Medical Detection Dogs and Durham University.The OSC sensors captured the odour profile of the samples, having been tuned to be sensitive to the VOCs associated with COVID-19 infection, primarily ketone and aldehyde compounds.Over two days of testing the samples, the researchers found the sensors were able to distinguish between infected and uninfected samples, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a distinct odour. On the first day of testing they achieved an average of 98% specificity (meaning a low risk of false positive results) and an average of 99% sensitivity (meaning a low risk of false negative results).On the second day of testing the sensors achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity, suggesting they can detect the presence of COVID-19 infection more accurately than any other diagnostic test available.Professor James Logan, Head of the Department of Disease Control at LSHTM, who led the study, said:  These results are really promising and demonstrate the potential for using this technology as a rapid, non-invasive test with incredible accuracy. However, further testing is required to confirm if these results can be replicated in real-world settings. If these devices are successfully developed for use in public places, they could be affordably and easily scaled up. They also could protect people against future disease outbreaks, with capability to develop sensor arrays to detect other diseases within a number of weeks. Professor Steve Lindsay, from the Department of Biosciences at Durham University, said:  Many diseases have a distinct smell associated with them. We started our research with a blank sheet of paper and asked the question: Does COVID-19 have a distinct smell? We ended the research showing a clear separation between the odours of people infected with the virus and those uninfected. COVID most definitely has a very distinct smell. This is real discovery science and very exciting for the development of screening methods for the disease. The Cambridgeshire-based start-up, RoboScientific, is exploring the potential of two types of device underpinned by these findings to enable fully-automated COVID-19 screening   a portable handheld device and a room-based device.The handheld device, developed from RoboScientific s existing technology for early disease detection, could detect if a person is COVID-19 positive from their body odour. If deployed in public spaces, these devices could be used in place of PCR and LFT testing as a faster, less invasive diagnostic to inform an individual whether they are infected and required to self-isolate. They can be used with a separate air sampler or individual breath or mask samples.The room-based device   the first of its kind   could screen areas (such as classrooms or aircraft cabins) to detect if an infected individual is in the room, with air analysis results within an estimated 30 minutes. If COVID-19 positive odour is detected, all those in the room would need to be individually tested to determine who was infected as the device would only detect the presence of infection, not who is infected. It would therefore not be designed to replace PCR or LFT testing, but rather for use alongside these strategies to allow more targeted testing, saving money and time, and reducing onward transmission.These devices were developed by adapting technology previously used in chicken houses to detect disease in flocks of up to 50,000 chickens, using well proven sampling methods and analysis.Stan Curtis, CEO of RoboScientific Ltd., said:  Our experience in consumer electronics, coupled with five years developing our unique sensors for agricultural applications, has enabled us to create a new way of sensing VOCs.  Our disease detection platform can provide fast accurate screening for diseases so that we will be ready if/when the next pandemic arrives. Reference: Guest C, Dewhirst SY, Allen DJ, et al.

The relevant research results have been published in Analytical Chemistry.Adsorption technology is one of the main technologies for treating Volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Over the past years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted high interest for their outstanding adsorption property. Closely related to MOFs, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcite-like systems or anionic clays, have received special attention for their improved adsorption properties due to the enhanced porosity and chemical affinity at multiple active sites. In this study, silver nanocubes (AgNCs) and Co-Ni LDH composite nanomaterials were prepared in template sacrifice method, and modified with 4-aminophenol (4-ATP) for both trapping and probe functions. Based on the as-prepared composite material, researchers constructed a high-efficiency gas sensor for selective detection of aldehyde gas. ""This SERS sensor has ultrahigh sensitivity for aldehyde gas,  said XU Di, the first author of this paper,  We verified its accuracy, repeatability and selectivity in the experiment."" Combined with principal component analysis method, they successfully identified and analyzed the similar SERS spectrum of aldehyde gases with the sensor, indicating application value. They further investigated the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic process of benzaldehyde molecules on Co-Ni LDH with the sensor. The kinetic adsorption process could be fitted better by the pseudo-first-order kinetics with a higher correlation coefficient than by a pseudo-second-order model. The isotherm adsorption fits the Langmuir isotherm model, and its adsorption constant is 6.25   106 L/mol, indicating that the adsorption sites of the composites were homogeneous and dominated by monolayer chemisorption. This study established a new measurement method for probing the adsorption process with extremely low consumption of both adsorbates and adsorbents, but also may lay the groundwork for the construction of rapid and ultra-sensitive SERS sensors for probing VOCs in the future.ReferenceXu D et al.

Testing for urea levels in dairy cows helps scientists and farmers understand how effectively nitrogen from feed is used in cows  bodies, with important economic implications for farmers in terms of feed costs, physiological effects for cows such as reproductive performance, and environmental impacts from excretion of nitrogen in dairy cow waste. Thus, accuracy in testing dairy cow urea levels is essential.Since the 1990s, mid-infrared testing of milk urea nitrogen (MUN) has been the most efficient and least invasive way to measure nitrogen use by dairy cows in large numbers. In a recent article in the Journal of Dairy Science, researchers from Cornell University report the development of a robust new set of MUN calibration reference samples to improve accuracy of MUN measurement.  When a set of these samples has been run on a milk analyzer, the data can be used to detect specific deficiencies in the quality of the MUN prediction that might be corrected by the instrument user or the milk analyzer manufacturer,  explained senior author David M. Barbano, PhD, Northeast Dairy Foods Research Center, Department of Food Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. Accurate and timely MUN concentration information  is of great importance for dairy herd feeding and reproduction management,  Barbano added. Given increasing worldwide scrutiny of the environmental effects of large-scale agriculture and the economic challenges faced by farmers, the need for accurate understanding of nitrogen use in the dairy industry has perhaps never been more pressing. This improvement in milk component testing marks further progress toward healthier and more sustainable agricultural and food production practices that will benefit producers and consumers alike.ReferencePortnoy M et al.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified specific areas and cells in the brain that become active when an individual is faced with the choice to learn or hide from information about an unwanted aversive event the individual likely has no power to prevent.The findings, published June 11 in Neuron, could shed light on the processes underlying psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety -- not to mention how all of us cope with the deluge of information that is a feature of modern life.""People's brains aren't well equipped to deal with the information age,"" said senior author Ilya Monosov, PhD, an associate professor of neuroscience, of neurosurgery and of biomedical engineering. ""People are constantly checking, checking, checking for news, and some of that checking is totally unhelpful. Our modern lifestyles could be resculpting the circuits in our brain that have evolved over millions of years to help us survive in an uncertain and ever-changing world.""In 2019, studying monkeys, Monosov laboratory members J. Kael White, PhD, then a graduate student, and senior scientist Ethan S. Bromberg-Martin, PhD, identified two brain areas involved in tracking uncertainty about positively anticipated events, such as rewards. Activity in those areas drove the monkeys' motivation to find information about good things that may happen.But it wasn't clear whether the same circuits were involved in seeking information about negatively anticipated events, like punishments. After all, most people want to know whether, for example, a bet on a horse race is likely to pay off big. Not so for bad news.""In the clinic, when you give some patients the opportunity to get a genetic test to find out if they have, for example, Huntington's disease, some people will go ahead and get the test as soon as they can, while other people will refuse to be tested until symptoms occur,"" Monosov said. ""Clinicians see information-seeking behavior in some people and dread behavior in others.""To find the neural circuits involved in deciding whether to seek information about unwelcome possibilities, first author Ahmad Jezzini, PhD, and Monosov taught two monkeys to recognize when something unpleasant might be headed their way. They trained the monkeys to recognize symbols that indicated they might be about to get an irritating puff of air to the face. For example, the monkeys first were shown one symbol that told them a puff might be coming but with varying degrees of certainty. A few seconds after the first symbol was shown, a second symbol was shown that resolved the animals' uncertainty. It told the monkeys that the puff was definitely coming, or it wasn't.The researchers measured whether the animals wanted to know what was going to happen by whether they watched for the second signal or averted their eyes or, in separate experiments, letting the monkeys choose among different symbols and their outcomes.Much like people, the two monkeys had different attitudes toward bad news: One wanted to know; the other preferred not to. The difference in their attitudes toward bad news was striking because they were of like mind when it came to good news. When they were given the option of finding out whether they were about to receive something they liked -- a drop of juice -- they both consistently chose to find out.""We found that attitudes toward seeking information about negative events can go both ways, even between animals that have the same attitude about positive rewarding events,"" said Jezzini, who is an instructor in neuroscience. ""To us, that was a sign that the two attitudes may be guided by different neural processes.""By precisely measuring neural activity in the brain while the monkeys were faced with these choices, the researchers identified one brain area, the anterior cingulate cortex, that encodes information about attitudes toward good and bad possibilities separately. They found a second brain area, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, that contains individual cells whose activity reflects the monkeys' overall attitudes: yes for info on either good or bad possibilities vs. yes for intel on good possibilities only.Understanding the neural circuits underlying uncertainty is a step toward better therapies for people with conditions such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which involve an inability to tolerate uncertainty.""We started this study because we wanted to know how the brain encodes our desire to know what our future has in store for us,"" Monosov said.

These findings, published in Science Advances, suggest that addressing the common problem of vitamin D deficiency with inexpensive supplements could play a part in combating the ongoing scourge of opioid addiction.Earlier work by David E. Fisher, MD, PhD, director of the Mass General Cancer Center's Melanoma Program and director of MGH's Cutaneous Biology Research Center (CBRC), laid the foundation for the current study. In 2007, Fisher and his team found something unexpected: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays (specifically the form called UVB), causes the skin to produce the hormone endorphin, which is chemically related to morphine, heroin and other opioids--in fact, all activate the same receptors in the brain. A subsequent study by Fisher found that UV exposure raises endorphin levels in mice, which then display behavior consistent with opioid addiction.Endorphin is sometimes called a ""feel good"" hormone because it induces a sense of mild euphoria. Studies have suggested that some people develop urges to sunbathe and visit tanning salons that mirror the behaviors of opioid addicts. Fisher and his colleagues speculated that people may seek out UVB because they unknowingly crave the endorphin rush. But that suggests a major contradiction. ""Why would we evolve to be behaviorally drawn towards the most common carcinogen that exists?"" asked Fisher. After all, sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer, to say nothing of wrinkles and other skin damage.Fisher believes that the only explanation for why humans and other animals seek out the sun is that exposure to UV radiation is necessary for production of vitamin D, which our bodies can't formulate on their own. Vitamin D promotes uptake of calcium, which is essential for building bone. As tribes of humans migrated north during prehistoric times, an evolutionary alteration might have been needed to compel them to step out of caves and into the sunshine on bitterly cold days. Otherwise, small children would have died of prolonged vitamin D deficiency (the cause of rickets) and weak bones might have shattered when people ran from predators, leaving them vulnerable.This theory led Fisher and colleagues to hypothesize that sun seeking is driven by vitamin D deficiency, with the goal of increasing synthesis of the hormone for survival, and that vitamin D deficiency might also make the body more sensitive to the effects of opioids, potentially contributing to addiction. ""Our goal in this study was to understand the relationship between vitamin D signaling in the body and UV-seeking and opioid-seeking behaviors,"" says lead author Lajos V. Kem ny, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow in Dermatology at MGH.In the Science Advances paper, Fisher, Kem ny and a multidisciplinary team from several institutions addressed the question from dual perspectives. In one arm of the study, they compared normal laboratory mice with mice that were deficient in vitamin D (either through special breeding or by removing vitamin D from their diets). ""We found that modulating vitamin D levels changes multiple addictive behaviors to both UV and opioids,"" says Kem ny. Importantly, when the mice were conditioned with modest doses of morphine, those deficient in vitamin D continued seeking out the drug, behavior that was less common among the normal mice. When morphine was withdrawn, the mice with low vitamin D levels were far more likely to develop withdrawal symptoms.The study also found that morphine worked more effectively as a pain reliever in mice with vitamin D deficiency--that is, the opioid had an exaggerated response in these mice, which may be concerning if it's true in humans, too, says Fisher. After all, consider a surgery patient who receives morphine for pain control after the operation. If that patient is deficient in vitamin D, the euphoric effects of morphine could be exaggerated, says Fisher, ""and that person is more likely to become addicted.""The lab data suggesting that vitamin D deficiency increases addictive behavior was supported by several accompanying analyses of human health records. One showed that patients with modestly low vitamin D levels were 50 percent more likely than others with normal levels to use opioids, while patients who had severe vitamin D deficiency were 90 percent more likely. Another analysis found that patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) were more likely than others to be deficient in vitamin D.Back in the lab, one of the study's other critical findings could have significant implications, says Fisher. ""When we corrected vitamin D levels in the deficient mice, their opioid responses reversed and returned to normal,"" he says. In humans, vitamin D deficiency is widespread, but is safely and easily treated with low-cost dietary supplements, notes Fisher. While more research is needed, he believes that treating vitamin D deficiency may offer a new way to help reduce the risk for OUD and bolster existing treatments for the disorder. ""Our results suggests that we may have an opportunity in the public health arena to influence the opioid epidemic,"" says Fisher.Reference: Kem ny LV, Robinson KC, Hermann AL, et al.

When one s earliest memory occurs, it is a moving target rather than being a single static memory,  explains childhood amnesia expert and lead author Dr Carole Peterson, from Memorial University of Newfoundland. Thus, what many people provide when asked for their earliest memory is not a boundary or watershed beginning, before which there are no memories. Rather, there seems to be a pool of potential memories from which both adults and children sample. And, we believe people remember a lot from age two that they don t realize they do. That s for two reasons. First, it s very easy to get people to remember earlier memories simply by asking them what their earliest memory is, and then asking them for a few more. Then they start recalling even earlier memories   sometimes up to a full year earlier. It s like priming a pump; once you get them started its self-prompting. Secondly, we ve documented those early memories are systematically misdated. Over and over again we find people think they were older than they actually were in their early memories. For more than 20 years Dr Peterson has conducted studies on memory, with a particular focus on the ability of children and adults to recall their earliest years.This latest research reviewed 10 of her research articles on childhood amnesia followed by analyses of both published and unpublished data collected in Dr Peterson s laboratory since 1999. It featured a total of 992 participants, and memories of 697 participants were then compared to the recollections of their parents.Overall, it shows that children s earliest memories come before when they think it happened, as confirmed by their parents.In some of the research reviewed by Peterson, the evidence to move our potential memory clock is  compelling . For example, when reviewing a study which interviewed children after two and eight years had passed since their earliest memory they were able to recall the same memory, however in the subsequent interviews gave a later age as to when they occurred. Eight years later many believed they were a full year older. So, the children, as they age, keep moving how old they thought they were at the time of those early memories,  says Dr Peterson, from the Department of Psychology at Memorial University.And she believes that the finding is due to something in memory dating called  telescoping . When you look at things that happened long ago, it s like looking through a lens. The more remote a memory is, the telescoping effect makes you see it as closer. It turns out they move their earliest memory forward a year to about three and a half years of age. But we found that when the child or adult is remembering events from age four and up, this doesn t happen. She says, after combing through all of the data, it clearly demonstrates people remember a lot more of their early childhood and a lot farther back than they think they do, and it s relatively easy to help them access those memories. When you look at one study, sometimes things don t become clear, but when you start putting together study after study and they all come up with the same conclusions, it becomes pretty convincing. It s this lack of clarity which Dr Peterson states is a limitation of the research and, indeed, all research done to-date in the subject area. What is needed now in childhood amnesia research are independently confirmed or documented external dates against which personally derived dates can be compared, as this would prevent telescoping errors and potential dating errors by parents,  Dr Peterson says.Such research   using verified dating   is currently ongoing both in her laboratory and elsewhere to further confirm the answer to this long-debated question.Reference: Peterson C.

With this method, researchers found that reactive sulfur species produced by bacteria degrade and inactivate  -lactam antibiotics.Bacteria are different from animal cells in that their outer layer is covered with a rigid structure called a cell wall.  -lactam antimicrobial agents interfere with the processes that form the cell wall. This results in bacteria no longer being able to withstand their own internal pressure so they rupture and die.  -lactam antimicrobial agents are very potent because they selectively inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis and have few side effects on hosts such as humans. These antimicrobial agents have a common structure called the  -lactam ring that is essential for inhibiting cell wall development. If this ring is degraded, the antimicrobial effect disappears.Previous studies have reported that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which bacteria produce during sulfur metabolism, reduces their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents leading to resistance. However, the detailed mechanism causing this are not yet understood. Researchers at Kumamoto University previously showed that the molecule cysteine persulfide, a combination of H2S and the amino acid cysteine, has an extremely potent antioxidant effect that is not found in H2S or cysteine alone.In this study, researchers examined how this reactive sulfur species is involved in the acquisition of resistance to  -lactam antibiotics. They discovered that  -lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, ampicillin, and meropenem (carbapenem antibiotics) rapidly lose bactericidal activity when exposed to cysteine persulfide but not with hydrogen sulfide. A detailed study of the reaction between  -lactam antimicrobial agents and cysteine persulfide revealed that the  -lactam ring, which is essential for bactericidal action, decomposes and a sulfur atom is inserted into part of the ring creating carbothioic acid. The production of carbothioic acid from a  -lactam antimicrobial agent appears to be a novel degradation metabolite.Researchers thus developed a highly sensitive analytical method to detect and quantify carbothioic acid using mass spectrometry, and then analyzed carbothioic acid production from bacteria that were exposed to  -lactam antimicrobials. They found that bacteria can absorb antimicrobial agents and use cysteine persulfide to degrade the agents into carbothioic acid which is then discharged. This is believed to be a previously undescribed inactivation and degradation mechanism of  -lactam antimicrobial agents into carbothioic acid by cysteine persulfide.""Our newly developed analytical method makes it possible to quantify the amount of carbothioic acid discharged from bacteria with high sensitivity,"" said Professor Tomohiro Sawa, who led the study. ""We believe it will be possible to screen for compounds that inhibit bacterial synthesis of cysteine persulfide by using carbothioic acid as a biomarker. Such a cysteine persulfide synthesis inhibitor in combination with  -lactam antibiotics is expected to inhibit antibiotic degradation and result in successful treatments with a lower concentration of  -lactam antibiotics. This should also help to reduce the emergence of new resistant bacteria.""Reference: Ono K, Kitamura Y, Zhang T, et al.

We can access these foods  health benefits because the microbes in our guts happily feast on them, breaking them down into smaller chemical components.Microbiome scientists at Colorado State University wanted to know if microbes can also break down those same polyphenols in systems outside the human body, including the microbial wild west of soils.A research team led by Kelly Wrighton, associate professor in the College of Agricultural Sciences  Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, has uncovered new insights into the role of polyphenols in the soil microbiome, known as a black box for its complexity. They proffer an updated theory that soils   much like the human gut   can be food sources for the microbes that live there. Their results could upend a long-held theory that, under certain conditions, soil microbes can t access polyphenols and could thus be used as carbon traps to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our study opens the door for further study of polyphenol metabolism in the field, and how it fits into natural carbon cycles,  said soil and crop sciences Ph.D. candidate Bridget McGivern, first author on the paper describing the work. Published in Nature Communications, the research involved precisely monitored soil samples subjected to a palette of very high-resolution analytical chemistry in the lab. The researchers set out to prove the concept that microbes in soil, under oxygen-free conditions, do in fact break down polyphenols, likely releasing carbon dioxide.These experiments fly in the face of the longstanding  enzyme latch  theory that soil microbes do not metabolize polyphenols when oxygen isn t freely available in places like flooded wetlands and peatlands. If it were true that polyphenols remained undigested in oxygen-free soils, it would mean loading up soils with these fibrous compounds could be an easy carbon-trapping sink. We know that polyphenols are really sticky, and so people thought that, by being in the soil, not only they themselves wouldn t be broken down, but they d stick to other carbons and enzymes in the soil and prevent further breakdown of everything else,  McGivern said.  So, if you had an already broken-down system like a degraded wetland, you could go in and add wood chips to the system, flood it again, and lock up all the carbon. ","Published: June 14, 2021"

That same class of machines, called polymerases, also build RNA messages, which are like notes copied from the central DNA repository of recipes, so they can be read more efficiently into proteins. But polymerases were thought to only work in one direction DNA into DNA or RNA. This prevents RNA messages from being rewritten back into the master recipe book of genomic DNA. Now, Thomas Jefferson University researchers provide the first evidence that RNA segments can be written back into DNA, which potentially challenges the central dogma in biology and could have wide implications affecting many fields of biology.""This work opens the door to many other studies that will help us understand the significance of having a mechanism for converting RNA messages into DNA in our own cells,"" says Richard Pomerantz, PhD, associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Thomas Jefferson University. ""The reality that a human polymerase can do this with high efficiency, raises many questions."" For example, this finding suggests that RNA messages can be used as templates for repairing or re-writing genomic DNA.The work was published June 11th in the journal Science Advances.Together with first author Gurushankar Chandramouly and other collaborators, Dr. Pomerantz's team started by investigating one very unusual polymerase, called polymerase theta. Of the 14 DNA polymerases in mammalian cells, only three do the bulk of the work of duplicating the entire genome to prepare for cell division. The remaining 11 are mostly involved in detecting and making repairs when there's a break or error in the DNA strands. Polymerase theta repairs DNA, but is very error-prone and makes many errors or mutations. The researchers therefore noticed that some of polymerase theta's ""bad"" qualities were ones it shared with another cellular machine, albeit one more common in viruses -- the reverse transcriptase. Like Pol theta, HIV reverse transcriptase acts as a DNA polymerase, but can also bind RNA and read RNA back into a DNA strand.In a series of elegant experiments, the researchers tested polymerase theta against the reverse transcriptase from HIV, which is one of the best studied of its kind. They showed that polymerase theta was capable of converting RNA messages into DNA, which it did as well as HIV reverse transcriptase, and that it actually did a better job than when duplicating DNA to DNA. Polymerase theta was more efficient and introduced fewer errors when using an RNA template to write new DNA messages, than when duplicating DNA into DNA, suggesting that this function could be its primary purpose in the cell.The group collaborated with Dr. Xiaojiang S. Chen's lab at USC and used x-ray crystallography to define the structure and found that this molecule was able to change shape in order to accommodate the more bulky RNA molecule - a feat unique among polymerases.""Our research suggests that polymerase theta's main function is to act as a reverse transcriptase,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. ""In healthy cells, the purpose of this molecule may be toward RNA-mediated DNA repair. In unhealthy cells, such as cancer cells, polymerase theta is highly expressed and promotes cancer cell growth and drug resistance. It will be exciting to further understand how polymerase theta's activity on RNA contributes to DNA repair and cancer-cell proliferation.""Reference: Chandramouly G, Zhao J, McDevitt S, et al.

It has also been applied to the research and development of new materials.A joint research team from POSTECH and Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS) has applied deep learning to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) system to develop a technique that can detect and improve the quality of SEM images without human intervention. The SEM is an essential material analysis equipment used for developing new materials. The findings from this research were recently published in Acta Materialia, the most authoritative journal in the field of metal materials. The SEM is one of the most advanced material analysis equipment crucial to investigating the correlation between the microstructural and physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of materials by providing their microstructural image data. However, in order to obtain high-quality, clear SEM images, the operator must be highly-skilled to maneuver the system with high precision   otherwise, it can lead to low-quality microscopic images. The quality of these images needs to be improved because they directly affect the subsequent material analysis processes. To this, the joint research team developed a deep learning-based refocusing method that automatically detects and improves the quality of the microscopic images. This technology is based on multi-scale deep neural network and it demonstrated that the image quality could be improved on blind settings without any prior knowledge or assumptions of the degree of blurring on the level of image degradation. In addition, the researchers also proposed a technique to train the network to learn not only how but also where to refocus in non-uniformly defocused images, moving a step closer to commercializing AI-based material analysis equipment.  We expect the cost and time for developing new materials to be reduced by automating the imaging process of the scanning electron microscopy, which is widely used for research and development of new materials,  remarked Professor Seungchul Lee who led the study.ReferenceNa J, Kim G, Kang S-H, Kim S-J, Lee S.

Designed specifically for ovarian cancers that are resistant to traditional therapies, the new radiopharmaceutical can be produced in 25 minutes at low cost, which leads to better efficiency compared with alternative methods. This research was presented at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging 2021 Annual Meeting.According to the American Cancer Society, more than 20,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year and nearly 14,000 will die from the disease. Ovarian cancer patients have a five-year survival rate of 49.1 percent. It is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women.In the study, researchers utilized a new generator system to develop the targeted alpha-therapy Pb-214-TCMC-trastuzumab to treat HER2-postive ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer cells and mice bearing ovarian cancer tumors were split into three groups: those treated with Pb-214-TCMC-trastuzumab, those treated with Pb-214-TCMC-IgG and an untreated control group. All groups were imaged over time to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.Compared to the Pb-214-TCMC-IgG and control groups, the tumor signal for mice and cells treated with Pb-214-TCMC-trastuzumab decreased dramatically over the course of the study, signaling the efficacy of the therapy. There were no adverse side effects from the treatment as determined by weight loss of all animals surviving.""The short 27-minute half-life of Pb-214 is ideal for fractioned alpha particle therapeutic applications,"" stated Mike Zamiara, study author and president of Niowave Inc. in East Lansing, Michigan.

But other dimensions of behavior extend over weeks, months, and years.Examples include a child learning how to read; an athlete recovering from a concussion; or a person turning 50 and wondering where all the time has gone. These are not changes that people perceive on a day-to-day basis.

""For example, we're interested in how neurons compute and allow us to quickly react it's a fast response requiring visual attention and motor control. Understanding the brain needs big data to capture all dimensions of human behavior.""As an expert in vision science, neuroinformatics, brain imaging, computational neuroscience, and data science, Pestilli's research has advanced the understanding of human cognition and brain networks over the last 15 years.He likes to compare the brain to the Internet, a powerful set of computers connected by cables simultaneously keeping many windows open and programs running. If the computer is healthy but the cables are not, long range communication between different parts of the brain begins to fail. This in turn creates problems for our long-term behavior.Pestilli and team are also interested in how biological computations change over longer time periods. Case in point -- How does our brain change as we lose our vision?""We've shown that if you change the input into the eye, it can change the brain's white matter, which is equivalent to the brain's cabling system just like computers are connected with cables, our brain has millions of cables connecting millions of tiny computers called neurons.""This visual system research was published in Nature Scientific Reports in March 2021.","Published: June 11, 2021"

The study also provides new insights into why some areas of the brain are more vulnerable to damage than other areas.""While the interconnected structure of the brain is essential to its function, these misfolded proteins commandeer that structure to travel through the brain and cause progressive degeneration,"" said Michael X. Henderson, Ph.D., an assistant professor at Van Andel Institute and corresponding author of the study. ""By understanding how these proteins travel through the brain and what causes certain neurons to be at risk for damage, we can develop new therapies that can be directed to the right place at the right time to have maximal impact on disease progression.""Using models of Alzheimer's disease, the team mapped misfolded tau proteins as they progressed through the brain. They found that tau pathology moved from region to region along the brain's neural networks, which are similar to biological highways, but that it did not travel to every connected region.To find out why some areas of the brain seemed to resist the proteins' spread, the team turned to gene expression patterns.They identified some genes that were expressed more in regions that had more tau pathology than expected from protein spread alone. By understanding the genetic factors that control protein accumulation in the brain, the team hopes to identify ways to interfere with misfolded protein movement and slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's and similar neurodegenerative diseases.""We used these network models to test our hypothesis that tau spreads both forward and backward along connections between brain regions,"" said Eli Cornblath, Ph.D., an M.D./Ph.D. student at University of Pennsylvania and the study's first author.

The transformation could boost the circular economy, which aims to eliminate waste, keep products and materials in use and have positive impacts for synthetic biology, experts say. Approximately 50 million tonnes of PET waste is produced annually, causing serious economic and environmental impacts. PET recycling is possible, but existing processes create products that continue to contribute to plastic pollution worldwide.The team also demonstrated how the technique works by converting a used plastic bottle into vanillin by adding the E. coli to the degraded plastic waste. Researchers say that the vanillin produced would be fit for human consumption but further experimental tests are required. Vanillin is widely used in the food and cosmetics industries, as well as the formulation of herbicides, antifoaming agents and cleaning products. Global demand for vanillin was in excess of 37,000 tonnes in 2018. Joanna Sadler, first author and BBSRC Discovery Fellow from the School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, said: ""This is the first example of using a biological system to upcycle plastic waste into a valuable industrial chemical and this has very exciting implications for the circular economy. ""The results from our research have major implications for the field of plastic sustainability and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology to address real-world challenges."" Dr Stephen Wallace, Principle Investigator of the study and a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Our work challenges the perception of plastic being a problematic waste and instead demonstrates its use as a new carbon resource from which high value products can be obtained.""

Mice and rats, which make up the vast majority of animal models, are nocturnal. Yet a survey of animal studies across eight behavioral neuroscience domains showed that most behavioral testing is conducted during the day, when the rodents would normally be at rest.""There are these dramatic daily fluctuations--in metabolism, in immune function, in learning and memory, in perception--and by the large, they get ignored,"" said Randy Nelson, who led the study. ""You just have to wonder: to what extent is that affecting the outcomes?""Nelson chairs the School of Medicine's Department of Neuroscience and directs basic science research for the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute.His findings appear in Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews.Nelson and his colleagues--RNI researchers Jacob Bumgarner, William Walker and Courtney DeVries--examined the 25 most frequently cited papers in each of eight categories of rodent behaviors: learning and memory, sensation and perception, attention, food intake, mating, maternal behavior, aggression and drug seeking.For each study, they determined whether the behavioral testing was done during the day, at night, or both. They also identified which studies reported time-of-day information ambiguously or not at all.Overall, only 20% of the studies reported nighttime testing. Seventeen percent reported daytime testing, and 7.5 percent reported both. The remainder of the studies either didn't mention when testing occurred (42%) or were ambiguous on that point (13.5%).Even among the studies conducted at night, most didn't describe in detail how the authors protected the rodents' circadian rhythms. For example, at what times did the researchers observe the animals? Did they house the animals in the dark during the day? If so, how did they keep extraneous light from invading the room every time someone opened the door or turned on a hallway light? In most cases, it's impossible to tell from the methods section.Yet recording this kind of information is crucial to a study's reproducibility. Without knowing how an experiment was run the first time, other scientists can't run it again to see if they get different results. And running experiments multiple times--under different conditions--is the basis of all scientific inquiry.""We want to make sure everyone's conducting and reporting the best science they can do,"" Nelson said. ""This is important because, in common with the NIH, we want to improve the rigor and reproducibility of science.""Failing to account for time of day doesn't just jeopardize an animal study's reproducibility. It can also make its results less applicable to humans.Being diurnal, humans tend to be active when the sun is up and rest when it's down. That's the opposite of the nocturnal rodents that scientists common use in biomedical studies. If the scientists disregard this discrepancy, it can reduce the value of their data when they try to extrapolate their results to humans.""If you're testing a mouse during the middle of its active period, which is during the dark, you can translate those data to a diurnal creature who's active during that time,"" Nelson said. ""I think that's fine.""But in the light, a mouse's daytime behavior is less comparable to a person's.""It's like waking you up at 3 in the morning and saying, 'OK, let's walk a tightrope,' and then you're no good at it,"" he said. ""Well, what a surprise.""So, how can a diurnal, human researcher design and carry out a study of nocturnal rodents when their circadian rhythms naturally conflict?One step she can take is to reverse the rodents' light/dark cycle by housing the animals in total darkness during the day and turning on the lights at night. This way, she and her colleagues get to observe the animals during their active phase--under simulated ""nighttime"" conditions--without driving to the lab at midnight.When researchers check on the animals in the daytime, they can do so under dim red lighting instead of regular, white lighting. To complete the effect, windows can even be tinted with a red film. Rodents can't see red light, so it won't disrupt their circadian rhythms.Some labs come equipped with red overhead lighting, but even if researchers can't access such a space, there are ways around the problem.""You can use a miner's light with a little, red light in it,"" Nelson said. ""That works really well.""Night-vision goggles are another option.In any event, recording these measures--in detail--is key.""The goal of this paper is to make sure that we raise consciousness about it in the same way that people raised consciousness about sex as a biological variable that's important,"" Nelson said. ""Everybody knows it, but--as a group of biomedical researchers--we ignore it. And if you ignore it, then can you really translate those data on a nocturnal animal to a diurnal animal when you're testing at the wrong time of day?""Reference: Nelson RJ, Bumgarner JR, Walker WH, DeVries AC.

It is widely posited that a low protein diet is associated with obesity and this new finding has implications for the development of targeted treatments for obesity.  The team found that when rats were given a low protein diet, a specific area of the brain known to play a central role in food-seeking behaviours called the ventral tegmental area (VTA), became more active when they were consuming protein-rich food. The study, funded mainly by the BBSRC and the Leverhulme Trust and the Troms  Research Foundation among other funding partners, is published this week in The Journal of Neuroscience. The authors report that when protein had been restricted previously, the VTA responded more to protein than to other nutrients, which suggests that the animals brains had adapted to ensure protein levels are maintained. Such an adaptation is meaningful as insufficient protein can have severe consequences for health and in extreme cases can lead to death. In addition, low levels of dietary protein has been proposed as a driver of obesity. Until now, it was not clear how the brain influenced protein intake. Dr Fabien Naneix, Lecturer at the Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen, who co-led the study explains:  We found that protein restriction increased preference for protein enriched food over carbohydrate. This protein preference is associated with a greater VTA response and when animals are switched from a normal balanced diet to protein restriction, protein preference is rapidly induced but changes in VTA activity requires extensive learning processes. On the other hand, prior protein restriction induced slower changes in protein preference and maintained higher VTA responses for protein, suggesting long-lasting changes induced by protein appetite.  Our findings are hugely significant as protein intake is essential for life. We need protein and amino acids for numerous biological processes and the only way is through food intake. So, it is important to understand how the brain drives our behaviours according to our current needs.   Our study is the first linking changes in protein preference and specific brain activity. The VTA is known to play a central role in motivation processes for other nutrients and we show here it is also the case for protein.

However, they can play a powerful role in the life cycles of bacteria. Biochemist Thomas B ttcher from the University of Vienna and PhD student Magdalena Jancheva were able to show for the first time how Pseudomonas bacteria use a self-produced signal molecule to selectively manipulate phages in a competing bacterial strain to defeat their enemy. This targeted control of phages provides entirely new biotechnological and therapeutic approaches, e.g. for phage therapies. The results produced in the context of an ERC grant have been published in the ""Journal of the American Chemical Society"".The human body and its microbiota harbour a large amount of phages. These infect bacteria as virus particles to ensure their own survival. One of their strategies is to integrate into the bacterial genome and multiply via bacterial cell division. However, external signal molecules can trigger the phages' sudden awakening from their dormant stage. Once activated, they destroy their host, the bacterium, and thus release their newly produced viral particles. With a prestigious ERC Consolidator Grant of the European Research Council, Thomas B ttcher investigates the switch from the sleeping (lysogenic) to the activated (lytic) lifestyle of phages.""We already know that phages decisively influence the population dynamics of bacteria and that microorganisms compete by using chemical weapons,"" says Thomas B ttcher, Professor of Microbial Biochemistry of the Faculty of Chemistry and the Centre of Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science. ""We now wanted to investigate whether, in the complex microbial ecosystems, there are also microbes that specifically activate phages in order to use them against their competitors."" Indeed, the researchers could show that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces large amounts of a signal molecule that triggers the conversion of a phage, residing in a strain of the species Staphylococcus aureus, from a quiet companion into a deadly parasite.""We were completely surprised to find that the chemical compound pyocyanin, which we were able to isolate and synthesise, only specifically activated one of several phages of Staphylococcus aureus. Pyocyanin is therefore a highly selective agent,"" says co-author Magdalena Jancheva. The drug mitomycin C induces DNA damage in bacterial cells and causes phages to leave their dying host, but according to Thomas B ttcher, ""it activates all phages in the bacteria in a non-selective manner"". The researchers also observed that pyocyanin releases even more phages in Staphylococcus aureus than mitomycin C, pyocyanin therefore had an ""remarkably strong effect"".The bacterial species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus occupy the same ecological niche in the human body. As pathogens, they frequently occur in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis, a congenital metabolic disease. Staphylococcus bacteria dominate at a young age, while Pseudomonas bacteria become more prevalent with increasing age. The current study demonstrates the efficiency of activation of latent phages by chemical signaling agents in the battle for space and resources between bacterial strains. It provides the first evidence that chemical signaling agents can exhibit selectivity for specific phages in a polylysogenic bacterial strain. Here, the activated phage (phiMBL3) revealed a previously unknown molecular switch through which the signaling agent acts. ""Certain signaling molecules could make it possible to combat pathogens via phage activation   they could thus be used to initiate internal phage therapy,"" Thomas B ttcher states. At the same time, the phages' molecular switches, which selectively trigger the production of viral particles through a signaling molecule such as pyocyanin, could also serve as a new tool for biotechnology or synthetic biology. ""Our findings open up a wide field in which we want to move forward"", the researchers conclude.ReferenceJancheva M, B ttcher T.

The new material is as strong as many common plastics in use today and could replace plastic in many common household products. The material was created using a new approach for assembling plant proteins into materials that mimic silk on a molecular level. The energy-efficient method, which uses sustainable ingredients, results in a plastic-like free-standing film, which can be made at industrial scale. Non-fading  structural  colour can be added to the polymer, and it can also be used to make water-resistant coatings. The material is home compostable, whereas other types of bioplastics require industrial composting facilities to degrade. In addition, the Cambridge-developed material requires no chemical modifications to its natural building blocks, so that it can safely degrade in most natural environments. The new product will be commercialised by Xampla, a University of Cambridge spin-out company developing replacements for single-use plastic and microplastics. The company will introduce a range of single-use sachets and capsules later this year, which can replace the plastic used in everyday products like dishwasher tablets and laundry detergent capsules. The results are reported in the journal Nature Communications. For many years, Professor Tuomas Knowles in Cambridge s Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry has been researching the behaviour of proteins. Much of his research has been focused on what happens when proteins misfold or  misbehave , and how this relates to health and human disease, primarily Alzheimer s disease.  We normally investigate how functional protein interactions allow us to stay healthy and how irregular interactions are implicated in Alzheimer s disease,  said Knowles, who led the current research.  It was a surprise to find our research could also address a big problem in sustainability: that of plastic pollution.  As part of their protein research, Knowles and his group became interested in why materials like spider silk are so strong when they have such weak molecular bonds.  We found that one of the key features that gives spider silk its strength is the hydrogen bonds are arranged regularly in space and at a very high density,  said Knowles. Co-author Dr Marc Rodriguez Garcia, a postdoctoral researcher in Knowles  group who is now Head of R&D at Xampla, began looking at how to replicate this regular self-assembly in other proteins. Proteins have a propensity for molecular self-organisation and self-assembly, and plant proteins, in particular, are abundant and can be sourced sustainably as by-products of the food industry.  Very little is known about the self-assembly of plant proteins, and it s exciting to know that by filling this knowledge gap we can find alternatives to single-use plastics,  said PhD candidate Ayaka Kamada, the paper s first author. The researchers successfully replicated the structures found on spider silk by using soy protein isolate, a protein with a completely different composition.  Because all proteins are made of polypeptide chains, under the right conditions we can cause plant proteins to self-assemble just like spider silk,  said Knowles, who is also a Fellow of St John's College.  In a spider, the silk protein is dissolved in an aqueous solution, which then assembles into an immensely strong fibre through a spinning process which requires very little energy.   Other researchers have been working directly with silk materials as a plastic replacement, but they re still an animal product,  said Rodriguez Garcia.  In a way, we ve come up with  vegan spider silk    we ve created the same material without the spider.  Any replacement for plastic requires another polymer   the two in nature that exist in abundance are polysaccharides and polypeptides. Cellulose and nanocellulose are polysaccharides and have been used for a range of applications, but often require some form of cross-linking to form strong materials. Proteins self-assemble and can form strong materials like silk without any chemical modifications, but they are much harder to work with. The researchers used soy protein isolate (SPI) as their test plant protein, since it is readily available as a by-product of soybean oil production. Plant proteins such as SPI are poorly soluble in water, making it hard to control their self-assembly into ordered structures. The new technique uses an environmentally friendly mixture of acetic acid and water, combined with ultrasonication and high temperatures, to improve the solubility of the SPI. This method produces protein structures with enhanced inter-molecular interactions guided by the hydrogen bond formation. In a second step, the solvent is removed, which results in a water-insoluble film. The material has a performance equivalent to high-performance engineering plastics such as low-density polyethylene. Its strength lies in the regular arrangement of the polypeptide chains, meaning there is no need for chemical cross-linking, which is frequently used to improve the performance and resistance of biopolymer films. The most commonly used cross-linking agents are non-sustainable and can even be toxic, whereas no toxic elements are required for the Cambridge-developed technique.  This is the culmination of something we ve been working on for over ten years, which is understanding how nature generates materials from proteins,  said Knowles.  We didn t set out to solve a sustainability challenge -- we were motivated by curiosity as to how to create strong materials from weak interactions.   The key breakthrough here is being able to control self-assembly, so we can now create high-performance materials,  said Rodriguez Garcia.  It s exciting to be part of this journey. There is a huge, huge issue of plastic pollution in the world, and we are in the fortunate position to be able to do something about it.

Their work used a mouse model of pancreatic cancer and cutting-edge techniques to trace the lineage and gene expression patterns of individual cancer cells. They found a spectrum of aggression in the cells that arose, with cells that were likely to remain in place at the primary tumor at one end and those that were more likely to move to new sites and colonize other tissues at the other end.Of the cells that eventually became metastatic and grew in tissues and organs beyond the pancreas, the majority shared a common lineage, the researchers discovered.""By building a precision tool for probing cancer metastasis in vivo, we're able to observe previously inaccessible types of information,"" says Simeonov. ""We were able to use this lineage tracing approach to rank cells based on how metastatic they were and then relate these differences in behavior to gene expression changes.""The group's findings, published in the journal Cancer Cell, suggest that it's not only genetic mutations that can drive cancer's spread; the single-cell RNA profiling results underscore that gene expression patterns--which genes cells are turning on and off--play a key role in disease outcomes.","Published: June 11, 2021"

In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Harvard Medical School discovered that cis P-tau, a toxic, non-degradable version of a healthy brain protein, is an early marker of vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their results, published on June 2 in Science Translational Medicine, define the molecular mechanism that causes an accumulation of this toxic protein. Furthermore, they showed that a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets this toxic protein was able to prevent disease pathology and memory loss in AD- and VaD-like preclinical models. Additionally, this treatment was even capable of reversing cognitive impairment in an AD-like preclinical model.""We believe our findings have not only discovered cis P-tau as a previously unrecognized major early driver of VaD and AD but also identified a highly effective and specific immunotherapy to target this common disease driver for treating and preventing AD and VaD at early stages,"" said Onder Albayram, Ph.D., co-lead author and assistant professor in the Division of Cardiology in the Department of Medicine at MUSC.Aging is a normal part of life - we experience weakening of our bones and muscles, stiffening of our blood vessels and some memory lapses. But for around 50 million people worldwide, these memory lapses become progressively more severe, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of dementia.Dementia is an umbrella term that covers AD, which accounts for 60% to 80% of cases; VaD, the second most common cause; and other less common pathologies. Currently, there are no effective treatments for AD. Interestingly, most AD cases have a vascular component, suggesting a broader relationship between cognitive function and healthy brain vasculature. A better understanding of that relationship could provide a platform to discover novel therapeutic targets.""Our work provides evidence that cis P-tau may be a pathogenic factor that explains VaD, which is not generally linked to other dementias,"" added Chenxi Qiu, Ph.D., co-lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at BIDMC, Harvard Medical School.In a preclinical model of VaD, young mice showed signs of brain inflammation and memory loss within one month. However, treating these mice with the cis P-tau mAb prevented neural degradation and cognitive decline out to six months. In a separate preclinical model of AD, old mice showed severe cognitive impairment. Excitingly, this severe impairment was significantly reversed when mice were given the cis P-tau mAb.""These data show that cis P-tau could be an early upstream pathogenic factor common to both diseases,"" said Albayram.Translating information gained from preclinical models to humans is often difficult, but this study offers reasons to be optimistic. Accumulation of cis P-tau caused dramatic changes in the genetic architecture of affected cells in a VaD model; these changes were consistent with those seen in human AD patients. The researchers went on to show that treatment with the cis P-tau mAb reversed 85% to 90 % of those changes suggesting the power of this potential therapy.""The genomic landscape really adapts after the silencing of this toxic protein,"" said Albayram. ""That was a big discovery.""Not only are Albayram and Qiu excited about these findings, but colleagues at MUSC are already quite enthusiastic about this work.""I can go on and on about this paper,"" said Adviye Ergul, M.D., Ph.D., professor in the College of Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at MUSC. ""They provide robust evidence that there is accumulation of a specific form of the tau protein - cis P-tau - that highlights a different tau protein pathology in VaD research.""This groundbreaking research has opened the door for new potential immunotherapies and highlighted several new areas of research that need to be explored. While the researchers delineated a pathway that leads to the accumulation of cis P-tau, the underlying linkage between vascular abnormalities and activation of the pathway needs to be identified. A better understanding of how toxic cis P-tau interacts with the healthy trans P-tau could provide further insights into the progression of AD disease.AD and VaD might not be the only diseases affected by high levels of cis P-tau. Other brain disorders with a vascular component might also arise from this toxic protein, but further study will be required to establish such a link.""Cis P-tau may be a common, early and pathogenic factor underlying traumatic brain injury, VaD and AD,"" said Qiu.As we get older and our memory begins to lapse - misplacing our car keys or forgetting the name of a new acquaintance - we fear the possibility that these are the first signs of dementia. And while there is currently no approved treatment to reverse the physiological effects of dementia, this new research may provide hope that new therapies are around the corner.Reference: Qiu C, Albayram O, Kondo A, et al.

The study was published in the journal Heart. Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a condition passed down through families that causes extremely high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Without treatment, it can lead to a heart attack at a very young age. FH affects 320,000 people in the UK, the vast majority of whom are unaware they have it.One method of detection is the 'FAMCAT' (Familial Hypercholesterolemia Case Assertation Tool) which analyses data in GP records - including blood test results and family history - to predict who is 'likely' or 'unlikely' to have FH. The result is a long list of patients that GPs can call in for further investigation. This is the first time FAMCAT has been used on data from a large, inner-city, ethnically diverse population.Dr John Robson, Reader in Primary Care at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""There is an urgent need for better methods to detect people who might have FH. We have demonstrated the FAMCAT algorithm can be applied to whole boroughs or cities, using the data we already have in the system to help find those undiagnosed cases. But FAMCAT generates a very long list of possible candidates, and this needs to be assessed for cost-effectiveness. For every confirmed case of FH, FAMCAT found 119 likely candidates all needing investigation - first by the GP, with a detailed family history and examination, then in secondary care for genetic testing and advice.""It is also unclear whether the algorithm performs equally well at detecting FH in different ethnic groups. We are now planning further research with east London data to investigate this.""Reference: Carvalho C, Williams C, Raisi-Estabragh Z, et al.

However, until now, it wasn t possible to preview the data in a file stored as DNA   if you wanted to know what a file was, you had to  open  the entire file. The advantage to our technique is that it is more efficient in terms of time and money,  says Kyle Tomek, lead author of a paper on the work and a Ph.D. student at NC State.  If you are not sure which file has the data you want, you don t have to sequence all of the DNA in all of the potential files. Instead, you can sequence much smaller portions of the DNA files to serve as previews. Here s a quick overview of how this works.Users  name  their data files by attaching sequences of DNA called primer-binding sequences to the ends of DNA strands that are storing information. To identify and extract a given file, most systems use polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specifically, they use a small DNA primer that matches the corresponding primer-binding sequence to identify the DNA strands containing the file you want. The system then uses PCR to make lots of copies of the relevant DNA strands, then sequences the entire sample. Because the process makes numerous copies of the targeted DNA strands, the signal of the targeted strands is stronger than the rest of the sample, making it possible to identify the targeted DNA sequence and read the file.However, one challenge that DNA data storage researchers have grappled with is that if two or more files have similar file names, the PCR will inadvertently copy pieces of multiple data files. As a result, users have to give files very distinct names to avoid getting messy data. At some point it occurred to us that we might be able to use these non-specific interactions as a tool, rather than viewing it as a problem,  says Albert Keung, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work and an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at NC State.Specifically, the researchers developed a technique that makes use of similar file names to let them open either an entire file or a specific subset of that file. This works by using a specific naming convention when naming a file and a given subset of the file. They can choose whether to open the entire file, or just the  preview  version, by manipulating several parameters of the PCR process: the temperature, the concentration of DNA in the sample, and the types and concentrations of reagents in the sample. Our technique makes the system more complex,  says James Tuck, co-corresponding author of the paper and a professor of computer engineering at NC State.  This means that we have to be even more careful in managing both the file-naming conventions and the conditions of PCR. However, this makes the system both more data-efficient and substantially more user friendly. The researchers demonstrated their technique by saving four large JPEG image files in DNA data storage and retrieving thumbnails of each file, as well as the full, high-resolution files in their entirety. Although we have only stored image files, this technology is broadly compatible with other file types. It also provides this new functionality without added cost,  says Kevin Volkel, co-author of the work and a Ph.D. student at NC State.The new  file preview  technique is also compatible with the DNA Enrichment and Nested Separation (DENSe) system that the researchers created to make DNA data storage more practical. DENSe effectively made DNA storage systems more scalable by introducing improved techniques for data file labeling and retrieval. We re currently looking for industry partners to help us explore the technology s commercial viability,  Keung says.The paper,  Promiscuous Molecules for Smarter File Operations in DNA-based Data Storage,  is published in Nature Communications. The paper was co-authored by Elaine Indermaur, a former undergraduate at NC State.The work was done with support from the National Science Foundation, under grants 1650148, 1901324 and 2027655; and from a Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Fellowship.Reference: Tomek KJ, Volkel K, Indermaur EW, Tuck JM, Keung AJ.

When we take antibiotics, 70 per cent passes through our bodies into wastewater. Farm animals are treated with antibiotics which can also end up in aquatic systems through run-off and flooding. University of Exeter research has previously shown that even when antimicrobials are present in these waters at low levels, they can contribute to the evolution of resistant bacteria. These bacteria can make their way into our guts, potentially causing health problems.Last month, the G7 Climate and Environment Ministers' Meeting Communiqu  recognised that the release of antimicrobials into the environment can select for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and have an impact on human, animal and environmental health. The communique reads: ""We note with concern that there are currently no international standards on safe concentrations of antimicrobials released into the environment from, inter alia, pharmaceutical manufacturing, healthcare facility effluent, agriculture and aquaculture. We also acknowledge the work of the AMR Industry Alliance in this regard. We commit to accumulate knowledge on AMR in the environment. We will work with our ministerial colleagues with responsibility for health, food, farming and medicines regulators where independent of government, as appropriate to develop and agree such standards.""Now, in a paper published in Water Research, the Exeter team worked with global pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to make a significant step towards meeting this need. After reviewing the available evidence in the field, they have developed a framework which effectively provides guidance on how to perform a risk assessment to ensure the levels of antimicrobials released into the environment are safe. Currently there are no thresholds for safe levels of antimicrobials in wastewater and aquatic systems, although the EU and UK government are monitoring the emerging evidence.Dr Aimee Murray, of the University of Exeter, lead author on the paper, said: ""Over the past few years, our research has helped understand the urgent threat posed by the evolution of AMR in our waters and in the environment. We're delighted to see the G7 Climate and Environment Ministers' Meeting commit to taking action. Our new paper is a significant step towards informing policy that can ensure the levels of antimicrobials we release into the environment are safe.""The Exeter team's review summarises and critically appraises the current approaches that study the concentrations of antimicrobials that increase AMR. They have consolidated terminology and recommended how data (including data generated at Exeter) on selection for AMR can best be analysed to establish safe thresholds for release into the environment. By collating and assessing available data, they have recommended what these safe thresholds could be, to enable governments to act to reduce them.Professor Will Gaze, of the University of Exeter, said: ""if we don't take action now, AMR could be a greater threat to humanity than COVID-19 over the coming decades. Our work over the last decade represents a significant contribution to understanding the role of the environment in the evolution and transmission of AMR. There is still uncertainty regarding the complex processes that lead to antimicrobial resistance genes being mobilised from environmental bacteria to human pathogens and how the presence of antimicrobials in natural environments drives this phenomenon.""Professor Jason Snape, Global Head of Environment at AstraZeneca, said: ""This framework is the latest output from our partnership with the University of Exeter, which has helped us over the past eight years to establish science-driven, risk-based targets for discharge concentrations for antibiotics, both to meet our commitments as a company and for our industry, addressing critical knowledge gaps in support of science-based policy to address environmental risks associated with AMR.""Reference: Murray AK, Stanton I, Gaze WH, Snape J.

Left to their own devices, it can take hundreds of years for them to degrade completely. Catalysts activated by sunlight could speed up the process, but getting these compounds to interact with microplastics is difficult. In a proof-of-concept study, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces developed self-propelled microrobots that can swim, attach to plastics and break them down.While plastic products are omnipresent indoors, plastic waste and broken bits now litter the outdoors, too. The smallest of these   microplastics less than 5 mm in size   are hard to pick up and remove. In addition, they can adsorb heavy metals and pollutants, potentially harming humans or animals if accidently consumed. So, previous researchers proposed a low-energy way to get rid of plastics in the environment by using catalysts that use sunlight to produce highly reactive compounds that break down these types of polymers. However, getting the catalysts and tiny plastic pieces in contact with each other is challenging and usually requires pretreatments or bulky mechanical stirrers, which aren t easily scaled-up. Martin Pumera and colleagues wanted to create a sunlight-propelled catalyst that moves toward and latches onto microparticles and dismantles them.To transform a catalytic material into light-driven microrobots, the researchers made star-shaped particles of bismuth vanadate and then evenly coated the 4-8  m-wide structures with magnetic iron oxide. The microrobots could swim down a maze of channels and interact with microplastic pieces along their entire lengths. The researchers found that under visible light, microrobots strongly glommed on to four common types of plastics. The team then illuminated pieces of the four plastics covered with the microrobot catalyst for seven days in a dilute hydrogen peroxide solution. They observed that the plastic lost 3% of its weight and that the surface texture for all types changed from smooth to pitted, and small molecules and components of the plastics were found in the left-over solution. The researchers say the self-propelled microrobot catalysts pave the way toward systems that can capture and degrade microplastics in hard-to-reach-locations.Reference: Beladi-Mousavi SM, Hermanov  S, Ying Y, Plutnar J, Pumera M.

Be it industrial-strength coffee, energy drinks of unearthly hues or complex sleep routines, everyone has their own go-tos for staying alert. Now, researchers claim, a new fatigue-fighting technique may have emerged in the form of non-invasive electrical brain stimulation.The research, published by scientists at the Air Force Research Laboratory and Department of Defense provider Infoscitex, Inc., used a form of nervous system stimulation called cervical vagus nerve stimulation (cVNS).Whilst previous studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), an electrical stimulation technique that involves passing electrical current through the scalp, could improve cognitive abilities under fatigue, other brain stimulation techniques have yet to be explored.The team, including lead author Lindsey K. McIntire, hypothesized that VNS could be even more effective than tDCS. This is because both techniques target an area of the brainstem called the locus coeruleus (LC) that secretes the wakefulness hormone norepinephrine.While tDCS signals must travel through the skin, skull and the rest of the brain to reach the LC, VNS techniques stimulate the vagus, the central nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. The device used in this study, the gammaCore Sapphire, stimulates the nerve by placing it against the skin of the neck. The authors hoped that this could be a quicker route to activating the LC. Additionally, VNS can be self-administered and only takes six minutes, rather than the half-hour required for tDCS, making it a more attractive option for fatigue relief.To test their theory, the team used 40 volunteers, all personnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, OH. The participants stayed awake for 34 hours in total. After 12 hours had passed, they were either given rounds of cVNS or fake stimulation using an identifical device that vibrated and clicked like the real thing, without any electrical impulses being passed through the skin. The group was then given four cognitive task sets to assess their alertness.The results were mixed. In two of the tasks, no significant effects of cVNS were noted. One was a test of sustained attention called the Mackworth clock test and the other a test of memory called the N-back test. On the other two tasks, cVNS-stimulated participants performed significantly better at two time points roughly 12 and 15 hours after stimulation.  The tasks were the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and the Air Force Multi-Attribute Task Battery (AF-MATB). The performance improvement in the AF-MATB was driven by tasks where close visual attentiveness was required. The PVT is also a highly visual task, and the authors suggest that the apparent benefits of the cVNS device arose from improvements to executive control, which they describe in their paper as  the ability to regulate perceptual and motor processes in order to respond in an adaptive way to novel or changing task demands. While the results from the behavioral tasks were mixed, subjective reports from volunteers were more robust. Significant differences were noted from 21 hours to 31 hours after stimulation, as the VNS group reported much smaller increases in fatigue. ""At 7AM, when people's performance would naturally start to decline, becuase they are in a circadian trough, we found that people receiving the active cVNS had significantly better multitasking ability, arousal level and they also reported feeling less fatigued and more energetic,"" summed up McIntire in an interview with Technology Networks. Will VNS devices be used to fight off fatigue outside of labs any time soon? The authors point out that their data will need to be confirmed by other labs using study groups that are more diverse in terms of sex and age. Additionally, they note that cervical VNS, the specific type of VNS technology used in the study, has only been tested in clinical populations   such devices are medically approved for the treatment of clusters headaches.

However, the specifics of this process are not always well understood. In a recent study published in Scientific Reports, researchers from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) found that when young rats were fed a diet of either soft or regular food, these different sensory inputs led to differences in muscle control and electrical activity of the jaw when a specific chewing-related brain region was stimulated.Chewing is mainly controlled by the brainstem, a brain region that controls many automatic activities such as breathing and swallowing. For chewing, the brainstem is also influenced by signaling that comes from higher brain regions, including the cortical masticatory area (CMA), which can be split into the front (anterior) and back (posterior) parts. When the anterior CMA is stimulated, signals travel through the brainstem and reach the jaw muscles, causing chewing to occur. However, it remains unknown whether incoming sensory information affects chewing under the control of the anterior CMA, something researchers at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) decided to address.""In the developing brain, changes in sensory information can greatly affect the brain's structure,"" says senior author of the study Takashi Ono. ""We fed 2-week-old rats either a soft diet or a regular diet, and then investigated a range of different neuromuscular outcomes in response to stimulation of the anterior CMA.""After rats had been fed the soft or regular diet for 3 to 9 weeks, electrodes were used to stimulate the anterior CMA while the rats' jaw movements were measured, along with the electrical activity of the jaw muscles. In response to anterior CMA stimulation, rats in the soft diet group had altered movement and electrical activity in the jaw muscles compared with the regular diet group.""Our findings suggest that the anterior CMA strongly influences the regulation of chewing, and is affected by sensory inputs during development. As such, reduced chewing function during growth should be corrected as soon as possible to avoid any potential adverse effects on jaw muscle development and chewing ability,"" says Ono.Given the importance of chewing for obtaining nutrients, the results of this study could be vital for monitoring and improving chewing ability in young children with chewing difficulties, as well as in adults after trauma or disease. The results of this study suggest that the brain's control of chewing may be influenced by simply increasing chewing difficulty.Reference: Aung PT, Kato C, Fujita A, et al.

The study also sheds light on memory and personality differences between those with strong visual imagery and those who cannot hold a picture in their mind's eye.The research, from the University of Exeter, published in Cerebral Cortex Communications, casts new light on why an estimated one-three per cent of the population lack the ability to visualise. This phenomenon was named ""aphantasia"" by the University of Exeter's Professor Adam Zeman in 2015 Professor Zeman called those with highly developed visual imagery skills ""hyperphantasics"".Funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the study is the first systematic neuropsychological and brain imaging study of people with aphantasia and hypephantasia. The team conducted fMRI scans on 24 people with aphantasia, 25 with hyperphantasia and a control group of 20 people with mid-range imagery vividness. They combined the imaging data with detailed cognitive and personality tests.The scans revealed that people with hyperphantasia have a stronger connection between the visual network which processes what we see, and which becomes active during visual imagery, and the prefrontal cortices, invovled in decision-making and attention. These stronger connections were apparent in scans performed during rest, while participants were relaxing - and possibly mind-wandering.Despite equivalent scores on standard memory tests, Professor Zeman and the team found that people with hyperphantasia produce richer descriptions of imagined scenarios than controls, who in turn outperformed aphantasics. This also applied to autobiographical memory, or the ability to remember events that have taken place in the person's life. Aphantasics also had lower ability to recognise faces.Personality tests revealed that aphantasics tended to be more introvert and hyperphantasics more open.Professor Zeman said: ""Our research indicates for the first time that a weaker connection between the parts of the brain responsible for vision and frontal regions involved in decision-making and attention leads to aphantasia. However, this shouldn't be viewed as a disadvantage - it's a different way of experiencing the world. Many aphantasics are extremely high-achieving, and we're now keen to explore whether the personality and memory differences we observed indicate contrasting ways of processing information, linked to visual imagery ability.""Reference: Milton F, Fulford J, Dance C, et al.

This breakthrough will spark all sorts of new technologies   from better navigation systems to better MRI machines, you name it,  Professor Bowen said. Entanglement is thought to lie at the heart of a quantum revolution. We ve finally demonstrated that sensors that use it can supersede existing, non-quantum technology. This is exciting   it s the first proof of the paradigm-changing potential of entanglement for sensing. Australia s Quantum Technologies Roadmap sees quantum sensors spurring a new wave of technological innovation in healthcare, engineering, transport and resources.A major success of the team s quantum microscope was its ability to catapult over a  hard barrier  in traditional light-based microscopy. The best light microscopes use bright lasers that are billions of times brighter than the sun,  Professor Bowen said. Fragile biological systems like a human cell can only survive a short time in them and this is a major roadblock. The quantum entanglement in our microscope provides 35 per cent improved clarity without destroying the cell, allowing us to see minute biological structures that would otherwise be invisible. The benefits are obvious   from a better understanding of living systems, to improved diagnostic technologies. Professor Bowen said there were potentially boundless opportunities for quantum entanglement in technology. Entanglement is set to revolutionise computing, communication and sensing,  he said. Absolutely secure communication was demonstrated some decades ago as the first demonstration of absolute quantum advantage over conventional technologies. Computing faster than any possible conventional computer was demonstrated by Google two years ago, as the first demonstration of absolute advantage in computing. The last piece in the puzzle was sensing, and we ve now closed that gap. This opens the door for some wide-ranging technological revolutions. Reference: Casacio CA, Madsen LS, Terrasson A, et al.

The single-shot viral vector vaccine -- developed in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) immunologist Dan Barouch, MD, PhD -- was authorized for use based on clinical trial data showing strong clinical efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States, Latin America and South Africa.In a new study published in Nature, Barouch, Director of BIDMC's Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, and colleagues report on the antibody and cellular immune responses generated by the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine against the original viral strain and against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The team found that this vaccine induced immune responses against all the viral variants.""The concern is whether SARS-CoV-2 variants may reduce the efficacy of current vaccines that were designed to protect against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain at the beginning of the pandemic,"" said Barouch, senior author of the study and also Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""These findings therefore have important implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.""To explore the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, Barouch and colleagues at BIDMC administered one or two doses of Johnson & Johnson's investigational vaccine to 20 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55. All volunteers were participants of a larger multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2a study to evaluate the vaccine at various doses and schedules. The researchers then used multiple methods to assess antibody and cellular immune responses against the original viral strain (WA1/2020) and against the viral variants first identified in South Africa (B.1.1351), the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), Brazil (P.1) and California (CAL.20C).Compared to antibody responses against WA1/2020, the data showed reductions in neutralizing antibodies against the B.1.1351 and P.1 strains. In contrast, non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were minimally impacted or not impacted by SARS-CoV-2 variants. Given the vaccine's protective efficacy as demonstrated in Phase 3 clinical trials, non-neutralizing antibodies and/or T cell responses may contribute to protection against COVID-19.The published Phase 3 efficacy data showed that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine offered strong protection against symptomatic COVID-19 in South Africa and in Brazil where most sequenced COVID-19 cases were caused by variants. The findings contribute to our understanding of vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.""Although the mechanistic correlates of protection for COVID-19 are not yet known, the vaccine's robust protective efficacy in these regions raises the possibility that non-neutralizing antibodies and/or T cell responses may also contribute to protection,"" said Barouch, who is also a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard. ""Alternatively, it is possible that low levels of neutralizing antibodies are sufficient for protection against COVID-19.""Reference: Alter G, Yu J, Liu J, et al.

The worries were due, in large part, to the effects that cancer and its treatments can have on the immune system. Now that COVID-19 vaccines are widely available, concerns have shifted to the safety and effectiveness of vaccination in this potentially vulnerable population. A study published in the journal Cancer Cell aims to allay those fears.In a review of 200 patients with a wide spectrum of cancer diagnoses, researchers at Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, NY, found that after full vaccination, 94% of patients overall demonstrated seroconversion, which was determined by the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Response rates were very high among patients with solid tumors and were lower in people with certain blood cancers, but even the majority of those patients mounted an immune response.""Studies from early in the pandemic found that cancer patients who get COVID-19 have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population,"" says senior co-author Amit Verma, director of the Division of Hemato-Oncology at Montefiore and professor of medicine and of developmental and molecular biology at Einstein, and associate director, translational science, Albert Einstein Cancer Center. ""We really need efforts to protect these vulnerable patients from infection. This study should help people feel reassured that these vaccines work very well, even in those receiving chemotherapy or immunotherapy.""""This study confirms that there is no need for patients to wait for vaccination until they finish their chemotherapy or immunotherapy,"" says senior co-author Balazs Halmos (@DrSteveMartin), director of the Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Program at Montefiore, professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and a member of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center (AECC). ""The side effects from vaccination seen in these populations were not substantially worse than in other groups. Not a single patient had to go to the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital because of side effects from the vaccines.""This study was the largest of its kind to look at seroconversion rates in cancer patients who have been fully vaccinated. Previous studies have looked at much smaller populations or have analyzed antibody levels after only the first dose of two-dose vaccines.In serum tests to look for IgG levels after vaccination, the researchers found that among patients with solid tumors, 98% showed seroconversion. Among patients with hematologic cancers, the rate of seroconversion was 85%.Patients receiving some treatments fared worse than others. Those receiving therapies for blood cancers that work by killing B cells (such as rituximab or CAR T therapies) had seroconversion rates of 70%. For those who had recently had bone marrow or stem cell transplants, the rate was 74%. But those rates were still much higher than expected, the researchers say.""Although those receiving treatments that affect B cells didn't do as well, patients with blood cancers that affect the myeloid cells rather than the lymphoid cells had a pretty good response with regard to seropositivity,"" says first author Astha Thakkar (@asthakkar15) a Montefiore hematologic oncology fellow. ""This includes people with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.""The researchers say that one reason their data are so significant is that they include patients who had a broad range of cancers and who were undergoing a number of different treatments. ""The patients themselves were also diverse and were representative of the patients we treat in the Bronx,"" Halmos says. ""About one-third were Black and 40% were Hispanic.""""Vaccination among these populations have been lower, even though these groups were hardest hit by the pandemic,"" Verma concludes.

In addition, the enzyme can cut and inactivate some human proteins important for an immune response. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Infectious Diseases have found other targets of PLpro in the human proteome, including proteins involved in cardiovascular function, blood clotting and inflammation, suggesting a link between the inactivation of these proteins and COVID-19 symptoms.Viruses like SARS-CoV-2 make multiple proteins as one long ""polyprotein."" Viral enzymes called proteases recognize specific amino acid sequences in this polyprotein and cut them to release individual proteins. However, some human proteins also contain these sequences (known as homologous host-pathogen sequences, or SSHHPS), including ones involved in generating the innate immune response, which could help protect the virus from the host. Patricia Legler and colleagues wanted to comprehensively identify human proteins that contain SSHHPS, examine their functions and see whether PLpro can cleave them in a test tube.The researchers developed a computational method to search a database of all known human proteins for sequences similar or identical to the SARS-CoV-2 SSHHPS. The analysis revealed that the proteins with highest sequence identity were those that had cardiovascular, inflammatory, kidney, respiratory or blood-related functions. For example, two of the proteins containing SSHHPS were cardiac myosins, one was an anti-coagulant and another was an anti-inflammatory protein. Inactivation of these proteins by PLpro is consistent with COVID-19 symptoms of heart damage, blood clots and inflammation. The team confirmed that PLpro could cut these protein sequences in vitro. Performing the same analysis on SSHHPS for the Zika viral protease identified proteins associated with neurological development and disorders, consistent with Zika symptoms. These results suggest that the symptoms and virulence of viruses can be predicted directly from their genomic sequences, the researchers say.Reference: Reynolds ND, Aceves NM, Liu JL, et al.

The study, published June 9 in Science Translational Medicine, also found that the effects lasted much longer than previously suspected, with some participants experiencing improvements for upwards of two weeks.These results bolster the evidence that non-traditional treatments may be a viable option for patients whose depression is not responsive to typical antidepressant medications. It may also provide a rapidly effective treatment option for patients in crisis.Often called  laughing gas,  nitrous oxide is frequently used as an anesthetic that provides short-term pain relief in dentistry and surgery.In a prior study, the investigators tested the effects of a one-hour inhalation session with 50% nitrous oxide gas in 20 patients, finding that it led to rapid improvements in patient s depressive symptoms that lasted for at least 24 hours when compared to placebo. However, several patients experienced negative side effects, including nausea, vomiting and headaches. This investigation was motivated by observations from research on ketamine and depression,  said Peter Nagele, MD, Chair of Anesthesia and Critical Care at UChicago Medicine.  Like nitrous oxide, ketamine is an anesthetic, and there has been promising work using ketamine at a sub-anesthetic dose for treating depression. We wondered if our past concentration of 50% had been too high. Maybe by lowering the dose, we could find the  Goldilocks spot  that would maximize clinical benefit and minimize negative side effects. In the new study, the investigators repeated a similar protocol with 20 patients, this time adding an additional inhalation session with 25% nitrous oxide. They found that even with only half the concentration of nitrous oxide, the treatment was nearly as effective as 50% nitrous oxide, but this time with just one quarter of the negative side effects.Furthermore, the investigators looked at patients  clinical depression scores after treatment over a longer time course; while the last study only evaluated depression symptoms up to 24 hours after treatment, this new study conducted additional evaluations over two weeks. To their surprise, after just a single administration, some patients  improvements in their depression symptoms lasted for the entire evaluation period. The reduction in side effects was unexpected and quite drastic, but even more excitingly, the effects after a single administration lasted for a whole two weeks,  said Nagele.  This has never been shown before. It s a very cool finding. These results indicate promise for nitrous oxide as a rapid and effective treatment for those suffering from severe depression that fails to respond to other treatments, such as SSRIs, a common type of antidepressant medication. A significant percentage   we think around 15%   of people who suffer from depression don t respond to standard antidepressant treatment,  said Charles Conway, MD, Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Treatment Resistant Depression and Neurostimulation Clinic at Washington University School of Medicine.  These  treatment-resistant depression  patients often suffer for years, even decades, with life-debilitating depression. We don t really know why standard treatments don t work for them, though we suspect that they may have different brain network disruptions than non-resistant depressed patients. Identifying novel treatments, such as nitrous oxide, that target alternative pathways is critical to treating these individuals. Despite its  laughing gas  reputation, patients who receive such a low dosage actually fall asleep. They re not getting high or euphoric, they get sedated,  Nagele said.While it remains challenging to get non-traditional treatments for depression accepted in the mainstream, researchers hope that these results, and other similar studies, will open the minds of reluctant physicians toward the unique properties of these drugs. These have just been pilot studies,  said Nagele.  But we need acceptance by the larger medical community for this to become a treatment that s actually available to patients in the real world. Most psychiatrists are not familiar with nitrous oxide or how to administer it, so we ll have to show the community how to deliver this treatment safely and effectively. I think there will be a lot of interest in getting this into clinical practice. With broader public acceptance, Nagele hopes that these results can open doors for those patients who are struggling to find adequate therapies for their depression. There is a huge unmet need,  he said.  There are millions of depressed patients who don t have good treatment options, especially those who are dealing with suicidality. If we develop effective, rapid treatments that can really help someone navigate their suicidal thinking and come out on the other side   that s a very gratifying line of research.

These simulations provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. The results were published in PLoS Computational Biology.Every cell in the body contains two meters of DNA. In order to fit all the DNA in the cell s small nucleus, the DNA is tightly packed in a structure known as chromatin. Chromatin is an array of identical smaller structures named nucleosomes. In a single nucleosome, DNA is wrapped around 8 proteins called histones. Chromatin is not uniformly compact across the genome. The tightness of the packaging is important in regulating which genes are expressed and therefore which proteins are produced by a cell.Transitions from tightly to loosely packed DNA   from closed to open chromatin   are essential for cells to convert to another cell type. These cell conversions are hallmarks of development and disease, but are also often used in regenerative therapies. Understanding how such transitions occur may contribute to understanding diseases and optimizing therapeutical cell type conversions.","Published: June 10, 2021"

""Even in cases of successful treatment, the patient's quality of life is severely lessened due to bone loss.""Prostate cancer that hasn't spread beyond nearby organs has nearly a 100% survival rate, meaning almost all of these patients will live at least another five or more years after their initial diagnosis and treatment.

In the U.S., about one in every eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 34,000 men die each year from the disease.The new study, published by Scientific Reports, focused on cancer-associated fibroblasts, which are the most abundant type of cell in tumors and are responsible for cancer growth and spread.

As odd as it may sound, our squishy, biological brains need metals to function. In fact, any organism that relies on chemical processes called oxidation and reduction will require some forms of metal to survive.In the brain, metals like iron, copper and zinc play important roles in many processes. They usually exist as ions, charged molecules that are used in the chemical reactions that fuel biological pathways. While their important role in the healthy brain is well established, the balance of metal and metal ions in the brain has become the focus of neurodegenerative researchers who suggest disruption of biological levels of these elements may contribute to proteinopathies like AD.Now, UK researchers have published a paper in Science Advances that reveals tiny amounts of non-ionic elemental metal deposits inside amyloid plaques. These hallmarks of AD are often exploited as therapeutic targets for the condition. The recently approved monoclonal antibody aducanumab is designed to bind to aggregated forms of  -amyloid.This finding, say the researchers, led by Keele University professor Neil Telling, is the first recorded evidence of elemental copper in the human brain. In an email to Technology Networks, Telling expanded on what this finding might mean for the brain:  The metallic forms of iron and copper we observed that are presented in this paper have distinctly different chemical and magnetic properties from their less reactive oxide forms in which iron and copper are predominately stored in the human body. The surfaces of metallic copper and iron are highly unstable and readily react with their surroundings, with potential to cause damage to brain cells.  The study identified tiny deposits of both metallic copper and iron. Credit: Neil Telling and James EverettThe metals are classed as biogenic, meaning they have been produced by the body, and were found in minuscule amounts that were only identifiable using a sophisticated imaging technique called synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM).The researchers found the deposits unexpectedly while analyzing the brains of two deceased Alzheimer s patients. STXM allows researchers to see what elements are present in specific areas of brain tissue, down to a resolution of roughly 20 nanometers   by comparison, a human hair is roughly 90,000 nanometers wide.The metals were found in amyloid plaques in the patients  frontal and temporal lobes, regions that contain structures essential to cognition such as the hippocampus. Interestingly, the iron found within the plaques appeared to be magnetic, a finding that was confirmed by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) analysis. This technique involved a magnetic field around the samples, which were then bombarded with polarized light rays. By then looking at the X-ray absorption spectra from the samples, the magnetism of the iron could be identified.","Published: June 9, 2021"

They also provide new insights on the changes that occur in the brain as these diseases develop. As tools for detecting Alzheimer s disease early are limited, there is a need to develop a reliable, non-invasive test that would enable early diagnosis,  says first author Murty Dinavahi, who was a PhD Research Scholar at the Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India, at the time the study was carried out, and is now a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Maryland, US.Previous studies in mice with a condition similar to Alzheimer s disease had suggested that weakened gamma brain waves may be an early sign of disease. Based on these findings, Murty and colleagues conducted a community-based study on around 250 elderly subjects. They compared gamma wave activity in 12 people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and five with Alzheimer s disease, with their healthy peers.The researchers used a technique called electroencephalography to measure electrical activity in the participants  brains while they viewed black and white patterns on a screen. These patterns are known to induce gamma oscillations in the part of the brain that processes visual information. The team also monitored the participants  eye movements during the experiments.Their results showed that people who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer s disease had weaker gamma waves in their brain than healthy individuals of the same age. We observed reductions in the strength of gamma waves in early stages of age-related cognitive decline,  Murty says.  Changes in these electrical signals could provide an early warning sign of an impending disease.  He adds that an early diagnosis could help individuals put care plans in place or allow them to begin treatments sooner. Our work provides a low-cost and non-invasive way to detect early signs of Alzheimer s disease,  concludes senior author Supratim Ray, Associate Professor at the Centre for Neuroscience, IISc.  This could be useful for clinicians and scientists studying early changes that take place in the brain during age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and potentially lead to new ways to diagnose and treat these conditions.

The study, published in Cell Reports, identifies cell-type specific transcriptional signatures of hyper-excitability and neurodegeneration, providing grounds for improved diagnosis. While the presence of sclerosis is essential for identifying temporal lobe epilepsy (the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy), it is also detected in some cases of dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease.Hippocampal sclerosis is characterized by the loss of specific neuronal populations and exacerbated activation of other cell types resident in the brain, such as microglia and astrocytes. However, understanding why some neuronal types are more vulnerable than others has remained largely unclear.In this work, the researchers have developed a transcriptional map that identifies the precise genetic code of all cell types specifically affected in the disease. ""With these maps we seek to match different genes with specific biological elements. In the case of the brain, we aim linking expression of some specific genes with different cell types, such as neurons, astrocytes and microglia"", explains Liset Men ndez de la Prida, a scientist at the Cajal Institute of the CSIC, who lead the study together with Jos  L pez-Atalaya, from the Institute of Neurosciences (CSIC-UMH) in Alicante.To do this, researchers applied two advanced procedures for biological sampling: laser micro-dissection of localized brain tissue and sorting of individual cell nuclei extracted from rats and mice. Using cutting-edge genomic and bioinformatic approaches allowed them to identify specific genetic signatures of degenerative processes.""When neurons begin to degenerate, they release some signals that can be detected by microglia, which are mediating the inflammatory and neurotoxic response. Each of these processes involve the activation or inactivation of some genetic programs defining a specific genetic signature. We identify some of these genetic signatures associated to neuronal types"", explains L pez-Atalaya.Researchers also recorded the electrical activity of individual neurons in vivo and found signs of epileptiform activities in some of them. These more hyperexcitable neurons tended to be located in a specific sublayer within the hippocampal region (the superficial sublayer) and expressed some characteristic genes. ""Very strikingly, we found that the hyperexcitability map perfectly matched neurodegeneration signatures"" adds de la Prida.To ease dissemination amongst the neuroscience and clinical communities, researchers have made the data associated with this study accessible as a public resource though two interactive websites. In Alzheimer's disease, which affects similar structures of the temporal lobe, electrographic seizures comparable to those of temporal lobe epilepsy have been described. Both diseases are associated with episodic memory deficits, which involve the hippocampus. In some cases of Alzheimer's, atrophy of the hippocampus is also observed, so the results of this study could be of relevance to identify their underlying commonalities.The work, funded by prestigious national and international grants, involves multidisciplinary collaborations of researchers from several institutions, including the Hospital de San Pau in Barcelona, the Universidad Europea in Madrid, as well as the Riken Brain Institute and the University of Kyoto in Japan.Reference: Cid E, Marquez-Galera A, Valero M, et al.

The researchers found that during rest the volunteers  brains rapidly and repeatedly replayed faster versions of the activity seen while they practiced typing a code. The more a volunteer replayed the activity the better they performed during subsequent practice sessions, suggesting rest strengthened memories. Our results support the idea that wakeful rest plays just as important a role as practice in learning a new skill. It appears to be the period when our brains compress and consolidate memories of what we just practiced,  said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., senior investigator at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the senior author of the study published in Cell Reports.  Understanding this role of neural replay may not only help shape how we learn new skills but also how we help patients recover skills lost after neurological injury like stroke. The study was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center. Dr. Cohen s team used a highly sensitive scanning technique, called magnetoencephalography, to record the brain waves of 33 healthy, right-handed volunteers as they learned to type a five-digit test code with their left hands. The subjects sat in a chair and under the scanner s long, cone-shaped cap. An experiment began when a subject was shown the code  41234  on a screen and asked to type it out as many times as possible for 10 seconds and then take a 10 second break. Subjects were asked to repeat this cycle of alternating practice and rest sessions a total of 35 times.During the first few trials, the speed at which subjects correctly typed the code improved dramatically and then leveled off around the 11th cycle. In a previous study, led by former NIH postdoctoral fellow Marlene B nstrup, M.D., Dr. Cohen s team showed that most of these gains happened during short rests, and not when the subjects were typing. Moreover, the gains were greater than those made after a night s sleep and were correlated with a decrease in the size of brain waves, called beta rhythms. In this new report, the researchers searched for something different in the subjects  brain waves. We wanted to explore the mechanisms behind memory strengthening seen during wakeful rest. Several forms of memory appear to rely on the replaying of neural activity, so we decided to test this idea out for procedural skill learning,  said Ethan R. Buch, Ph.D., a staff scientist on Dr. Cohen s team and leader of the study.To do this, Leonardo Claudino, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Cohen s lab, helped Dr. Buch develop a computer program which allowed the team to decipher the brain wave activity associated with typing each number in the test code.The program helped them discover that a much faster version   about 20 times faster - of the brain activity seen during typing was replayed during the rest periods. Over the course of the first eleven practice trials, these compressed versions of the activity were replayed many times - about 25 times - per rest period. This was two to three times more often than the activity seen during later rest periods or after the experiments had ended.Interestingly, they found that the frequency of replay during rest predicted memory strengthening. In other words, the subjects whose brains replayed the typing activity more often showed greater jumps in performance after each trial than those who replayed it less often. During the early part of the learning curve we saw that wakeful rest replay was compressed in time, frequent, and a good predictor of variability in learning a new skill across individuals,  said Dr. Buch.  This suggests that during wakeful rest the brain binds together the memories required to learn a new skill. As expected, the team discovered that the replay activity often happened in the sensorimotor regions of the brain, which are responsible for controlling movements. However, they also saw activity in other brain regions, namely the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. We were a bit surprised by these last results. Traditionally, it was thought that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex may not play such a substantive role in procedural memory. In contrast, our results suggest that these regions are rapidly chattering with the sensorimotor cortex when learning these types of skills,  said Dr. Cohen.  Overall, our results support the idea that manipulating replay activity during waking rest may be a powerful tool that researchers can use to help individuals learn new skills faster and possibly facilitate rehabilitation from stroke.

""What are the things we can tweak? What are the things we can do to make our snipers better at recognizing camouflage?""Because a missed shot by a sniper also tells the enemy his location. ""You can't take shots at things that are not the target,"" Hegd  says.""The potential for rapid training of novices in the camouflage-breaking paradigm is very promising as it highlights the potential for application to a wide variety of detection and localization tasks,"" says Dr. Frederick Gregory, program manager, U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory. ""Results in experts highlight an opportunity to extend the training to real world visual search and visualization problems that would be of prime importance for the Army to solve.""For this newly published work, six adult volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were trained to break camouflage using Hegd 's deep-learning method, but received no specific training about how to pinpoint the target. Participants looked at digitally synthesized camouflage scenes like foliage or fruit and each scene had a 50-50 chance of containing no target versus a camouflaged target like a human head or a novel, 3D digital image. Similar to computer scientists training self-driving cars, the idea was and is to get viewers to get to know the lay of the land that is their focus. ""If it turns out there is something that doesn't belong there, you can tell,"" he says.Trainees could then either look at the image for 50 milliseconds --.05 seconds -- or as long as they wanted, then proceed to the next step where they quickly viewed a random field of pixels, that work like a visual palate cleanser, before acknowledging whether the camouflage image contained a target, then using a mouse to show where the target was. ""You have to work from memory to say where it was,"" he notes.When the participants could look at the image for as long as they wanted, the reported location of the actual target was essentially indistinguishable from the actual target but the accuracy did not drop much when the viewing time was just 50 milliseconds, which gives little time for even moving your eyes around, Hegd  says.The subjects again had no subsequent training on identifying precisely where the target was. And they found that even without that specific training, they could do both equally well. ""This was not a given,"" Hegd  notes.In a second experiment with seven different individuals they used a much-abbreviated training process, which basically ensured participants knew which buttons to push when, and used instead a clearly more pronounced ""pop-out' target without the traditional camouflage background, rather scenarios like that black O-shaped target among a crowd of black C shapes or a blue S shape among a sea of green H shapes. Both the longer and shorter viewing times yielded essentially identical results from the more extensively trained camouflage-breakers, both in accuracy of localization and reaction time.Camouflage is used extensively by the military, from the deserts of the Middle East to the dense jungles of South America with the visual texture changing to blend with the natural environment. ""You often are recognized by your outline, and you use these patterns to break up your outline, so the person trying to break your camouflage doesn't know where you leave off and the background begins,"" he says.He notes that context is another important factor for recognition, referencing how you may not recognize a person whose face you have seen multiple times when you see them in a different environ. His current Army funded studies include exploring more about the importance of context, and further exploring ramifications of ""camouflage breaking"" in identifying medical problems.He notes that even with his training, some people are better at breaking camouflage than others -- he says he is really bad at it -- and why remains mostly a mystery and another learning point for Hegd  and his colleagues.Reference: ","Published: June 9, 2021"

Scientists at the Salk Institute are developing a promising approach for treating it: using stem cells to create insulin-producing cells (called beta cells) that could replace nonfunctional pancreatic cells.In a study published on June 7, 2021, in the journal Nature Communications, the investigators reported that they have developed a new way to create beta cells that is much more efficient than previous methods. Additionally, when these beta cells were tested in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes, the animals' blood sugar was brought under control within about two weeks.""Stem cells are an extremely promising approach for developing many cell therapies, including better treatments for type 1 diabetes,"" says Salk Professor Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, the paper's senior author. ""This method for manufacturing large numbers of safe and functional beta cells is an important step forward.""In the current work, the investigators started with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). These cells, which can be derived from adult tissues (most often the skin), have the potential to become any kind of cell found in the adult body. Using various growth factors and chemicals, the investigators coaxed hPSCs into beta cells in a stepwise fashion that mimicked pancreatic development.Producing beta cells from hPSCs in the lab is not new, but in the past the yields of these precious cells have been low. With existing methods, only about 10 to 40 percent of cells become beta cells. By comparison, techniques used to create nerve cells from hPSCs have yields of about 80 percent. Another issue is that if undifferentiated cells are left in the mix, they could eventually turn into another kind cell that would be unwanted.""In order for beta cell-based treatments to eventually become a viable option for patients, it's important to make these cells easier to manufacture,"" says co-first author Haisong Liu, a former member of the Belmonte lab. ""We need to find a way to optimize the process.""To address the problem, the researchers took a stepwise approach to create beta cells. They identified several chemicals that are important for inducing hPSCs to become more specialized cells. They ultimately identified several cocktails of chemicals that resulted in beta cell yields of up to 80 percent.They also looked at the ways in which these cells are grown in the lab. ""Normally cells are grown on a flat plate, but we allowed them to grow in three dimensions,"" says co-first author Ronghui Li, a postdoctoral fellow in the Belmonte lab. Growing the cells in this way creates more shared surface area between the cells and allows them to influence each other, just as they would during human development.After the cells were created, they were transplanted into a mouse model of type 1 diabetes, The model mice had a modified immune system that would not reject transplanted human cells. ""We found that within two weeks these mice had a reduction of their high blood sugar level into normal range,"" says co-first author Hsin-Kai Liao, a staff researcher in the Belmonte lab. ""The transplanted hPSC-derived beta cells were biologically functional.""The researchers will continue to study this technique in the lab to further optimize the production of beta cells. More research is needed to assess safety issues before clinical trials can be initiated in humans. The investigators say the methods reported in this paper may also be useful for developing specialized cells to treat other diseases.Reference: Liu H, Li R, Liao H-K, et al.

Many of these are petrochemical derivatives, and so their synthesis is not sustainable. It is therefore essential to seek alternative ways to manufacture chemicals, on an industrial-scale, sustainably and cheaply - paving the way to a greener cleaner future.Bacteria can be seen as nature's micro-chemical factories, and many researchers are trying to understand how their complex network of chemical reactions can be re-wired to convert cheap feedstock like glucose into useful chemical products for our use. Using genetic switches to redirect the bacteria's chemistry is an exciting development in the field of Synthetic Biology.Typically, genetic switches are turned on by adding a chemical called an inducer. However, inducers are expensive, and often need to be constantly added to prevent switching back off, analogous to a ""light switch with a spring in it"" that turns back off when you let go. This makes this switching approach expensive and so scaling up to industrial production economically infeasible.In the paper, 'Designing an irreversible metabolic switch for scalable induction of microbial chemical production', published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers from the School of Engineering at the University of Warwick have found a cheap way to switch bacteria into chemical production mode.Led by Dr Ahmad A. Mannan and Professor Declan G. Bates from Warwick's Integrative Synthetic Biology Centre at the School of Engineering, new theoretical research investigated how biosensors from E. coli that respond to cheap natural nutrients like oleic acid can be harnessed to create switches. Using mathematical models and the engineering principles of feedback control loops, commonly used in flight control systems, they discovered how to design a genetic switch in bacteria that removes the reverting ""spring"", so that adding only a pulse of a cheap natural nutrient can switch the cell to chemical production mode permanently - drastically cutting costs.Dr. Ahmad Mannan, from Warwick's Integrative Synthetic Biology Centre at the School of Engineering comments: ""The ability to switch on bacteria into chemical production mode permanently is a massive step forward to realising economically viable scale up of chemical production from microbes. The switch should be widely applicable to many industrially relevant microbes and for the synthesis of almost any chemical - a versatile component in the Synthetic Biology toolbox. The next steps of our research would be to uncover the principles to understand where in the chemical roadmap to apply this ""traffic light"" and perhaps look to collaborating with industry where it could be readily incorporated into existing fermentation processes.""Professor Declan Bates, from Warwick's Integrative Synthetic Biology Centre at the School of Engineering adds: ""Using cutting-edge synthetic biology techniques our work has laid out the framework for constructing the proposed irreversible switch in the lab. Not only could our work change the way chemical industries make high-value chemicals, it also contributes to the larger vision for how humans can move away from reliance on non-renewable resources, to enabling sustainable synthesis of biochemicals, for a greener, cleaner future.""Reference: Mannan AA, Bates DG.

The study also found that 25.7% of dreams were related to specific impending events, and 37.4% of dreams with a future event source were additionally related to one or more specific memories of past experiences. Future-oriented dreams became proportionally more common later in the night.""Humans have struggled to understand the meaning of dreams for millennia,"" said principal investigator Erin Wamsley, who has a doctorate in cognitive neuroscience and is an associate professor in the department of psychology and program in neuroscience at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. ""We present new evidence that dreams reflect a memory-processing function. Although it has long been known that dreams incorporate fragments of past experience, our data suggest that dreams also anticipate probable future events.""The study involved 48 students who spent the night in the laboratory for overnight sleep evaluation using polysomnography. During the night, participants were awakened up to 13 times to report on their experiences during sleep onset, REM sleep, and non-REM sleep. The following morning, participants identified and described waking life sources for each dream reported the previous evening. A total of 481 reports were analyzed.""This is a new description of how dreams draw simultaneously from multiple waking-life sources, utilizing fragments of past experience to construct novel scenarios anticipating future events,"" said Wamsley.According to Wamsley, the proportional increase of future-oriented dreams later in the night may be driven by temporal proximity to the upcoming events. While these dreams rarely depict future events realistically, the activation and recombination of future-relevant memory fragments may nonetheless serve an adaptive function.The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented as a poster beginning June 9 during Virtual SLEEP 2021.

""Using BH3 profiling, we found a specific metabolic dependency in triple negative breast cancer cells obtained from a patient that we could target with an existing drug, making the cells more susceptible to death and priming them for a second targeted drug that could then trigger their death.""Daniels, Letai and colleagues also showed that the strategy suppresses growth of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in mice bearing patient-derived tumors.Though tumors often have unique metabolic adaptations on which they depend, specifically targeting those vulnerabilities with drugs has proved challenging. Such drugs have often failed in clinical trials because they were poorly targeted or too toxic at the doses required to kill cancer cells when used as single agents.""We wanted to see which of the drugs known to perturb metabolism would bring the TNBC cells closer to dying, but leave normal cells unaffected,"" said Daniels. The researchers reasoned that such cells could then be selectively targeted by existing therapies known as BH3 mimetics to push them over the edge. Because the initial priming treatment requires low doses of the drug, this strategy could lower the risk of toxicities that have troubled the development of drugs targeting cancer metabolism.Therapy often induces in cancer cells a type of programmed death known as apoptosis, which is orchestrated by an elaborate protein machinery. Cells, however, also produce anti-death proteins that inhibit key elements of that machinery. Whether a stressed cell dies or survives depends on the balance of pro-death and anti-death proteins, and cancer cells tend to produce large quantities of the latter to escape apoptosis and resist therapy.BH3 mimetics inhibit anti-death proteins, tipping the balance in favor of cell suicide. Notably, one BH3 mimetic has already been approved for the treatment of certain blood cancers, and other such drugs are in various stages of development.Dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), developed in Letai's laboratory, measures that same balance of pro-death and anti-death proteins to gauge how primed a patient's tumor cells are for apoptosis following exposure to a drug. It thus represents a potentially rapid and unbiased method for screening hundreds of drugs at a time to find those most likely to treat a given patient's tumors.Daniels, Letai and colleagues used DBP to examine a ""library"" of 192 compounds that perturb metabolism--developed in the laboratory of Ludwig Harvard Co-Director Joan Brugge--for their effects on normal and TNBC cells. Eight disrupted cancer cell metabolism but left normal cells unperturbed.Two of these drugs target an enzyme known as NAMPT, which participates in one of three biochemical pathways that produce NAD+, a molecule of critical importance to metabolism. Some sensitive TNBC cell lines, the researchers showed, were dependent on the pathway involving NAMPT. They also ran a DBP screen to find out which specific anti-death proteins the TNBC cells depended on for survival following NAMPT inhibition. They used this information to identify the most effective BH3 mimetic drug to use in combination with NAMPT inhibitors.Using two mouse models of patient-derived TNBC tumors developed in Brugge's lab, the researchers showed that only the mice bearing NAMPT-dependent tumors responded to a combination of the NAMPT inhibitor and the BH3 mimetic. They propose that the NAMPT inhibitor, which proved too toxic as a single agent, might be repurposed as a combination therapy given at lower doses with BH3 mimetics.""What we've shown overall is that we can use DBP to find metabolic regulators of apoptotic priming and specific anti-apoptotic dependencies in tumors--and so identify powerful combinations of metabolic compounds and BH3 mimetics for therapy,"" said Daniels.Letai's laboratory is using DBP to methodically identify other drug combinations for the treatment of a variety of cancers. Because it is a functional drug screen--examining only whether a given drug primes cancer cells for death--DBP does not require prior knowledge of a cancer's inner workings or genetic aberrations.""We don't have to be limited to drug targets that are identifiable only by genetic mutations, which are only a tiny fraction of the true targets out there in the cancer world,"" said Letai.He and his colleagues are also planning a clinical trial using DBP to identify tailored therapies for individual patients diagnosed with myelogenous leukemia.Letai and Daniels note that the regular inter-lab meetings and collaborative model of the Ludwig Harvard Center were critical to the conception, design and conduct of the study.""It was a way of combining a unique set of expertise,"" said Letai. ""I'm good at cell death, not good at metabolism. Veerle is good at metabolism and cell death, but was lacking some key tools to do her initial screening, so we turned to other members of the Ludwig Harvard Center who actually had those tools. We wouldn't have been aware of that expertise if we weren't at the Center because Harvard is a very big place.""Reference: Daniels VW, Zoeller JJ, Gastel N van, et al.

Using a combination of theory and experiment, they were able to show and explain an intricate connection between composition, light-induced lattice dynamics, and stability of the materials. The paper was published in the journal Nature Communications.Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are semiconductor nanocrystals that, thanks to their unique properties, have found a number of applications in optoelectronics, for instance, in lasers and LEDs. PNCs have a much higher photoluminescence quantum yield compared to bulk materials. Moreover, at nanoscale the quantum-confinement can be achieved, which could be used as an additional means of tuning optical properties of such materials. Metal halide perovskites have electronic properties that make the optical properties of nanocrystals made from these materials more tolerant to defects than other semiconducting materials. Assistant Professor at the Skoltech Center for Energy Science and Technology (CEST) Sergey Levchenko and his colleagues used atomistic modelling to explain the results of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, a method that allows to observe lattice dynamics in real time. They studied the coherent lattice vibrational dynamics - how atomic structure of PNCs evolves after excitation with a laser pulse with a duration shorter than the period of vibrational modes -- for hybrid halide PNCs. They found, among other things, that energy transfer between vibrational modes in iodine-based perovskite nanocrystals is much more pronounced than in bromine-based ones due to a difference in interaction between the inorganic framework and the organic moiety in organic-inorganic halide PNCs. ""These results pave the way to a rational control over fundamental properties of such PNCs, including energy transfer upon optical excitation and charge-carrier relaxation, via compositional changes,"" Levchenko says.ReferenceDebnath T et al.

According to the researchers, ""the results obtained in the SNIFFDRONE project (Odor monitoring by drones for environmental purposes) are very positive and represent a significant advance in the field of odor management in the WWTP. The new system will help to take appropriate control actions and therefore improve the management of the plant compared to current practices "" This is how the technicians from the DAM R & D & i Department express themselves, when assessing the work carried out in this European research that ended on October 31st. Specifically, a drone has been developed capable of predicting ""the odor concentration from the readings of chemical sensors and providing measurements that help to locate the sources of origin"", indicate from DAM. The study, carried out together with the IBEC (Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia) and which is part of the ATTRACT initiative (GA 777222, Horizon 2020 program of the European Union), starts from the reality that current odor evaluation methodologies use measurements infrequent olfactometric measurements that do not allow a precise characterization, so an effective monitoring of the plant cannot be carried out. ""The system provides odor concentration maps that help to take appropriate control actions and therefore improve plant management compared to current practices,"" explain the researchers from DAM's R + D + i department.The drone is configured with an electronic nose made up of 21 chemical sensors, plus temperature, humidity and pressure sensors, in a miniature sensor chamber. It also contains a sampling system, GPS positioning, and connects to a base station for signal processing and data analysis in real time. ""The system has been calibrated and validated in real operating conditions through several measurement campaigns at the Molina de Segura WWTP (Murcia). The results obtained allow us to obtain a prototype capable of predicting the intensity of the odor of ambient air samples in real time and simultaneously collecting samples for analysis in the laboratory after the flight, which allows us to calibrate and validate the operation of the system "" , stand out from the Valencian water purification company. ""The developed drone allows, thanks to a combination of chemical sensors and artificial intelligence, to quickly assess the intensity of the odor emitted by a waste management plant in large areas that are sometimes difficult to access. This information is relevant for the plant operators with the ultimate goal of minimizing the impact on neighboring communities "", declares Santi Marco, Head of the Group of Signal and Information Processing for Sensing Systems at IBEC and Professor at the University of Barcelona . For all these reasons, the DAM Innovation department technicians consider that the results of SNIFFDRONE represent a significant advance in the field of odor management in WWTP, since until now ""the odor detection robots had been tested with Single-odor chemical sources in relatively simple controlled scenarios and in most cases using ground-based robots "", they conclude.ReferenceBurgu s J, Esclapez MD, Do ate S, Pastor L, Marco S.

Nanoengineers at the University of California San Diego developed the high-throughput bioprinting technology, which 3D prints with record speed--it can produce a 96-well array of living human tissue samples within 30 minutes. Having the ability to rapidly produce such samples could accelerate high-throughput preclinical drug screening and disease modeling, the researchers said.The process for a pharmaceutical company to develop a new drug can take up to 15 years and cost up to $2.6 billion. It generally begins with screening tens of thousands of drug candidates in test tubes. Successful candidates then get tested in animals, and any that pass this stage move on to clinical trials. With any luck, one of these candidates will make it into the market as an FDA approved drug.The high-throughput 3D bioprinting technology developed at UC San Diego could accelerate the first steps of this process. It would enable drug developers to rapidly build up large quantities of human tissues on which they could test and weed out drug candidates much earlier.""With human tissues, you can get better data--real human data--on how a drug will work,"" said Shaochen Chen, a professor of nanoengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. ""Our technology can create these tissues with high-throughput capability, high reproducibility and high precision. This could really help the pharmaceutical industry quickly identify and focus on the most promising drugs.""The work was published in the journal Biofabrication.The researchers note that while their technology might not eliminate animal testing, it could minimize failures encountered during that stage.""What we are developing here are complex 3D cell culture systems that will more closely mimic actual human tissues, and that can hopefully improve the success rate of drug development,"" said Shangting You, a postdoctoral researcher in Chen's lab and co-first author of the study.The technology rivals other 3D bioprinting methods not only in terms of resolution--it prints lifelike structures with intricate, microscopic features, such as human liver cancer tissues containing blood vessel networks--but also speed. Printing one of these tissue samples takes about 10 seconds with Chen's technology; printing the same sample would take hours with traditional methods. Also, it has the added benefit of automatically printing samples directly in industrial well plates. This means that samples no longer have to be manually transferred one at a time from the printing platform to the well plates for screening.""When you're scaling this up to a 96-well plate, you're talking about a world of difference in time savings--at least 96 hours using a traditional method plus sample transfer time, versus around 30 minutes total with our technology,"" said Chen.Reproducibility is another key feature of this work. The tissues that Chen's technology produces are highly organized structures, so they can be easily replicated for industrial scale screening. It's a different approach than growing organoids for drug screening, explained Chen. ""With organoids, you're mixing different types of cells and letting them to self-organize to form a 3D structure that is not well controlled and can vary from one experiment to another. Thus, they are not reproducible for the same property, structure and function. But with our 3D bioprinting approach, we can specify exactly where to print different cell types, the amounts and the micro-architecture.""","Published: June 9, 2021"

A study published in the journal Epilepsia shows that several of the molecules have antiseizure effects.In people with epilepsy, the nerve cells in the brain become overactive, causing epileptic seizures.""More than 60 million people in the world have epilepsy. A third of them still experience seizures despite taking medication, so there is a pressing need for new types of drugs"", says Nina Ottosson, principal research engineer in the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Link ping University.Nerve impulses are electrical signals that travel along nerves lightning-fast. Epilepsy and several other conditions arise when the nerves transmit signals far too readily, at times when they should be electrically quiet. The nerve impulses are created when small channels, known as ion channels, located in the membranes of the nerve cells allow electrically charged ions to pass through. When sufficiently many ions have entered a cell, an electrical impulse arises, which is transmitted along a long nerve fibre and subsequently stimulates other nerve cells. The ion channels thus play a key role in epilepsy. Many of the drugs currently used to prevent epileptic seizures act by affecting ion channels.Previous work by the research group at Link ping University has shown that resin acids, which are found in the resin from pine and spruce trees, can affect certain types of ion channel. The scientists used these natural resin acids as a starting point to develop new, similar molecules. The long-term goal is to create drugs that prevent epileptic seizures.In the newly published study, the researchers have examined an ion channel that affects how readily a nerve impulse is stimulated. This channel, the potassium ion channel denoted by hKV7.2/7.3, plays an important role in epilepsy. If it is closed, an epileptic seizure can occur, while the seizure can be stopped if the channel opens. One drug, retigabine, can open hKV7.2/7.3, and this was useful in treating severe epilepsy. Retigabine, however, affects other ion channels, in particular channels in the smooth muscle found in, for example, the bladder and blood vessels. This gave undesired effects, such as abnormally low blood pressure and difficulties in urinating. Retigabine was withdrawn a couple of years ago.The researchers have shown in the study that several of the new resin acid molecules can open hKV7.2/7.3. They also investigated whether the molecules affect a closely related ion channel, hKV7.4, which is opened by retigabine and contributes to its undesired effects. Experiments in tissue from rats demonstrated that the new molecules have less effect on smooth muscle, and it is thus less probable that they give undesired effects on blood vessels and the bladder. The new resin acids influence ion channels using a different mechanism than that used by retigabine. The researchers believe that the difference in the mechanism of action is significant for the effects in different tissues.""I believe that the mechanism for how our molecules act on ion channels can be extremely important. We hope that through future collaborations we can take our molecules along the complete pathway to a drug in clinical use"", says Nina Ottosson.Another important question is whether the new molecules can prevent seizures in a whole organism. The researchers thus investigated the effect of the molecules in zebrafish larvae in which epileptic seizures were provoked using a special substance.""Several of the molecules had an antiseizure effect in these experiments when used at the same concentration as retigabine"", says Nina Ottosson.The scientists are now continuing to work towards a detailed understanding of how the resin acid molecules affect ion channels, and how they can be improved such that they can be used as drugs.""Patients and relatives often contact me, and their stories show how pressing the need for effective treatments is. It would be amazing if some of those affected could be helped in the long term by our research. But at the same time, we must realise how incredibly difficult it is to take a molecule along the complete pathway to a new drug. Our results may also contribute to development by stimulating other research"", says Fredrik Elinder, professor in the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at Link ping University.Reference: Ottosson NE, Ejneby MS, Wu X, et al.

When mixed together, the two solutions allow for the API crystals to form a nucleus and grow. With the device, the rates and ratios at which the drug solution is mixed with the anti-solvent can be altered in parallel by scientists, creating multiple conditions for crystal growth. As the crystals grow in different conditions, data on their growth rates, shapes and structures is gathered and imported into a data network.With the data, scientists can more quickly identify the best conditions for manufacturing the most stable crystalline form with a desirable crystal morphology -- a crystal with a plate-like shape instead of a crystal with a rod-like shape -- of an API and scale up the crystallization of stable forms.The UIC researchers led by Meenesh Singh, in collaboration with the Enabling Technologies Consortium, have validated the device using L-histidine, the active ingredient in medications that can potentially treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, allergic diseases and ulcers. The results are reported in Lab on a Chip, a journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry.""The pharmaceutical industry needs a robust screening system that can accurately determine API polymorphs and crystallization kinetics in a shorter time frame. But most parallel and combinatorial screening systems cannot control the synthesis conditions actively, thereby leading to inaccurate results,"" said Singh, UIC assistant professor of chemical engineering at the College of Engineering. ""In this paper, we show a blueprint of such a microfluidic device that has parallel-connected micromixers to trap and grow crystals under multiple conditions simultaneously.""In their study, the researchers found that the device was able to screen polymorphs, morphology and growth rates of L-histidine in eight different conditions. The conditions included variations in molar concentration, percentage of ethanol by volume and supersaturation - important variables that influence crystal growth rate. The overall screening time for L-histidine using the multi-well microfluidic device was about 30 minutes, which is at least eight times shorter than a sequential screening process.The researchers also compared the screening results with a conventional device. They found that the conventional device significantly overestimated the fraction of stable form and showed high uncertainty in measured growth rates.""The multi-well microfluidic device paves the way for next-generation microfluidic devices that are amenable to automation for high-throughput screening of crystalline materials,"" Singh said. Better screening devices can improve API process development efficiency and enable timely and robust drug manufacturing, he said, which could ultimately lead to safer drugs that cost less money.Reference: Coliaie P, Kelkar MS, Langston M, et al.

Researchers had long assumed that lanthanides' toxicity risk was low and therefore safe to implement in a number of high-tech breakthroughs we now take for granted: from OLEDs (organic light-emitting displays)  to medical MRIs and even hybrid vehicles.In recent years, however, some scientists have questioned lanthanides' safety. In matters concerning health care, for example, some MRI patients have attributed a litany of side effects, including long-term kidney damage, to their exposure to the lanthanide gadolinium, a commonly used MRI contrast agent. And in the wake of landmark studies showing that gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) linger in patients' kidneys, bone and brain tissue for months if not years, scientists have searched for clearer evidence linking lanthanide exposure to disease. But what's slowing scientists down is that they don't know where to start - there are 15 lanthanide elements, and the human genome consists of billions of nucleotide sequences. Understanding how lanthanides might trigger gene mutations associated with cancer and other diseases would require a dataset of mammoth proportions that doesn't yet exist. Now, a team of researchers led by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley has compiled the most complete library yet of lanthanides and their potential toxicity - by exposing baker's yeast, aka Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to lanthanide metals. Their findings were recently published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Like us, yeasts are eukaryotes - organisms made up of membrane-bound cells whose chromosomes are neatly packaged in a nucleus. We are made up of tens of trillions of cells; yeasts are just one cell. ""Yeast is the smallest eukaryote - but their thousands of genes represent a great approximation to the gene variants in humans,"" said senior author Rebecca Abergel, who holds titles of faculty scientist in the Chemical Sciences Division at Berkeley Lab, where she heads the BioActinide Chemistry Group, and assistant professor of nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley. ""What's cool about this study is that it was done with a library of yeast genes, and we could screen the whole genome of the yeast and compare how a normal gene strain versus a gene-deletion strain was actually affected by lanthanide exposure."" In an investigation spanning nearly a decade, Abergel and her team relied on a barcoded library of the baker's yeast genome to screen which cellular functions were disrupted by lanthanides. The library was developed in the early 2000s as part of the Yeast Deletion Project, a consortium of researchers across the U.S. and Canada, to establish relationships between genes and chemical exposures. Co-senior author Christopher Vulpe, a professor of physiological sciences at the University of Florida, is one of the early adopters of this library for functional profiling of various toxicants. After testing over 4,000 genes against 13 of the 15 lanthanide metals (the study excluded cerium and promethium), the researchers found that lanthanides interrupt the cell-signaling pathways that keep our bodies functioning - such as our skeletal and neurological processes - by hijacking calcium-binding sites in two key cellular activities: endocytosis, the process that governs how nutrients are imported inside the cells, and the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) machinery, which sorts proteins and helps cells shuttle in critical nutrients like calcium. ""This study could point us to understanding which lanthanide metals are more toxic than others, and whether someone is more genetically predisposed to lanthanide toxicity,"" Abergel said. Abergel's investigation of baker's yeast as a genomic model for human disease began in 2012, when she was awarded a Berkeley Lab LDRD (Laboratory Directed Research and Development) Award for her study titled ""Global transcriptome, deletome and proteome profiling of yeast exposed to radioactive metal ions: a tool to distinguish radiation-induced damage from chemical toxicity."" Her interest in public health then led to the development of an anti-radiation-poisoning pill, an anti-gadolinium-toxicity pill for MRI patients, and advances in cancer therapies and medical imaging. As a follow-up to the current study, she and her research team are now studying the toxicity mechanisms of each specific metal, beginning with gadolinium. They also hope to investigate in animal models how cellular abnormalities caused by lanthanide exposure are sustained over time - and possibly even across generations. ""This was a massive study showing all the potential pathways affected by lanthanide metal exposure - but we're just scratching the surface of a huge dataset"" and there's much more work to be done, she said.ReferencePallares RM, Faulkner D, An DD, et al.

It is characterized by the formation of scar tissue due to damage or an unchecked immune response, and it can cause mild to severe difficulty breathing and oxygen deprivation. Fibrosis is currently thought to be mostly irreversible, as current drug treatments are only mildly effective at managing symptoms and generally cause significant side effects.Mesenchymal stromal cells, or MSCs, are multipotent and self-renewing, much like stem cells, and they have been studied for their potential to treat conditions like fibrosis.""While previous studies tested the therapeutic effects of MSCs - which are known to suppress inflammation and to adapt to different tissue environments - their efficacy has so far been limited to early phases of the disease, when inflammation levels are high and scar tissue is still forming"" said Jae-Won Shin, UIC assistant professor of pharmacology and bioengineering at the College of Medicine and corresponding author of the study. ""Our approach was to optimize MSC-based therapeutics to work after inflammation has been reduced, which is when most people are diagnosed with fibrosis.""As described in a new paper published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the UIC researchers engineered a thin microgel that, when designed in a specific way, can boost the therapeutic potential of MSCs to degrade scar tissue and regenerate healthy tissue in mouse models of fibrosis.Shin and his colleagues engineered the microgel, which is as soft as healthy lung tissue, and incorporated a small protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Also known as TNF-alpha, this protein acts as an inflammatory signal that encourages MSCs to synthesize collagenase. Collagenase is an enzyme that degrades excess collagen in fibrotic tissues and promotes the restoration of damaged tissues.To optimize the MSCs with the microgel, the UIC researchers designed a microfluidic device to encapsulate individual cells rapidly and consistently in the thin gel.""We miniaturized down to the small scale, the individual cell, which is important for delivery of the therapeutic into the tiny airways of the lungs,"" said study first author Sing-Wan Wong, a UIC postdoctoral research associate in the department of pharmacology and regenerative medicine.In models of fibrotic injury, the UIC researchers observed reduced indicators of scaring and increased indicators of healthy lung tissue, such as normal collagen levels and architecture, only among the mice treated with MSCs coated in their TNF-alpha-incorporated gel via single cell encapsulation.""This is really one of the first scientific demonstrations that collagen levels can be normalized well after fibrotic injury, and that the cell environment, not just the cells themselves, can be designed at the single-cell level in a precise manner,"" Shin said.

While mouse studies have identified potential treatments, these drugs have typically done very poorly in human trials. Researchers at Boston Children's Hospital, working in collaboration with Pfizer, now report a high-throughput target and drug discovery platform using motor neurons made from ALS patients. Using the platform, they confirmed two known targets and identified an existing class of drugs -- agonists to the dopamine D2 receptor -- as potential novel treatments.The researchers, led by Clifford Woolf, MD, PhD, director of the F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children's, and first authors Xuan Huang, PhD, and Kasper Roet, PhD, in Woolf's lab, describe the platform and their findings June 8 in the journal Cell Reports.To create the motor neurons used for drug screening, the team used induced pluripotent stem cells, made by the lab of Kevin Eggan at Harvard University from tissue samples of patients with ALS who carried the SOD1(A4V) mutation. The Woolf lab also developed a high-throughput, live-cell imaging technology to measure the motor neurons' hyperexcitability -- the tendency to ""fire"" excessively -- before and after exposure to candidate drugs. Woolf and colleagues previously showed that human motor neurons with ALS mutations are more excitable than normal motor neurons.""This hyperexcitability makes the motor neurons more susceptible to degeneration and ultimately death,"" says Woolf. ""Our imaging platform is able to rapidly evaluate hyperactivity in 384-well plates of motor neurons and test the cells' response to thousands of different drugs.""The technology, called GCaMP imaging, had not been used on a mass scale before for ALS. GCaMP is a fluorescent reporter of calcium levels in the neurons, an indicator of how frequently the neurons are firing action potentials.In all, the researchers screened a library of 2,900 drugs from Pfizer with known, annotated actions. After three rounds of screening, they found 67 compounds that reduced the hyperexcitability of the patient-derived motor neurons, without causing toxicity.""By doing a screen aimed at reversing the ALS motor neuron disease phenotype -- namely, hyperexcitability -- we were able to discover new targets and disease mechanisms and confirm others in an unbiased way,"" says Woolf.Further investigations homed in on 13 potential drug targets with the greatest effects, seven of which belonged to two classes (AMPA receptors and Kv7 potassium channels) already known to be associated with ALS hyperexcitability. Kv7 channel-opening drugs were found to decrease motor neuron hyperexcitability in ALS in a recent clinical trial. QurAlis, a company co-founded by Woolf, Eggan, and Roet, is developing these drugs as therapies for ALS.The current study also found a promising new class of candidate drugs, agonists to the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2). These receptors' role in motor neuron hyperexcitability had not previously been recognized. Some DRD2 agonists (bromocriptine, sumanirole) are commercially available, opening the possibility of using them in patients with ALS.""Our results show that neuronal excitability screens are a powerful platform for discovery of relevant, druggable targets,"" says Woolf. ""We believe it can be applied to other neurological diseases that involve neuronal excitability, such as epilepsy and other neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.""Woolf is continuing to use human neuron screening platforms to identify novel targets for treating pain and neuropathy.""One of the most difficult challengers in drug discovery is identifying a target that has a key role in the disease process,"" he says.

Since the trial launched in March 2020, more than 6800 healthcare workers have enrolled across 36 sites in Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.BCG was originally developed 100 years ago to prevent tuberculosis. Now, the BRACE randomised controlled clinical trial is working to determine if the BCG vaccine reduces the incidence of symptomatic and severe COVID-19 in healthcare workers. It is also investigating whether BCG vaccine reduces the impact of other respiratory illnesses and allergic diseases.Professor Nigel Curtis, Head of the Infectious Diseases Research Group at MCRI, Professor of Paediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Melbourne and BRACE Chief Principal Investigator, said the big story of 2021 was the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants.""With the emergence of new variants - for which vaccine-induced and natural immune responses may not be as effective - there is concern that herd immunity may be undermined. If this happens, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread and cause disease,"" he said.""We have been lucky enough to receive this additional funding for the BRACE COVID-19-Specific vaccine sub-study (BCOS) to investigate biomarkers of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection induced by natural infection and COVID-specific vaccination.""Associate Professor Julio Croda, the BRACE trial's Brazil Principal Investigator, said 2400 healthcare workers across three trial sites in Brazil were being actively followed up and tested for COVID-19 as part of the trial.""This subset of participants provides a unique opportunity to understand the risks and determinants of susceptibility to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly the P.1 variant. This research is critical to designing effective approaches to help protect people,"" he said.With COVID-19-specific vaccines now available to healthcare workers, BCOS will also look at whether BCG vaccine improves the immune response to Pfizer, AstraZeneca and CoronaVac vaccines.Dr Nicole Messina, the Biosample and Laboratory Lead on the BRACE trial said: ""We are recruiting existing BRACE trial participants in Victoria, South Australia and Brazil to assess whether those who had the BCG vaccine have a better or more prolonged immune response to their COVID-19-specific vaccine.""Professor Kathryn North AM, MCRI Director, said: ""It's incredibly exciting work and demonstrates how MCRI responded to the pandemic. A deeper understanding of immune responses to COVID-19-specific vaccines will be important to the global effort to contain this pandemic.""Participant follow-up continues every three months with questionnaires and blood collection, as well as ongoing data collection via phone calls and the trial's custom-built smartphone app, powered by WeGuide.The BRACE trial has received philanthropic funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Sarah and Lachlan Murdoch, Minderoo Foundation, The Royal Children's Hospital Foundation, South Australian government, NAB Foundation, The Calvert Jones Foundation, UHG Foundation, Modara Pines Charitable Foundation, Health Services Union NSW, Peter Sowerby Foundation, South Australia Ministry of Health, Epworth Health, Swiss National Science Foundation and individual donors.This article has been republished from the following materials.

If the mother's body cannot properly adapt to the growing baby this leads to major and common issues including fetal growth restriction, fetal over-growth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia - a life-threatening high blood pressure in the mother.Many of these complications lead to difficult labours for women with more medical intervention and lifelong issues for the baby including diabetes, heart issues and obesity.Pregnancy disorders are usually diagnosed during the second or third trimester of gestation when they have often already had a serious impact on the health of the mother and baby. The current methods to diagnose pregnancy disorders are not sensitive or reliable enough to identify all at risk pregnancies.Now scientists have found a way to test hormone levels in the placenta to predict which women will have serious pregnancy complications.Dr Amanda N. Sferruzzi-Perri, a Fellow of St John's College, University of Cambridge, runs a lab in the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience and is the lead author of a new paper published in Nature Communications Biology.Dr Sferruzzi-Perri said: ""The female body is remarkable and from the moment of conception, a pregnant woman's body needs to change nearly every single organ system so the fetus can develop. The fetus also needs nutrients and oxygen to grow so the mother has to change her metabolism and vascular system so she can provide them.""We know that the placenta drives many of the changes in a women's body during pregnancy and our study found hormonal biomarkers from the placenta could indicate which women would have pregnancy complications. We found that these biomarkers are present from the first trimester of pregnancy, normally women are only diagnosed with complications during the second or third trimester when disorders may already have had serious consequences for the health of the mother and her developing baby.""This is a highly important finding given that pregnancy disorders affect around one in ten pregnant women and are often diagnosed too late when the complications are already wreaking havoc on the mother's body and the fetal development.""The placenta is a complex biological organ. It forms and grows from the fertilised egg, and attaches to the wall of the uterus. It allows nutrients and oxygen to flow from mother to baby, and removes fetal waste products. Despite its importance, the placenta is a very understood organ and is notoriously difficult to study in pregnant women. But its ability to function properly is vital as it impacts on pregnancy outcomes and the lifelong health of mother and child.The placenta develops during pregnancy and connects the developing baby to the mother. It serves as the lungs, kidneys, gut and liver for growing babies and carries oxygen and nutrients to the fetus whilst secreting hormones and discarding waste.Using mouse models, researchers looked at the proteins made by the placenta and compared them to blood samples from women who had uneventful pregnancies and those who developed gestational diabetes. The team developed new methods to isolate and study the endocrine cells in the mouse placenta because these cells are responsible for secreting hormones during pregnancy. They profiled the placenta to identify the hormones that are secreted to create a comprehensive map of proteins in the mysterious organ.The mouse model map of hormonal proteins from the placenta was then compared with datasets from studies of the human placenta and pregnancy outcomes and researchers discovered a lot of biological overlap.Dr Sferruzzi-Perri said: ""We found that around a third of the proteins we identified changed in women during pregnancies with disorders. Using a small study to test if these placental proteins will have some clinical value, we also discovered that abnormal levels of hormones were present in the mother's blood as early as the first trimester - week 12 of gestation - in women who developed gestational diabetes, a pregnancy complication usually diagnosed at 24-28 weeks.""We also identified several specific transcription factors - proteins within the cell that turn on or off genes - that are likely to govern the production of placental hormones which have important implications for understanding how we may improve pregnancy outcomes.""The scientists explored whether these genetic biomarkers were detectable during pregnancy and used a study that tracked pregnancy outcomes in women at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. They found that blood samples showed these biomarkers in early pregnancy which could lead to earlier diagnosis of complications allowing treatment to begin more quickly.Dr Claire Meek, a diabetes in pregnancy physician and researcher at Addenbrooke's, said: ""This pregnancy-induced form of diabetes causes accelerated growth of the baby and complications at the time of delivery. Unfortunately, some women already have signs of a big baby at the time of diagnosis at 28 weeks. This new test might be able to identify gestational diabetes earlier in pregnancy, providing opportunities to prevent the disease, or to protect mums and babies from the most harmful complications.""Dr Sferruzzi-Perri said: ""This work provides new hope that a better understanding of the placenta will result in safer, healthier pregnancies for mothers and babies. Our team is now working to assess if these discoveries could improve clinical care in future, either through earlier diagnosis or to provide new opportunities to treat these pregnancy complications by targeting the placenta.""Reference: Napso T, Zhao X, Lligo a MI, et al.

Nearly every living organism   from animals to plants as well as several microorganisms and fungi   has an internal body clock, or a circadian rhythm.Yet, scientists have been perplexed out how these genes operate. Now,  Virginia Tech scientists have taken a step closer to an answer thanks to the DNA of a mouse, a petri dish, and much patience. In a new study published in the journal Genes & Development, Shihoko Kojima, an assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, part of the Virginia Tech College of Science, and a researcher with the Fralin Life Sciences Institute, and her team has identified a novel gene, Per2AS, that controls the sleep/wake cycle in mice. Per2AS appears to be a new type of gene, known as a non-coding gene. Unlike most other genes, Per2AS is not translated from RNA into a subsequent protein, thus making its function unclear until now.(Circadian rhythms derives from the Latin circa diem, or  around a day. )The study has been in the works for several years. Nine, exactly. Why the long tenure? Well, it s complicated. Literally.  It was difficult to find out what its job is because Per2AS was a noncoding gene,  Kojima said.  Scientists have accumulated a lot of knowledge and tools to figure out the function of traditional genes. However, these tools cannot be readily applicable to nontraditional genes, such as Per2AS, because most tools are made based on the unique characteristics common to traditional genes. According to Kojima, when Human Genome Project started some 30 years ago, scientists then thought most of our genome is made out of traditional genes, because these genes were believed to control unique traits that we all have   eye and hair color, height and weight, personality. That didn t turn out to be true. It turned out that only 2 percent of our genome is used for traditional genes and the rest appears to be nontraditional genes. There has been a hot debate whether these nontraditional genes are also important for our traits   some say it is DNA junk, while others say they have important functions,  she said.Growing evidence suggests that at least some nontraditional genes are important for various biological processes, such as neuronal activities, immune functions, and cell differentiation, as well as disease development including cancer, neurodegeneration, and congenital genetic diseases. The big takeaway: A nontraditional gene can have functions to control our body clock and therefore is important for our genome to have. In other words, nontraditional genes are as vital as their more basic counterparts. People also have an equivalent gene,  Kojima said.  However, it is unclear at this point whether the human version has the same function(s) as the mouse version. Most organisms living on the Earth have a circadian clock because this is an internal timing system important to adapt to the daily environmental changes caused by the Earth s rotation. The circadian clock of human is not much different from that of rodents or insects. What s next? Kojima wants to study the gene in a live mouse model. Not just from a petri dish.  We also want to know if this gene is in many other organisms. If so, that would mean this gene is very important. Reference: Mosig RA, Castaneda AN, Deslauriers JC, et al.

The larger genome comprises an accumulation of transposable elements   moving DNA sequences   providing new insights on the relationship between social and genome evolution. The research is published in PNAS.1 If an organism is eusocial, it demonstrates advanced social behaviors including: living together in groups, cooperating to take care of offspring, division of labor and overlap of generations such that younger populations can assist older generations. It is a phenomenon that is well recognized and studied in certain species of insects, such as ants.Rubenstein and team serendipitously discovered that the shrimp possess another interesting characteristic: the size of their genome varies dramatically and appears to be related to their social organization. This contradicts what is known about eusociality in the insect world. Genomic studies have demonstrated that eusocial insects typically have smaller genomes than their less-social relatives.

If scientists can understand the molecular mechanisms of such functions, then it is possible to detect the severe dysfunction which can lead to illness. At a molecular level, this can be achieved with fluorescent markers that are specifically incorporated into the respective biomolecules. In the past, this has been achieved by incorporating a marker in the bio-molecule by completely rebuilding it from the beginning, necessitating a large number of steps. Unfortunately, this approach not only takes a lot of time and resources, but also produces unwanted waste products. Researchers at the Universities of G ttingen and Edinburgh have now been able to show that a non-toxic complex of the common metal manganese makes it possible to conveniently label a class of special bio-molecules known as peptides right at the last minute of their synthesis. This means the mechanism of action of these labelled peptides can be investigated efficiently. The results were published in the journal Nature Communications.The research group developed the selective labelling of peptides and natural biological products at a late point in the series of steps necessary for synthesis by activating carbon-hydrogen bonds in tryptophan residues. This experimentally simple strategy makes it possible to efficiently access novel fluorescent pep-tides that are highly sensitive to their biological environment. This enabled the team to create a highly sensitive ""rotor"" with the ability to show changes in the composition of membranes of immune cells. Its fluorescence is dependent on the viscosity of the cell membrane. The researchers observed radiant fluorescence in the presence of cholesterol in the cell membrane. In this way, the rotor can be used to screen certain molecules in cells that are important for the adaptive immune system to fight infections and cancer.""The project demonstrates the power of combining chemical, biological and medical research, which allows the direct observation of cell-specific events,"" says project leader Professor Lutz Ackermann from G ttin-gen University.

The study highlights two important points,A.New insights in pathogenesis could be gained by culturing cells in conditions closer to physiological conditions, andB.A better idea of therapeutic response may be obtained by screening experimental agents in cancer cells grown in a microenvironment similar to actual disease setting.Culturing cells in their native conditions has the potential to identify therapy, either single agent or combination, which would have otherwise been considered ineffective under the currently used artificial environment. Additionally, novel targets may also be identified under native conditions in addition to refining our existing knowledge of tumor biology. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in perspective the exhaustive work of manually concurrently culturing cells in standard and native conditions, and conducting the diverse interrogations, limited this study to understanding of a few cell lines, mechanisms and drugs. Future studies incorporating high-throughput culturing and screening methods, and the testing of other hypotheses and timepoints will help to reveal the scope of generalizability of these findings.""Reference: Bhattacharya B, Huang DQ, Low SHH, et al.

Glial cells, and in particular the ones called oligodendrocyte progenitors, are highly responsive to external signals and injuries. They can detect changes in the nervous system and form new myelin, which wraps around nerves and provides metabolic support and accurate transmission of electrical signals. As we age, however, less myelin is formed in response to external signals, and this progressive decline has been linked to the age-related cognitive and motor deficits detected in older people in the general population. Impaired myelin formation also has been reported in older individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis or Alzheimer s and identified as one of the causes of their progressive clinical deterioration.A new study from the Neuroscience Initiative team at the Advanced Science Research Center at The Graduate Center, CUNY (CUNY ASRC) has identified a molecule called ten-eleven-translocation 1 (TET1) as a necessary component of myelin repair. The research, published today in Nature Communications, shows that TET1 modifies the DNA in specific glial cells in adult brains so they can form new myelin in response to injury. We designed experiments to identify molecules that could affect brain rejuvenation,  said Sarah Moyon, Ph.D., a research assistant professor with the CUNY ASRC Neuroscience Initiative and the study s lead author.  We found that TET1 levels progressively decline in older mice, and with that, DNA can no longer be properly modified to guarantee the formation of functional myelin. Combining whole-genome sequencing bioinformatics, the authors showed that the DNA modifications induced by TET1 in young adult mice were essential to promote a healthy dialogue among cells in the central nervous system and for guaranteeing proper function. The authors also demonstrated that young adult mice with a genetic modification of TET1 in the myelin-forming glial cells were not capable of producing functional myelin, and therefore behaved like older mice. This newly identified age-related decline in TET1 may account for the inability of older individuals to form new myelin,  said Patrizia Casaccia, founding director of the CUNY ASRC Neuroscience Initiative, a professor of Biology and Biochemistry at The Graduate Center, CUNY, and the study s primary investigator.  I believe that studying the effect of aging in glial cells in normal conditions and in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases will ultimately help us design better therapeutic strategies to slow the progression of devastating diseases like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer s. The discovery also could have important implications for molecular rejuvenation of aging brains in healthy individuals, said the researchers. Future studies aimed at increasing TET1 levels in older mice are underway to define whether the molecule could rescue new myelin formation and favor proper neuro-glial communication. The research team s long-term goal is to promote recovery of cognitive and motor functions in older people and in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.Reference: Moyon S, Frawley R, Marechal D, et al.

The findings are part of the large research project Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD), which is a prospective, long-term study looking at outcomes in pregnant women with epilepsy and their children. The study was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.This study reports findings from 382 children (292 children born to women with epilepsy and 90 born to healthy women) who were assessed for language development at age 2. The researchers also compared developmental scores with third trimester blood levels of antiseizure medication in these children.Results suggest that children born to healthy women and those born to women with epilepsy do not show significant differences in language development scores at age 2. Neither was language development linked to third trimester blood levels of epilepsy medications. Most women with epilepsy in the study were taking lamotrigine and/or levetiracetam.However, the study did find that those children born to mothers with the very highest levels of antiseizure medication in the blood during the third trimester did have somewhat lower scores on tests in the motor and general adaptive domains, which refer to skills related to self-care, such as feeding.The children in this study will continue to be followed and will participate in additional cognitive tests through age 6.

Each group contained 20 clones. The 20 differed from one another genetically, but the same clones were included in each of the 98 groups, which lived in separate enclosures under different environmental conditions.Wice and Saltz found the same clones occupied the same social positions in each enclosed ""world,"" regardless of variation in living conditions.""Social structure varies tremendously across the animal world, and the big question we're interested in is 'How did this variation evolve?'"" said Saltz, associate professor of biosciences at Rice. ""For evolution to occur, social structure must be heritable, and we showed that it is.""Wice, a Ph.D. student in Saltz's lab, said even though genetic variation explained just part the variation in flies' social network positions, the heritability estimates that he and Saltz discovered are enough to fuel evolutionary change.""For us to know whether or not the structure of social groups and the structure of networks will evolve over time, we have to know the genetic basis of how individuals are nested within their social networks and we also have to know how natural selection acts on social group structure,"" Wice said. ""We studied both of those things simultaneously in this experiment, which hadn't been done before.""Wice said previous research had shown that the structure of social networks can evolve by natural selection, but few genetic components of social network structure had been described.""We kind of integrated those things simultaneously to see how the structure of social groups will evolve and how it could potentially respond to selection,"" Wice said.Wice said the study found the amount of variation in social position that was explained by genetics ""was on the order of like 2.4% to 16.6%."" And given that virtually all living creatures exhibit some form of social organization, the researchers' findings could apply to species as varied as humans and bacteria, Wice said.Some studies have explored whether human popularity might also be partly explained by genetics, Saltz said. But she added it is essentially impossible to design an empirical test.""The best way to do that would be to get identical twins, and 'Truman Show' them,"" she said, referring to the 1998 film in which the title character unwittingly lives in a controlled environment as part of a reality TV show. ""You'd put one twin in one Truman Show bubble and the other twin in the other Truman Show bubble, and then see if they end up having the same identical-twin friends.""In essence, that describes the experiment she and Wice conducted with the flies.""Any two genotypes in our sample are as closely related genetically as two randomly chosen people,"" Wice said. ""But we can essentially make photocopies of each one of the flies and test, basically, the identical twins over and over.""And because Wice gathered data on social interactions by videotaping flies in each enclosure, running the experiment was a lot like producing 98 simultaneous Truman Shows, but ""with 20 Trumans in each show,"" Wice said.Positions within social networks were measured in five ways based on thousands of interactions between flies that were tallied and cataloged by computer software that ""watched"" dozens of hours of video of the 98 groups. Though the word ""popularity"" doesn't appear in the paper, Saltz said it's apt because some of the key parameters measured were equivalent to ""how many friends you have and whether your friends are friends with each other or not.""Remarkably, Wice and Saltz found that social position within networks remained the same, even when they varied the environment by changing the quality of food in the enclosures. In some, food contained more protein and in others more carbohydrates. In other instances, flies had fewer available calories. In all, there were five types of food, and roughly 20 groups of flies living on each type.""Our findings show that we expect social structure to evolve differently in different nutritional environments,"" Wice said. ""That's significant, but further research is needed to determine what kind of changes arise from nutritional differences.""Ultimately, Wice and Saltz would like to know more about the ways that nutrition, aggressive behavior and other factors influence the evolution of social structure.""What creates social structure?"" Saltz said. ""Group structures are inherently emergent properties of many different individuals, and there must be some underlying principles that shape the evolution of those structures.""The fact that an individual's position within a social network is dependent on the behavior of other individuals complicates that study of evolutionary social structure, Wice said, noting that some of the tools used in their analysis did not exist when Wice began Ph.D. studies five years ago.""It's not independent data, and that violates a lot of statistical tests and assumptions,"" Wice said. ""The tools are improving all the time, and it wouldn't surprise me if new tools came out in the next five years that will allow us and learn even more from the data we're collecting today.""Reference: Wice EW, Saltz JB.

This could potentially be used to provide individually-tailored media content -- and perhaps even to enlighten us about ourselves.We have become accustomed to online algorithms trying to guess our preferences for everything from movies and music to news and shopping. This is based not only on what we have searched for, looked at, or listened to, but also on how these activities compare to others. Collaborative filtering, as the technique is called, uses hidden patterns in our behavior and the behavior of others to predict which things we may find interesting or appealing.But what if the algorithms could use responses from our brain rather than just our behavior? It may sound a bit like science fiction, but a project combining computer science and cognitive neuroscience showed that brain-based collaborative filtering is indeed possible. By using an algorithm to match an individual's pattern of brain responses with those of others, researchers from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Helsinki were able to predict a person's attraction to a not-yet-seen face.Previously the researchers had placed EEG electrodes onto the heads of study participants and showed them images of various faces, and thereby demonstrated that machine learning can use electrical activity from the brain to detect which faces the subjects found most attractive.""Through comparing the brain activity of others, we've now also found it possible to predict faces each participant would find appealing prior to seeing them. In this way, we can make reliable recommendations for users - just as streaming services suggest new films or series based on the history of the users,"" explains senior author Dr. Tuukka Ruotsalo of the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science.","Published: June 8, 2021"

Much like a coin toss, however, the fate of the transplanted stem cells is unpredictable. They may choose self-renewal, grow into a different kind of tissue, or die.Spermatogonial stem cells follow the same stochastic fate of unpredictability in outcomes. But a group of fertility scientists led by Hiroshima University's Yoshiaki Nakamura discovered a new method that has favorably flipped the odds and successfully reversed male infertility in mice -- showing great promise for future applications in regenerating human sperm after cancer treatment and repopulating threatened and endangered species. Results of their study are published in the journal Cell Stem Cell.""Transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells promises a wealth of applications such as the treatment of infertility in men and the preservation of genetic diversity. Yet, currently, its inefficiency rules out the practical application of this technology,"" Nakamura, assistant professor at the HU Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life, said.""Our knowledge about the fate behavior of individual spermatogonial stem cells and their progenies following transplantation remains poorly developed, limiting the potential to develop new strategies to increase the currently low transplantation efficiencies,"" he added.Taking an up-close look at single-cell resolution, the international team of Japanese and British scientists tracked the fate of transplanted spermatogonial stem cells in mice. They implanted normal mouse sperm stem cells in infertile mice and found that only a tiny fraction repopulates in the long-term as working spermatogonia and the rest change into a different type of cell -- a process called differentiation -- or cease to carry out its function and die.Using these insights, they developed a new method that can artificially tune the fate of the sperm stem cells to increase the likelihood of repopulation to a level where fertility is restored. They briefly introduced a retinoic acid synthesis inhibitor after transplantation, which temporarily prevented the donor sperm stem cells from undergoing differentiation. The chemical inhibitor helped orchestrate an outcome where the stem cells choose a fate of self-renewal.""We demonstrated that repopulation efficiency of transplanted spermatogonial stem cells increased by tuning their stochastic fate,"" Nakamura said, adding that the next step for their research is to confirm if their new strategy will also work for livestock and eventually humans.""My final objective is to apply spermatogonial stem cell transplantation for the fertility of male individuals with cancer after chemotherapy or the preservation of genetic diversity in farm animals and rare or endangered wild animals,"" he said.Reference: Nakamura Y, J rg DJ, Kon Y, et al.

Unlike the majority of countries worldwide, in the UK 16-year-old students can decide to stop their maths education. This situation allowed the team to examine whether this specific lack of maths education in students coming from a similar environment could impact brain development and cognition.The study found that students who didn't study maths had a lower amount of a crucial chemical for brain plasticity (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) in a key brain region involved in many important cognitive functions, including reasoning, problem solving, maths, memory and learning. Based on the amount of brain chemical found in each student, researchers were able to discriminate between adolescents who studied or did not study maths, independent of their cognitive abilities. Moreover, the amount of this brain chemical successfully predicted changes in mathematical attainment score around 19 months later. Notably, the researchers did not find differences in the brain chemical before the adolescents stopped studying maths.Roi Cohen Kadosh, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Oxford, led the study. He said: ""Maths skills are associated with a range of benefits, including employment, socioeconomic status, and mental and physical health. Adolescence is an important period in life that is associated with important brain and cognitive changes. Sadly, the opportunity to stop studying maths at this age seems to lead to a gap between adolescents who stop their maths education compared to those who continue it. Our study provides a new level of biological understanding of the impact of education on the developing brain and the mutual effect between biology and education.""It is not yet known how this disparity, or its long-term implications, can be prevented. Not every adolescent enjoys maths so we need to investigate possible alternatives, such as training in logic and reasoning that engage the same brain area as maths.""Professor Cohen Kadosh added, ""While we started this line of research before COVID-19, I also wonder how the reduced access to education in general, and maths in particular (or lack of it due to the pandemic) impacts the brain and cognitive development of children and adolescents. While we are still unaware of the long-term influence of this interruption, our study provides an important understanding of how a lack of a single component in education, maths, can impact brain and behaviour.""Reference: Zacharopoulos G, Sella F, Kadosh RC.

The substance can cause severe symptoms in humans and animals. Small amounts of the toxin were detected in the raw milk of cows that grazed in a pasture exposed to sycamore maple. The team calls for further investigations to realistically assess the potential dangers.High concentrations of hypoglycin A can be found in unripe akee and lychee fruit and in the seeds and seedlings of various maple trees. These include, for example, the sycamore maple, which is common throughout Europe. The toxin can cause severe illness in humans. In 2017, a team of researchers in India was able to prove that the toxin was responsible for the sudden death of several hundred children in the country who had previously eaten large quantities of lychee. ""The substance interferes with the body s energy metabolism. One typical symptom in humans is very low blood sugar levels,"" says Professor Annette Zeyner from the Institute of Agricultural and Nutritional Sciences at MLU. In 2013, hypoglycin A from maple trees was also found to cause atypical myopathy in horses - a puzzling disease that is often fatal for animals kept on a pasture. Zeyner and her team joined forces with Dr J rg Ziegler from IPB to discover whether hypoglycin A could also be detected in the raw milk of cows. ""Maple trees are widespread and grazing cows is a common practice. Thus, it seemed logical that cows - like horses - would eat the seeds or seedlings of maple trees, thereby ingesting the toxins,"" explains Zeyner. For the new study, the team examined samples from dairy farmers in northern Germany. Only milk provided directly from the farms was analysed. ""We did not analyse samples from individual cows; instead, we sampled the milk from several cows which was stored in collection tanks,"" says Zeyner. The samples were analysed using a special form of mass spectrometry which can detect even tiny amounts of a substance. The result: ""We detected hypoglycin A only in two samples of raw milk from the one of the farms whose pasture contained a single maple tree,"" says Zeyner. The concentration of the substance was 17 and 69 micrograms per litre of milk. ""These are low and widely varying concentrations. But considering that there was only one tree in the pasture and the sample came from a collection tank, it was surprising that we were able to detect anything at all,"" explains Zeyner. The toxin could not be detected in any of the other samples. ""Our study is the first to show that cows appear to ingest parts of the sycamore maple containing the toxin, which is then transferred to their milk. Many other questions arise from this finding,"" says the researcher in summary. It is still unclear, for example, how much toxin the cows have to ingest for there to be detectable traces in their milk. Follow-up studies will be needed to determine whether the substance is destroyed when the milk is processed or even whether this low concentration is a cause for concern, and how it can be prevented.

Researchers will use PROTEAN-CR to understand key biological mechanisms of cancer as well as to suggest novel cancer therapies. Pilot projects will include peptide-based cancer vaccination and analysis of mutations in the context of T-cell based immunotherapy.The three-year, $1.2 million grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) will advance Kavraki's ongoing collaboration with co-investigator Gregory Lizee at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.In cancer, proteins can suffer modifications that favor the maintenance and proliferation of malignant cells. One way to fight cancer is using ligands with anti-tumor properties to inhibit these proteins. But the discovery of molecules with anticancer properties isn't easy. There are hundreds of thousands of different proteins and possible ligands to assess. Proteins and ligands can assume different three-dimensional conformations, and even the same protein can have multiple mutations; both these issues affect protein-ligand binding. Kavraki said PROTEAN-CR is needed because of these challenges and a persistent knowledge gap with structural analyses of protein-ligand interactions.Kavraki, Rice's Noah Harding Professor of Computer Science, a professor of bioengineering, mechanical engineering and electrical and computer engineering, and director of the Ken Kennedy Institute, said the long-term goal of the U01 grant is to enable broad structural analysis of protein-ligand interactions so cancer researchers can mix, match and test small anti-tumor molecules for personalized cancer therapies.PROTEAN-CR will also allow researchers to manipulate the 3D structures of known molecules and their possible forms, making it easier for researchers to screen possible protein-ligand complexes and predict how they will bind to and destroy tumor cells. To assess the best binding modes, machine learning methods will be used to create new scoring functions. PROTEAN-CR also will be linked to publicly available biological databases to retrieve updated information on protein mutations and modifications.Kavraki said her unified data science-inspired approach will accelerate cancer research by complementing wet-lab and clinical studies. Additional collaborators include Dinler Antunes at the University of Houston and Jin Wang at Baylor College of Medicine.""There is a real gap in incorporating large-scale structural analysis to understand the role of proteins and protein-ligand interactions in complex diseases such as cancer,"" Kavraki said. ""Our work will fill this gap and complement the tools that are currently in development through NCI's informatics program.""Kavraki's lab has already developed some PROTEAN-CR core functions through a prototype web server being tested by MD Anderson researchers for drug discovery and immunotherapy applications.

Understanding the epidemiology of this microorganism can help identify its origin, distribution, causes, and risk factors. Now, ITQB NOVA researchers led by Maria Miragaia showed evidence that Staphylococcus saprophyticus can originate in food, namely in the meat-production chain.Europe is the world's second-biggest producer of pork, the most favored meat type in these countries. One of the contaminants of that meat is S. saprophyticus, which is found also in the environment, the gut and rectal flora of pigs, and in the human gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and perineum. In the study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, by using a combination of phenotypic, genomic, and pan-genome wide association approaches, researchers identified two different lineages (G and S) of S. saprophyticus. The lineage G, from food origin and transmitted to humans by contact with food products, and lineage S, from human origin. Both are associated with disease and may be transmitted directly or indirectly between persons within the community, showing not only a local but an extensive geographic distribution. In order to understand if these bacteria causing urinary tract infections could be related to the ones in pork, the research group looked at S. saprophyticus from a slaughterhouse and compared them to those causing human urinary tract infections. The team analysed bacteria collected from UTI worldwide over 20 years, and from UTI and pork meat production chain in Portugal. The results revealed that bacteria from the slaughterhouse (equipment, meat, workers colonisation) were similar to human UTI bacteria and had the same antibiotic resistance profile. Although S. saprophyticus pig's colonisation rate was extremely low (1%), 35% of slaughterhouse samples were contaminated. The presence of an antiseptic resistance gene (qacA) by all the lineage G bacteria could be part of the explanation for the ineffective cleaning procedures that were used. ""S. saprophyticus strains of animal origin (lineage G) enters the slaughterhouse through food animals, persist on the equipment, disseminate and contaminate the meat processing chain and humans. Human colonization is a crucial step for the later occurrence of UTI"", explains Opeyemi Lawal, first author of the study developed during his PhD. Additionally, by studying genomic data of bacteria collected from patients attending three hospitals in the Lisbon area, the researchers were able to clearly understand that the transmission of these pathogenic bacteria from both lineages (G and S) occurs between persons within the community. With this deep-structured analysis, researchers were also able to identify putative new virulence factors for this unexplored bacterium. The team will continue to search for reservoirs of this bacterium in humans and animals, and to study the mechanisms of S. saprophyticus dissemination and disease to provide the groundwork towards strategies to combat this pathogen, ""This a clear example of how food manipulation can impact in human health, and how important it is to educate consumers regarding good individual hygiene practices to avoid spreading of infectious diseases"", says Maria Miragaia, head of the Bacterial Evolution and Molecular Epidemiology Lab. ""This adds to the list of bacteria that are transmitted to humans through contact with animals and animal-derived food. But the exact mechanisms associated to the conversion from a colonizer to an infectious agent remains to be clarified"", adds Henrik Westh from the Copenhagen University Hospital - Amager and Hvidovre, University of Copenhagen (Denmark).ReferenceLawal OU, Fraqueza MJ, Bouchami O, et al.

This has led the WHO to include it on a list of ten chemicals that cause serious health problems. However, lead poisoning continues to affect many population groups. A study published today in open access in the journal Environment International found high levels of lead in indigenous people in Peruvian Amazonia living near areas where oil extraction takes place. The research was led by Cristina O'Callaghan-Gordo, a professor and researcher in Health Sciences Studies at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a centre supported by the ""la Caixa"" Foundation and the National Institute of Health of Peru.""The main hypothesis is that the metal reaches them through their diet in areas with the most serious environmental pollution, as the population hunts and fishes for food, and previous studies have shown the that lead is present in animals in this region. On the other hand, in places with lower levels of environmental pollution, the most likely route is occupational exposure, such as coming into direct contact with oil due to participating in clean-up tasks after oil spills,"" explained Cristina O'Callaghan-Gordo.The study included 1,047 people, of whom 309 (31%) were children under 12 years old. The population studied lives in four river basins in Peruvian Amazonia, a remote non-industrialized region. The work took place between May and June 2016, and involved face-to-face interviews to collect data on the participants' risk factors and lifestyle, as well as blood tests. The research also took the distance between where the population lived and the oil extraction facility into account. The highest blood lead levels were found among participants from the Corrientes river basin, which accounts for most of the oil extraction activity in the region. The study also found higher levels of lead in the blood of people living less than an hour's walk from an oil facility. The values observed in this study are twice as high as the values reported for children in Europe between 1999 and 2007, at a time when leaded petrol was still used in Europe (which in some countries continued until 2005). The results showed high levels of lead, especially among males. ""This is quite common, as men tend to be involved more often in activities that expose them to lead, such as cleaning up spills,"" said O'Callaghan-Gordo.This study is the result of an agreement reached between the indigenous peoples' federations in the river basins affected and the Peruvian Government, aimed at addressing their concerns about the potential effects on health. ""This study came about at the request of the indigenous communities, as they have been calling upon the Government to do something in this respect for decades,"" said the researcher. Alterations in the nervous, haematological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and renal systems are associated with exposure to lead in both adults and children, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. ""Levels of lead like those we found in Peru have effects on health. In fact, any amount of this metal in the blood has consequences for health.

These findings may help in understanding the development of certain immune deficiency disorders and establish novel therapies against them.Immune cells represent a diverse group of cells. Some circulate in the blood stream and migrate to infected tissues after receiving signals from damaged tissues. Others reside in tissues to take up the invading microbe, migrate to lymph nodes and activate an immune response. Therefore, to function effectively, the immune system's activities rely on motile cells. Immune cells move around the body via a process of repeated contraction and expansion, called actomyosin movement, involving myosin proteins. However, how this process of immune cell motility is governed remains unknown.""As simple as it sounds, cell migration is a highly regulated and complex process,"" says first author of the study Takeshi Nakatani. ""A lot of individual pieces of the cell have to come together to allow immune cells to move forward and travel to infected sites of the body. Lysosomes are compartments within cells that are connected to nutrient sensing and metabolism, and they have also been shown to be involved in cell motility. We wanted to understand how lysosomes regulate the process of immune cell migration.""The researchers focused on a protein complex on lysosomes, called the Ragulator complex. To understand how the Ragulator complex regulates immune cell motility, the researchers used isolated dendritic cells. These cells take up microbial invaders and bring them to other immune cells in lymph nodes to activate an immune response. The researchers found that when the Ragulator complex interacts with a protein called MPRIP (myosin phosphatase Rho-interacting protein), it prevents the protein MLCP (myosin light chain phosphatase) from blocking the phosphorylation of myosin proteins, resulting in cell contraction. In doing so, the action of the Ragulator complex can be seen as a 'brake-release'.Interestingly, the researchers found that cells migrate by repeated cycles of protrusions of their front and contraction of their rear, leading to a forward movement. However, in the absence of the Ragulator complex, cell contraction did not occur. In experiments with animals, the researchers found that without the Ragulator complex, dendritic cells cannot travel from peripheral tissue to lymph nodes, which results in an impaired immune response.""These are striking results that show how the lysosomal Ragulator complex is involved in the migration of immune cells in addition to its functions in cellular metabolism. Our study revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which immune cells migrate and elicit a proper immune response. These findings could help develop novel therapies against autoimmune diseases as well as better vaccines and anti-cancer drugs,"" says senior author of the study Hyota Takamatsu.Reference: Nakatani T, Tsujimoto K, Park J, et al.

Particularly, the biomanufacturing industry, with the unique challenges of using cells as cell therapy products, is looking for innovations in rapid methods to detect virus contamination as part of their quality control processes and in release testing. While the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered a gold standard for viral detection, there are limitations and they can often produce variable results.A more accurate version is digital PCR, which allows absolute quantification - meaning it reveals the copy number of viruses in a sample - and can allow for setting clear thresholds of virus contamination and is not susceptible to potential fluctuations of reference gene required by standard qPCR methods. However, digital PCR demands a relatively long reaction time of around four hours. Another drawback of all current PCR-based methods is that they need expensive equipment for precise temperature control and cycling.The new methodological development by CAMP - the RApid DIgital Crispr Approach (RADICA) - allows absolute quantification of viral nucleic acids in 40-60 minutes in an isothermal manner in a water bath, a prototypical and inexpensive laboratory equipment. The team's research is explained in a paper titled ""Digital CRISPR-based method for the rapid detection and absolute quantification of nucleic acids"" published recently in the prestigious journal Biomaterials.The RADICA method has been tested on SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA/RNA as well as the Epstein-Barr virus in cultured B cells and patient serum. The researchers say the method can be adapted to detect other kinds of viruses, and in other types of samples such as saliva and cell culture media. RADICA is also able to distinguish the virus from their close relatives.""This is the first reported method of detecting nucleic acids to utilise the sensitivity of isothermal amplification and specificity of CRISPR based detection in a digital format - allowing rapid and specific amplification of DNA without the time consuming and costly need for thermal cycling,"" says Dr Xiaolin Wu, Postdoctoral Associate at SMART CAMP. ""RADICA offers four times faster absolute quantification compared to conventional digital PCR methods.""The team uses extracted DNA/RNA of the sample and divides a 15  L reaction into thousands of independent partitions. In each partition, the DNA/RNA is amplified and identified by Cas12a protein, an enzyme that can turn the target signal into a fluorescent signal. This allows absolute quantification to be achieved by counting the number of partitions that have the target DNA/RNA and are lit up.""The last year has shown us the importance of detecting viruses quickly and accurately, and RADICA can help fill existing gaps in this area,"" says National University of Singapore Professor Hanry Yu, co-corresponding author and Co-Lead Principal Investigator at SMART CAMP. ""Cell therapy products have a very short shelf life and patients are usually in need of treatment urgently. Current sterility tests need around 14 days, which is too slow for clinical needs but RADICA shortens the process into hours.""Professor Tim Lu, who is co-corresponding author, CAMP Principal Investigator and Associate Professor of Biological Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the team's method is faster, cheaper and more efficient than what is used today and its digital format makes it more tolerant to contamination or inhibitors that may be present in biological samples - often the case with cell therapy products. Professor Lu adds that on top of detecting the presence of a target virus, RADICA also identifies how many viruses there are in the sample which can help doctors and researchers in deciding the course of treatment, as well as production and inventory management of cell therapy products.While the researchers at CAMP developed RADICA for monitoring cell therapy manufacturing processes and biosafety release testing of cell therapy products, Dr Wu says the method can also be used to detect DNA/RNA targets of different viruses and adapted to devices commonly found in hospitals and service laboratories - providing a potential new way to tackle pandemics.Reference: Wu X, Tay JK, Goh CK, et al.

Though it is not specific for any one disorder, it could help in services such as memory clinics as a rapid screening tool to identify whether memory, thinking or psychiatric problems are a result of neurodegeneration.'Neurodegenerative diseases are debilitating conditions that result in ongoing degeneration or death of nerve cells, leading to problems in thought, attention and memory. There are currently around 850,000 people with dementia in the UK which is projected to rise to 1.6 million by 2040. In order to help identify the onset of these debilitating diseases and put in place preventative measures as early as possible there has been a drive to develop reliable and accessible biomarkers that can recognise or rule out whether the processes in the brain that are responsible for neurodegeneration are occurring.Current biomarkers used to identify neurodegenerative disorders are taken from the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal column (cerebrospinal fluid - CSF) which has to be extracted using an invasive procedure called lumbar puncture. Advances have been made to use biomarkers from the blood which would provide a more accessible and comfortable assessment. A central and irreversible feature in many neurodegenerative disorders is damage to the nerve fibre which results in the release of neurofilament light chain (NfL). Using ultrasensitive tests, NfL can be detected in blood at low levels and is increased in a number of disorders, unlike phosphorylated tau which is specific for Alzheimer's disease. This means NfL can be of use in the diagnostic process of many neurodegenerative diseases most notably in this study Down's syndrome dementia, ALS and frontotemporal dementia.Co-author Professor Ammar Al-Chalabi from at King's College London and co-lead of the Psychosis and Neuropsychiatry research theme at the NIHR Maudsley BRC. said 'For neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or motor neuron disease, a blood test to allow early diagnosis and help us monitor disease progression and response to treatment would be very helpful. Neurofilament light chain is a promising biomarker that could speed diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and shorten clinical trials.'The study examined 3138 samples from King's College London, Lund University and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including people with no cognitive impairment, people with neurodegenerative disorders, people with Down syndrome and people with depression. The study showed that concentrations of NfL in the blood were higher across all neurodegenerative disorders compared to those with no cognitive problems, the highest being in people with Down's syndrome dementia, motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia.The study also showed that although blood based NfL could not differentiate between all the disorders, it could provide insight into different groups within certain disorders. For example, in those with Parkinson's a high concentration of NfL indicated atypical Parkinson's disorder and in patients with Down syndrome, NfL levels differentiated between those with and without dementia.Co-author Andre Strydom, Professor in Intellectual Disabilities at King's College London said: 'This study shows that neurofilament light chain levels were particularly increased in adults with Down syndrome who have a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, we showed that those individuals with a dementia diagnosis following onset of Alzheimer's disease had higher levels than those who did not. This suggests that the new marker could potentially be used to improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's in people with Down syndrome, as well as to be used as biomarker to show whether treatments are effective or not. It is exciting that all that could be needed is a simple blood test, which is better tolerated in Down syndrome individuals than brain scans.'The study assessed age-related thresholds or cut-offs of NfL concentrations that could represent the point at which an individual would receive a diagnosis. These age-related cut-off points were 90% accurate in highlighting neurodegeneration in those over 65 years of age and 100% accurate in detecting motor neurone disease and Down syndrome dementia in the King's College London samples, with a very similar result in the Lund samples. Importantly, NfL was able to distinguish individuals with depression from individuals with neurodegenerative disorders which commonly present with primary psychiatric disorder in the onset of disease development such as frontotemporal dementia.Joint-Senior author Professor Oskar Hansson from Lund University said 'Blood tests have great potential to improve the diagnosis of dementia both in specialised memory clinics and in primary care. Plasma NfL can be extremely useful in a number of clinical scenarios which can greatly inform doctors, as shown in this large study'.Dr Hye said 'Blood-based NfL offers a scalable and widely accessible alternative to invasive and expensive tests for dementia. It is already used as a routine assessment in some European countries such as Sweden or Netherlands, and our age-related cut-offs can provide a benchmark and quick accessible test for clinicians, to indicate neurodegeneration in people who are exhibiting problems in thinking and memory.'Lead author Dr Nicholas Ashton from King's College London concludes 'We are entering an exciting period where blood tests like plasma NfL, in combination with other emerging blood biomarkers like phosphorylated tau (p-tau), are starting to give us a meaningful and non-invasive insight into brain disorders'.Reference: Ashton NJ, Janelidze S, Al Khleifat A, et al.

This suggests that people with this gene have some level of protection from severe Covid.The study, funded by Innovate UK, the UK's innovation agency, compared asymptomatic people to patients from the same community who developed severe Covid but had no underlying illnesses, and is published in the HLA journal.The study team believe this is the first clear evidence of genetic resistance because this study compared severely affected people with an asymptomatic COVID group and used next generation sequencing to focus in detail and at scale on the HLA genes which are packed together on chromosome 6. Other studies have scanned the whole genome but that approach is less effective in the tissue typing complex.Genome wide studies can be likened to a satellite image. The high density and complexity of the histocompatibility complex and variation in different populations means significant variation can be overlooked. For example, different alleles or versions of the same gene could have opposite effects on the immune response. This study was much more focused and compared symptomatic to asymptomatic in the same population revealing the ""protective"" qualities of the allele.It is known that the human leukocyte antigen gene identified, HLA-DRB1*04:01, is directly correlated to latitude and longitude. This means more people in the North and West of Europe are likely to have this gene.This suggests that populations of European descent will be more likely to remain asymptomatic but still transmit the disease to susceptible populations.Dr Carlos Echevarria from the Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University who also works as a Respiratory Consultant in the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is a co-author of the paper says: ""This is an important finding as it may explain why some people catch Covid but don't get sick.""It could lead us to a genetic test which may indicate who we need to prioritise for future vaccinations.""""At a population level, this is important for us to know because when we have lots of people who are resistant, so they catch Covid but don't show symptoms, then they risk spreading the virus while asymptomatic.""The effect of genes being linked to geolocation is an accepted scientific concept and it is well known that HLA genes develop over generations in reaction to disease-causing pathogens.Study author, David Langton, whose company ExplantLab helped fund the study through an Innovate UK research award, added: ""Some of the most interesting findings were the relationships between longitude and latitude and HLA gene frequency. It has long been known that the incidence of multiple sclerosis increases with increasing latitude. This has been put down in part to reduced UV exposure and therefore lower vitamin D levels. We weren't aware, however, that one of the main risk genes for MS, that is DRB1*15:01, directly correlates to latitude.""This highlights the complex interaction between environment, genetics and disease. We know some HLA genes are vitamin D responsive, and that low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for severe COVID and we are doing further work in this area.""The study used samples from 49 patients with severe Covid who had been hospitalised with respiratory failure, samples from an asymptomatic group of 69 hospital workers who had tested positive through routine blood antibody testing and a control group from a study into the relationship between HLA genotypes and the outcomes of joint replacement surgery.The research used next generation sequencing machines to study the different versions, or alleles, of the HLA genes in depth which was combined with a variety of expertise and modelling. The work was limited to samples from North East England during the first lockdown, this reduced variation in the study groups but more studies will be needed in the UK and other populations as there may be different copies of the HLA genes providing resistance in other populations.Reference: Langton DJ, Bourke SC, Lie BA, et al.

This type of language loss is called aphasia, a long-term neurological disorder caused by damage to the part of the brain responsible for language production and processing that impacts over a million people in the US.""It's a huge problem,"" says Swathi Kiran, director of BU's Aphasia Research Lab, and College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences: Sargent College associate dean for research and James and Cecilia Tse Ying Professor in Neurorehabilitation. ""It's something our lab is working to tackle at multiple levels.""For the last decade, Kiran and her team have studied the brain to see how it changes as people's language skills improve with speech therapy. More recently, they've developed new methods to predict a person's ability to improve even before they start therapy. In a new paper published in Scientific Reports, Kiran and collaborators at BU and the University of Texas at Austin report they can predict language recovery in Hispanic patients who speak both English and Spanish fluently--a group of aphasia patients particularly at risk of long-term language loss--using sophisticated computer models of the brain. They say the breakthrough could be a game changer for the field of speech therapy and for stroke survivors impacted by aphasia.""This [paper] uses computational modeling to predict rehabilitation outcomes in a population of neurological disorders that are really underserved,"" Kiran says. In the US, Hispanic stroke survivors are nearly two times less likely to be insured than all other racial or ethnic groups, Kiran says, and therefore they experience greater difficulties in accessing language rehabilitation. On top of that, oftentimes speech therapy is only available in one language, even though patients may speak multiple languages at home, making it difficult for clinicians to prioritize which language a patient should receive therapy in.""This work started with the question, 'If someone had a stroke in this country and [the patient] speaks two languages, which language should they receive therapy in?'"" says Kiran. ""Are they more likely to improve if they receive therapy in English? Or in Spanish?""This first-of-its-kind technology addresses that need by using sophisticated neural network models that simulate the brain of a bilingual person that is language impaired, and their brain's response to therapy in English and Spanish. The model can then identify the optimal language to target during treatment, and predict the outcome after therapy to forecast how well a person will recover their language skills. They found that the models predicted treatment effects accurately in the treated language, meaning these computational tools could guide healthcare providers to prescribe the best possible rehabilitation plan.""There is more recognition with the pandemic that people from different populations--whether [those be differences of] race, ethnicity, different disability, socioeconomic status--don't receive the same level of [healthcare],"" says Kiran. ""The problem we're trying to solve here is, for our patients, health disparities at their worst; they are from a population that, the data shows, does not have great access to care, and they have communication problems [due to aphasia].""As part of this work, the team is examining how recovery in one language impacts recovery of the other--will learning the word ""dog"" in English lead to a patient recalling the word ""perro,"" the word for dog in Spanish?""If you're bilingual you may go back and forth between languages, and what we're trying to do [in our lab] is use that as a therapy piece,"" says Kiran.Clinical trials using this technology are already underway, which will soon provide an even clearer picture of how the models can potentially be implemented in hospital and clinical settings.""We are trying to develop effective therapy programs, but we also try to deal with the patient as a whole,"" Kiran says.

According to new research from Michigan State University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, part of the answer may be found in a surprising place: an infant's digestive system.The human digestive system is home to a vast community of microorganisms known as the gut microbiome. The MSU-UNC research team discovered that the gut microbiome was different in infants with strong fear responses and infants with milder reactions.These fear responses -- how someone reacts to a scary situation -- in early life can be indicators of future mental health. And there is growing evidence tying neurological well-being to the microbiome in the gut.The new findings suggest that the gut microbiome could one day provide researchers and physicians with a new tool to monitor and support healthy neurological development.""This early developmental period is a time of tremendous opportunity for promoting healthy brain development,"" said MSU's Rebecca Knickmeyer, leader of the new study published June 2 in the journal Nature Communications. ""The microbiome is an exciting new target that can be potentially used for that.""Studies of this connection and its role in fear response in animals led Knickmeyer, an associate professor in the College of Human Medicine's Department of Pediatrics and Human Development, and her team to look for something similar in humans. And studying how humans, especially young children, handle fear is important because it can help forecast mental health in some cases.""Fear reactions are a normal part of child development. Children should be aware of threats in their environment and be ready to respond to them"" said Knickmeyer, who also works in MSU's Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, or IQ. ""But if they can't dampen that response when they're safe, they may be at heightened risk to develop anxiety and depression later on in life.""On the other end of the response spectrum, children with exceptionally muted fear responses may go on to develop callous, unemotional traits associated with antisocial behavior, Knickmeyer said.To determine whether the gut microbiome was connected to fear response in humans, Knickmeyer and her co-workers designed a pilot study with about 30 infants. The researchers selected the cohort carefully to keep as many factors impacting the gut microbiome as consistent as possible. For example, all of the children were breastfed and none was on antibiotics.The researchers then characterized the children's microbiome by analyzing stool samples and assessed a child's fear response using a simple test: observing how a child reacted to someone entering the room while wearing a Halloween mask.""We really wanted the experience to be enjoyable for both the kids and their parents. The parents were there the whole time and they could jump in whenever they wanted,"" Knickmeyer said. ""These are really the kinds of experiences infants would have in their everyday lives.""Compiling all the data, the researchers saw significant associations between specific features of the gut microbiome and the strength of infant fear responses.For example, children with uneven microbiomes at 1 month of age were more fearful at 1 year of age. Uneven microbiomes are dominated by a small set of bacteria, whereas even microbiomes are more balanced.The researchers also discovered that the content of the microbial community at 1 year of age related to fear responses. Compared with less fearful children, infants with heightened responses had more of some types of bacteria and less of others.The team, however, did not observe a connection between the children's gut microbiome and how the children reacted to strangers who weren't wearing masks. Knickmeyer said this is likely due to the different parts of the brain involved with processing potentially frightening situations.""With strangers, there is a social element. So children may have a social wariness, but they don't see strangers as immediate threats,"" Knickmeyer said. ""When children see a mask, they don't see it as social. It goes into that quick-and-dirty assessment part of the brain.""As part of the study, the team also imaged the children's brains using MRI technology. They found that the content of the microbial community at 1 year was associated with the size of the amygdala, which is part of the brain involved in making quick decisions about potential threats.Connecting the dots suggests that the microbiome may influence how the amygdala develops and operates. That's one of many interesting possibilities uncovered by this new study, which the team is currently working to replicate. Knickmeyer is also preparing to start up new lines of inquiry with new collaborations at IQ, asking new questions that she's excited to answer.""We have a great opportunity to support neurological health early on,"" she said. ""Our long-term goal is that we'll learn what we can do to foster healthy growth and development.""Reference: Carlson AL, Xia K, Azcarate-Peril MA, et al.

A new measure of brain health developed by researchers at Rush University Medical Center may offer a novel approach to identifying individuals at risk of memory and thinking problems, according to research results published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association on June 1.Dubbed the  cognitive clock  by the researchers, the tool is a measure of brain health based on cognitive performance. It may be used in the future to predict the likelihood of memory and thinking problems that develop as a person ages. Alzheimer s disease, which is of the most common cause of dementia, and other diseases of the brain accumulate slowly over time as people get older. Age is widely recognized as the main risk factor for Alzheimer s disease, but it s a very imperfect predictor, since not everyone develops dementia as they age,  said Patricia Boyle, PhD, professor in Rush Medical College s Division of Behavioral Sciences neuropsychologist in the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, and lead author of the study. Our new cognitive clock provides a measure of brain health that tells us more about how well a person s brain is functioning than chronological age. In this way, the clock can help us detect who is at highest risk of developing cognitive impairment in the coming years. For some people, cognition remains fairly stable as they age,  Boyle added.  But, for others, cognition declines slowly over time, and still others show steep declines. The researchers believed that cognitive performance data, even using a simple cognitive screening test, could be used to distinguish people exhibiting normal cognitive aging from those who are on their way to developing memory and thinking problems that are often coupled with aging.This thesis led the Rush researchers to look at data they acquired from several long-term studies conducted by the RADC, including the Rush Memory and Aging Project which included people living in the community in greater Chicago; the Religious Orders Study, which included older Catholic clergy from across the United States; and the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a biracial population-based study. We used long-term cognitive testing data from our participants to develop a profile of cognitive aging, what we call the cognitive clock  Boyle said.  The cognitive clock reflects the general pattern of age-related cognitive decline and allows us to see who is doing better than average and who is doing worse at a given point in time. This helps us identify who might be at high risk of developing memory and thinking problems. The cognitive clock was first developed working with data from 1,057 participants from the Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study, who began without cognitive impairment and underwent yearly cognitive assessments for up to 24 years. The cognitive assessment included the Mini-Mental State Exam, a widely used test of cognitive function among the elderly that measures orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills. In addition to the MMSE, detailed evaluations also included a structured medical history, neurologic examinations, and a set of neurocognitive tests.The researchers examined how cognitive performance changes over time with advancing age using a novel statistical approach to identify the typical profile of cognitive aging. Using this cognitive clock, researchers can estimate an individual s cognitive age -- their position on the clock   at any given point in time.Cognitive age is an indicator of brain health.  We found that, on average, cognition remains stable until a cognitive age of around 80 years of age, then declines moderately until 90, then declines more rapidly until death,  Boyle said. Further, we found that cognitive age is a much better predictor than chronological age of dementia, mild cognitive impairment and mortality. It also is more strongly associated with other aspects of brain health. The researchers then applied the clock to an independent sample of 2,592 participants from the Chicago Health and Aging Project to confirm its accuracy for predicting outcomes such as Alzheimer s dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and mortality. Again, they found that cognitive age was a better predictor of these outcomes than chronological age. Essentially, what we did is use cognitive data collected over many years to create a single, easy-to-understand metric that may be used to predict health outcomes with good accuracy,  Boyle said. This tool may serve as an aid in aging research moving forward and may offer a new tool to identify at risk individuals. It is very difficult to develop a test or biomarker that accurately predicts health outcomes on an individual level. This has been a longstanding challenge in aging research. However, we are hoping that with additional research and validation, we may be able extend the approach applied here to clinical settings,  Boyle said. Ideally, we could have a patient come into a clinic or hospital and complete a brief cognitive screen that gives us information to plug into a formula to estimate their cognitive age. That will provide important information about their brain health, and from there, we can estimate likelihood of developing Alzheimer s disease or dementia in the coming years. That would be an exciting advance. Reference:1. Boyle PA, Wang T, Yu L, et al. The  cognitive clock : A novel indicator of brain health.

Their generation follows principles called transcription and translation. First, DNA copies its genetic information to messenger RNA (mRNA), which then determines the sequence in a chain of amino acids, which finally fold into a protein. The reality, however, is more complex: More than 90 per cent of our genes do not result in only one mRNA and then one protein, but a process called alternative splicing produces several mRNA variants, only some of which are then translated into a specific protein isoform in a specific cell at a given time. Conventional techniques to detect alternative splicing are mostly single time-point measurements that are work-intense and cannot reliably monitor over time which protein isoforms are actually translated in the cell.Researchers at Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) thus developed a new bioengineered reporter system called EXSISERS. The idea behind it is to generate a signal such as light as soon as a specific protein isoform is being translated. ""This is possible via designer reporter proteins that can cut themselves out of the nascent amino acid chain- they are self-excising,"" says Dong-Jiunn Jeffery Truong. ""In analogy to the famous cut and restore rope trick in magic performances, the excision of the reporter leaves no scar in the natural protein isoforms."" The researchers have already applied this method to human cells in culture. One of their aims was to analyze the expression of isoforms of a protein called Tau, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. This makes Tau isoforms a potential target for future molecular therapies.""Bioengineering inspired by natural biomolecular processes will make it possible to observe many other fundamental cellular processes non-invasively,"" says Gil Gregor Westmeyer. ""The more cellular parameters we can monitor, the better we can develop targeted molecular interventions for future cellular therapies, for example, to treat neurodegenerative diseases."" Westmeyer and his team are already collaborating with several academic laboratories that use the new reporter system to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of isoform expression in cells and its implication in diseases.Reference: Truong D-JJ, Phlairaharn T, E wein B, et al.

It leads to chronic pain, organ failure, and early death in patients. A team led by researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital has now demonstrated a base editing approach that efficiently corrects the mutation underlying SCD in patient blood stem cells and in mice. This gene editing treatment rescued the disease symptoms in animal models, enabling the long-lasting production of healthy blood cells.The root of SCD is two mutated copies of the hemoglobin gene, HBB, which cause red blood cells to transform from a circular disc into a sickle shape -- setting off a chain of events leading to organ damage, recurrent pain, and early mortality. In this study, the researchers used a molecular technology called base editing to directly convert a single letter of pathogenic DNA into a harmless genetic variant of HBB in human blood-producing cells and in a mouse model of SCD.""We were able to correct the disease-causing variant in both cell and animal models using a customized base editor, without requiring double-stranded DNA breaks or inserting new segments of DNA into the genome,"" says co-senior author David Liu, Richard Merkin Professor and director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies in Healthcare at the Broad Institute, professor at Harvard University, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. ""This was a major team effort, and our hope is that base editing will provide a promising basis for a therapeutic strategy down the road for sickle cell disease.""""Our study illustrates the power and excitement of multidisciplinary collaborations for creating novel mechanism-based cures for genetic diseases,"" says co-senior author Mitchell Weiss, chair of the St. Jude Department of Hematology. ""In particular, we combined expertise in protein engineering, base editing, and red blood cell biology to create a novel approach for treating and possibly curing sickle cell disease.""The work appeared in Nature, led by co-first authors Gregory Newby at the Broad Institute and Jonathan Yen, Kaitly Woodard, and Thiyagaraj Mayuranathan at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.","Published: June 7, 2021"

It's filled with countless microorganisms actively breaking down organic matter, like fallen leaves and plants, and performing a host of other functions that maintain the natural balance of carbon and nutrients stored in the ground beneath us.""Soil is mostly microorganisms, both alive and dead,"" says Jennifer Bhatnagar, soil microbiologist and Boston University College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of biology. It's typical to see several hundred different types of fungi and bacteria in a single pinch of soil off the ground, she says, making it one of the most diverse ecosystems that exist. Because there's still so much unknown about soil organisms, until now scientists have not attempted to predict where certain species or groups of soil microbes live around the world. But having that knowledge about these organisms-- too small to see with the naked eye--is key to better understanding the soil microbiome, which is made up of the communities of different microbes that live together. A team of BU biologists, including Bhatnagar, took on that challenge--and their research reveals, for the first time, that it is possible to accurately predict the abundance of different species of soil microbes in different parts of the world. The team recently published their findings in a new paper in Nature Ecology & Evolution. ""If we know where organisms are on earth, and we know how they change through space and time due to different environmental forces, and something about what different species are doing, then we can much better predict how the function of these communities will change in terms of carbon and nutrient cycling,"" Bhatnagar says. That kind of knowledge would have huge implications for agriculture, climate change, and public health. ""The health of the soils is so tied to the soil microbes,"" says Michael Dietze, senior author on the study and a BU College of Arts & Sciences professor of earth and environment. Dietze, Bhatnagar, and researchers from their labs joined forces to work on this project, which involved analyzing hundreds of soil samples collected by National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) research sites. Bhatnagar and her lab members brought to the team their soil expertise, while Dietze and his lab offered their unique ability to develop precise ecological forecasts and near-term environmental predictions. The team learned that microbe predictability increases as spatial area increases, so the bigger the piece of land their model makes forecasts about, the more likely the predictions about what types of microbes live there will be accurate. Dietze says the ability to accurately predict which microbes would likely be found in a given soil sample also increased as the researchers looked at organism groupings higher up on the phylogenetic scale, a system that classifies organisms based on evolutionary relatedness. On the smallest end of the scale, a ""species"" represents the finest level of classification; on the other end, a ""phylum"" makes up the largest and most diverse groupings of organisms. They were surprised to find that they were better able to predict the presence of a whole phylum, as opposed to individual species. After receiving the genomic data of the soil samples from NEON, the research team's forecasting models take into account environmental factors specific to the place where the soil came from--what plants live there, the soil acidity (pH), temperature, climate, and many others. They found their model was best able to predict the presence of microorganisms based on their symbiotic relationship with local plant species. Mycorrhizal fungi, for example, is a very common soil microbe that about 90 percent of plant families associate with, including pines and oak trees in New England. In contrast, the team found it was more difficult to predict large groups of organisms based on their relationship with soil acidity. Despite knowing soil acidity levels, and what types of bacteria would typically like to live in that environment, their model couldn't accurately predict the amount of bacteria that were actually present in the soil sample, Bhatnagar says. ""That means there is something else beyond the relationship with [acidity], beyond the relationship with any other environmental factor that we typically measure in our ecosystems,"" she says. Now, Dietze and Bhatnagar's team are expanding their forecasts beyond predicting microbes based on only their location, to also include specific times of the year. ""Building a framework for forecasting the soil microbiome at sites across the US will improve our understanding of seasonal and interannual change,"" says Zoey Werbin, a PhD student working in Bhatnagar's lab and an author on the paper. ""This could help us anticipate how climate change could affect microbial processes like decomposition or nitrogen cycling."" With her dissertation project, Werbin hopes to answer fundamental questions about how and why the soil microbiome varies over time and space. ""The more we learn, the more we realize how important soil microbes are for agriculture, public health, and climate change. It's really exciting to investigate how microscopic organisms can have such large-scale effects,"" Werbin says. ""We know certain factors, like temperature and moisture, affect microbial communities. But we don't know how important those factors are compared to natural variability, or interactions between microbes. My PhD project will help identify the driving forces of the soil microbiome, as well as the biggest sources of uncertainty.""ReferenceAverill C, Werbin ZR, Atherton KF, Bhatnagar JM, Dietze MC.

From cell phones to pens and cars to medical devices, the modern world is full of plastic-- and plastic waste. New research from scientists at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) Ecosystems Center found that some of that plastic waste has been accumulating in salt marshes for decades. The study was published in Environmental Advances.Salt marshes are the link between the land and open ocean ecosystems, and -- in a way --between urban environments and the wild ocean. Microplastics (plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters) tend to float on the water surface, but salt marshes fill and empty with the tides, so particles that would normally float get trapped within branches and roots and settle into the marsh soil.Sediments accumulate in the salt marsh layer after layer, like tree rings, keeping an historical record of sedimentation within the ecosystem. ""By accumulating sediments, they are keeping a record in time,"" says Javier Lloret, MBL research scientist and co-first author on the paper.Globally, scientists estimate that about 8 million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year. But until now, there's been no estimation of the amount of that plastic that gets trapped in salt marsh ecosystems.By taking core samples of the marsh sediment at six different estuaries in the Waquoit Bay system on Cape Cod, as well as New Bedford, Mass., harbor, the researchers were able to trace the abundance of microplastics dating back decades in areas with very contrasted degrees of land use.""As you go into the past, the amount of microplastics you find decreases clearly,"" says Lloret. ""The amount of microplastics you find in sediments is related to the population numbers... but also the amount of plastic that people use.""""Waquoit Bay is the perfect salt marsh system to study plastic pollution because we can contrast one area that is almost pristine... with another area that is highly impacted by human activity,"" says Rut Pedrosa-P mies, also an MBL research scientist and co-first author on the paper. ""We found a broad range of plastic pollution.""The researchers focused on two types of microplastic pollution: fragments (from the breakdown of larger plastic pieces) and fibers (thread-like plastics which tend to shed from clothing and fishing gear). They found that fragment pollution increased both through time and with urbanization. The more populated the area surrounding the collection site, the more plastic fragments the researchers observed.One surprise in the data was that microplastic concentration in the sediments wasn't linear as urbanization grew. Up to 50% development, the concentration of microplastic fragments was relatively unchanged, but once the land was occupied at 50%, the number of microplastics grew exponentially.""Just a few people in the surrounding area is not going to change much, but when urban uses occupy more than 50% of the land, the number of microplastics goes crazy,"" says Lloret.The microplastic fibers didn't have the same relationship with urbanization. ""Even in the more pristine areas that don't have urbanization, we find fiber plastic pollution"" says Pedrosa-P mies.The researchers believe the fragments have a local origin (people using and disposing of plastics where they live) whereas fibers can be transported long distances by air or by water from large-scale urban areas.""When we started, we didn't know if microplastics were an issue here on Cape Cod, or not. No one had analyzed the marsh sediments on Cape Cod for microplastics before,"" says Lloret.Now that the scientists have shown there is microplastic pollution in New England salt marshes, the next step is to gain further insight. How are those particles arriving in the ecosystem? What are the sources? How are they impacting the ecosystem and the food web of the organisms that live there?""There are still a lot of unanswered questions,"" says Pedrosa-P mies. ""This is the first step for management, too.""Reference: Lloret J, Pedrosa-Pamies R, Vandal N, et al.

For a small proportion of people who are reinfected, the virus can cause severe symptomatic disease, which is often life-threatening. The main hypothesis for some time has been that antibodies generated the first time around, instead of providing protection against disease, can actually exacerbate it,  says Stylianos Bournazos, research assistant professor at Rockefeller.  But even in secondary infection, we see a wide range of symptoms so the presence of antibodies alone cannot explain why only some cases turn deadly.  Now new findings published in Science by the lab of Jeffrey V. Ravetch in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute in Cambodia suggest that the susceptibility and severity of dengue disease comes down to a particular type of antibody that is missing a specific sugar, fucose, on its stem. This impacts the antibody s so-called Fc region, which is responsible for binding and passing instructions along to other immune cells. Previously, researchers in the Ravetch lab found that patients with severe dengue disease have unusually high levels of these fucose-less antibodies. However, it was not clear whether the absence of fucose was the result of severe disease or its cause. By analyzing samples from a variety of dengue patients early in the onset of their disease, the team found that those who eventually developed the most severe disease also had significantly higher levels of fucose-deficient antibodies at the time of hospital admission. As a result of this change to their structure, the antibodies bind too strongly to white blood cells, increasing inflammation and leading to the destruction of platelets crucial for blood clotting. The result is hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome often seen in severe dengue disease. The findings suggest that the fucose status of antibodies represents a robust prognostic tool, says Ravetch, Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professor and head of the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology.  It can help us identify patients at risk of severe illness so they can receive appropriate medical care early on. ReferenceBournazos S, Vo HTM, Duong V, et al.

But Daniel Segr  has set his sights on a much more ambitious vision for how the microbiome could be manipulated for good: ""To help sustain our planet, not just our own health.""Segr , director of the Boston University Microbiome Initiative, says he and other scientists in his field of synthetic and systems biology are studying microbiomes--microscopic communities of bacteria, fungi, or a combination of those that exert influence over each other and the surrounding environment. They want to know how microbiomes might be directed to carry out important tasks like absorbing more atmospheric carbon, protecting coral reefs from ocean acidification, improving the fertility and yield of agricultural lands, and supporting the growth of forests and other plants despite changing environmental conditions.""Microbes affect us as humans through their own metabolic processes, they affect our planet through what they consume and secrete, they help create the oxygen we breathe,"" says Segr , a BU College of Arts & Sciences professor of biology and bioinformatics, and a College of Engineering professor of biomedical engineering. ""A long time ago microbes are what made multicellular life possible.""But, unlike many other synthetic biologists who are working to enhance or genetically engineer microbes directly, Segr  is more interested in how to direct the behavior of a microbiome by tweaking the environmental conditions it lives within--an approach he says could be better described as ""synthetic ecology.""""The more traditional synthetic biology approach would be to manipulate the genomes of the microbes,"" Segr  says. ""But we're trying to manipulate microbial ecosystems using environmental molecules.""""We know that microbial interactions with the environment are important,"" says Alan Pacheco, who earned his PhD in bioinformatics working in Segr 's lab. Some of those interactions benefit several microbial species, some only benefit one species in a community, and some can be harmful to certain species, he says. ""But there's still so much we don't know about why these interactions happen the way that they do.""In a new study recently published in Nature Communications, Segr , Pacheco, and their collaborator Melisa Osborne, a research scientist in Segr 's lab, explored how the presence of 32 different environmental molecules or nutrients, alone or in combination with others, would influence the growth rate of microbial communities and the mix of diverse species making up a given microbiome.""In the back of our minds we had this idea of diet, framed by studies that have looked at differences in the gut microbiome based on Western vs hunter-gatherer diets,"" says Pacheco, who is now a postdoctoral fellow at ETH Z rich. Hunter-gatherer diets, opportunistic and comprising a wide range of plant-based food sources, are considered much more diverse than the Western diet, which is why the hunter-gatherer diet is thought to cultivate a healthier gut.But the experimental results surprised the team. They expected they would see growth and diversity of microbiomes increase as the ""bugs"" had more access to a variety of foods--a range of carbons, including sugars, amino acids, and complex polymers--but that's not what their carefully controlled experiments revealed. Instead, they observed that competition for food between different species of microbes hampered diversification within the microbial community.""Our results demonstrate that environmental complexity alone is not sufficient for maintaining community diversity, and provide practical guidance for designing and controlling microbial ecosystems,"" the authors write.So, what are the mechanisms that control a microbiome's diversity? ""It's going to take some time to figure out the cause of all these interactions,"" Segr  says.Although increasing the variety of food sources didn't increase the variety of microbial species within their experiments, more food did fuel more microbial growth. ""We found yield depends on the total number of carbon sources, but not on the variety of those sources,"" Segr  says. ""It's like people at a picnic--if enough people come to a picnic, no matter what the spread of different foods, eventually everything will be eaten up. In many of our experiments, the microbial communities used up every last bit of carbon source to the fullest extent.""Pacheco adds that if somebody can consume something, somebody else can outcompete them for it. ""Our experiments showed that the crucial modulator in microbial diversity is how much these different organisms compete with one another for resources,"" he says. ""The more organisms compete, the less diverse that community is going to be.""The team plans to do more research into additional environmental factors, investigating how nutrient access and variety changes microbial communities over time, and how the medium that the microbial community lives in affects their consumption and secretion of molecules. They are also exploring how metabolic processes amongst different microbial species could interact and interplay with each other, and how the ability of some organisms to sequentially or simultaneously consume multiple resources affects the microbiome overall.Further unlocking and eventually harnessing all these environmental ""dials and knobs"" could open doors to using microbiomes to influence human metabolisms and health or disease states in people and in natural ecosystems.Reference: Pacheco AR, Osborne ML, Segr  D.

""With Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods and other products coming on the market, there's a huge interest in plant-based foods for improved sustainability, health and ethical reasons,"" says McClements, a leading expert in food design and nanotechnology, and author of Future Foods: How Modern Science Is Transforming the Way We Eat. In 2019, the plant-based food market in the U.S. alone was valued at nearly $5 billion, with 40.5% of sales in the milk category and 18.9% in plant-based meat products, the paper notes. That represented a market value growth of 29% from 2017. ""A lot of academics are starting to work in this area and are not familiar with the complexity of animal products and the physicochemical principles you need in order to assemble plant-based ingredients into these products, each with their own physical, functional, nutritional and sensory attributes,"" McClements says. With funding from the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Good Food Institute, McClements leads a multidisciplinary team at UMass Amherst that is exploring the science behind designing better plant-based protein. Co-author Lutz Grossmann, who recently joined the UMass Amherst food science team as an assistant professor, has expertise in alternative protein sources, McClements notes. ""Our research has pivoted toward this topic,"" McClements says. ""There's a huge amount of innovation and investment in this area, and I get contacted frequently by different startup companies who are trying to make plant-based fish or eggs or cheese, but who often don't have a background in the science of foods."" While the plant-based food sector is expanding to meet consumer demand, McClements notes in the paper that ""a plant-based diet is not necessarily better than an omnivore diet from a nutritional perspective."" Plant-based products need to be fortified with micronutrients that are naturally present in animal meat, milk and eggs, including vitamin D, calcium and zinc. They also have to be digestible and provide the full complement of essential amino acids. McClements says that many of the current generation of highly processed, plant-based meat products are unhealthy because they're full of saturated fat, salt and sugar. But he adds that ultra-processed food does not have to be unhealthy. ""We're trying to make processed food healthier,"" McClements says. ""We aim to design them to have all the vitamins and minerals you need and have health-promoting components like dietary fiber and phytochemicals so that they taste good and they're convenient and they're cheap and you can easily incorporate them into your life. That's the goal in the future, but we're not there yet for most products.""

A team of biophysicists led by Professor Josef Alfons K s and Dr J rg Schnau  were able to show in experiments that cells can be transferred into slow motion without changing the temperature. From a physical point of view, such possibilities have so far only been available in the context of the theory of relativity. Cells are not only our biological building blocks, but also highly dynamic, active systems. The research group led by Professor K s has succeeded in significantly reducing these dynamics with heavy water, without damaging the cells.""Generally, a lot of people know heavy water for its important technical use in nuclear power plants. We took a different approach here and were able to show that for cells, time - or, more specifically, their dynamics - can be significantly slowed down in the presence of heavy water,"" said K s, who has devoted himself to researching the physical properties of cells and tissue. The research showed on various biological levels that the movement of cells and their dynamics was only taking place in slow motion. ""It is very intriguing that cellular dynamics can be slowed down at the same temperature. So far, only the theory of relativity has offered such possibilities in the physical context,"" explained K s. He added that the results form the basis of a method to offer cells and organs longer-lasting protection against degeneration.The researchers confirmed this effect with a variety of complementary methods and attributed the observations to an increased interaction between the structural proteins. ""Heavy water also forms hydrogen bonds, but these are stronger than in normal aqueous environments. As a result, structural proteins such as actin seem to interact more strongly with one another and briefly stick together. What is spectacular here is that the effects are reversible, with cells showing their native properties again as soon as they are transferred into a normal aqueous medium,"" said Dr J rg Schnau . ""What is even more astonishing is that these changes show the fingerprint of a passive material. However, cells are highly active and far from thermodynamic equilibrium. If they behave like a passive material, they are usually dead,"" added K s.However, as the researchers were able to show, this was not the case in their experiments. They now hope to be able to use the knowledge gained to keep cells or even tissue vital for longer. If this approach is confirmed, heavy water could be used for longer storage times, for example during organ transplants.Reference: Schnau  J, Kunschmann T, Grosser S, et al.

The usual process is to do the surgery to remove the cancer metastases, give the patient chemotherapy, and then follow up with CT scans every six to 12 months, to see if the cancer recurs. And if the cancer does recur, you know the treatment hasn't worked. By measuring the ctDNA in the blood, we could immediately see whether the chemotherapy had cleared the cancer and were therefore able to predict the likelihood of the cancer recurring.""Associate Professor Tie said ctDNA biomarkers might allow clinicians to intervene earlier.""Cancer that can be detected on a CT scan is unlikely to be curable by chemotherapy. But if we are able to detect microscopic disease, that we can't pick up on a scan, we can intervene earlier and potentially still offer the patient a chance of cure.""Promising sign for the future of cancer treatmentAssociate Professor Tie said while ctDNA technology was already being used in the US, further research was needed before it could be rolled out in Australia.""The test needs to be very sensitive to be able to pick up microscopic cancer cells. I am hopeful the new technology coming through will have enough sensitivity that we will be able to use this technique in the years ahead to improve patient care and treatment,"" she said.""With further development of this technology, this could also mean patients with a low recurrence risk could avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.""Reference: Tie J, Wang Y, Cohen J, et al.

They also studied how learning of this skill affects the daily life of people who are blind.The findings are published in the journal PLOS ONE.The study involved blind and sighted participants between 21 and 79 years of age who trained over the course of 10 weeks. Blind participants also took part in a 3-month follow up survey assessing the effects of the training on their daily life.Both sighted and blind people improved considerably on all measures, and in some cases performed comparatively to expert echolocators at the end of training. Somewhat surprisingly, in some cases sighted people even performed better than those who were blind.Importantly, however, neither age nor blindness was a limiting factor in participants' rate of learning or in their ability to apply their echolocation skills to novel, untrained tasks. Furthermore, in the follow up survey, all participants who were blind reported improved mobility, and 83% reported better independence and wellbeing.Overall, the results suggest that the ability to learn click-based echolocation is not strongly limited by age or level of vision. This has positive implications for the rehabilitation of people with vision loss or in the early stages of progressive vision loss.Currently, click-based echolocation is not taught as part of mobility training and rehabilitation for blind people. There is also the possibility that some people are reluctant to use click-based echolocation due to a perceived stigma around making the required clicks in social environments.Despite this, the results indicate that blind people who use echolocation and people new to echolocation are confident to use it in social situations. The potential barriers relating to perceived stigma are perhaps much smaller than previously thought.Dr. Lore Thaler, in the Department of Psychology at Durham University, said ""I cannot think of any other work with blind participants that has had such enthusiastic feedback.""""People who took part in our study reported that the training in click-based echolocation had a positive effect on their mobility, independence and wellbeing, attesting that the improvements we observed in the lab transcended into positive life benefits outside the lab. """"We are very excited about this and feel that it would make sense to provide information and training in click-based echolocation to people who may still have good functional vision, but who are expected to lose vision later in life because of progressive degenerative eye conditions.""The human brain continues to surprise us with its capabilities for complex learning strategies and the neuroplasticity to alter its very structure to better process information from its senses.Reference: Norman LJ, Dodsworth C, Foresteire D, Thaler L.

As opposed to ""gray matter,"" which is composed of the cell bodies of neurons, white matter is made up of a fatty substance called myelin that coats neurons, offering protection and helping them transmit signals quickly and efficiently. A reduction in white matter is associated with motor and cognitive impairment.Earlier work by a team from the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) found that antiretroviral therapy (ART)--the lifesaving suite of drugs that many people with HIV use daily--can reduce white matter, but it wasn't clear how the virus itself contributed to this loss.In a new study using both human and rodent cells, the team has hammered out a detailed mechanism, revealing how HIV prevents the myelin-making brain cells called oligodendrocytes from maturing, thus putting a wrench in white matter production. When the researchers applied a compound blocking this process, the cells were once again able to mature.The work is published in the journal Glia.""Even when people with HIV have their disease well-controlled by antiretrovirals, they still have the virus present in their bodies, so this study came out of our interest in understanding how HIV infection itself affects white matter,"" says Kelly Jordan-Sciutto, a professor in Penn's School of Dental Medicine and co-senior author on the study. ""By understanding those mechanisms, we can take the next step to protect people with HIV infection from these impacts.""""When people think about the brain, they think of neurons, but they often don't think about white matter, as important as it is,"" says Judith Grinspan, a research scientist at CHOP and the study's other co-senior author. ""But it's clear that myelination is playing key roles in various stages of life: in infancy, in adolescence, and likely during learning in adulthood too. The more we find out about this biology, the more we can do to prevent white matter loss and the harms that can cause.""Jordan-Sciutto and Grinspan have been collaborating for several years to elucidate how ART and HIV affect the brain, and specifically oligodendrocytes, a focus of Grinspan's research. Their previous work on antiretrovirals had shown that commonly used drugs disrupted the function of oligodendrocytes, reducing myelin formation.In the current study, they aimed to isolate the effect of HIV on this process. Led by Lindsay Roth, who recently earned her doctoral degree within the Biomedical Graduate Studies group at Penn and completed a postdoctoral fellowship working with Jordan-Sciutto and Grinspan, the investigation began by looking at human macrophages, one of the major cell types that HIV infects.Scientists had hypothesized that HIV's impact on the brain arose indirectly through the activity of these immune cells since the virus doesn't infect neurons or oligodendrocytes. To learn more about how this might affect white matter specifically, the researchers took the fluid in which macrophages infected with HIV were growing and applied it to rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which mature into oligodendrocytes. While this treatment didn't kill the precursor cells, it did block them from maturing into oligodendrocytes. Myelin production was subsequently also reduced.""Immune cells that are infected with the virus secrete harmful substances, which normally target invading organisms, but can can also kill nearby cells, such as neurons, or stop them from differentiating,"" Grinspan says. ""So the next step was to figure out what was being secreted to cause this effect on the oligodendrocytes.""The researchers had a clue to go on: Glutamate, a neurotransmitter, is known to have neurotoxic effects when it reaches high levels. ""If you have too much glutamate, you're in big trouble,"" says Grinspan. Sure enough, when the researchers applied a compound that blunts glutamate levels to HIV-infected macrophages before the transfer of the growth medium to oligodendrocyte precursors, the cells were able to mature into oligodendrocytes. The result suggests that glutamate secreted by the infected macrophages was the culprit behind the precursor cells getting ""stuck"" in their immature form.There was another mechanism, however, that the researchers suspected might be involved: the integrated stress response. This response integrates signals from four different signaling pathways, resulting in changes in gene expression that serve to protect the cell from stress or to prompt the cell to die, if the stress is overwhelming. Earlier findings from Jordan-Sciutto's lab had found the integrated stress response was activated in other types of brain cells in patients who had cognitive impairment associated with HIV infection, so the team looked for its involvement in oligodendrocytes as well.Indeed, they found evidence that the integrated stress response was activated in cultures of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.Taking this information with what they had found out about glutamate, ""Lindsay was able to tie these two things together,"" Jordan-Sciutto says. She demonstrated that HIV-infected macrophages secreted glutamate, which activated the integrated stress response by turning on a pathway governed by an enzyme called PERK. ""If you blocked glutamate, you prevented the activation of the integrated stress response,"" Jordan-Sciutto says.To take these findings further, and potentially test out new drug targets to address HIV-related cognitive impairments, the team hopes to use a well-characterized rat model of HIV infection.""HIV is a human disease, so it's a hard one to model,"" says Grinspan. ""We want to find out if this model recapitulates human disease more accurately than others we've used in the past.""By tracking white matter in this animal model and comparing it to imaging studies done on patients with HIV, they hope to get at a better understanding of what factors shape white matter loss. They're particularly interested in looking at a cohort of adolescents being treated at CHOP, as teens are a group in whom HIV infection rates are climbing.Ultimately, the researchers want to discern the effects of the virus from the drugs used to treat it in order to better evaluate the risks of each.""When we put people on ART, especially kids or adolescents, it's important to understand the implications of doing that,"" says Jordan-Sciutto. ""Antiretrovirals may prevent the establishment of a viral reservoir in the central nervous system, which would be wonderful, but we also know that the drugs can cause harm, particularly to white matter.""And then of course we can't forget the 37 million HIV-infected individuals who live outside the United States and may not have access to antiretrovrials like the patients here,"" she says. ""We want to know how we can help them too.""Reference: Roth LM, Akay-Espinoza C, Grinspan JB, Jordan-Sciutto KL.

Researchers at Aalto University have now developed a new audio technique that enables people to also hear ultrasonic sources that generate sound at frequencies above 20,000 Hz with simultaneous perception of their direction. The results have been published in Scientific Reports on 2 June 2021.'In our study, we used bats in their natural habitat as sources of ultrasonic sound. With our new technique, we can now hear the directions-of-arrival of bat sounds, which means we can track bats in flight and hear where they are - we're essentially giving ourselves super hearing,' says Professor Ville Pulkki from Aalto University.Small devices have been used before to listen to bats but previous versions haven't allowed listeners to locate the bats, just hear them. With their device the researchers record ultrasound using an array of microphones flush mounted and uniformly distributed on the surface of a small sphere. After the signal has been pitch-shifted to audible frequencies, the sound is played back on the headphones immediately. Currently, the pitch-shifting is performed on a computer, but, in the future, it could be done with electronics attached to the headphones.'A sound-field analysis is performed on the microphone signals, and as a result we obtain the most prominent direction of the ultrasonic sound field and a parameter that suggests that the sound comes only from a single source. After this, a single microphone signal is brought to the audible frequency range of human hearing and its single-source signal is played back on the headphones so that the listener can perceive the source from the direction the sound was analysed to arrive,' Pulkki says.On top of its popular appeal, the technique has tangible real-world applications.'In science and art, people have always been interested in how they could improve their senses. Finding sources of ultrasonic sound is also useful in many practical situations, such as finding leaks in pressurised gas pipes. Minor pipe leaks often produce strong ultrasound emissions not detected by normal hearing. The device allows us to spot the sound source quickly,' Pulkki explains.'Sometimes, damaged electrical equipment also emit ultrasound, and the device could be used for locating faulty equipment faster in places such as data centres,' he continues.Reference: Pulkki V, McCormack L, Gonzalez R.

Parkinson's symptoms of muscle stiffness, tremor and slowness of movement can be treated with a medication call levodopa that temporarily restores dopamine. However, that process of rising and falling levels of dopamine throughout the day can cause dyskinesia, a side effect of medication that may include twisting, swaying or head bobbing.Deep brain stimulation controls motor symptoms from Parkinson's disease with electrodes that are placed in certain areas of the brain. The electrodes are connected to a device placed under the skin in the upper chest. The device controls the electrical impulses.""Deep brain stimulation benefits seem to last for several years but not enough data have been available to show that these effects are still present more than 15 years after surgery,"" said study author Elena Moro, MD, PhD, of the Grenoble Alpes University in France and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology. ""We wanted to know if people with Parkinson's disease continue to benefit from this treatment. It is exciting to report that our study found in the long run, deep brain stimulation continues to be effective in people with Parkinson's disease.""For the study, researchers identified 51 people who had a deep brain stimulation device implanted at the university hospital. The average age for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was 40. The average age for device implantation was 51. Study participants had the device an average of 17 years.Researchers reviewed data for each participant on movement problems, quality of life, medication and scores on tests that measure the severity and progression of Parkinson's disease.Researchers found that when comparing data on participants before having a device implanted to data 15 years later, the amount of time participants experienced dyskinesia was reduced by 75%.Researchers also found the amount of time spent in an ""off state,"" when medication was no longer working well, was reduced by 59%. Also, the use of medications to control dopamine levels was reduced by 51%.Researchers found few side effects of having the stimulation for 15 years and such side effects were mostly manageable.""Our study also found that despite the natural progression of Parkinson's disease and the worsening of some symptoms that become resistant to medications over the years, participants still maintained an overall improvement in quality of life,"" said Moro. ""Future studies should continue to examine the benefits of deep brain stimulation over longer periods of time and in larger groups of people.""A limitation of the study was that many of the people who had deep brain stimulation at the hospital were not available for study 15 years later, either because researchers were no longer able to contact them or because they had died. It is possible that the people in the study may have been healthier than those not included, meaning the results may not fully reflect the experience of all people using deep brain stimulation.Reference: Bove F, Mulas D, Cavallieri F, et al.

""The new interpretation accounts for the data while undermining all the reasons to think it challenges free will.""The debate over free will centers mostly around research from the 1980s that used electroencephalograms to study brain activity. The EEG-based research measured when electrical signals begin to build in the brain relative to when a person is aware of their desire to make a movement. The averaged data described a ramp before movement that became known as the ""readiness potential,"" or ""RP.""The 1980s research, conducted by neurophysiologist Benjamin Libet, contended that if the readiness potential was evident prior to a person having a conscious thought about moving, free will could not be responsible for either the buildup of electrical signals or the subsequent movement.According to the research team, this part of Libet's logic was based on a premise that is likely false.""Because the averaged readiness potential reliably precedes voluntary movement, people assumed that it reflected a process specifically directed at producing that movement. As it turns out, and as our model has shown, that is not necessarily the case,"" said Aaron Schurger, an assistant professor of psychology at Chapman University who co-wrote of the article.The article highlights new research using computational modeling that indicates that the standard interpretation of the readiness potential should be reassessed, particularly for its relevance to the question of free will.The study points to findings that suggest that the readiness potential--the pre-movement buildup of activity--reflects the neural activity that underlies the formation of a decision to move, rather than the outcome of a decision to move.""These new computational models account for the consistent finding of the readiness potential without positing anything like an RP in individual trials. The readiness potential itself is a kind of artifact or illusion, one which would be expected to appear just as it does given the experimental design, but doesn't reflect a real brain signal that begins with the RP onset or is read out by other areas,"" said Roskies.The article also highlights several challenges to the idea that the readiness potential causes humans to act: difficulty distinguishing the readiness potential from other electrical signals in the brain; the presence of a readiness potential when tasks do not involve motor activity; and ""noise"" in analyses which makes it difficult to confirm whether the readiness potential always predicts movement.False positives, in which readiness potential is observed but fails to initiate movement, and inconsistencies in the amount of time between the buildup of the brain waves and movement also complicate the understanding of the connection between the electrical activity in the brain and free will.Finally, the article emphasizes the philosophical aspects of attempting to address the problem of free will with brain data.Pengbo Hu at Pomona College and Joanna Pak from Chapman University, also contributed to this paper.Reference: Schurger A, Hu P  Ben,  Pak J, Roskies AL.

""We know very little about whether there are resident microbes in oysters, and if there are, what their function may be or how they may help or bring harm to the oyster.""Zhang and doctoral student Zachary Pimentel extracted the DNA of microbes living in or on the gut, gill, inner shell, mantle and other tissues of oysters to identify the microbes that live there. They then applied a metagenomics technology to reconstruct the genome of the most abundant microbes to better understand the nature of the oyster microbiome and the function of some of the microbes.""This was the first overview of what microbes live in certain parts of Eastern oysters,"" said Pimentel, the lead author on a paper about the study published in May by the American Society for Microbiology. ""In humans, we know that the microbes that live in the gut versus the skin are quite different. But we didn't know about the compartmentalization of certain microbes in certain oyster tissues.""The researchers identified one microbe, a bacterium in the class Mollicutes, that gains energy from the consumption of chitin, a substance found throughout the marine environment. It was most abundant in the gut of the oysters and appears to be an indicator of a healthy oyster, but when found in other tissues, it may be correlated with infections.""When they're abundant in the gut of healthy oysters, that may indicate that the oysters are happy to have them,"" Zhang said. ""But when the microbe gains abundance in other tissues, that may be a sign that the oyster is not doing well, maybe because the immune system is freaked out.""The same microbe was also discovered to consume arginine, an amino acid found in all organisms that is used to create proteins.""We're really interested in that one because it has potential implications for the immune system of oysters,"" Pimentel said. ""Oysters rely on arginine for its immune response. A pathogen has been found to steal the arginine to hide from the oyster's immune system, so it's really interesting that there's another microbe that uses arginine and has potential implications for oyster immunity.""Once the researchers have identified the function of key beneficial microbes, the next step is to learn when and where the microbes are acquired.""One microbe was found to be abundant in adult oysters but very rare in larval samples,"" Zhang said. ""So they could be acquired at some point in their growth, but when and how they are acquired is a big question. If we know they are important and we can identify the source of where they came from, then perhaps we can help preserve the population of this specific microbe.""According to Zhang and Pimentel, oysters play an important role in building reefs, filtering water, and providing other ecological functions, in addition to their role in supporting the aquaculture industry. Further research about the microbiome of oysters could be beneficial to understanding more about oyster health and the health of their ecosystem.""We know for other organisms that the microbiome is a really important factor when considering health and disease, so we're laying the groundwork for future research that might implicate certain microbes in important processes related to health and disease,"" Pimentel said.""The more we know about oysters and their interactions with microbes, the more we'll understand about how to conserve them,"" added Zhang.Reference: Pimentel ZT, Dufault-Thompson K, Russo KT, et al.

The study is published today in BMC Genomics.First author of the study Lily Peck is studying on the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Partnership at the Grantham Institute and the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial. She said:  Using ever-higher volumes of chemicals and fungicides to fight emerging crop diseases is neither sustainable nor affordable for many growers. If we can instead understand how new types of diseases evolve, we can give growers the knowledge they need to reduce the risk of new diseases emerging in the first place. The team re-animated cryogenically frozen samples of the fungus that causes Coffee Wilt Disease. There have been two serious outbreaks of the disease, in the 1920s-1950s and between the 1990s-2000s, and it still causes damage. For example, in 2011, 55,000 Robusta coffee trees were killed by wilt in Tanzania, destroying 160T of coffee in the process   equivalent to over 22 million cups of coffee.In the outbreak beginning in the 1920s, Coffee Wilt Disease infected a wide range of coffee varieties, and was eventually brought under control in the 1950s by management practices such as burning infected trees, seeking natural resistance in coffee, and breeding programs that selected for more resistant plant varieties.However, the disease re-emerged in the 1970s and spread extensively through the 1990s-2000s. Two separate disease populations have been identified with each only infecting specific types of coffee: one infecting Arabica coffee in Ethiopia, and the other infecting Robusta coffee in east and central Africa. The team wanted to investigate how the two strains had emerged.In a secure lab at CABI, they re-awakened two strains from the original outbreak, collected in the 1950s and deposited into CABI s collection, and two strains each from the two coffee-specific fungal strains, with the most recent from 2003. They then sequenced the genomes of the fungi and examined their DNA for evidence of changes that could have helped them infect these specific coffee varieties.They discovered the newer, variety-specific fungi have larger genomes than the earlier strains, and they identified genes that could have helped the fungi overcome plants  defences and survive within the plants to trigger disease.These genes were also found to be highly similar to those found in a different, closely related fungus that affects over 120 different crops, including bananas in sub-Saharan Africa, causing Panama disease, which is currently devastating today's most popular variety, the Cavendish banana.While strains of this banana-infecting fungus are known to be able to swap genes, conferring the ability to infect new varieties, the potential transfer of their genes to a different species of fungi has not been seen before. However, the team note that the two species sometimes live in close proximity on the roots of coffee and banana plants, and so it is possible that the coffee fungus gained these advantageous genes from its normally banana-based neighbour.Coffee and bananas are often grown together, as coffee plants like the shade provided by the taller banana plants. The researchers say their study could suggest not growing crops with closely related diseases together, like banana and coffee, could reduce the possibility of new strains of coffee-killing fungi evolving.The researchers are now using the re-animated strains to infect coffee plants in the lab, in order to study exactly how the fungus infects the plant, potentially providing other ways to prevent the disease taking hold.The insights could also be applied to different crop plants, where other closely related plant pathogens could make similar leaps, causing new diseases to emerge. Having shown the value of examining historical specimens of plant disease, the team plan to replicate the study with other diseases stored in CABI s collection, which hosts 30,000 specimens collected from around the world over the past 100 years.Lead researcher Professor Timothy Barraclough, from the Department of Zoology at Oxford and the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said:  The historical approach shows us what happens to a plant pathogen before and after a new outbreak of disease occurs. We can then study the mechanisms of evolution and improve predictions of how similar outbreaks could occur in the future. Our aim is to replicate this study for many plant pathogens, eventually drawing up a  rule book  of how pathogenicity evolves, helping us to prevent future outbreaks where possible.

It protects the brain from infection and helps injured tissues heal, but it also causes autoimmune diseases and creates inflammation that drives neurodegeneration.Two new studies in mice suggest that the double-edged nature of the relationship between the immune system and the brain may come down to the origins of the immune cells that patrol the meninges, the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. In complementary studies published June 3 in the journal Science, two teams of researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis unexpectedly found that many of the immune cells in the meninges come from bone marrow in the skull and migrate to the brain through special channels without passing through the blood.These skull-derived immune cells are peacekeepers, dedicated to maintaining a healthy status quo. It's the other immune cells, the ones that arrive from the bloodstream, that seem to be the troublemakers. They carry genetic signatures that mark them as likely to promote autoimmunity and inflammation, and they become more abundant with aging or under conditions of disease or injury. Taken together, the findings reveal a key aspect of the connection between the brain and the immune system that could inform our understanding of a wide range of brain disorders.""There has been this gap in our knowledge that applies to almost every neurological disease: neuro-COVID, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, you name it,"" said Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor of Pathology & Immunology and a BJC Investigator. Kipnis is the senior author on one of the papers. ""We knew immune cells were involved in neurological conditions, but where were they coming from? What we've found is that there's a new source that hasn't been described before for these cells.""Earlier this year, Kipnis showed that immune cells stationed in the meninges keep tabs on the brain. As part of these new studies, Kipnis and Marco Colonna, MD, the Robert Rock Belliveau, MD, Professor of Pathology and the senior author on the other paper, independently launched projects to find where such cells come from. Kipnis focused on the innate arm of the immune system and Colonna on the adaptive arm. Innate immune cells are responsible for inflammation, which helps defend against infection and heal injuries, but also can damage tissues and contribute to degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Adaptive immune cells are capable of specifically targeting undesirables such as viruses and tumors, but they also can mistakenly home in on the body's own healthy tissues, resulting in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.Colonna and colleagues -- including co-first authors Simone Brioschi, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher, Wei-Le Wang, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher, and Vincent Peng, a graduate student -- traced the development of B cells, antibody-producing members of the adaptive immune system. They found that most B cells in the meninges arose and matured in the skull bone marrow. As B cells mature, they must be taught to distinguish between normal proteins from the body, which pose no threat, and foreign proteins that signal infection or disease and require a response. For B cells destined for a life patrolling the boundaries of the central nervous system, the skull is a convenient site for this education.""B cells in the bone marrow of the skull come into contact with the central nervous system and are educated by the central nervous system,"" said Colonna, who is also a professor of medicine. ""That would not happen if they were released into the blood. Because they are directly in contact with the brain, they learn to be tolerant of brain proteins.""Along with the tolerant B cells derived from the skull, the researchers also discovered a population of B cells that come into the meninges from the blood. These blood-derived B cells are not trained to ignore normal central nervous system proteins. Some of these cells may wrongly recognize harmless central nervous system proteins as foreign and produce antibodies against them, Colonna said. Moreover, the number of these blood-derived B cells increases with age, providing a clue to why the risk of neuro-immune conditions is higher in older people.Meanwhile, Kipnis' team -- led by co-first authors Andrea Cugurra, a graduate student, Tornike Mamuladze, MD, a visiting researcher, and Justin Rustenhoven, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher -- was searching for the source of meningeal myeloid cells, a group of innate immune cells. They found that myeloid cells arose in the bone marrow of the skull and spinal vertebrae and entered the meninges via direct channels through the bone.Using mouse models of multiple sclerosis and of brain and spinal cord injuries, Kipnis and colleagues found that myeloid cells swarm into the brain and spinal cord in response to injury or disease. Most of the entering cells are drawn from the resident population of myeloid cells in the meninges. These are biased toward regulating and modulating the immune response. But some myeloid cells come in from the blood, and these are more inflammatory, capable of causing damage if not properly controlled.""Understanding where these cells come from and how they behave is a critical part of understanding the basic mechanisms of neuro-immune interactions, so we can design new therapeutic approaches for neurological conditions associated with inflammation,"" said Kipnis, who is also a professor of neurosurgery, of neurology and of neuroscience. ""The location of these cells in the skull makes them relatively accessible, and opens up the possibility of designing therapies to alter the behavior of these cells and treat neuro-immune conditions.""Reference:Cugurra A, Mamuladze T, Rustenhoven J, et al.

Although several vaccines have recently become available, making significant strides towards preventing COVID-19, what about the treatment of those who already have the infection? Vaccines aren't 100% effective, highlighting the need--now more than ever--for effective antiviral therapeutics. Moreover, some people can't receive vaccines due to health issues, and new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that can penetrate vaccine-conferred immunity, are being reported, indicating that we need to think beyond prevention.Given this need, a team of researchers based in Japan, the US, and the UK launched a project to develop effective therapeutics. This team included several researchers based at Tokyo University of Science: Visiting Professor Koichi Watashi, Dr. Hirofumi Ohashi, Professor Shin Aoki, Professor Kouji Kuramochi, and Assistant Professor Tomohiro Tanaka. Their goal was clear and simple: finding a cure for COVID-19.To achieve this goal, the researchers first established an experimental system for screening drugs that may help to control infections. This system used a type of cells called VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, which were manipulated to efficiently be infected with and produce SARS-CoV-2. ""To determine whether a drug of interest could help combat infection by SARS-CoV-2, we simply had to expose VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells to both the drug and SARS-CoV-2 and then observe whether the drug's presence served to hinder the virus's efforts to infect cells,"" explains Professor Watashi.The researchers used this experimental system to screen a panel of drugs that are already approved for clinical use, including drugs like remdesivir and chloroquine that have already being approved or are being trialed as treatments for COVID-19. In an exciting outcome, the researchers found two drugs that provided effective SARS-CoV-2 suppression: cepharanthine, which is used to treat inflammation, and nelfinavir, which is approved for the treatment of HIV infection.Cepharanthine inhibited the entry of the virus into cells by preventing the virus from binding to a protein on the cell membrane, which it uses as a gateway. In contrast, nelfinavir worked to prevent the virus from replicating inside the cell by inhibiting a protein that the virus relies on for replication. Given that these drugs have distinct antiviral mechanisms, using both of them together could be especially effective for patients, with computational models predicting that combined cepharanthine/nelfinavir therapy can hasten the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from a patient's lungs by as few as 4.9 days.So, does this mean we will be seeing these new drugs in COVID-19 treatment centers? Of course, the drug duo isn't ready to be rolled out into healthcare systems just yet. These findings justify further research into the clinical potential of cepharanthine/nelfinavir therapy, and only following this can we say for sure that it is useful and helpful.Nevertheless, given the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ever-increasing death toll, the development of cepharanthine/nelfinavir therapy may provide clinicians and patients with a much-needed new treatment option.Reference: Ohashi H, Watashi K, Saso W, et al.

The subjects listened to a sound file that exemplified the speech-to-song illusion, then completed surveys relating to three different studies.""In the first study, we just played them the canonical stimulus made by the researcher that discovered this illusion -- if that can't create the illusion, then nothing can,"" said co-author Michael Vitevitch, professor of psychology at KU. ""Then we simply asked people, 'Did you experience the illusion or not?' There was no difference in the age of the number of people that said yes or no.""Your browser does not support this element. Can you hear the speech-to-song illusion in this audio clip used in the study? Credit: KU While the researchers hypothesized fewer older people would perceive the illusion than younger people, the study showed no difference due to age.While older and younger people perceived the speech-to-song illusion at the same rates, in the second study investigators sought to discover if older people experienced it less powerfully.""We thought maybe 'yes or no' was too coarse of a measurement, so let's try to use a five-point rating scale,"" Vitevitch said. ""Maybe older adults would rate it as being a little bit more speech-like and younger adults will rate it as being more song-like and you'll see it on this five-point scale, maybe. But there was no difference in the numbers with the younger and older adults.""In the third study, Vitevitch wanted to see if older adults perhaps experience the illusion more slowly than younger people.""We thought maybe it's not the strength of the illusion that's different but maybe it's when the illusion occurred,"" he said. ""So, we did a final study and asked people to click a button on the screen when their perception shifted from speech to song -- we thought maybe older adults would need a few more repetitions for it to switch over. But we got the same number for both younger adults and older.""Vitevitch's co-authors were KU undergraduate researchers Hollie Mullin, Evan Norkey and Anisha Kodwani, as well as Nichol Castro of the University of Buffalo.According to Vitevitch, the findings might translate to good news for older adults.""We have this common misconception that everything goes downhill cognitively as we age,"" said the KU researcher. ""That's not the case. There are some things that do get worse with age, but there are some things that actually get better with age, and some things that stay consistent with age --in the case of this illusion, you're going to get equally suckered whether you're an older adult or a younger adult.""In another aspect of the research, the investigators found people with musical training experienced the speech-to-song illusion at similar rates as people with no background in music.""There's a debate about whether musicians or musically trained people experienced the illusion more or less or sooner or more strongly,"" Vitevitch said. ""We looked at it and there was really no difference there either. Musicians and non-musically trained people experience this at about the same rates and have the same sort of experience. The amount of musical training didn't matter. It was just amazingly consistent however we looked at it."" Not everybody experiences the speech-to-song illusion. The study found about 73% of participants heard spoken words become song-like after several repetitions.

This in turn causes inflammation, the pain and swelling that come as immune cells rush into damaged or infected tissue, but often in the wrong amount or context. Called immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, they are typically treated with drugs that reduce inflammation, including methotrexate.Led by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the new study looked specifically at patients' responses to the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, which they measured by looking at the antibodies produced in each patient by the vaccine. Once injected into the body, vaccine ingredients are meant to trigger the production of antibodies, immune proteins that specifically glom onto this viral target protein, disabling it and tagging it for removal from the body.The lower antibody response in patients who take methotrexate does not necessarily mean that these patients are not protected against COVID-19, cautions co-first study author Rebecca Haberman, MD, clinical instructor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone Health.""It is most important to state that patients should not be concerned about our study findings as the majority of patients with immune system disorders are responding well to the mRNA vaccines,"" Dr. Haberman says. ""It is also possible that methotrexate is delaying, rather than preventing, an adequate immune response against COVID-19.""Researchers have known that rheumatoid arthritis patients who take methotrexate have a reduced response to seasonal flu vaccines. Because mRNA vaccines use a new mechanism of action that patients with these common immune disorders have not seen before, the researchers wanted to determine how well these patients are protected.The research was conducted at NYU Langone and at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen Nuremberg in Germany and enrolled healthy people and patients treated for common immune-mediated disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Study participants received two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The researchers analyzed blood samples to determine the amount of antibodies patients produced after receiving the vaccine and measured the activation of key immune system cells, including CD8 killer T cells, which are generated as part of the body's immune response.The researchers found that over 90 percent of healthy subjects and patients taking drugs other than methotrexate to control inflammation in both the New York and German study groups mounted strong antibody responses. Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders who were taking methotrexate achieved an adequate response in only 62 percent of cases. Similarly, while healthy patients and those with common immune disorders who were taking anti-inflammatory drugs other than methotrexate produced CD8 T cells, patients taking methotrexate did not show an increase in CD8 T cell activation after vaccination.""More research is needed to understand why such a significant proportion of people with common immune disorders who take methotrexate have deficiencies in mounting an antibody and cellular response,"" says study co-senior author Jose U. Scher, MD, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone. ""This may not necessarily mean that the vaccine is not efficacious, but that alternate vaccine strategies need to be investigated.""These alternate vaccine strategies include potentially discontinuing methotrexate during the time these patients receive the vaccine, changing the dosage of methotrexate or possibly administering a booster shot to the vaccine, says Dr. Scher, who is also director of the Psoriatic Arthritis Center at NYU Langone. The research team is currently leading studies to determine the best course of action for these patients.Reference: Haberman RH, Herati R, Simon D, et al.

""We have identified promising existing drugs and are also leveraging our findings to develop optimized antivirals that will be more effective against SARS-CoV-2, including variants and drug resistant strains, as well as against other coronaviruses that currently exist or might emerge in future.""In a collaboration between Calibr, the drug discovery division of Scripps Research, and a team of researchers in the institute's Department of Immunology and Microbiology, the study tested more than 12,000 drugs in two different types of human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.The drugs used in the study came from the ReFRAME drug repurposing library, which was established by Calibr in 2018 with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to tackle areas of urgent unmet medical need, especially neglected tropical diseases. The collection contains FDA-approved drugs and other experimental compounds that have been tested for safety in humans.""Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw that ReFRAME could be leveraged to screen for hits against SARS-CoV-2,"" says Arnab Chatterjee, PhD, vice president of medicinal chemistry at Calibr. ""In the months that followed, we launched many scientific collaborations to speed drug discovery, both internally at Scripps Research and with partners nationally and internationally.""In the Scripps Research study, the scientists treated two different types of laboratory-cultured SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells with each of the 12,000 drugs from ReFRAME. After 24 or 48 hours, they measured the level of viral infection in the cells to determine if the drugs prevented the virus from replicating. In some cases, they applied two drugs at a time to see if the compounds would work together against the virus.""Some of the most effective antiviral strategies are 'cocktails' in which patients are given several different drugs to combat the infection, such as those used to treat HIV infections,"" says the study's corresponding author Thomas Rogers, MD, PhD, an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research and assistant professor of Medicine at UC San Diego.From the thousands of drugs screened, the researchers identified a total of 90 compounds that prevented SARS-CoV-2 from replicating in at least one of the human cell lines. Of those, 13 had the highest potential to be repurposed as COVID-19 therapies, based on their potency, cell line-independent activity or a likely mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic properties and human safety profiles.Four of the drugs--halofantrine, nelfinavir, simeprevir and manidipine--are already FDA approved and nine others are in various stages of the drug development process.From the drug combination screens, the researchers found 19 drugs that had an additive effect when administered with remdesivir, the antiviral produced by the pharmaceutical company Gilead that is FDA approved for use in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. An additive effect means that the drugs were both active against the virus when applied together.""The potential advantage of a therapeutic strategy that uses a combination of drugs is that taking a lower dose of any one drug could reduce the risk of side effects of that drug,"" says Malina Bakowski, PhD, the lead author on the Nature Communications paper and principal investigator at Calibr.Two additional drugs went a step further to have a synergistic effect on remdesivir, meaning the drugs heightened remdesivir's ability to suppress the virus. These two drugs were riboprine, a compound that's been tested as a preventative for nausea and surgical infection, and 10-deazaaminopterin, a derivative of the vitamin folic acid.Based on the results of cell culture screens, the researchers tested the best-performing drug candidates in human tissue cells and an animal model to determine which are most likely to work in human patients. Building on their success in identifying potential COVID-19 therapies, the Scripps Research team is continuing to advance other promising candidates through their drug discovery pipeline.""The results from the cellular assays and animal models are very promising and the need for medical remedies to address COVID-19 remains urgent,"" says Schultz.

The results from a clinical trial at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital were published online in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment May 10, 2021.Quing Zhu, professor of biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering and of radiology at the School of Medicine, led a team of engineers and radiologists in the three-year clinical trial involving patients with various types of breast cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+), and estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (ER+/HER2-). By conducting imaging after the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which ranges from two to three weeks depending on the type of treatment regimen used, Zhu said. The prediction model based on tumor biomarkers and imaging parameters can predict how well the cancer is responding.""We found that the tumor biomarkers and near-infrared and ultrasound imaging parameters together would be the best earlier predictors to give us an area under the receiving operating curve, or AUC, of 0.94,"" said Zhu, a pioneer of combining ultrasound and near-infrared imaging modalities for cancer diagnosis and treatment assessment. ""If we extended the imaging to the end of cycle 3 of neoadjuvant treatment, 1 1/2 to two months into the six-month treatment period, the prediction can reach AUC 0.97, the best in the literature regarding monitoring neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment response.""In the study, 38 women patients with breast cancer underwent ultrasound and ultrasound-guided DOT prior to beginning neoadjuvant chemotherapy, at the end of each of the first three treatment cycles and prior to surgery. The DOT system consists of a 10-centimeter handheld probe and a near-infrared system developed in Zhu's lab that takes data noninvasively from the breast from nine sources and 14 detectors in less than 4 seconds.""In this technology, the near-infrared light is delivered to the breast tissue and gets absorbed by the tumor,"" Zhu said. ""If there is no tumor, there will be a stronger reflection of the light back to the breast tissue surface. Using a tomography image reconstruction algorithm, the tumor absorption map can be reconstructed, and the total hemoglobin concentration can be computed from absorption maps of multiple optical wavelengths. Total hemoglobin concentration is directly related to tumor vasculature. This technology is very sensitive, and light penetration depth can reach 4 centimeters to 5 centimeters, but the resolution is low, so we couple it with the ultrasound to improve the resolution.""Through this dual-modality combination, the researchers can determine if the vasculature, or blood vessel network, of the tumor is reducing and the tumor size is shrinking, which predicts a good treatment response, Zhu said. Otherwise, the tumor may not respond to treatment, and physicians may consider either early surgery or change to a different treatment regimen to improve patient treatment outcomes.Going forward, Zhu would like to make the DOT system smaller so that it can be used at the patient's bedside in the infusion clinics. Eventually, she would like to integrate it with an existing ultrasound machine, which is compact and low-cost, to provide a dual-modality imaging assessment. She is working with the university's Office of Technology Management to commercialize the technology, which has US Patents pending.""We could image the patient right before treatment and at early treatment cycles to help physicians decide who is responding and who is not responding,"" she said. ""If we can decide this early on, we don't have to continue to give the patient the toxic chemotherapy drugs and find out at the end of treatment that tumors do not respond to the drugs.""Reference: Zhu Q, Ademuyiwa FO, Young C, et al. early assessment window for predicting breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy using biomarkers, ultrasound, and diffuse optical tomography.

The sediments preserved at Charyn Canyon acted as a litmus test for the influx of freshwater into the Arctic Ocean, stimulating the transport of moist air masses from the North Atlantic back onto land via westerly air flows,"" corresponding author Prud'homme says. The results of the research have now been published in the scientific journal Communications Earth and Environment.The researchers focused their investigation on the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods. The Pliocene, five to 2.6 million years ago, represents the best analogue for the climatic conditions of the Anthropocene: this geologic time period was the last time concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was comparable to today, around 400 parts per million (ppm). ""That's why our insights from the Charyn Canyon sediments are so essential for understanding future climate,"" Prud'homme says.Until now, little has been known about the role Central Asia plays in global climate evolution past and present. Earth's climate evolution over the past five million years has been understood mainly from the perspective of marine mechanisms. In contrast, the significance of climate feedbacks that originated on land - rather than in the oceans, lakes or ice cores - has remained largely unexplored. The international research team has filled this gap with their field research in Charyn Canyon.","Published: June 4, 2021"

The treatment alters the function of the body's phagocytes and facilitates extensive activation of the immune system.The immune defense is the body's own defense system equipped to combat cancer. However, cancer learns to hide from immune attacks and harnesses this system to promote its own growth. Therefore, it would be beneficial to be able to return the immune defense back to restricting the advancement of cancer.Macrophages, a type of white blood cell, are central in the fight against cancer. Cancer educates macrophages to subdue the defense system and renders many treatments targeting the immune system ineffective.Academy Research Fellow Maija Hollm n's research group has searched for means of altering the activity of macrophages in order to direct the immune defense to attack cancer. The antibody bexmarilimab, developed based on this research and in collaboration with Faron Pharmaceuticals, is currently undergoing clinical trials in patients. Hollm n's group has studied the changes occurring in the defense systems of patients with cancer following antibody treatment.""In the majority of patients, the antibody treatment activated killer T cells, which are the body's strike force against cancer. Additionally, the antibody treatment successfully lowered the suppressive potential of macrophage precursors travelling in the blood circulation. The patients also showed increases in certain mediators of inflammation and types of white blood cell in the blood,"" describes Hollm n.""The activation of the killer T cells is a very promising demonstration of the antibody's capability to boost the defense system against cancer. The treated patients had very advanced and poorly treatable cancers, which highlights the significance of the results,"" says Doctoral Candidate Jenna Rannikko.","Published: June 4, 2021"

Selective breeding for desired traits has created nearly 200 different breeds of dog, each with their own distinct temperament. One characteristic shared by all dog breeds is an ability to closely socialize, communicate and bond with humans. For years, researchers have wondered to what extent this inter-species social bond is driven by dog genetics, or by their environmental interaction with humans.To answer this question, some lucky researchers at the University of Arizona conducted a study with 375 8-week-old puppies. Their research is published in the journal Current Biology.The team, including lead author Dr Emily Bray, a postdoctoral researcher at the Arizona Canine Cognition Center, had their pooch participants, a mix of Labradors, Golden Retrievers or Lab-Golden crosses, conduct a series of behavioral tasks.In the first task, which assessed how they responded to human social signals, a researcher stood in front of a puppy between two upturned cups. Under one cup lay a treat. The researchers then either pointed at the treat cup, or placed a colored marker beside it, stating the satisfyingly jargon-free phrase:  Puppy, look! The puppies  behavior was then recorded. From the very earliest trials, the puppies, who had minimal interaction with humans prior to this point, were still able to understand from the researcher s actions that they should investigate the treat-containing cup. Collectively, they were able to find the treat roughly 67% of the time, a level significantly above chance (if the dogs had been choosing a cup at random). When the researchers did not prompt the puppy, success reduced to chance level, showing that the dogs were not just sniffing out the hidden treat.A third task had the researchers read from a pre-prepared puppy script. Here s a direct sample from the script:  Hi pup! Are you a good puppy? Yes, you are. What a good puppy. Aww, look how cute you are. Look at those big eyes and floppy ears ).The researchers measured how long the puppies made eye contact with them  during this spiel and then how long they were willing to spend receiving pats when they were allowed to approach the researcher afterwards. In contrast, the dogs paid much less attention to the researchers during a task that did not involve an interaction started by the researcher, the so-called  unsolvable  task. Lead author Dr Emily Bray poses with some study participants. Credit: Bray et al, 2021.  The 'unsolvable' task is one that has been used to assess problem-solving strategies in adult dogs and wolves   when confronted with an insurmountable obstacle (in this case, accessing food in a locked Tupperware), what is an individual s go-to strategy?  explained Bray in an interview with Technology Networks.Wider research has shown that dogs are much more likely to seek help from humans during an ""unsolvable"" task than more independently minded wolves. Bray explained that young puppies may not have yet learned to seek such help from humans, even if they were already able to respond to interaction initiated by people around them. This finding, she says,  mimics human development:  Human infants are similarly receptive to social communication (e.g., following a point, understanding language) earlier than they can generate it (e.g., producing a point, speaking first words). The researchers then used genetic analyses to examine the underpinnings of their behavioral findings. Their cohort of puppies was taken from the Canine Companions for Independence (CCI), the largest non-profit provider of service dogs for people with disabilities in the US. The puppies, all had established pedigrees going back several generations, allowing Bray and colleagues to assess how much of the dogs  performance in the social tasks varied according to genetics. They found that these social communicative skills were roughly 40% heritable, a statistic thought to be similar to the heritability of human intelligence.These findings are the first direct evidence that variation in dog social cognition is heritable, a finding, says Bray, that gives clues to how our canine chums evolved under selective breeding:  If similar heritable variation was present in the wolf populations that gave rise to dogs (thousands of years ago), these social communicative skills would have had strong potential to undergo rapid selection. Early humans may have highly valued the specific traits in a dog that suggest they would work well alongside their owners, much like the dog breeders of today. Bray says,  Dogs  communicative skills uniquely position them to fill the niche that they do alongside humans. Many of the tasks that they perform for us, now and in the past (i.e., herding, hunting, detecting and acting as service dogs), are facilitated by their ability to effectively use our cues. Even with just your run-of-the-mill companion dog, these abilities help foster attachment (we know mutual eye gaze increases oxytocin levels in both species) and strengthen the human-animal bond. While the research did not aim to tease out all of the mechanisms in puppy brains that allow them to understand human signals so clearly   a question that Bray s team suggest will be answered in future studies   what is clear is that working with puppies is extremely enjoyable:  The repetition of the exact same tasks hundreds of times should have become monotonous, but instead the puppies  antics and individual personalities kept us on our toes and made every testing session interesting!  concludes Bray.

Only around 3% of the population has been vaccinated.While there are  plans to significantly ramp up production of the Covaxin and Covishield vaccines, the target to vaccinate around 1 billion people may still not be reached this year, warn the authors. As any protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccine is expected to take at least 2 weeks after both doses, and with large demands, India will require many more sources of vaccines in the coming days and weeks to stem the current uptick in infections,  they write.Initially, Covid-19 vaccination was available only in government hospitals and centres, free of cost, but to expand coverage, the government has allowed private hospitals to vaccinate. These charge anything from $3 to $15, meaning that very few people can afford this cost.  Therefore, for stemming COVID-19, vaccinations must be free for all in India,  the authors insist.  A further complication is that when the Indian government decided to lower the age criteria for the jab it procured 50% of vaccines for its 36 states specifically for the over 45s, with the other half to be procured by state governments and private hospitals for those aged 18-44. State governments have therefore been left to negotiate the costs themselves, which are higher than those negotiated by the government. For instance, one dose of Covaxin costs central government around $2, rising to around $5.4 for state governments, and to around $16 for private hospitals, they point out.  This differential pricing .is likely to be detrimental to public health at this time of grave crisis in India,  creating inequitable distribution and potentially sparking public mistrust, they argue. For India to stem Covid-19, the nation cannot allow any differential approach for its residents,  they write.And in an attempt to create a vaccination records infrastructure for adults and ensure that no one is missed, the Indian government has mandated pre-registration via a mobile app. But only around a third of people in rural areas have an internet connection, point out the authors. A simple vaccination card may be a better option, they suggest.The Indian government has committed around $120 million for Covid-19 vaccine research, most of which is being used to scale up vaccine production, with the rest invested in new vaccine candidates, including those against variant strains.  However, the funding pledged by the government is far from adequate,  warn the authors.  This will be concerning in scenarios where a 3rd booster shot is required. Hence, India needs a corpus of funds for the above that covers all future eventualities of vaccine deployment,  they argue. India may need to reset its vaccine strategies, enhance the competence level of pandemic management and spur the bureaucratic machinery so that vaccine equity can be achieved in a very short span of time,  they conclude.This article has been republished from the following materials.

They also want to clarify how brain wiring and function develops during pregnancy and after birth.The dHCP is a collaboration between King s College London, Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, and the images are the team's third open-source large-scale data release of this project.  The researchers are currently analysing the images to ask questions about how the brain develops and whether early birth negatively affects brain development. They are also looking into using artificial intelligence (AI) to answer these questions. Co-investigator Professor Daniel Rueckert from Imperial s Department of Computing said:  The dHCP dataset presents a unique resource for understanding brain development using advanced computational tools. We have already started exploring the development of AI approaches to ask questions about how the brain develops.  Principal Investigator Professor David Edwards from King s said there have never been this many brain scans of babies put out for researchers to use. He said:  It s completely novel in the sense that it s the largest data set yet created and it s free for people to use. We re providing the world with a chance to make a map of whatever feature of normal development they want to study   whether it s the growth of the frontal lobe, or cerebellar function   whatever it is, this is the data you can use to make your map. These new scans complete a neonatal dataset of brain images and associated clinical data like sex, age at birth, age at scan, birthweight, head circumference and radiology score. The imaging data includes structural imaging to measure and quantify different structures in the brain, structural connectivity data (diffusion MRI) to explore how different brain regions are connected, and functional connectivity data (resting-state fMRI) to measure how different brain regions communicate. For these scans, most of the babies were imaged while naturally asleep. If the baby woke up, scanning was stopped and attempts made to resettle before proceeding. If a baby moved, the team ensured all the data was motion corrected, largely using methods developed specifically for the dHCP project, in order to produce highly detailed and rich information on brain development. Co-investigator Professor Jo Hajnal from King s said: During the project we have developed dedicated receiver coils and patient handling, as well as MR acquisition, image reconstruction and analysis methods all specifically optimised for neonates. We hope that the resulting data will be valuable to many researchers and will provide an enduring resource that will help significantly to drive forward understanding of human brain development.  Co-investigator Professor Steve Smith from the University of Oxford said: ""This is the result of many years hard coordinated work across our 3 universities, and has resulted in the most amazing, rich data on how the brain develops just before and after birth. We're very excited to release the dataset to the international research community.  Future data releases will provide foetal images (imaging babies in the womb), more detailed ancillary data as well as genetic and clinical data. The research consortium is funded by a  15 million Synergy grant from the European Research Council. The aim is to ensure data is shared as widely as possible. Future releases will include data from babies still in the womb as well as information on children s genes and their abilities as they grow up.Researchers can now download the data.Read more: http://www.developingconnectome.org/project/This article has been republished from the following materials.

By also identifying two of these variants in other patient groups, the researchers were able to give a diagnosis to multiple families, ending the  diagnostic odyssey  that many patients and their families face.Globally, around 400,000 babies are born every year with new, spontaneous DNA changes   known as de novo mutations   that interfere with their development. These developmental disorders can lead to conditions such as intellectual disability, epilepsy or heart defects.De novo mutations in genes that create proteins are a well-established cause of developmental disorders, but to date many of the genes linked to these disorders remain unknown. Every person is born with around 60 de novo mutations on average, though the vast majority do not lead to health problems.It is a huge advantage to a patient and their family to know the genetic cause of their disorder. Not only does it provide answers, but it also allows risk prediction for other family members and potentially a gateway into personalised treatment. Given this, the majority of patients with developmental disorders will undergo genetic testing as part of their clinical care, however, this leads to a genetic diagnosis in fewer than half of cases. This genetic testing normally identifies any variants that occur in the parts of the genome that code directly for proteins.Ongoing initiatives, such as the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study, have discovered associated genes by looking for patterns in the genomes of children with these disorders and comparing these to their parents  genomes.In this study, which is part of the wider DDD study, the teams looked in regions of the genome that are immediately adjacent to protein-coding regions, known as untranslated regions, or UTRs.These regions are not coded into the final protein, but instead regulate processes; such as controlling how much protein is made, when it stops and where the protein ends up in the cell.Through computational and lab-based methods, researchers identified six variants in the UTRs that impacted the gene MEF2C, either by changing the levels of gene expression, reducing the amount of protein produced or disrupting the function of the MEF2C protein.By identifying further genetic links to developmental disorders, it is possible to give more people a diagnosis and an understanding of their condition, which can help family planning, as well as potentially opening up new treatment plans and support. This study has highlighted how important it is to look into UTRs and to possibly include them in routine clinical screening. It could also encourage more researchers to have another look at their existing data, possibly finding more important genetic variants in previously unanalysed UTRs.Reference: Wright CF, Quaife NM, Ramos-Hern ndez L, et al.

A baby s prenatal alcohol exposure carries the risk of potential lifelong problems, including premature birth, delayed infant development, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The findings emphasize how many factors influence alcohol use during pregnancy,  says lead author Carson Kautz-Turnbull, a third-year graduate student in the Rochester Department of Psychology whose interests lie in FASD intervention work and reaching underserved populations, including racial minorities, rural populations, and low-income groups.  The more we learn about these factors, the more we can reduce stigma around drinking during pregnancy and help in a way that s empowering and meaningful,  Kautz-Turnbull says.The team followed 246 pregnant women at two sites in western Ukraine over time as part of CIFASD, an international consortium of researchers that researchers at the University s Mt. Hope Family Center are members of, which is funded by the NIH s National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.The team found that higher use of alcohol and tobacco by partners as well as pregnant women s lower relationship satisfaction increased the likelihood of their babies  prenatal alcohol exposure. Conversely, women who felt supported by their partners reported lower rates of depressive symptoms and were less likely to drink during pregnancy.All study participants had a partner; most were married. In their first trimesters, the women reported on their relationship satisfaction, including frequency of quarreling, happiness with the relationship, and the ease of talking to their partners, their partners  substance use, and their socioeconomic status. In the third trimester, the participants were surveyed about their own drinking habits and depressive symptoms. Subsequently, the researchers assessed the infants  mental and psychomotor development around the age of six months.According to the team s analysis, pregnant women s depressive symptoms and drinking directly correlated with their relationships with their partners and to their partners  substance use. (The researchers asked about alcohol and tobacco use only.) Positive partner influences resulted in women s lower alcohol use in late pregnancy and fewer depressive symptoms. The findings applied even when socioeconomic status, which is generally linked to depression and drinking, was taken into account. Higher prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in poorer mental and psychomotor development in the infants, though a mother s prenatal depression did not affect babies the way drinking did.That s why maternal health and pregnancy interventions are likely to be more effective when partners are included, with benefits for both mothers and babies, the team concludes. Interventions addressing the partners  substance use may help reduce pregnant women s substance use, too, while improving their relationship satisfaction, protecting against depression, and boosting infant development.Rochester FASD expert and study coauthor Christie Petrenko, a research associate and assistant professor at the University s Mt. Hope Family Center, is Kautz-Turnbull s doctoral advisor. She says being part of the CIFASD initiative means that talented Rochester students like Kautz-Turnbull can connect with other investigators in the field in order to enrich their research training beyond local projects. While Rochester researchers contribute new data and innovations to CIFASD, such as Petrenko s collaborative work in developing and testing the Families Moving Forward (FMF) Connect app, they have the opportunity to collaborate with other CIFASD investigators on important questions that could otherwise not easily be answered by a single research group.Besides Kautz-Turnbull and Petrenko, the study was coauthored by Rochester s Elizabeth Handley, Emory University s Claire Coles and Julie Kable, University of South Alabama s Wladimir Wertelecki, Lyubov Yevtushok of Omni-Net Centers in Ukraine, Natalya Zymak-Zakutnya of the OMNI-Net for Children International Charitable Fund in Ukraine, Christina Chambers of the University of California, San Diego, and CIFASD.Reference: Kautz-Turnbull C, Petrenko CLM, Handley ED, et al.

Unlike most cases of ALS, the disease began attacking these patients during childhood, worsened more slowly than usual, and was linked to a gene, called SPTLC1, that is part of the body s fat production system. Preliminary results suggested that genetically silencing SPTLC1 activity would be an effective strategy for combating this type of ALS. ALS is a paralyzing and often fatal disease that usually affects middle-aged people. We found that a genetic form of the disease can also threaten children. Our results show for the first time that ALS can be caused by changes in  the way the body metabolizes lipids,  said Carsten B nnemann, M.D., senior investigator at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and a senior author of the study published in Nature Medicine.  We hope these results will help doctors recognize this new form of ALS and lead to the development of treatments that will improve the lives of these children and young adults. We also hope that our results may provide new clues to understanding and treating other forms of the disease. Dr. B nnemann leads a team of researchers that uses advanced genetic techniques to solve some of the most mysterious childhood neurological disorders around the world. In this study, the team discovered that 11 of these cases had ALS that was linked to variations in the DNA sequence of SPLTC1, a gene responsible for manufacturing a diverse class of fats called sphingolipids.In addition, the team worked with scientists in labs led by Teresa M. Dunn, Ph.D., professor and chair at USU, and Thorsten Hornemann, Ph.D., at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. Together they not only found clues as to how variations in the SPLTC1 gene lead to ALS but also developed a strategy for counteracting these problems.The study began with Claudia Digregorio, a young woman from the Apulia region of Italy. Her case had been so vexing that Pope Francis imparted an in-person blessing on her at the Vatican before she left for the United States to be examined by Dr. B nnemann s team at the NIH s Clinical Center.Like many of the other patients, Claudia needed a wheelchair to move around and a surgically implanted tracheostomy tube to help with breathing. Neurological examinations by the team revealed that she and the others had many of the hallmarks of ALS, including severely weakened or paralyzed muscles. In addition, some patients  muscles showed signs of atrophy when examined under a microscope or with non-invasive scanners.Nevertheless, this form of ALS appeared to be different. Most patients are diagnosed with ALS around 50 to 60 years of age. The disease then worsens so rapidly that patients typically die within three to five years of diagnosis. In contrast, initial symptoms, like toe walking and spasticity, appeared in these patients around four years of age. Moreover, by the end of the study, the patients had lived anywhere from five to 20 years longer. These young patients had many of the upper and lower motor neuron problems that are indicative of ALS,  said Payam Mohassel, M.D., an NIH clinical research fellow and the lead author of the study.  What made these cases unique was the early age of onset and the slower progression of symptoms. This made us wonder what was underlying this distinct form of ALS. The first clues came from analyzing the DNA of the patients. The researchers used next-generation genetic tools to read the patients  exomes, the sequences of DNA that hold the instructions for making proteins. They found that the patients had conspicuous changes in the same narrow portion of the SPLTC1 gene. Four of the patients inherited these changes from a parent. Meanwhile, the other six cases appeared to be the result of what scientist call  de novo  mutations in the gene. These types of mutations can spontaneously occur as cells rapidly multiply before or shortly after conception.Mutations in SPLTC1 are also known to cause a different neurological disorder called hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1). The SPLTC1 protein is a subunit of an enzyme, called SPT, which catalyzes the first of several reactions needed to make sphingolipids. HSAN1 mutations cause the enzyme to produce atypical and harmful versions of sphingolipids.At first, the team thought the ALS-causing mutations they discovered may produce similar problems. However, blood tests from the patients showed no signs of the harmful sphingolipids. At that point, we felt like we had hit a roadblock. We could not fully understand how the mutations seen in the ALS patients did not show the abnormalities expected from what was known about SPTLC1 mutations,  said Dr. B nnemann.  Fortunately, Dr. Dunn s team had some ideas. For decades Dr. Dunn s team had studied the role of sphingolipids in health and disease. With the help of the Dunn team, the researchers reexamined blood samples from the ALS patients and discovered that the levels of typical sphingolipids were abnormally high. This suggested that the ALS mutations enhanced SPT activity.Similar results were seen when the researchers programmed neurons grown in petri dishes to carry the ALS-causing mutations in SPLTC1. The mutant carrying neurons produced higher levels of typical sphingolipids than control cells. This difference was enhanced when the neurons were fed the amino acid serine, a key ingredient in the SPT reaction.Previous studies have suggested that serine supplementation may be an effective treatment for HSAN1. Based on their results, the authors of this study recommended avoiding serine supplementation when treating the ALS patients.Next, Dr. Dunn s team performed a series of experiments which showed that the ALS-causing mutations prevent another protein called ORMDL from inhibiting SPT activity. Our results suggest that these ALS patients are essentially living without a brake on SPT activity. SPT is controlled by a feedback loop. When sphingolipid levels are high then ORMDL proteins bind to and slow down SPT. The mutations these patients carry essentially short circuit this feedback loop,  said Dr. Dunn.  We thought that restoring this brake may be a good strategy for treating this type of ALS. To test this idea, the B nnemann team created small interfering strands of RNA designed to turn off the mutant SPLTC1 genes found in the patients. Experiments on the patients  skin cells showed that these RNA strands both reduced the levels of SPLTC1 gene activity and restored sphingosine levels to normal. These preliminary results suggest that we may be able to use a precision gene silencing strategy to treat patients with this type of ALS. In addition, we are also exploring other ways to step on the brake that slows SPT activity,  said Dr. Bonnemann.  Our ultimate goal is to translate these ideas into effective treatments for our patients who currently have no therapeutic options. Reference: Mohassel P, Donkervoort S, Lone MA, et al.

The vagus nerve is an important communicator between these two organs. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research in Cologne, the Cluster of Excellence for Ageing Research CECAD at the University of Cologne and the University Hospital Cologne now took a closer look at the functions of the different nerve cells in the control centre of the vagus nerve, and discovered something very surprising: although the nerve cells are located in the same control center, they innervate different regions of the gut and also differentially control satiety and blood sugar levels. This discovery could play an important role in the development of future therapeutic strategies against obesity and diabetes.When we consume food, information about the ingested food is transmitted from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain in order to adapt feelings of hunger and satiety. Based on this information, the brain decides, for example, whether we continue or stop eating. In addition, our blood sugar level are adapted by the brain. The vagus nerve, which extends from the brain all the way down to the gastrointestinal tract, plays an essential role in this communication. In the control center of the vagus nerve, the so-called nodose ganglion, various nerve cells are situated, some of which innervate the stomach while others innervate the intestine. Some of these nerve cells detect mechanical stimuli in the different organs, such as stomach stretch during feeding, while others detect chemical signals, such as nutrients from the food that we consume. But what roles these different nerve cells play in transmitting information from the gut to the brain, and how their activity contributes to adaptations of feeding behavior and blood sugar levels had remained largely unclear.""To investigate the function of the nerve cells in the nodose ganglion, we developed a genetic approach that enables us to visualize the different nerve cells and manipulate their activity in mice. This allowed us to analyze which nerve cells innervate which organ, pointing to what kind of signals they detect in the gut,"" says study leader Henning Fenselau. ""It also allowed us to specifically switch on and off the different types of nerve cells to analyze their precise function.""","Published: June 3, 2021"

These metastases come from cancer cells that migrated from the original tumor to other organs and remained inactive there for a long time. Researchers have now discovered how these  sleeping cells  are kept at rest and how they wake up and form metastases. They report on this in the journal  Nature .It is an ominous seed that a tumor can leave behind in the body: Individual cancer cells migrate from the tumor to other tissues in the body and survive chemotherapy there in a kind of hibernation. Cancer medicine is currently focusing on observing those affected after the disease in order to determine whether these cells have awakened and metastases develop. One of the biggest questions in cancer research is what exactly triggers this ""waking up"".""This state of rest is an important time window for new therapeutic approaches when the number of cancer cells and their heterogeneity can still be managed,"" explains Prof. Dr. Mohamed Bentires-Alj, research group leader at the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel and the University Hospital Basel. Understanding the mechanisms behind the dormant state of these cancer cells is therefore important in order to prevent cancer from recurring. His team has now taken an important step in this direction.His colleague Dr. Ana Correia and colleagues used experiments with mice and human tissue samples to decipher the transition from  hibernation  to  waking  in cancer cells that had migrated to the liver from a breast tumor.","Published: June 3, 2021"

Knowing that, researchers are better equipped to isolate the natural product to begin developing it for a possible drug.""Natural products are still one of the most successful paths for drug discovery,"" said Bahar Behsaz, a project scientist in the lab and lead author of a paper about the process. ""And we think we're able to take it further with an algorithm like ours. Our computational model is orders of magnitude faster and more sensitive.""In a single study, the team was able to scan the metabolomics and genomic data for about 200 strains of microbes. The algorithm not only identified the hundreds of natural product drugs the researchers expected to find, but it also discovered four novel natural products that appear promising for future drug development. The team's work was published recently in Nature Communications.The paper, ""Integrating Genomics and Metabolomics for Scalable Non-Ribosomal Peptide Discovery,"" outlines the team's development of NRPminer, an artificial intelligence tool to aid in discovering non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs). NRPs are an important type of natural product and are used to make many antibiotics, anticancer drugs and other clinically used medications. They are, however, difficult to detect and even more difficult to identify as potentially useful.""What is unique about our approach is that our technology is very sensitive. It can detect molecules with nanograms of abundance,"" said Hosein Mohimani, an assistant professor and head of the lab. ""We can discover things that are hidden under the grass.""Most of the antibiotic, antifungal and many antitumor medications discovered and widely used have come from natural products.Penicillin is among the most used and well-known drugs derived from natural products. It was, in part, discovered by luck, as are many of the drugs made from natural products. But replicating that luck is difficult in the laboratory and at scale. Trying to uncover natural products is also time and labor intensive, often taking years and millions of dollars. Major pharmaceutical companies have mostly abandoned the search for new natural products in the past decades.By applying machine learning algorithms to the study of genomics, however, researchers have created new opportunities to identify and isolate natural products that could be beneficial.""Our hope is that we can push this forward and discover other natural drug candidates and then develop those into a phase that would be attractive to pharmaceutical companies,"" Mohimani said. ""Bahar Behsaz and I are expanding our discovery methods to different classes of natural products at a scale suitable for commercialization.""The team is already investigating the four new natural products discovered during their study.

The research was published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.Diabetes is a disease where people have too much sugar in their bloodstream, and it is a huge public health burden. Approximately 463 million adults worldwide were living with diabetes in 2019, and by 2045 this number is expected to rise to 700 million. An estimated 374 million people are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease. A healthy diet and lifestyle can play a major role in lowering a person's diabetes risk.""We found people who consumed around 2 servings of fruit per day had a 36 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the next five years than those who consumed less than half a serving of fruit per day,"" said study author Nicola Bondonno, Ph.D., of Edith Cowan University's Institute for Nutrition Research in Perth, Australia. ""We did not see the same patterns for fruit juice. These findings indicate that a healthy diet and lifestyle which includes the consumption of whole fruits is a great strategy to lower your diabetes risk.""The researchers studied data from 7,675 participants from the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute's Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study who provided information on their fruit and fruit juice intake through a food frequency questionnaire. They found participants who ate more whole fruits had 36 percent lower odds of having diabetes at five years. The researchers found an association between fruit intake and markers of insulin sensitivity, meaning that people who consumed more fruit had to produce less insulin to lower their blood glucose levels.""This is important because high levels of circulating insulin (hyperinsulinemia) can damage blood vessels and are related not only to diabetes, but also to high blood pressure, obesity and heart disease,"" Bondonno said.Reference: Bondonno NP, Davey RJ, Murray K, et al.

The protein could become a target for future cancer treatments.A crucial part of the immune system's response to cancer is a group of white blood cells, called CD8+ T-cells, which kill tumour cells. Before they launch their anti-tumour response, these cells must be told who to attack by another immune cell, called a dendritic cell.In their study, published in Cell today (2 June), the scientists identified a protein that is present in blood plasma and is also secreted by cancer cells, secreted gelsolin, which interferes with this relay process by blocking a receptor inside dendritic cells. With no instruction passed to the T-cells, the tumours avoid their killer response.The team analysed clinical data and samples from cancer patients with 10 different types of the disease and found that individuals with liver, head and neck and stomach cancers, who have lower levels of this protein in their tumours had higher chances of survival.*They also found that blocking the action of this protein in mice with cancer increased their response to treatments including checkpoint inhibitors, a major immunotherapy.Caetano Reis e Sousa, author and group leader of the Immunobiology Laboratory at the Crick, says: ""The interaction between tumour cells, the surrounding environment and the immune system is a complex picture. And although immunotherapies have revolutionised the way certain cancers are treated, there's still a lot to understand about who is most likely to benefit.""It's exciting to find a previously unknown mechanism for how our body recognises and tackles tumours. This opens new avenues for developing drugs that increase the number of patients with different types of cancer who might benefit from innovative immunotherapies.""This work builds on the team's research into dendritic cell biology. These cells absorb debris from dead cancer cells and hold them internally in pockets called phagosomes. Binding to a protein on the debris, F-actin, triggers these pockets to burst, releasing the debris into the cell where they can be processed and moved to the surface to signal the presence of a tumour to nearby T-cells.When the researchers examined the activity of secreted gelsolin, they found the protein outcompetes a key dendritic cell receptor, blocking its ability to bind to F-actin and therefore the ability of the dendritic cells to initiate a T-cell response.""Dendritic cells play a vital role in the immune system and our body's response to cancer,"" says Evangelos Giampazolias, author and postdoc in the Immunobiology Laboratory at the Crick. ""Understanding this process in more detail will enable us to identify how cancers are able to hide and how we might remove their disguise.""Oliver Schulz, author and research scientist in the Immunobiology Laboratory at the Crick says, ""While secreted gelsolin circulates in healthy blood plasma, some cancer cells secrete really high levels of it - so these tumours are launching an anti-immune defence which helps them avoid killer T-cells.""Reducing levels of this protein will help alleviate the competition for binding to F-actin and allow dendritic cells to communicate their vital message.""The researchers will continue this work, trying to develop a potential therapy that targets the secreted gelsolin in the tumour without affecting the activity of this protein in other parts of the body.Reference: Giampazolias E, Schulz O, Lim KHJ, et al.

Our study has found that turning off a gene that controls this protein activity increased necrotic cell death and led to more heart injury and worse heart function following heart attack in a rodent model,  said study author Zhaokang Cheng, an assistant professor in the WSU College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.  With further research, this discovery could ultimately lead to the development of a small-molecule drug that could intervene in that pathway to limit or prevent heart muscle cell death after reperfusion therapy. Such a drug could help reduce heart injury and increase the survival and lifespan of heart attack victims, Cheng said. Every year, about 800,000 people in the U.S. have a heart attack, which amounts to one heart attack occurring every 40 seconds.Reperfusion therapy, which uses clot-dissolving drugs or mechanical means to unblock clogged arteries, has long been the most effective treatment for heart attack. Though it significantly reduces heart damage, patients treated with this therapy still experience some damage, about half of which actually results from the treatment itself. This is because the rapid restoration of blood flow into oxygen-deprived heart tissues can lead to a swift rise in free radicals. When left unchecked, this surge of free radicals induces oxidative stress, which can cause heart muscle cell death and heart injury as part of a condition known as ischemia/reperfusion injury.Though scientists have long considered necrosis to be a passive, unavoidable form of cell death, recent studies have suggested that some forms of it happen in a highly regulated manner that could potentially be targeted for treatment. Little has been known about how this type of cell death is regulated, however, which is what prompted Cheng to take a closer look.He and his team had previously screened more than 20,000 genes to look for ones that appeared to either suppress or promote necrotic cell death. One gene that stood out to them as warranting further study was PRKAR1A, which helps regulate PKA activity by encoding a protein known as PKA regulatory subunit R1alpha.So the researchers conducted a series of experiments to validate whether the R1alpha protein can regulate necrotic cell death in a rodent model. They found that turning off the PRKAR1A gene increased cell death, both in cultured cells and in mice. Mice lacking the gene also had more heart injury and worse heart function after heart attack, as compared to wild-type mice.Cheng explained that, under normal circumstances, the rapid increase of free radicals after heart attack treatment triggers the heart to launch its antioxidant defense system, the built-in protective mechanism that helps keep free radicals in check. What their new study findings suggest is that the antioxidant defense system cannot be launched as effectively when the R1alpha protein is removed from the heart, resulting in more oxidative stress, which leads to cell death and heart injury.He explained that the R1alpha protein binds to another type of protein known as PKA catalytic subunits to keep PKA activity in check. When R1alpha is removed, the catalytic subunits are uncontrolled and PKA activity increases, which Cheng believes is what prevents the activation of the antioxidant defense system. This suggests that use of a small-molecule compound that selectively inhibits PKA activity could potentially block necrotic cell death and lead to better outcomes after heart attack treatment.Though Cheng said he hoped their research would eventually allow them to test such a compound in an animal model, the next step they are pursuing is to determine whether there are other mechanisms by which PKA regulates necrotic cell death aside from the antioxidant defense system.Reference: Liu Y, Chen J, Xia P, Stratakis CA, Cheng Z.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/culture-drives-evolution-more-than-genetics-349432,Culture Drives Evolution More Than Genetics Researchers have discovered that culture helps humans adapt to their environment and overcome challenges better and faster than genetics  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In a new study, University of Maine researchers found that culture helps humans adapt to their environment and overcome challenges better and faster than genetics.After conducting an extensive review of the literature and evidence of long-term human evolution, scientists Tim Waring and Zach Wood concluded that humans are experiencing a ""special evolutionary transition"" in which the importance of culture, such as learned knowledge, practices and skills, is surpassing the value of genes as the primary driver of human evolution.Culture is an under-appreciated factor in human evolution, Waring says. Like genes, culture helps people adjust to their environment and meet the challenges of survival and reproduction. Culture, however, does so more effectively than genes because the transfer of knowledge is faster and more flexible than the inheritance of genes, according to Waring and Wood.Culture is a stronger mechanism of adaptation for a couple of reasons, Waring says. It's faster: gene transfer occurs only once a generation, while cultural practices can be rapidly learned and frequently updated. Culture is also more flexible than genes: gene transfer is rigid and limited to the genetic information of two parents, while cultural transmission is based on flexible human learning and effectively unlimited with the ability to make use of information from peers and experts far beyond parents. As a result, cultural evolution is a stronger type of adaptation than old genetics.Waring, an associate professor of social-ecological systems modeling, and Wood, a postdoctoral research associate with the School of Biology and Ecology, have just published their findings in a literature review in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the flagship biological research journal of The Royal Society in London.""This research explains why humans are such a unique species. We evolve both genetically and culturally over time, but we are slowly becoming ever more cultural and ever less genetic,"" Waring says.Culture has influenced how humans survive and evolve for millenia. According to Waring and Wood, the combination of both culture and genes has fueled several key adaptations in humans such as reduced aggression, cooperative inclinations, collaborative abilities and the capacity for social learning. Increasingly, the researchers suggest, human adaptations are steered by culture, and require genes to accommodate.Waring and Wood say culture is also special in one important way: it is strongly group-oriented. Factors like conformity, social identity and shared norms and institutions -- factors that have no genetic equivalent -- make cultural evolution very group-oriented, according to researchers. Therefore, competition between culturally organized groups propels adaptations such as new cooperative norms and social systems that help groups survive better together.According to researchers, ""culturally organized groups appear to solve adaptive problems more readily than individuals, through the compounding value of social learning and cultural transmission in groups."" Cultural adaptations may also occur faster in larger groups than in small ones.With groups primarily driving culture and culture now fueling human evolution more than genetics, Waring and Wood found that evolution itself has become more group-oriented.""In the very long term, we suggest that humans are evolving from individual genetic organisms to cultural groups which function as superorganisms, similar to ant colonies and beehives,"" Waring says. ""The 'society as organism' metaphor is not so metaphorical after all. This insight can help society better understand how individuals can fit into a well-organized and mutually beneficial system. Take the coronavirus pandemic, for example. An effective national epidemic response program is truly a national immune system, and we can therefore learn directly from how immune systems work to improve our COVID response.""Reference: Waring TM, Wood ZT.

Healthy participants 18 to 50 years old will receive either a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine or the experimental vaccine, FluMos-v1. Scientists from NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) developed FluMos-v1 to stimulate antibodies against multiple influenza virus strains by displaying part of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein on self-assembling nanoparticle scaffolds. Alicia T. Widge, M.D., of NIAID s Vaccine Research Center (VRC), is the principal investigator of the NIAID-sponsored single-site trial.  The health and economic burdens of influenza are substantial, and the world badly needs improved flu vaccines,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.   I am encouraged by the great promise of the VRC nanoparticle vaccine candidate, which so far has performed very well in pre-clinical testing. Standard influenza vaccines must be reformulated and administered annually to match changes in the HA protein in the viral strains predicted to dominate in the upcoming influenza season. If the vaccine is not well matched to dominant circulating virus strains, the antibodies elicited may provide sub-optimal protection. So-called universal influenza vaccines are being developed and tested by many research groups and could one day eliminate the need for annual vaccination by generating long-lasting antibodies to protect against many existing or emergent influenza virus strains, including those not represented in the vaccine.Similar to commercially available flu vaccines, the experimental nanoparticle FluMos-v1 vaccine is designed to elicit antibodies directed against the HA protein from four different virus strains, two influenza type A strains of H1 and H3 subtype and two influenza type B strains. However, unlike conventional flu vaccines, FluMos-v1 displays multiple copies of each of the four HA types. The 20 HA epitopes arrayed in repeating patterns on the nanoparticle scaffolds sent a strong signal to the immune system and prompted a robust antibody response in animal models.In their recently published animal study, VRC scientists led by Barney S. Graham, M.D., Ph.D., and Masaru Kanekiyo, D.V.M., Ph.D., and their collaborators from the University of Washington tested the investigational nanoparticle vaccine in mice, ferrets and monkeys, and compared the immune responses generated to those made by a commercially available seasonal flu vaccine. FluMos-v1 performed as well as or slightly better than the commercial vaccine in eliciting antibodies matched to the vaccine s HA components. FluMos-v1 vastly outperformed the seasonal flu vaccine in its ability to elicit protective antibodies to two influenza type A subtypes (H5 and H7) not in the vaccine. The clinical trial aims to enroll 35 participants, 15 of whom will receive a single intramuscular injection of an FDA-licensed, quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine. Five participants will receive one 20-microgram (mcg) dose of the investigational vaccine by intramuscular injection. If there are no safety concerns detected at that dosage, an additional 15 volunteers will receive one 60-mcg dose of the investigational vaccine.Participants will keep a diary for a week following vaccination in which to report any signs or symptoms, including redness, pain or swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle aches or joint pain. All volunteers will record their temperature daily and will measure any swelling or redness at the injection site. Volunteers will return to the NIH Clinical Center periodically for 40 weeks over one flu season   after inoculation and will provide blood samples. The blood samples will yield information about the safety of the investigational vaccine and also will be assessed to determine levels of HA-directed antibodies produced following vaccination. Participants who receive FluMos-v1 will have oral mucosal samples taken that will be used for research purposes to determine the oral mucosal immune response to the vaccine.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The findings, which reveal how the physical nature of the genome changes as cells transform to serve specific functions, point to new ways to potentially better understand disease and to create improved therapies for cancer and genetic disorders.The genome is the library of genetic information essential for life. Each cell contains the entire library, yet it uses only part of this information. Special types of cells, such as a white blood cell or a neuron, have only certain  books  open   those containing information relevant for their function. Researchers have long sought to determine how the genome manages these enormous libraries and allows access to the  books  that are needed, while storing away the ones not in use. In the newly published study, which appears in the journal Physical Review Letters, the researchers revealed how this happens within a cell.  We found that the parts of the genome that are being used are liquid, while the unused parts form solid-like islands,  explains Alexandra Zidovska, an assistant professor in New York University s Department of Physics and the senior author of the study.  These solid-like islands serve as library bookshelves storing the books with genes not currently in use, while the liquid genome part acts like an  open book,  which is readily accessible and used for a cell s life and function.  The genome s genetic information is encoded in the DNA molecule. Proper reading and processing of this information is critical for human health and aging. In a human cell, the genome, which contains the genetic code, is housed in the cell nucleus. Barely 10 micrometers in size   or about 10 times smaller than the width of a strand of human hair   it stores about two meters of DNA. Storing this vast amount of genetic information in such a small space requires packing in such a way so that each piece of DNA, and thus of genetic code, is easily accessible when needed. What had been less understood is how this information was stored and what was the role of physics in it.To explore this phenomenon, the researchers, who also included Iraj Eshghi and Jonah Eaton, NYU doctoral candidates, compared cells before and after they become specialized. Specifically, the scientists mapped motions of the genome in nuclei of mouse stem cells   those that do not yet have a specialized function, but are poised to become any cell type, such as a neuron or a white blood cell   and then let these cells undergo a differentiation into neuronal cells before mapping the genomic motions again. In doing so, they generated the first-ever maps of a genome s motions before and after cell differentiation. Here they found that stem cells keep their genome  open    making it as accessible as an open book, with  genetic pages  being easily reachable. However, the mapping also showed that once a stem cell becomes a specialized cell, e.g. a neuron, this specialized cell keeps readily accessible only parts of the genome that are needed for its specific function. It puts away the unused parts of the genome on  bookshelves.  This leaves more space for information that is being actively read out and processed.  These motions tell us exactly how accessible the genome is in a given place in the cell nucleus,  explains Zidovska.  Moreover, these motions reveal the physical state of different parts of the genome, with liquid parts corresponding to loosely packed DNA, and solid-like parts corresponding to tightly packed DNA gels. The genome packing in these different states of matter directly impacts the genome s accessibility; the liquid parts are accessible, in contrast to the solid-like parts. The amazing thing is that this organization relies on physics of different states of matter, liquid and solid. Measuring motions of distinct parts of the genome allowed us to show these different physical properties of different parts of the genome, and thus understand the genome organization--the cell s  library system,    she adds.A proper cellular filing system is vital for human health, the researchers note. Considering the vast number of cell types in the human body, if a book is missing or misplaced in this cellular library, it may lead to missing or unnecessary information, possibly leading to developmental and inherited disorders as well as afflictions such as cancer,  explains Zidovska.  Therefore, revealing how the genome is organized inside the cell nucleus is critical to our understanding of these conditions and diseases. Moreover, such knowledge may help us in designing future therapies and diagnostics of such disorders. Reference: Eshghi I, Eaton JA, Zidovska A.

""We have demonstrated that in vulnerable children who received stimulating and emotionally supportive learning experiences, statistically significant changes in brain structure appear in middle age.""The results support the idea that early environment influences the brain structure of individuals growing up with multi-risk socioeconomic challenges, said Martha Farah, director of the Center for Neuroscience and Society at Penn and first author of the study.""This has exciting implications for the basic science of brain development, as well as for theories of social stratification and social policy,"" Farah said.The study follows children who have continuously participated in the Abecedarian Project, an early intervention program initiated by Ramey in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in 1971 to study the effects of educational, social, health, and family support services on high-risk infants.Both the comparison and treatment groups received extra health care, nutrition, and family support services; however, beginning at six weeks of age, the treatment group also received five years of high quality educational support, five days a week, 50 weeks a year.When scanned, the Abecedarian study participants were in their late 30s to early 40s, offering the researchers a unique look at how childhood factors affect the adult brain.""People generally know about the potentially large benefits of early education for children from very low resource circumstances,"" said co-author Sharon Landesman Ramey, professor and distinguished research scholar at Fralin Biomedical Research Institute. ""The new results reveal that biological effects accompany the many behavioral, social, health, and economic benefits reported in the Abecedarian Project. This affirms the idea that positive early life experiences contribute to later positive adjustment through a combination of behavioral, social, and brain pathways.""During follow-up examinations, structural MRI scans of the brains of 47 study participants were conducted at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Human Neuroimaging Lab. Of those, 29 individuals had been in the group that received the educational enrichment focused on promoting language, cognition, and interactive learning.The other 18 individuals received the same robust health, nutritional, and social services supports provided to the educational treatment group, and whatever community childcare or other learning their parents provided. The two groups were well matched on a variety of factors such as maternal education, head circumference at birth and age at scanning.Analyzing the scans, the researchers looked at brain size as a whole, including the cortex, the brain's outermost layer, as well as five regions selected for their expected connection to the intervention's stimulation of children's language and cognitive development.Those included the left inferior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus, which may be relevant to language, and the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, relevant to cognitive control. A fifth, the bilateral hippocampus, was added because its volume is frequently associated with early life adversity and socioeconomic status.The researchers determined that those in the early education treatment group had increased size of the whole brain, including the cortex.Several specific cortical regions also appeared larger, according to study co-authors Read Montague, professor and director of the Human Neuroimaging Lab and Computational Psychiatry Unit at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, and Terry Lohrenz, research assistant professor and member of the institute's Human Neuroimaging Laboratory.The scientists noted the group intervention treatment results for the brain were substantially greater for males than for females. The reasons for this are not known, and were surprising, since both the boys and girls showed generally comparable positive behavioral and educational effects from their early enriched education. The current study cannot adequately explain the sex differences.""When we launched this project in the 1970s, the field knew more about how to assess behavior than it knew about how to assess brain structure,"" Craig Ramey said. ""Because of advances in neuroimaging technology and through strong interdisciplinary collaborations, we were able to measure structural features of the brain. The prefrontal cortex and areas associated with language were definitely affected; and to our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence on a link between known early educational experiences and long-term changes in humans.""""We believe that these findings warrant careful consideration and lend further support to the value of ensuring positive learning and social-emotional support for all children - particularly to improve outcomes for children who are vulnerable to inadequate stimulation and care in the early years of life,"" Craig Ramey said.Reference: Farah MJ, Sternberg S, Nichols TA, et al.

There is no effective treatment and the average life expectancy after being diagnosed with ALS is usually short. Because of this, new knowledge about the disease is urgently needed.Now, researchers from the University of Copenhagen have gained new insights about ALS, by investigating the early development of the disease in a mouse model.""We have found that networks of nerve cells in the spinal cord called inhibitory interneurons lose connection to motor neurons, the nerve cells that directly control muscle contraction. We do not yet know if these changes cause the disease. But the loss of the inhibitory signal could explain why the motor neurons end up dying in ALS"", says first and co-corresponding author to the new study Ilary Allodi, Assistant Professor at the Department of Neuroscience.A lot of ALS research have focused on the motor neurons themselves, but the research group at the University of Copenhagen had a different approach.""It is only natural that motor neurons have received major attention. They control our muscles, which is the challenge for ALS patients. Here, we wanted to investigate the circuit of interneurons in the spinal cord because they determine the activity of motor neurons. Since we found that there is a loss of connections between inhibitory interneurons and motor neurons that happens before the motor neuron death, we think that this loss could be a possible explanation for why the motor neurons ends up dying in ALS patients"", says Ole Kiehn, senior, co-corresponding author and Professor at the Department of Neuroscience.","Published: June 2, 2021"

The work also notes that in developing countries, where animal agriculture is becoming increasingly industrialized, methane emissions could rise more than expected.These assessments are based on a review, appearing in the journal Environmental Research Letters, of eight existing studies.Methane is a global warming gas even more powerful than CO2. Its amount and lifetime in the atmosphere are smaller than CO2, but quantities are still increasing. The United Nations has recently urged that reducing methane emissions is a highly effective way of rapidly reducing global warming.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports these emissions in a national greenhouse gas inventory every year using complex models. But, the researchers write, existing methods that the EPA and other international agencies use to estimate methane emissions from animals are not corroborated by measuring concentrations of the gas in the air.This omission is significant.Some previous studies have monitored methane directly in the air using tall towers, airplanes, and satellites, collected above and downwind of animal production facilities. The recent Environmental Research Letters analysis compiled and reviewed several of these atmospheric studies over North America through the last decade. These studies consistently found more methane than the EPA and other agencies expected coming from livestock, in amounts ranging from 39 percent to 90 percent higher than previously estimated.""Back in 2013, we found that atmospheric methane emissions were higher from livestock and oil and gas producing regions than the EPA was reporting,"" says Scot Miller, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University and coauthor of the Environmental Research Letters paper. ""Since then, the models and atmospheric measurements don't appear much closer to coming into agreement. It's increasingly likely that methane emissions from farmed animals could be higher in North America than is often being reported.""Methane comes from cows' and sheep's digestion, as well as from stockpiles of manure from all farmed animals. In the U.S. and Canada, animal production is nearly entirely divorced from other farming practices like crop production. Pigs and chickens are raised in crowded sheds and their manure is stored in large stockpiles. Dairy cows are crowded into milking parlors and produce more manure than some small cities.These industrialized changes to rearing animals allow producers to use less feed like hay, corn, and soybeans, translating to fewer resources needed on farms. It was long assumed by the scientific community that this also translates into lower greenhouse gas emissions, too.""North American meat and dairy producers often tout improvements in their efficiency, claiming that concentrated feeds and confinement have reduced greenhouse gas emissions greatly over the past few decades,"" observes Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor in NYU's Environmental Studies Department and a co-author of the paper. ""Our findings throw those claims into doubt. Individual cows may be belching and emitting less, but that doesn't necessarily translate to entire herds and warehouses of confined animals, and their stockpiles of manure, emitting less.""These assessments have international importance as well, the authors note. Since re-entering the Paris Agreement in 2021, the U.S. is preparing to reduce emissions from all greenhouse gases, including those from animal agriculture.""This research indicates a need to reexamine or improve reporting methods for methane, which are critical to tracking progress over time,"" Hayek says.Other countries may have cause for concern in the future, too. For instance, throughout Asia, meat and dairy consumption is on the rise, and this production is becoming increasingly industrialized. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization previously predicted that East and Southeast Asia's animal emissions will peak around 2030 because U.S.-style technological efficiency in Asia could reduce emissions afterward.The findings reported in Environmental Research Letters, however, indicate that emissions could actually continue to rise through the year 2050.""This would further undermine international goals to limit global warming, surpassing 1.5  or 2  Celsius even more quickly than expected,"" Miller says.The authors highlight the role of international agencies, development banks, and corporations in hastening the transition toward industrial animal agriculture production.""This evidence suggests that the banks and government agencies who are funding intensive animal facilities' expansion might be accepting more climate risk than they realize,"" says Hayek. ""Policymakers should consider methane emissions along with a gamut of other major environmental issues stemming from concentrated meat and dairy production, including water pollution and infectious animal-borne disease breakouts, to inform policies that guide food systems toward a better direction.""Reference: Hayek MN, Miller SM.

The dog was probably the first animal to be domesticated by humans and has subsequently been artificially selected by humans into a great diversity of dog breeds of different sizes and shapes,  lead author of the study and senior lecturer in Genomics and Bioinformatics at UNSW Sydney s School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Dr Richard Edwards says. Before this paper, it was difficult to interpret differences between the dog reference genomes and non-domesticated dogs, such as dingoes, jackals, coyotes, wolves and foxes. Big changes could be the result of recent artificial selection during creation of the specific reference breed. By adding such a high-quality genome at the base of the domestic dog family tree, we have provided an anchor point for studies that can help establish the timing and direction of genetic changes during domestication and subsequent breeding. Dr Edwards says the Basenji genome sequence is different to the traditional dog reference genome, CanFam, which is of a highly-derived breed, the Boxer.He says the choice of dog reference genome can affect the results of future dog genetics studies looking at genetic variants. For example, the Boxer is much more closely related to other Mastiffs than other breeds,  he says. This may introduce biases in genetic analyses across many dog breeds. There is also the risk that breed-specific variation may map poorly   or not at all   to a biased reference. In principle, the Basenji is equally distant from most modern breeds, making it a less biased basis for comparisons. Dr Kylie Cairns is an expert in dingo identity and evolution in the Centre for Ecosystem Science in UNSW s School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences.She says the Basenji genome now provides a high-quality comparison to all domestic dog breeds for future studies. As Basenjis are a very old breed, they provide the perfect comparison to more modern breeds to explore how breeds were developed, the process of domestication and assist in studies looking for disease genes,  Dr Cairns says. This genome will also be critical in comparisons to wolves, dingoes and village dogs as an example of an ancient domestic breed. She says the Basenji genome may allow scientists to more fully unravel the evolutionary history of early dogs and how humans have shaped the first dogs into the companions and breeds we have today. Many people wouldn t realise that most dog breeds arose in the last 200-300 years,  she says. So having access to a high quality refence genome from an ancient breed such as the Basenji gives insight into early breed development and how domestic dogs have been shaped by humans in the last few thousand years. We will also be able to tackle lingering questions about the evolutionary history of dingoes and their relatives in New Guinea, with the Basenji acting as a halfway point between non-domesticated dingoes and truly modern dog breeds like pugs, kelpies and poodles.  Dr Edwards says the genome of the Basenji is one of only a handful of referenced quality genomes for specific dog breeds.The first of these was a German Shepherd, Nala, which Dr Edwards also contributed to last year.Dr Edwards says researchers combined three cutting edge genome sequencing technologies to assembly the Basenji dog genome, which is based on a female dog called China. Over 99 per cent of the final genome assembly can be found in the 39 pieces that represent the 39 dog chromosomes,  he says. These chromosomes only have one hundred regions of unresolved sequence, which is the fewest of any published dog genome so far. This makes it one of the highest-quality dog genomes produced to date. The study also features a number of interesting genome assembly case studies that demonstrate the importance of curation and careful analysis, even for high-quality genomes. Even the best technologies can still make mistakes,  Dr Edwards says.For example, the mitochondrial genome   a separate, small genome belonging to the cell s energy generators   had mistakenly been assembled into the middle of one of the chromosomes at one stage. Genomics has a come a long way in recent years, but we ve not reached perfection yet. At the same time, it is not possible to manually scan over two billion DNA letters for mistakes. Part of what drives the research in my lab is finding improved ways to use computers to help identify and fix these errors. Reference: Edwards RJ, Field MA, Ferguson JM, et al.

The app is free and it only takes about four minutes per day - so it's something people realistically can do - and our results suggest it is effective. ""There's some evidence that the benefits were stronger for people who were more overweight.""We would expect to see this, because the app targets mechanisms that lead people to become overweight, such as the strong urges to approach and consume tempting junk foods.""Dr Matthias Aulbach, of the University of Helsinki, added: ""For anyone with unhealthy eating habits - perhaps developed during lockdown - FoodT might be helpful.""The study used FoodT usage data, and the app also periodically asks questions about how often users eat certain foods, along with other information such as their age and weight.The findings suggest that using the app regularly was linked with bigger changes in eating habits.""If you're trying to teach the brain something new, it's a good idea to space out the learning over multiple sessions,"" said Dr Aulbach.""It may be helpful to do the training in different contexts - not just at home but at work and elsewhere, so the associations you learn don't just relate to one location.""From our results it seems important that you do the training regularly and don't just stop. So keep it interesting and relevant for yourself so you won't get bored with it: personalise the app as far as possible and pick the foods that you find really hard to resist.""The researchers stress that their findings should be interpreted cautiously, because there was no control (comparison) group and other factors (such as the possibility that people who did more training were also separately more motivated to lose weight) could play a part in the results.Leaving a review on Google Play, one app user wrote: ""Really useful.

The technique works well for many patients, but researchers would like to make DBS devices that are a little smarter by adding the capability to sense activity in the brain and adapt stimulation accordingly. Now, a new algorithm developed by Brown University bioengineers could be an important step toward such adaptive DBS. The algorithm removes a key hurdle that makes it difficult for DBS systems to sense brain signals while simultaneously delivering stimulation.""We know that there are electrical signals in the brain associated with disease states, and we'd like to be able to record those signals and use them to adjust neuromodulation therapy automatically,"" said David Borton, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Brown and corresponding author of a study describing the algorithm. ""The problem is that stimulation creates electrical artifacts that corrupt the signals we're trying to record. So we've developed a means of identifying and removing those artifacts, so all that's left is the signal of interest from the brain.""The research is published in the journal Cell Reports Methods. The work was co-led by Nicole Provenza, a Ph.D. candidate working in Borton's lab at Brown, and Evan Dastin-van Rijn, a Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota who worked on the project while he was an undergraduate at Brown advised by Borton and Matthew Harrison, an associate professor of applied mathematics. Borton's lab is affiliated the Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science.DBS systems typically consist of an electrode implanted in the brain that's connected to a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest. Electrical pulses are delivered at a consistent frequency, which is set by a doctor. The stimulation frequency can be adjusted as disease states change, but this has to be done manually by a physician. If devices could sense biomarkers of disease and respond automatically, it could lead to more effective DBS therapy with potentially fewer side effects.There are several factors that make it difficult to sense and stimulate at the same time, the researchers say. For one thing, the frequency signature of the stimulation artifact can sometimes overlap with that of the brain signal researchers want to detect. So merely cutting out swaths of frequency to eliminate artifacts might also remove important signals. To eliminate the artifact and leave other data intact, the exact waveform of the artifact needs to be identified, which presents another problem. Implanted brain sensors are generally designed to run on minimal power, so the rate at which sensors sample electrical signals makes for fairly low-resolution data. Accurately identifying the artifact waveform with such low-resolution data is a challenge.To get around that problem, the researchers came up with a way to turn low-resolution data into a high-resolution picture of the waveform. Even though sensors don't collect high-resolution data, they do collect a lot of data over time. Using some clever mathematics, the Brown team found a way to cobble bits of data together into a high-resolution picture of the artifact waveform.""We basically take an average of samples recorded at similar points along the artifact waveform,"" Dastin-van Rijn said. ""That allows us to predict the contribution of the artifact in those kinds of samples, and then remove it.""In a series of laboratory experiments and computer simulations, the team showed that their algorithm outperforms other techniques in its ability to separate signal from artifact. The team also used the algorithm on previously collected data from humans and animal models to show that they could accurately identify artifacts and remove them.""I think one big advantage to our method is that even when the signal of interest closely resembles the simulation artifact, our method can still tell the difference between the two,"" Provenza said. ""So that way we're able to get rid of the artifact while leaving the signal intact.""Another advantage, the researchers say, is that the algorithm isn't computationally expensive. It could potentially run in real time on current DBS devices. That opens the door to real-time artifact-filtering, which would enable simultaneous recording and stimulation.""That's the key to an adaptive system,"" Borton said. ""Being able to get rid of the stimulation artifact while still recording important biomarkers is what will ultimately enable a closed-loop therapeutic system.""Reference: Dastin-van Rijn EM, Provenza NR, Calvert JS, et al.

The ozone loss, triggered by the eruption of the Toba supervolcano located in present-day Indonesia, might solve an evolutionary puzzle that scientists have been debating for decades.""Toba has long been posited as a cause of the bottleneck, but initial investigations into the climate variables of temperature and precipitation provided no concrete evidence of a devastating effect on humankind,"" says Sergey Osipov at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, who worked on the project with KAUST's Georgiy Stenchikov and colleagues from King Saud University, NASA and the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.""We point out that, in the tropics, near-surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the driving evolutionary factor. Climate becomes more relevant in the more volatile regions away from the tropics,"" says Stenchikov.Large volcanic eruptions emit gases and ash that create a sunlight-attenuating aerosol layer in the stratosphere, causing cooling at the Earth's surface. This ""volcanic winter"" has multiple knock-on effects, such as cooler oceans, prolonged El Ni o events, crop failures and disease.""The ozone layer prevents high levels of harmful UV radiation reaching the surface,"" says Osipov. ""To generate ozone from oxygen in the atmosphere, photons are needed to break the O2 bond. When a volcano releases vast amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2), the resulting volcanic plume absorbs UV radiation but blocks sunlight. This limits ozone formation, creating an ozone hole and heightening the chances of UV stress.""The team examined UV radiation levels after the Toba eruption using the ModelE climate model developed by NASA GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies). They simulated the possible after-effects of different sizes of eruptions. Running such a model is computationally intensive, and Osipov is grateful for the use of KAUST's supercomputer, Shaheen II, and associated expertise.Their model suggests that the Toba SO2 cloud depleted global ozone levels by as much as 50 percent. Furthermore, they found that the effects on ozone are significant, even under relatively small eruption scenarios. The resulting health hazards from higher UV radiation at the surface would have significantly affected human survival rates.""The UV stress effects could be similar to the aftermath of a nuclear war,"" says Osipov. ""For example, crop yields and marine productivity would drop due to UV sterilization effects. Going outside without UV protection would cause eye damage and sunburn in less than 15 minutes. Over time, skin cancers and general DNA damage would have led to population decline.""Reference: Osipov S, Stenchikov G, Tsigaridis K, et al.

This is heavier than we would expect, and, if replicated, points to unexplained excess mass in chromosomes.""In the study, researchers used a method called X-ray ptychography, which involves stitching together the diffraction patterns that occur as the X-ray beam passes through the chromosomes, to create a highly sensitive 3D reconstruction. The fine resolution was possible as the beam deployed at Diamond Light Source was billions of times brighter than the Sun (ie, there was a very large number of photons passing through at a given time).The chromosomes were imaged in metaphase, just before they were about to divide into two daughter cells. This is when packaging proteins wind up the DNA into very compact, precise structures.Archana Bhartiya, a PhD student at the London Centre for Nanotechnology at UCL and lead author of the paper, said: ""A better understanding of chromosomes may have important implications for human health.""A vast amount of study of chromosomes is undertaken in medical labs to diagnose cancer from patient samples. Any improvements in our abilities to image chromosomes would therefore be highly valuable.""Each human cell, at metaphase, normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, or 46 in total. Within these are four copies of 3.5 billion base pairs of DNA.Reference: Bhartiya A, Batey D, Cipiccia S, et al. X-ray ptychography imaging of human chromosomes after low-dose irradiation.

For instance, in July 2019, significant Alaskan wildfires were detected by satellites. The recent unusual climate phenomena are of immense concern to many people living in these regions.A team of scientists from Japan, South Korea, and the USA, including Hokkaido University's Assistant Professor Teppei J. Yasunari, have revealed relationships among wildfires, aerosols (air pollution), and climate patterns in and around the Arctic. They have published their discoveries in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Involved in this study were Professor Hisashi Nakamura, The University of Tokyo, Japan; Dr. Nakbin Choi and Professor Myong-In Lee, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea; and Professor Yoshihiro Tachibana, Mie University, Japan, and two scientists from the Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA.""Wildfires lead to extensive air pollution, primarily in the form of inhalable particulate matter with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5). Arctic hazes during winter and spring are typical phenomena due to aerosols existing in the Arctic. In our scientific field, it is also known that deposition of light-absorbing aerosols onto snow surfaces can induce the so-called snow darkening effect, contributing to accelerated snow melting. For these reasons, long-term assessments of PM2.5 and aerosols in the Arctic and surrounding regions are required,"" said Yasunari.For their investigations, the scientists used the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) dataset and fire data by satellite, both produced by NASA, focusing on the recent period from 2003 to 2017. They assessed comprehensive air pollution (i.e., PM2.5) in the Arctic for as long as the past 15 years, seeking to clarify the relationships between variations in PM2.5 and aerosols, wildfires, and the relevant climate patterns.""We found 13 out of the 20 months with highest PM2.5 in the Arctic during the 15 year period were in summer. The elevated PM2.5 levels were highly correlated with relatively higher organic carbon aerosol concentrations, implying active wildfires. We concluded that the summertime wildfires contributed to those months with exceptionally high PM2.5 in the Arctic. In those months, the wildfires likely occurred under extremely warm and dry conditions. Those were due to concomitantly persistent or developed high-pressure systems over Europe, Siberia, and subpolar North America, namely, Alaska and Canada,"" explained Yasunari.The scientists named this climate (atmospheric circulation) pattern, the circum-Arctic wave (CAW) pattern, as a driver for enhancing the co-occurrence of heatwaves in Europe and wildfires in Siberia and subpolar North America. In fact, the CAW-like pattern was also seen in the early summer of 2019, which was outside the period of the MERRA-2 analyses.Reference: Yasunari TJ, Nakamura H, Kim K-M, et al.

So how do you know which treatment will be best for the sick person and will be successful in eradicating their cancer? In order to offer a personalized treatment that best matches the case being treated, a team of scientists led by the University of Geneva (UNIGE) had already developed a spheroidal reproduction of tumors that integrates tumor cells, but also their microenvironment. However, the immune system was not yet taken into consideration, although it can either be strengthened or destroyed by the treatment offered to patients. Today, the Geneva team has succeeded in integrating into the spheroidal structure two types of immune cells that come directly from the sick person, allowing to test the various possible treatments and to select the most effective. Results to read in the journal Cancers .In order to test cancer treatments, scientists use 2D cultures of cancer cells. However, these are only an artificial system, as they do not represent the tumor in 3D in all its complexity. This is why the team of Patrycja Nowak-Sliwinska, professor in the Pharmaceutical Sciences Section of the Faculty of Sciences at UNIGE, has developed a spheroidal structure that mimics the microenvironment of the tumor. ""It's about creating a 3D structure from the tumor cells, also integrating fibroblasts - cells that make up the mass of the tumor - and endothelial cells, which allow the tumor to feed. and to be vascularized. This method, since used by the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG), allows you to get closer to the tumor present in the patient's body.

If T cells are like a team of specialist doctors in an emergency room, NK cells are the paramedics: They arrive first on the scene and perform damage control until reinforcements arrive.Part of our innate immune system, which dispatches these first responders, NK cells are primed from birth to recognize and respond to danger. Learning what fuels NK cells is an active area of research in immunology, with important clinical implications.""There's a lot of interest right now in NK cells as a potential target of immunotherapy,"" says Joseph Sun, an immunologist in the Sloan Kettering Institute. ""The more we can understand what drives these cells, the better we can program them to fight disease.""Like all cells, NK cells require energy and nutrients to grow and divide. But NK cells have a particularly high demand for these supplies   especially when they are fighting a foe.Dr. Sun and Sam Sheppard, a postdoc in the Sun lab, wanted to know more about what powers NK cells when they re in the midst of battle against infections and cancer. So, they made precise changes to the metabolic pathways in these cells and studied them in a mouse model that mirrors what happens naturally.They discovered that when NK cells are actively fighting, they depend on a form of metabolism called aerobic glycolysis. This way of harvesting nutrients rapidly breaks down glucose to lactate, generating a small amount of ATP (a cell s  energy currency ) in the process. It s not as efficient as some other ways the cell has to metabolize glucose, but it has the virtue of being fast, which allows NK cells to be quick on the draw. When an NK cell becomes activated, they massively increase their glycolysis,  Dr. Sheppard says.  In the case of viral infection, this happens within just two days. Aerobic glycolysis is so important to the cells, in fact, that when the researchers genetically altered the mice to remove a key component of this pathway, called LDHA, the NK cells were useless. They can still develop normally and carry out most of their day-to-day functions,  Dr. Sun says.  But their ability to fight infections and cancer is crippled. ","Published: June 2, 2021"

Led by University of California, Irvine professor of bioinformatics Wei Li, PhD, the Grace B. Bell chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry at UCI s School of Medicine, this new research unlocks how much differences in people s genes account for differences in their traits and what can be attributed to the effects of the surrounding environment.Shown are the genetic variants associated with alternative mRNA 3'UTR lengths. A change from the T allele to the C allele leads to the lengthening of a 3'UTR measured by a ruler. These 3'UTR associated genetic variants provide substantial new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying many human complex traits and diseases. Credit: UCI School of Medicine. Our research is of particularly importance as it offers interpretations that explain how natural variations can shape human phenotypic diversity and tissue-specific diseases,  said Li.  Our most exciting finding was that certain events in human genes can explain a substantial proportion of trait heritability.  It was well known that 3 -UTR alternative polyadenylation (APA) occurs in approximately 70 percent of human genes and substantively impacts cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and tumorigenesis.  But, until now, the association of APA events with disease risk and complex human traits was not well understood.Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of noncoding variants associated with human traits and diseases. However, the functional interpretation of these variants has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, researchers constructed a multi-tissue atlas of human 3  UTR alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3 aQTLs), containing approximately 0.4 million common genetic variants associated with the APA of target genes, identified in 46 tissues isolated from 467 individuals (Genotype-Tissue Expression Project). From our findings we could show that specific molecular features associated with human phenotypic variations contribute substantially to the molecular mechanisms underlying human complex traits and diseases,  explained Li. The research team is continuing to study these molecular mechanisms to test the novel 3 aQTLs genes for diabetes, prostate cancer, Alzheimer s Disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Reference: Li L, Huang K-L, Gao Y, et al.

What would movies and sporting events without this salty, buttery snack? America's love for this snack goes beyond these events. We consume 15 billion quarts of popped popcorn each year.When it comes to popcorn, consumers want a seed-to-snack treat that leaves more snacks than seeds when popped. This means when they pop the corn, there shouldn't be many unpopped kernels left in the bowl.Maria Fernanda Maioli set out to determine the properties affecting popping expansion in popcorn. The team's research was recently published in Agronomy Journal, a publication of the American Society of Agronomy.""The way kernels expand is a basic, yet very important characteristic of popcorn,"" says Fernanda Maioli. This is referred to as ""expansion ratio.""""Very hard grains burst when heated. This expansion multiplies the initial volume of the grains by more than 40 times. In the case of popcorn, it produces a unique and tasty food.""The major factors that influence popcorn quality are kernel moisture, expansion ratios, and popping ratios. Higher quality popcorn is associated with kernels that expand more. This popped corn has a better texture and softness.There have been several past studies on the ways popcorn kernel expand. These studies report that popping expansion has a strong association with higher starch content in kernels.Previous research also shows that popcorn varieties with a thicker protective outer seed coating - have a greater expansion ratio.Popping ability is also affected by how well the starchy substance inside kernels transfer heat during the popping process. Fernanda Maioli and her team's study measured this performance, which makes this research unique.""We observed how this heat transfer inside the popcorn kernel relates to the expansion ratio,"" she adds. ""It allowed us to understand how other characteristics may also relate to expansion.""""The purpose of our study was to identify popcorn characteristics related to expansion,"" says Fernanda Maioli. ""This will help us efficiently identify popcorn varieties with good agronomic characteristics as well as good popping quality.""The team evaluated 49 types of popcorn for different traits. The traits included grain yield, kernel length, popping expansion, kernel and protective layer thickness, heat transfer ability, and the amount of protein in kernels.Then the researchers studied the influence of those characteristics on the popping expansion.""Our results showed that the thickness of the kernel's outer layer is a key trait for selecting popcorn with greater popping expansion,"" says Fernanda Maioli.Understanding which popcorn traits are related to the expansion capacity will help future researchers identify and breed high quality popcorn. Researchers will not need to spend time and money to look at other unrelated characteristics.The team hopes they can identify relationships between other key traits.

They have also identified a compound that shows potential to block OTUD7A protein activity. The finding, by scientists at the University of North Carolina and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, appeared online June 1, 2021, in Advanced Science.About 250 children and young adults are diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma each year in the U.S. About half of those diagnosed will ultimately succumb to the disease, pointing to the need for better therapies.""Our primary research focus targeted the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein found in about 85 percent of Ewing sarcoma patients,"" said UNC Lineberger's Pengda Liu, PhD, assistant professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the UNC School of Medicine and co-lead author. ""This protein, made up of pieces of two other proteins, is unique to Ewing sarcoma and only produced in cancer cells, making it an excellent target for treatment.""Critical relationships between proteins contribute to the development of cancers such as Ewing sarcoma. So, it was a seminal discovery when the UNC researchers found that OTUD7A controls the cancer-causing fusion protein.Armed with this knowledge, the scientists went on the hunt for small molecule compounds that could block OTUD7A's activity. Their collaborator, Atomwise Inc., used an artificial intelligence program known as AtomNet to screen four million small molecules to find ones that could fit into a pocket in OTUD7A. One compound they identified, 7Ai, showed a good ability to reduce tumor formation in mice that were grafted with human Ewing sarcoma cells. The compound did not appear to be toxic and was well-tolerated. Also, 7Ai did not kill normal cells that were tested in lab culture experiments.""Treatment with 7Ai could provide a new targeted therapeutic option for patients who become resistant to chemotherapy.

It could also enable further study of these disorders and give scientists a new tool to test experimental treatments.Platelets are cells that are necessary for the blood to clot and stop bleeding. Having too few platelets can lead to internal or serious bleeding after surgery or injuries, which is usually treated with therapies that cause clotting. Recent studies have shown that a drug called Eltrombopag increases the production of platelets, but not all patients appear to benefit from it. ""Patients with the same apparent form of platelet disorder may respond differently to treatment with Eltrombopag,"" says first author Christian Di Buduo, Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy.To help determine which patients might benefit from the drug, Di Buduo and colleagues developed a mini 3D model of human bone marrow that combines a scaffolding of silk protein and culture of patient-derived cells to recreate the human bone marrow environment where platelets are produced. ""This device is a significant improvement over previous models, requiring only a very small sample of blood to recreate platelet production,"" Di Buduo explains.The team then tested what happened when they added Eltrombopag to a blood sample from a patient with a platelet disorder that had previously been treated with the drug. Their results showed that the number of platelets produced in the model corresponded to how each patient had responded to treatment with Eltrombopag. The increase in the number of platelets collected from the model was comparable to the increase in the number of platelets in patients' blood following treatment.The authors say the model could eventually lead to personalised treatment for platelet disorders by helping clinicians match patients to the best treatment.""This easy-to-reproduce system may also help scientists better understand what goes wrong in these disorders and how treatments work, as well as provide them with a new tool for testing new drugs that may lead to improved therapies in the future,"" concludes senior author Alessandra Balduini, Principal Investigator and Professor at the University of Pavia.Reference: Di Buduo CA, Laurent P-A, Zaninetti C, et al.

T. Charlie Johnson, PhD, the Rebecca W. Bushnell Professor of Physics and Astronomy in Penn's School of Arts & Sciences (Abstract # 5544).""It's an early study but the results are very promising,"" Johnson said.

The late George Preti, PhD, of the Monell Chemical Senses Center, is also co-author.The Penn research team is currently working with VOC Health to commercialize the device, along with others, for research and clinical applications.The electronic olfaction -- ""e-nose"" -- system is equipped with nanosensors calibrated to detect the composition of VOCs, which all cells emanate. Previous studies from the researchers demonstrated that VOCs released from tissue and plasma from ovarian cancer patients are distinct from those released from samples of patients with benign tumors.Among 93 patients, including 20 patients with ovarian cancer, 20 with benign ovarian tumors and 20 age-matched controls with no cancer, as well as 13 patients with pancreatic cancer, 10 patients with benign pancreatic disease, and 10 controls, the vapor sensors discriminated the VOCs from ovarian cancer with 95 percent accuracy and pancreatic cancer with 90 percent accuracy. The tool also correctly identified all patients (a total of eight) with early-stage cancers.The technology's pattern recognition approach is similar to the way people's own sense of smell works, where a distinct mixture of compounds tells the brain what it's smelling. The tool was trained and tested to identify the VOC patterns more associated with cancer cells and those associated with cells from healthy blood samples in 20 minutes or less.The team's collaboration with Richard Postrel, CEO and chief innovation officer of VOC Health, has also led to an improvement in detection speed by 20 fold.""Collaborating with researchers from the department of Physics and Astronomy, the Perelman School of Medicine, and Penn Vet has allowed us to perfect and integrate our own innovations - expediting the commercialization process,"" Postrel said.

Every day we benefit greatly from our ability to manipulate objects with a high degree of control   whether we re typing on a computer, playing a musical instrument, or even just turning a key to unlock a door.While these tasks may seem simple, in-hand object manipulation is actually very complex and engages a large-scale brain network encompassing sensory, association, and motor regions.Now, a team of scientists in the Human Brain Project is implementing this brain network as a biologically constrained recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) on EBRAINS. This type of network is often used to model sequence data. The network s ability to learn sequences of states   for example, how a sequence of limb positions evolves when a certain force is applied to a joint   is especially relevant to robotics.The design of the RCNN was informed by the EBRAINS Multilevel Human Brain Atlas, which allowed the researchers to identify the connection profile of brain regions involved in complex hand movements. The RCNN was then trained in-silico on supercomputers at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, which is part of the EBRAINS high-performance computing infrastructure.The RCNN was tasked with generating a simple digit configuration   to join fingers with the thumb   which it successfully performed after 2,000 iterations of self- generated experience. The RCNN requires hours of simulated experience to train"", says Mario Senden, one of the lead scientists.

The peptide is derived from amelogenin, the key protein in the formation of tooth enamel, the tooth s crown. It is also key to the formation of cementum, which makes up the surface of the tooth root.Each lozenge deposits several micrometers of new enamel on the teeth via the peptide, which is engineered to bind to the damaged enamel to repair it while not affecting the mouth s soft tissue. The new layer also integrates with dentin, the living tissue underneath the tooth s surface. Two lozenges a day can rebuild enamel, while one a day can maintain a healthy layer. The lozenge   which can be used like a mint   is expected to be safe for use by adults and children alike.The lozenge uses a genetically engineered peptide, along with phosphorus and calcium ions, to build new layers of enamel on teeth.The researchers have been discussing commercial applications with potential corporate partners, according to Professor Mehmet Sarikaya, the team leader. He is a professor in the Department of Materials Research Science and Engineering and adjunct professor in the Department of Oral Health Sciences. Also playing a critical role is Dr. Sami Dogan of the School of Dentistry s Department of Restorative Dentistry faculty.The lozenge produces new enamel that is whiter than what tooth-whitening strips or gels produce. It has another distinct advantage: Conventional whitening treatments rely on hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent that can weaken tooth enamel after prolonged use. Since tooth enamel can t regrow spontaneously, the underlying dentin can be exposed, with results ranging from hypersensitivity to cavities or even gum disease. The lozenge, on the other hand, strengthens, rebuilds, and protects teeth.While fluoride can also fortify tooth enamel, it does not actively rebuild it. It also dilutes relatively quickly, and its overall effectiveness depends largely on diligent oral hygiene. At the same time, the lozenge can also be used in conjunction with fluoride, Dr. Dogan said. The fluoride can be in a very low concentration, he added   about 20 percent of what is found in most fluoride toothpastes. We have three objectives in the clinical trial,  Professor Sarikaya said.  First, demonstrate efficacy. Second, documentation. Third, benchmarking   seeing how the whitening effect compares to existing commercial treatments.  The researchers have already tested the lozenge on extracted teeth from humans, pigs, and rats, and also on live rats.The team also plans to develop related products for use in dental offices, Dr. Dogan said, expecting this phase of trials to start in March or April.  Each study will take two weeks, and we expect these trials to take no more than three months,  he said. The team is also developing a toothpaste for over-the-counter use, but has not fixed a timetable for its introduction.In addition, the researchers are investigating a gel or solution with the engineered peptide to treat hypersensitive teeth. This problem results from weakness in the enamel that makes the underlying dentin and nerves more vulnerable to heat or cold. Most common products currently on the market can put a layer of organic material on the tooth and numb nerve endings with potassium nitrate, but the relief is only temporary. The peptide, however, addresses the problem permanently at its source by strengthening the enamel.The idea for the lozenge design originated with Deniz Yucesoy, a graduate student in the UW s Genetically Engineered Materials Science and Engineering Center who received a $100,000 Amazon Catalyst grant through CoMotion, UW s commercialization center, to support the initial project. Key contributions also came from Hanson Fong, a research scientist in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.This article has been republished from the following materials.

This part of the study included 1.2 million participants. The researchers crosschecked their findings from that analysis with an entirely separate sample of 1.3 million volunteers from 23andMe customers.When the two sets of data from the different sources were compared, genetic variants linked to depression replicated with statistical significance for most of the markers tested. What is most heartening is we could replicate our findings in independent data sets,  said Daniel Levey, an associate research scientist in the Yale Department of Psychiatry and co-lead author.  Replication is a hallmark of good science, and this paper points to just how reliable and stable results from GWAS studies are becoming. Like many mental health disorders, depression is genetically complex and is characterized by combinations of many different genetic variants, the researchers say. That s why we weren t surprised by how many variants we found,  said Joel Gelernter, the Foundations Fund Professor of Psychiatry at Yale, professor of genetics and of neuroscience, and co-senior author of the study.  And we don t know how many more there are left to discover   hundreds? Maybe even thousands? The size of the new GWAS study will help clinicians to develop polygenic risk scores to pinpoint those most at risk of developing major depression and other related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, the authors say.The study also provides deep insights into the underlying biology of genetic disorders. For instance, one gene variant implicated in depression, NEGR1, is a neural growth regulator active in the hypothalamus, an area of the brain previously linked to depression. That confirms research done by the late Yale neuroscientist Ronald Duman on the role of neurotrophic factors in depression, Levey said. It s really striking when completely different kinds of research converge on similar biology, and that s what s happening here,  he said.Insights into the functions of the variants can also help identify many drugs that hold promise in the treatment of depression, the researchers say. For instance, the drug riluzole, which is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), modulates glutamate transmission in brain. Several gene variants linked by the new study to depression affect the glutamate system, which is actively being studied for depression treatments. One of the real goals of the research is bringing forward new ways to treat people suffering from depression,  added co-senior author Dr. Murray Stein, staff psychiatrist at the V.A. San Diego Healthcare System and Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Public Health at UCSD.Reference: Levey DF, Stein MB, Wendt FR, et al.

But a new study of duetting songbirds from Ecuador, the plain-tail wren (Pheugopedius euophrys), has offered another tune explaining the mysterious connection between successful performing duos.It's a link of their minds, and it happens, in fact, as each singer mutes the brain of the other as they coordinate their duets.In a study published May 31 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers studying brain activity of singing male and female plain-tailed wrens has discovered that the species synchronizes their frenetically paced duets, surprisingly, by inhibiting the song-making regions of their partner's brain as they exchange phrases.Researchers say that the auditory feedback exchanged between wrens during their opera-like duets momentarily inhibits motor circuits used for singing in the listening partner, which helps link the pair's brains and coordinate turn-taking for a seemingly telepathic performance. The study also offers fresh insight into how humans and other cooperative animals use sensory cues to act in concert with one another. ""You could say that timing is everything,"" said Eric Fortune, co-author of the study and neurobiologist at New Jersey Institute of Technology's Department of Biological Sciences. ""What these wrens have shown us is that for any good collaboration, partners need to become 'one' through sensory linkages. The take-home message is that when we are cooperating well... we become a single entity with our partners.""""Think of these birds like jazz singers,"" added Melissa Coleman, the paper's corresponding author and associate professor of biology at Scripps College. ""Duetting wrens have a rough song structure planned before they sing, but as the song evolves, they must rapidly coordinate by receiving constant input from their counterpart.""What we expected to find was a highly active set of specialized neurons that coordinate this turn-taking, but instead what we found is that hearing each other actually causes inhibition of those neurons -- that's the key regulating the incredible timing between the two.""For the study, the team had to travel to the heart of the plain-tail wren music scene, within remote bamboo forests on the slopes of Ecuador's active Antisana Volcano. Camped at the Yanayacu Biological Station's lab, the team made neurophysiological recordings of four pairs of native wrens as they sang solo and duet songs, analyzing sensorimotor activity in a premotor area of the birds' brains where specialized neurons for learning and making music are active.The recordings showed that during duet turn-taking -- which often take the form of tightly knit call-and-answer phrases, or syllables, that together sound as if a single bird is singing -- the birds' neurons fired rapidly when they produced their own syllables. Yet, as one wren begins to hear their partner's syllables sung in the duet, the neurons quiet down significantly. ""You can think of inhibition as acting like a trampoline,"" explained Fortune. ""When the birds hear their partner, the neurons are inhibited, but just like rebounding off a trampoline, the release from that inhibition causes them to swiftly respond when it's their time to sing.""Next, the team played recordings of wrens duetting while they were in a sleep-like state, anesthetized with a drug that affects a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the wrens' brains that is also found in humans, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The drug transformed the activity in the brain, from inhibition to bursts of activity when the wrens heard their own music. ""These mechanisms are shared or similar to what happens in our brains because we are doing the same kind of things,"" said Fortune. ""There are similar brain circuits in humans that are involved in learning and coordinating vocalizations.""Fortune and Coleman say the results offer a fresh look into how the brains of humans and other cooperating animals use sensory cues to act in concert with each other, from flowing musical and dance performances, or even the disjointed feeling of inhibition commonly experienced today during video conferencing.""These days, inhibition is occurring at all the wrong times when we have poor internet connections during our Zoom, WebEx, and Facetime conferences. The delays affect the sensory information that we rely on for coordinating the timing of our conversations,"" said Coleman. ""I think this study is important for understanding how we interact with the world whenever we are trying to produce a single behavior as two performers. We are wired for cooperation, the same way as these jazz singing wrens.""Reference: Coleman MJ, Day NF, Rivera-Parra P, Fortune ES. Neurophysiological coordination of duet singing.

But they can still fall short of being physically with someone.""Our social cues are limited online,"" said Fannie Liu, a research scientist at Snap Inc who earned her Ph.D. from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute in Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. ""We're exploring a new way to support digital connection through a deeper and more internal cue.""Liu was part of a team from CMU, Snap and the University of Washington that built Significant Otter, an app designed primarily for smart watches that allows couples to communicate with each other based on their sensed heart rate. The team presented their work this month at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) Conference.As the app's name suggests, it uses otters to communicate. The app allows couples to send animated otters to one another that represent emotions and activities. For example, otters can be sad, excited, calm or angry, or they can be working, exercising, eating or tired. The app senses a person's heartrate and then suggests otters with the emotion or activity that may correspond to it. A fast heartrate could prompt the app to suggest an excited or angry otter, or an otter that is exercising or eating.The partner can then respond with preset reactions. The reactions aren't based on the person's heartrate but are instead designed to give support to the person communicating based on their heartrate. Example reactions include otters hugging, holding each other's hands or even giving an encouraging thumbs up.The team tested the app in April and May 2020 with 20 couples separated by the pandemic and found that the use of biosignals -- in this case, heartrate -- made for easier and more authentic communication. Liu and the team didn't intend to test the app during the pandemic, but couples who participated in the test said that the app gave them a sense of their partner's physical state even when they couldn't be physically together.""It's coming from your heart,"" Liu said.

Klotho, which is often referred to as the  longevity gene  has now been shown in this study to play a central role in the production of hippocampal adult-born new neurons or neurogenesis.Adult-born hippocampal neurons are important for memory formation and their production declines with age, explaining in part cognitive decline in older people.The researchers split female mice into three groups; a control group that received a standard diet of daily feeding, a daily Calorie Restricted (CR) diet, and Intermittent Fasting (IF) in which the mice were fed every other day. The latter two groups were fed 10% less calories than the control.Over the course of three months, the mice in the IF group demonstrated improved long-term memory retention compared to the other groups. When the brains of these mice were studied, it was apparent that the Klotho gene was upregulated, and neurogenesis increased compared to those that were on the CR diet. Dr Thuret s previous work has demonstrated that calorie restricted diets in humans can improve memory function. That research showed that IF can enhance learning processes and could affect age associated cognitive impairment.Dr Gisele Pereira Dias from King s IoPPN said  In demonstrating that IF is a more effective means of improving long term memory than other calorie-controlled diets, we ve given ourselves an excellent means of going forwards. To see such significant improvements by lowering the total calorie intake by only 10% shows that there is a lot of promise. The researchers now hope to recreate this study with human participants in order to further explore the effects of IF.Reference: Dias GP, Murphy T, Stangl D, et al.

WHO convened an expert group of partners from around the world to do so, including experts who are part of existing naming systems, nomenclature and virus taxonomic experts, researchers and national authorities.WHO will assign labels for those variants that are designated as Variants of Interest or Variants of Concern by WHO. These will be posted on the WHO website.These labels do not replace existing scientific names (e.g. those assigned by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango), which convey important scientific information and will continue to be used in research.While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting. As a result, people often resort to calling variants by the places where they are detected, which is stigmatizing and discriminatory.

The researchers then used simulations to predict that the amount of oxygen supplied to hippocampal neurons furthest from blood vessels is only just enough for the cells to keep working normally.Dr Catherine Hall, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Sussex says: These findings are an important step in the search for preventative measures and treatments for Alzheimer s, because they suggest that increasing blood flow in the hippocampus might be really effective at preventing damage from happening. If it s right that increasing blood flow in the hippocampus is important in protecting the brain from diseases like Alzheimer s, then it will throw further weight behind the importance of regular exercise and a low-cholesterol diet to long-term brain health. We think that the hippocampus exists at a watershed.  It s just about OK normally, but when anything else happens to decrease brain blood flow, oxygen levels in the hippocampus reduce to levels that stop neurons working. We think that s probably why Alzheimer s disease first causes memory problems   because the early decrease in blood flow stops the hippocampus from working properly. The same factors that put you at risk of having a heart attack make you more likely to develop dementia. That s because our brains need enough blood flow to provide energy   in the form of oxygen and glucose   so brain cells can work properly, and because blood flow can clear away waste products such as the beta amyloid proteins that build up in Alzheimer s disease. Now we want to discover whether the lower blood flow and oxygen levels in the hippocampus are what causes beta amyloid to start to build up in Alzheimer s disease. Understanding what causes early damage will be really important to help us learn how to treat or prevent disease. Dr Kira Shaw, a psychology researcher at the University of Sussex who undertook the main experiments, said: We found that blood flow and oxygen levels in the hippocampus were lower than those in the visual cortex. Also, when neurons are active, there is a large increase in blood flow and oxygen levels in the visual cortex. This provides energy to hungry neurons. But in the hippocampus, these responses were much smaller. The scientists also found that blood vessels in the hippocampus contained fewer mRNA transcripts (codes for making proteins) for proteins that shape blood vessel dilation. Additionally, the cells that dilate small blood vessels, called pericytes, were a different shape in the hippocampus than in the visual cortex.Dr Shaw concluded:  We think blood vessels in the hippocampus are less able to dilate than in the visual cortex .Reference: Shaw K, Bell L, Boyd K, et al.

Beyond the fact that it can store information, further fascinating aspects of DNA are its geometric and topological properties, such as knotting and super-coiling. Indeed, very much like a twisted telephone cord, DNA is often found coiled up inside bacteria and other cells and even knotted in viruses. Now, a collaboration of scientists from the Universities of Edinburgh, San Diego and Vienna have started to harness these properties to craft ""topologically tunable"" DNA-based complex fluids and soft materials with potential applications in drug delivery and tissue regeneration as published in Science Advances.The well-known double helical shape of DNA has profound implications on its behaviour. A linear DNA molecule, that is a DNA molecule with two ends, can freely twist and turn. By contrast, joining the two ends to form a DNA circle entails that any over or under twisting of the double-helix remains ""topologically locked"" i.e. the extra twist cannot be removed without cutting the molecule. Over or under twists have interesting consequences for how DNA molecules arrange in space -- in particular, they coil and buckle onto themselves very much like an old telephone cord into so called supercoiled conformations (Fig. 1). The buckling of DNA relieves stress from the over/under twisting, and thereby decreases the overall size of the molecule. For this reason it is thought that supercoiling is a natural mechanism employed by cells to package their genome into tiny spaces. While the smaller size naturally leads to faster diffusion of DNA molecules in solution e.g. in water or through gel pores, because of the lower drag, this well-understood behaviour does not occur when many DNA molecules are packed and entangled like spaghetti in a bowl.""We have performed large-scale computer simulations of dense solutions of DNA molecules with different degree of supercoiling and found several surprising results."", explains Jan Smrek from the University of Vienna, the first author of the study. ""In contrast to the dilute case, the more super-coiled the DNA rings, the larger their size."" Since the molecules need to avoid each other, their shapes adopt strongly asymmetric and branched conformations that occupy more volume than their non-supercoiled counterparts. Intriguingly, and contrary to expectations, ""the larger DNA molecules still yield faster diffusion."" The faster diffusion means that the solution has lower viscosity.Supercoiled DNA molecules occurring naturally in bacteria are known as plasmids. In vivo, cells have special proteins called topoisomerase that can reduce the amount of supercoiling in plasmids. ""Thanks to these proteins -- which can be purified and used in the lab -- we are able to control the extent of supercoiling in entangled DNA plasmids and study their dynamics using fluorescent dyes. We were amazed to discover that, indeed, DNA plasmids that were treated with topoisomerase, and hence with low supercoiling, are slower than their highly supercoiled counterparts."" explains Rae Robertson Anderson, who led the experiments at the University of San Diego.To explain the surprising faster dynamics the scientists used large scale simulations on supercomputers to quantify how entangled the molecules in solutions are. While it is known that a ringshaped polymer -- rather similar to a circular DNA plasmid -- can be threaded by another ring, meaning that the latter can pierce through the eye of the former, it was not known how this type of entanglement impacts the motion of supercoiled DNA. Thanks to the simulations, the scientists found that a high degree of supercoiling decreases the penetrable area of each molecule resulting, in turn, in fewer threadings between the plasmids and ultimately yielding a solution with lower viscosity. Nevertheless, the plasmids could still wrap around one another and constrain each others' motion without threading. Yet, the supercoiling stiffens the conformations and thereby making them less prone to bend and entwine tightly, which reduces this type of entanglement too.Davide Michieletto from the University of Edinburgh concludes, ""not only did we find these novel effects in simulations, but we also demonstrated these trends experimentally and developed a theory describing them quantitatively. By changing the supercoiling we can tune the viscosity of these complex fluids at will. We now understand much better the connection between the adaptive geometry of the molecules and the resulting material properties. This is not only exciting from the fundamental perspective, but also promises useful applications. Using dedicated enzymes, such as the topoisomerase, one can design switchable DNA-based soft materials with tunable properties.""Reference: Smrek J, Garamella J, Robertson-Anderson R, Michieletto D.

These results strengthen and expand previously published outcomes.Patients who received the treatment are less likely to go on to experience fatal cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks, lung problems or other cancers. As well as avoiding scattered radiation from EBRT that can damage nearby vital organs, delivering TARGIT-IORT during the lumpectomy procedure seems to lower the likelihood of death if patients do go on to develop cardiovascular disease, protecting in a drug-like manner. This was the case even when EBRT was also given post-operatively, and is thought to be because the treatment changes the microenvironment in the lumpectomy wound.","Published: June 1, 2021"

Liu s treatment works by leveraging macrophages, specialized white blood cells involved in the detection and elimination of cancer cells and other pathogens. Macrophages also activate T-cells which then attack and destroy cancer cells. Under normal conditions, this system works well to limit the growth of abnormal cells. However, cancer cells are tricky. Macrophages are vulnerable to cancer cells masquerading as healthy cells by co-opting mechanisms normal cells rely on that evade immune surveillance and detection. These mechanisms can profoundly increase cancer s ability to grow and resist traditional treatment.This new immunotherapy alters macrophages by knocking out Signal-regulatory protein   (SIRP ), a receptor whose primary function is to prevent macrophages from engulfing and destroying healthy cells. Cancer cells often exploit SIRP  by expressing a marker (CD47) that disguises them as normal cells. In the animal study, published in Nature Communications, Liu and her team found that Sirp -deficient macrophages initiate a robust immune response against cancer by triggering inflammation and activating tumor-specific T-cells.The immune system is built to fight off invaders and aberrant cell growths like cancer. But cancer can also suppress and subvert the natural immune response by making it difficult for the body to recognize cancer cells as abnormal. While immunotherapy, which helps recruit the immune system to attack cancer cells, has revolutionized the treatment of tumors, the therapies only work for a limited number of patients. Scientists recognize that tumor-specific T-cells are the best weapon we have against cancer, but immunosuppression prevents them from doing their job,  Liu said.  Our treatment uses macrophages like a general to call up an army of T-cell soldiers to kill cancer.  The study demonstrates the treatment is effective   and does not destroy large amounts of healthy cells   when delivered locally to the tumor site in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT), one of the cornerstone treatments for cancer. To kill the cancer without harming the patient, you need to localize the effects,  Liu said.  We developed a method that is very effective while minimizing the global adverse effects. The researchers found that local RT cured colorectal cancer and two types of pancreatic cancer in SIRP -deficient mice with advanced tumors. The findings are significant, given that colorectal and pancreatic cancers are often treatment-resistant with high mortality rates.The mice in the study developed inflammatory immune responses, and in most cases the tumors stopped growing immediately after irradiation. Within four to 12 days, mice with small and medium tumors had cleared the cancer completely, without apparent long-term adverse effects, and the animals remained tumor-free for the remainder of the study. In general, mice that were cured of their cancer exhibited similar longevity (about 18 months) as healthy mice.The treatment also prevented one of the major negative effects of RT   its tendency to drive a strong wound-healing response that can result in the regrowth of cancer, as the local immune response is suppressed to promote new tissue growth and repair at the site of the RT. This mechanism, however, was absent post-RT in the SIRP -deficient mice.The mice exhibited long-lasting immunity to the cancer, which Koby Kidder, a Ph.D. student at Georgia State and co-author of the study, said is the result of an immune response robust enough to control the tumor cells throughout the body. Even when the cured mice were injected with new cancer cells, these cells failed to form tumors, suggesting the animals had acquired long-term immunity that prevented tumor recurrence. The reason we achieved such a high degree of efficacy is that we directly used the macrophage to mobilize other cells within the body,  Kidder said.  The mounting of a consummate anti-tumor immune response in concert with removing immunosuppressive factors (cells and cytokines) from the tumor microenvironment drastically affected the immune response. By removing SIRP  and combining it with radiotherapy, we elicited such a robust response it essentially cured the cancer. The study demonstrates SIRP  is a master controller of immunity inside the tumor microenvironment, directing post-RT wound healing, strengthening immunosuppression, conferring treatment resistance and allowing the cancer to progress. In the absence of SIRP , however, antitumor immune responses are significantly enhanced.The treatment has the potential to become a  pan-cancer therapy,  meaning it could be used to cure a broad spectrum of cancers, including those at advanced stages with metastasis. The study provides strong proof-of-concept for developing Sirp -negative macrophage-based cell therapies, Liu said.The cell therapy approach has already been tested against the entire NCI-60 cancer panel   made up of 60 various human tumor cell lines representing leukemia, melanoma, lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate and kidney cancers   and has been found to be effective. The researchers are applying for approval of the therapy as an investigational new drug by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and hope to begin human clinical trials in 2022.Reference: Bian Z, Shi L, Kidder K, et al.

It consists of a system of cells, and when there is a shortage of cells, it affects the performance of the immune system.This is seen in e.g. cancer patients following chemotherapy. This is because chemotherapy targets all the cells in your body, including the stem cells in your bone marrow, which were meant to develop into new immune cells. This means that the immune system then lacks cells to fight new infections.There are drugs that can harvest stem cells from the bone marrow, so that they can be returned to the patients after treatment. They then develop into new immune cells, enabling the body to once again fight incoming threats. But previously, we lacked detailed knowledge of how these drugs worked.Now, a study conducted in mice by researchers at the University of Copenhagen demonstrates how the medicine works at the cell level - and, surprisingly, how one of the two applied and tested drugs is more effective than the other, despite the fact that the other drug, on paper, appears to be the most effective of the two. This discovery may not just help improve stem cell transplantation; it may also lead to improved drugs in the future.""We have tested two drugs for stem cell transplantation which appear to have the same effect. What they do is block a receptor, causing the bone marrow to release stem cells into the blood. What the new study shows, though, is that they do not just block the receptor; one of the two drugs also affects other signalling pathways in the cell. And in short, that makes it more effective than the other of the two drugs,"" says PhD Student Astrid Sissel J rgensen from the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.""We used to believe that all we had to do was block the receptor, and that the two drugs had the same effect. It now appears that there is more to it,"" she says.The drugs tested by the researchers mobilize stem cells by acting as CXCR4 receptor antagonists. This means that they inhibit or reduce activity of the receptor. Several drugs target this receptor, including drugs inhibiting HIV replication.""The drugs not only block the receptor's normal signalling. One of the two drugs we have tested also affect some of the other cell pathways and even make the receptor withdraw into the cell and disappear from the surface,"" explains Professor Mette Rosenkilde, who is the corresponding author of the study. The study results reveal that one of the two drugs makes the bone marrow release more stem cells into the blood.This knowledge about how drugs affect cell pathways differently is also known as biased signalling. And it is things like these that make one of the drugs more effective in practice than on paper.According to the researchers, the new knowledge on biased signalling challenges our current view of these drugs.""The results of our study directly influence our view of drugs used for stem cell transplantation. In the long term, though, it may also affect our view of future drugs, and how new drugs should be designed to have the best possible effect, both in connection with stem cell mobilisation, but also for treating HIV infections, where this particular receptor also plays a main role,"" says Mette Rosenkilde.Reference: J rgensen AS, Daugvilaite V, De Filippo K. et al.

The lead author Maite Gandariasbeitia explains: ""Rapeseed cake and beer bagasse are two potential organic treatments which have shown really positive results in previous studies.""Their high nitrogen content promotes the activity of beneficial microorganisms in the soil, which helps to break down organic matter like manure and kill off nematodes and other parasites which damage crops.""Gandariasbeitia also highlights how nematodes can negatively impact crop yields: ""Root-knot nematodes are a type of common soil parasite which penetrate a plant's root tissue to lay their eggs and this activity causes galls, or knot-like swellings, to form on the root,"" she says.""This damage negatively impacts root development and means the crop can't take up nutrients efficiently, slowing plant growth and ultimately, leading to reduced yields for farmers.""To disinfest the soil and reduce these nematode populations, beer bagasse and rapeseed cake were incorporated into the soil with fresh cow manure as a potential organic treatment.

This week, a team of biologists studying the tree of life has unveiled a new classification system for cell nuclei and discovered a method for transmuting one type of cell nucleus into another.The study, which appears this week in the journal Science, emerged from several once-separate efforts. One of these centered on the DNA Zoo, an international consortium spanning dozens of institutions including Baylor College of Medicine, the National Science Foundation-supported Center for Theoretical Biological Physics (CTBP) at Rice University, the University of Western Australia and SeaWorld.Scientists on the DNA Zoo team had been working together to classify how chromosomes, which can be several meters long, fold up to fit inside the nuclei of different species from across the tree of life.""Whether we were looking at worms or urchins, sea squirts or coral, we kept seeing the same folding patterns coming up,"" said Dr. Olga Dudchenko, co-first author of the new study and a member of the Center for Genome Architecture at Baylor and CTBP.Eventually, the team realized it was just seeing variants on two overall nuclear designs. ""In some species, chromosomes are organized like the pages of a printed newspaper, with the outer margins on one side and the folded middle at the other,"" explained Dudchenko, who also is co-director of DNA Zoo. ""And then in other species, each chromosome is crumpled into a little ball.""""So we had a puzzle,"" said Dr. Erez Lieberman Aiden, an associate professor of molecular and human genetics and Emeritus McNair Scholar at Baylor, co-director of the DNA Zoo and senior author on the new study. ""The data implied that over the course of evolution, species can switch back and forth from one type to the other. We wondered: What is the controlling mechanism? Might it be possible to change one type of nucleus into another in the lab?"" Aiden also is director of the Center for Genome Architecture and a senior investigator at CTBP.Meanwhile, an independent team in the Netherlands had discovered something unexpected. ""I was doing experiments on a protein called condensin II, which we knew plays a role in how cells divide,"" said Claire Hoencamp, co-first author of the study and a member of the laboratory of Dr. Benjamin Rowland at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. ""But we observed the strangest thing: When we mutated the protein in human cells, the chromosomes would totally rearrange. It was baffling!""The two teams met at a conference in the Austrian mountains, where Rowland presented his lab's latest work. They soon realized that Hoencamp had hit on a way to convert human cells from one nuclear type to another.""When we looked at the genomes being studied at the DNA Zoo, we discovered that evolution had already done our experiment many, many times! When mutations in a species break condensin II, they usually flip the whole architecture of the nucleus,"" said Rowland, senior author on the study. ""It's always a little disappointing to get scooped on an experiment, but evolution had a very long head start.""The team decided to work together to confirm condensin II's role. But then the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and much of the world shut down.""Without access to our laboratories, we were left with only one way to establish what condensin II was doing,"" Hoencamp said. ""We needed to create a computer program that could simulate the effects of condensin II on the chain of hundreds of millions of genetic letters that comprise each human chromosome.""The team turned to Dr. Jos  Onuchic, the Harry C. and Olga K. Wiess Chair of Physics at Rice. ""Our simulations showed that by destroying condensin II, you could make a human nucleus reorganize to resemble a fly nucleus,"" said Onuchic, co-director of CTBP, which includes collaborators at Rice, Baylor, Northeastern University and other institutions in Houston and Boston.The simulations were performed by a team within Onuchic's lab at CTBP, led by postdoctoral fellow and co-first author Dr. Sumitabha Brahmachari, working with Dr. Vinicius Contessoto, a former postdoc at CTBP, and Dr. Michele Di Pierro, a CTBP senior investigator and currently an assistant professor at Northeastern University.""We began with an incredibly broad survey of 2 billion years of nuclear evolution,"" Brahmachari said.

This method exploits the fragmentation patterns of the small DNA fragments that tumors leak into the blood stream, which reflect the unique epigenetic signature of many childhood cancers. Focusing on Ewing sarcoma, a bone tumor of children and young adults with unmet clinical need, the team led by Eleni Tomazou, PhD, St. Anna CCRI, demonstrates the method's utility for tumor classification and monitoring, which permits close surveillance of cancer therapy without highly invasive tumor biopsies.In tumors, cancer cells constantly divide, with some of the cancer cells dying in the process. These cells often release their DNA into the blood stream, where it circulates and can be analyzed using genomic methods such as high-throughput DNA sequencing. Such ""so-termed liquid biopsy"" analyses provide a minimally invasive alternative to conventional tumor biopsies that often require surgery, holding great promise for personalized therapies. For example, it becomes possible to check frequently for molecular changes in the tumor. However, the use of liquid biopsy for childhood cancers has so far been hampered by the fact that many childhood tumors have few genetic alterations that are detectable in DNA isolated from blood plasma.Exploiting tumor-specific epigenetic patternsCell-free DNA from dying tumor cells circulates in the blood in the form of small fragments. Their size is neither random nor determined solely by the DNA sequence. Rather, it reflects how the DNA is packaged inside the cancer cells, and it is influenced by the chromatin (i.e., complex of DNA, protein and RNA) structure and epigenetic profiles of these cells. This is very relevant because epigenetic patterns - sometimes referred to as the ""second code"" of the genome - are characteristically different for different cell types in the human body. Epigenetic mechanisms lead to changes in gene function that are not based on changes in the DNA sequence but are passed on to daughter cells. The analysis of cell-free DNA fragmentation patterns provides a unique opportunity to learn about the epigenetic regulation inside the tumor without having to surgically remove tumor cells or even know whether and where in the body a tumor exists.""We previously identified unique epigenetic signatures of Ewing sarcoma. We reasoned that these characteristic epigenetic signatures should be preserved in the fragmentation patterns of tumor-derived DNA circulating in the blood. This would provide us with a much-needed marker for early diagnosis and tumor classification using the liquid biopsy concept"", explains Dr. Tomazou, Principal Investigator of the Epigenome-based precision medicine group at St. Anna CCRI.Machine learning increases sensitivityThe new study benchmarks various metrics for analyzing cell-free DNA fragmentation, and it introduces the LIQUORICE algorithm for detecting circulating tumor DNA based on cancer-specific chromatin signatures. The scientists used machine-learning classifiers to distinguish between patients with cancer and healthy individuals, and between different types of pediatric sarcomas. ""By feeding these machine learning algorithms with our extensive whole genome sequencing data of tumor-derived DNA in the blood stream, the analysis becomes highly sensitive and in many instances outperforms conventional genetic analyses"", says Dr. Tomazou.When asked about potential applications, she explains: ""Our assay works well, we are very excited. However, further validation will be needed before it can become part of routine clinical diagnostics."" According to the scientists, their approach could be used for minimally invasive diagnosis and, but also as a prognostic marker, monitoring which patient responds to therapy. Additionally, it might serve as a predictive marker during neoadjuvant therapy (i.e., chemotherapy before surgery), potentially enabling dose adjustments according to treatment response. ""Right now, most patients receive very high doses of chemotherapy, while some patients may be cured already with a less severe therapy, which would reduce their risk of getting other cancers later in life. There is a real medical need for adaptive clinical trials and personalized treatment of bone tumors in children.""Reference: Peneder P, St tz AM, Surdez D, et al.

Neuroscientists from Synapsy - the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research into Mental Illness - based at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and Lausanne University (UNIL) have recently demonstrated that lactate, a molecule produced by the body during exercise, has an antidepressant effect in mice. Lactate is best known for the pivotal role it plays in the nutrition of neurons inside the brain. Yet it can also counter the inhibition of the survival and proliferation of new neurons, a loss seen in patients suffering from depression and in stressed animal. Furthermore, the research team pinpointed NADH as a vital component in the mechanism: this is a molecule with antioxidant properties that is derived from the metabolism of lactate. The findings, published in the scientific journal Molecular Psychiatry, provide a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underpin physical activity, which should lead to an improvement in the way depression is treated in the future.WHO recognises depression - which affects nearly 264 million people - as the leading cause of disability worldwide. Treatments based on antidepressants and psychotherapy are available to help people suffering from the disorder. Yet, as Jean-Luc Martin, senior lecturer and researcher at CHUV's Centre for Psychiatric Neurosciences (CNP) and UNIL, Synapsy member and co-director of the study together with Professor Pierre Magistretti, points out: ""Around 30% of people with depression don't respond to antidepressants.""

Fluorescence microscopy is often used to image molecular and cellular details of the brain in animal models of various diseases but, until now, has been limited to small volumes and highly invasive procedures due to intense light scattering by the skin and skull. Visualization of biological dynamics in an unperturbed environment, deep in a living organism, is essential for understanding the complex biology of living organisms and progression of diseases,  said research team leader Daniel Razansky from the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, both in Switzerland.  Our study represents the first time that 3D fluorescence microscopy has been performed fully noninvasively at capillary level resolution in an adult mouse brain, effectively covering a field of view of about 1 centimeter. In Optica, The Optical Society's (OSA) journal for high impact research, the researchers describe their new technique, which is called diffuse optical localization imaging (DOLI). It takes advantage of what is known as the second near-infrared (NIR-II) spectral window from 1000 to 1700 nanometers, which exhibits less scattering. Enabling high-resolution optical observations in deep living tissues represents a long-standing goal in the biomedical imaging field,  said Razansky.  DOLI s superb resolution for deep-tissue optical observations can provide functional insights into the brain, making it a promising platform for studying neural activity, microcirculation, neurovascular coupling and neurodegeneration.

This part of the study included 1.2 million participants. The researchers crosschecked their findings from that analysis with an entirely separate sample of 1.3 million volunteers from 23andMe customers.When the two sets of data from the different sources were compared, genetic variants linked to depression replicated with statistical significance for most of the markers tested.""What is most heartening is we could replicate our findings in independent data sets,"" said Daniel Levey, an associate research scientist in the Yale Department of Psychiatry and co-lead author. ""Replication is a hallmark of good science, and this paper points to just how reliable and stable results from GWAS studies are becoming.""Like many mental health disorders, depression is genetically complex and is characterized by combinations of many different genetic variants, the researchers say.""That's why we weren't surprised by how many variants we found,"" said Joel Gelernter, the Foundations Fund Professor of Psychiatry at Yale, professor of genetics and of neuroscience, and co-senior author of the study. ""And we don't know how many more there are left to discover -- hundreds? Maybe even thousands?""The size of the new GWAS study will help clinicians to develop polygenic risk scores to pinpoint those most at risk of developing major depression and other related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, the authors say.The study also provides deep insights into the underlying biology of genetic disorders. For instance, one gene variant implicated in depression, NEGR1, is a neural growth regulator active in the hypothalamus, an area of the brain previously linked to depression. That confirms research done by the late Yale neuroscientist Ronald Duman on the role of neurotrophic factors in depression, Levey said.""It's really striking when completely different kinds of research converge on similar biology, and that's what's happening here,"" he said.Insights into the functions of the variants can also help identify many drugs that hold promise in the treatment of depression, the researchers say. For instance, the drug riluzole, which is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), modulates glutamate transmission in brain. Several gene variants linked by the new study to depression affect the glutamate system, which is actively being studied for depression treatments.""One of the real goals of the research is bringing forward new ways to treat people suffering from depression,"" added co-senior author Dr. Murray Stein, staff psychiatrist at the V.A.

These questions have led to many scientific theories over the years, and now a team of researchers at the Universities of Glasgow and Birmingham have been able to provide some answers.Their new study, which is published today in Nature Communications, demonstrates that our memories become less vibrant and detailed over time, with only the central gist eventually preserved. Moreover, this 'gistification' of our memories is boosted when we frequently recall our recent experiences.The work could have implications in a number of areas, including the nature of memories in post-traumatic stress disorder, the repeated questioning of eye-witness testimonies and even in best practice for exam studying.While memories are not exact carbon copies of the past - remembering is understood to be a highly reconstructive process - experts have suggested that the contents of a memory could change each time we bring it back to mind.However, exactly how our memories differ from the original experiences, and how they are transformed over time, has until now proven difficult to measure in laboratory settings.For this study the researchers developed a simple computerised task that measures how fast people can recover certain characteristics of visual memories when prompted to do so. Participants learned word-image pairs and were later required to recollect different elements of the image when cued with the word. For example, participants were asked to indicate, as fast as possible, if the image was coloured or greyscale (a perceptual detail), or whether it showed an animate or inanimate object (a semantic element).These tests, probing the quality of the visual memories, happened immediately after learning and also after a two-day delay. Reaction time patterns showed that participants were faster to recollect meaningful, semantic elements than surface, perceptual ones.Julia Lifanov, lead author of the study from the University of Birmingham, said: ""Many memory theories assume that over time, and as people re-tell their stories, they tend to forget the surface details but retain the meaningful, semantic content of an event.""Imagine reminiscing about a pre-COVID dinner with a friend - you realize that you cannot recall the table d cor but know exactly what you ordered; or you remember the conversation with the bartender, but not the colour of his shirt. Memory experts call this phenomenon 'semanticization'.""Prof Maria Wimber, senior author on the study from the University of Glasgow, said: ""The pattern towards recollection of meaningful semantic elements we demonstrate in this study indicates that memories are biased towards meaningful content in the first place - and we have shown in previous studies that this bias is clearly reflected in brain signals too.""Our memories change with time and use and that is a good and adaptive thing. We want our memories to retain the information that is most likely to be useful in the future, when we encounter similar situations.""The researchers found that the bias towards semantic memory content becomes significantly stronger with the passage of time, and with repeated remembering. When participants came back to the lab two days later, they were much slower at answering the perceptual-detailed questions, but they show relatively preserved memory for the semantic content of the images. However, the shift from detail-rich to more concept-based memories was far less pronounced in a group of subjects who repeatedly viewed the images, rather than being asked to actively bringing them back to mind.The study has implications for probing the nature of memories in health and disease. It provides a tool to study maladaptive changes, for example in post-traumatic stress disorder where patients often suffer from intrusive, traumatic memories, and tend to over-generalize these experiences to novel situations. The findings are also highly relevant for understanding how eyewitness memories may be biased by frequent interviews and repeatedly recalling the same event.The findings also demonstrate that testing yourself prior to an exam (for example, by using flashcards) will make the meaningful information stick for longer, especially when followed by periods of rest and sleep.Reference: Lifanov J, Linde-Domingo J, Wimber M.

In all, 84 different symptoms and clinical signs were reported, including loss of taste and smell, cognitive disorders such as loss of memory and difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety, chest pain and fevers.The findings raise concern about an immense public health burden if even a portion of these patients need continuing care, said Steven Goodman, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and a professor of epidemiology and population health and of medicine. If something on the order of 70% of those coming out of moderate to serious COVID-19 are showing persisting symptoms, that is a huge number,  Goodman said.The study will publish May 26 in JAMA Network Open. Tahmina Nasserie, a graduate student in epidemiology, is the lead author.  It s astonishing how many symptoms are part of what s now being referred to as long COVID,  Goodman said. He added that the review found wide discrepancies in design and quality of the studies, making it difficult to compare results, but it remained evident that the problem of persistent symptoms is substantial. A recent initiative to study long COVID was launched by the National Institutes of Health, which will be allocating $1.15 billion toward research on the subject.The authors collected and analyzed results from 45 different studies published in English between January 2020 and March 2021. The studies included a total of  9,751 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 83% of whom had been hospitalized. Goodman added that there is little research available on post-COVID-19 symptoms among those with milder cases, but that two studies, reporting on 214 outpatients, showed high frequencies of persistent symptoms.For their review, the authors defined persistent symptoms as those lasting for at least 60 days after diagnosis, symptom onset or hospital admission, or at least 30 days after recovery from acute illness or hospital discharge. The majority of the studies followed patients no more than three months, but a few followed patients for six months. We did this study because there have been a lot of news commentaries and scientific articles talking about long-term COVID symptoms,  Nasserie said.  But few had dug into the scientific evidence deeply enough to show the full range, how long they lasted and whom they affected. The authors found that 72.5% of study participants reported at least one persistent symptom. The rates were as high in two six-month studies. The symptoms indicated that a variety of systems within the body were affected, including cardiac, respiratory, neuromuscular, neurological, circulatory and immune systems, Nasserie said. The most commonly occurring symptoms were shortness of breath, fatigue, exhaustion and sleep problems.  The numbers are very shocking, especially for fatigue and shortness of breath,  Nasserie said.  These were pretty debilitating symptoms, with some people reporting difficulty walking up a flight of stairs.  About 40% of patients said they experienced fatigue, 36% said they experienced shortness of breath and 29% said they experienced sleep disorders. Depression and anxiety, along with general pain and discomfort, were also relatively common: About 20% of patients described these symptoms. An inability to concentrate, commonly referred to as  brain fog,  was mentioned by about 25% of patients.As an epidemiologist who studies patterns of disease, Goodman said he became increasingly concerned about the lingering effects of COVID-19 in early fall 2020 as news reports emerged of patients calling themselves  long haulers  and reporting a variety of unusual symptoms after recovering from the acute phase of the illness. Early on, we completely ignored the long-term consequences of getting sick with this virus,  Goodman said.  People were being told this was all in their heads. The question now isn t is this real, but how big is the problem. Reference:Nasserie T, Hittle M, Goodman SN.

Radiotherapy works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, and cells sustaining so much DNA damage that they cannot sufficiently repair it will soon cease to replicate and die. It's an effective strategy overall, and radiotherapy is a common frontline cancer treatment option. Unfortunately, many cancers have subsets of cells that are able to survive initial radiotherapeutic regimens by developing mechanisms that are able to repair the DNA damage. This often results in resistance to further radiation as cancerous growth recurs. But until recently, little was known about exactly what happens in the genomes of cancer cells following radiotherapy. To probe the traits of post-radiotherapy cancer genomics, Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Professor Roel Verhaak, Ph.D., led a team that analyzed gliomas, a brain cancer, both when they first arose and after they recurred in 190 patients. They also looked at data from nearly 3,700 other post-treatment metastatic tumors. In ""Radiotherapy is associated with a deletion signature that contributes to poor outcomes in cancer patients,"" published in Nature Genetics, the researchers present findings showing that radiotherapy is associated with consistent genomic damage in the form of a large number of DNA deletions. The study also implicates an error-prone DNA damage repair mechanism as being an important contributor to the deletion signature. Targeting this DNA repair mechanism may help maximize the efficacy of radiotherapy. The study was co-led by Floris Barthel, M.D., a senior fellow in the group, and first author Emre Kocakavuk, M.D., a visiting student from University Hospital Essen in Germany.Analyzing the pre- and post-treatment glioma datasets as well as the post-treatment metastatic tumor dataset, Verhaak and his team identified a significant increase of small (five to 15 base pair) deletions and chromosome or chromosome-arm level deletions in response to radiation. Furthermore, the post-treatment small deletion pattern had distinct characteristics that implicate canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) as the preferred repair pathway for radiation-induced DNA damage.""c-NHEJ is an error-prone mechanism for DNA repair that cancer cells need to use to mitigate the damage done by radiation. We discovered that small deletions commonly happen as a consequence,"" says Verhaak.The research also reveals that patients who acquire the high small deletion burden have significantly shorter survival than others post-radiotherapy. The finding implies that the deletion signature is associated with a loss of sensitivity to subsequent radiotherapy and suggests that the presence of many small deletions may serve as a biomarker for radiotherapy response. Somewhat paradoxically, tumors that acquire the high deletion burden signature appear to become robust, possessing sufficient, if not precise, DNA repair to survive mutation-inducing treatments. Therefore, even if initial radiotherapy is effective, recurrent tumors that exhibit this genomic trait are unlikely to respond to more.On the other hand, the study supports the hypothesis that DNA repair inhibitors likely represent an effective therapeutic strategy and could improve cancer cell response to radiotherapy. At this point, research has indeed indicated that drugs known as PARP inhibitors are effective for treating various cancer types, and preliminary work is being done to evaluate other candidate DNA repair mechanism inhibitors.""Finding a robust signature of c-NHEJ in post-irradiated tumors is very exciting because it suggests that slowing this repair process during radiotherapy could potentially increase the effectiveness of treatment,"" says Barthel.Reference: Kocakavuk E, Anderson KJ, Varn FS, et al.

For example, when DNA becomes damaged, healthy white blood cells can use several different strategies to make repairs. But cancer cells may ""put all their eggs in one basket,"" getting rid of all backup plans and depending on just one pathway to mend their DNA. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor Christopher Vakoc focuses on probing cancers to figure out if they have any unique dependencies. His lab was surprised to discover that a single DNA repair method remained in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive cancer that originates in bone marrow. They discovered that if they shut down that pathway in cells grown in the laboratory, they could kill the cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed.Cancer cells may unintentionally remove multiple methods for fixing problems as they change their DNA to grow and spread quickly. But developing a dependency on just one repair pathway means that they have no backup plans if it fails. Vakoc explains:""Sometimes cancer cells, to become ""super cells,"" they had to get rid of stuff that they thought they didn't need. You get rid of what you don't need, you kind of spring clean maybe a little too much, then you realize: 'Shoot!' You threw away something you actually do need.""In normal cells, a particular type of DNA damage can be solved with two different methods: the ALDH2 gene and the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. AML cells have inactivated ALDH2 and are dependent on the FA proteins to perform this DNA repair. The researchers showed that if they shut down the FA pathway, it resulted in cancer cell death.The team hopes their findings will lead to clinical treatments that eliminate cancer cells without harming other cells in the body. Vakoc says:""The reality is, there aren't that many differences between cancer cells and normal cells with regard to dependencies. So this is one of the most striking things we've found, which is the kind of win-win for us, to discover a dependency that can be modified with a drug is, we think, the way to make new cancer medicines that are safer and more effective.""Reference: Yang Z, Wu XS, Wei Y, et al.

A new study by investigators at Brigham and Women s Hospital used an ultrasensitive, single-molecule array (Simoa) assay to detect extremely low levels of molecules in the blood and measured how these levels change over the days and weeks following vaccination. The team found evidence of circulating protein subunits of SARS-CoV-2, followed by evidence of the body mounting its immune response and then clearing the viral protein to below the level of single-molecule detection. Results are published in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Because of our ultra-sensitive method, we re able to corroborate that the mRNA vaccine is operating as intended, stoking the body s immune response,  said co-corresponding author David Walt, PhD, a member of the faculty in the Department of Pathology at the Brigham. Walt is also a member of the Wyss Institute and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.  We were able to detect extremely low levels of viral protein and see that as soon as the body begins generating antibodies, those levels declined to undetectable.  Walt has a financial interest in Quanterix Corporation, the company that developed the ultra-sensitive digital immunoassay platform used in this work.To conduct their study, Walt and colleagues measured levels of SARS-CoV-2 protein subunits in plasma samples collected from 13 participants who received two doses of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine. Specifically, the team measured levels of SARS-CoV-2 antigens Spike, S1, and Nucleocapsid. The team examined plasma collected at 10-13 timepoints between 1 and 29 days after the first injection and 1-28 days after the second injection. The average age of participants was 24 and the percentage of female participants was 46.The team found that 11-of-13 participants had low levels of SARS-CoV-2 protein (S1 subunit) as early as one day post-vaccination. S1 subunit protein level peaked on average five days after the first injection. In all participants, the level of S1 protein declined and became undetectable by day 14. Spike protein was detected in 3-of-13 participants an average of 15 days after the first injection. After the second vaccine dose, no S1 or Spike was detectable.The team collected corresponding antibody data and showed that the immune response began to mount after the viral proteins were produced. Increased antibody levels correlated with viral protein clearance from plasma.The researchers note that the level of translated protein detected was extremely low and disappeared once antibodies were detected. All participants in the study were healthy volunteers who were vaccinated but not infected with SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is designed to introduce mRNA into the body, which is then translated into the Spike protein. It is the Spike protein that can activate the immune system, which in turn creates antibodies to prevent future infections,  said co-first author Alana Ogata, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Walt lab.  We observed that antibodies that target Spike and S1 proteins are generated as early as 1-2 days after circulating S1 is detected, followed by the clearance of proteins. Additionally, we see that the second dose does not result in circulating protein but does provide an additional boost in antibody levels, as expected. Researchers note that limitations of the current study include the small sample size and potential biases that result from enrolling healthy, young adults, which may not be representative of the general population. The research team plans to continue their plasma studies in other populations, including pregnant people and children, to further understand the dynamics between viral proteins and the immune response.Reference: Ogata AF, Cheng C-A, Desjardins M, et al.

That s because at least four coronaviruses in the same general family as SARS-CoV-2 cause the benign yet annoying illness known as the common cold. In a new study that appears in Nature Communications, scientists from Scripps Research investigated how the immune system s previous exposure to cold-causing coronaviruses impact immune response to COVID-19. In doing so, they discovered one cross-reactive coronavirus antibody that s triggered during a COVID-19 infection.The findings will help in the pursuit of a vaccine or antibody treatment that works against most or all coronaviruses, says senior author Raiees Andrabi, PhD, an investigator in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology. By examining blood samples collected before the pandemic and comparing those with samples from people who had been sick with COVID-19, we were able to pinpoint antibody types that cross reacted with benign coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV-2,  says Andrabi, who works closely with the laboratory of professor Dennis Burton, PhD.In later tests, the antibody also neutralized SARS-CoV-1, the coronavirus that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. We were able to determine that this type of cross-reactive antibody is likely produced by a memory B cell that s initially exposed to a coronavirus that causes the common cold, and is then recalled during a COVID-19 infection,  Andrabi says.Memory B cells are an essential part of the immune system. They  remember  initial disease threats and can circulate in the bloodstream for decades, ready to be called back into action if the threat emerges again. These cells are responsible for producing targeted antibodies.The discovery may be an important step in the eventual development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, which would be able to protect against potential coronaviruses that emerge in the future, says Burton, the James and Jessie Minor Chair in Immunology in the Department of Immunology & Microbiology at Scripps Research. Another deadly coronavirus will likely emerge again in the future and when it does, we want to be better prepared,  Burton says.  Our identification of a cross-reactive antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and the more common coronaviruses is a promising development on the way to a broad-acting vaccine or therapy. Burton s lab is also investigating broadly neutralizing antibodies that can be harnessed to protect against many forms of influenza, which is another virus likely to cause a pandemic in the future.In the new study, the team used electron microscopy to understand how the cross-reactive antibody is able to neutralize a range of coronaviruses. They saw that it mostly binds to the base of the virus s spike protein, an area that doesn t change much from strain to strain, says first author Ge  Sophie  Song, a graduate student in the Burton laboratory. The study highlights how important it is to fully understand the nature of preexisting immunity, especially in regard to coronaviruses,  Song says.  Earlier exposure to a coronavirus, even a benign virus that causes colds, impacts the nature and level of antibodies produced when more serious coronavirus threats emerge.""Reference: Song G, He W, Callaghan S, et al.

Weaning patients from these drugs can result in unpleasant symptoms that can range from flu-like feelings and persistent pain or itch to Parkinson's-like conditions that can last for weeks.One in six Americans have, or will, suffer from depression; for veterans, the estimated rate is twice that.Previous research has demonstrated that antidepressant drugs collect gradually in cholesterol-rich membrane structures called lipid rafts. When a neurotransmitter (such as serotonin, which is involved with mood) binds to a receptor on the outside of a cell, a protein in the lipid raft --- called Gs alpha --- conveys the signal into the cell's interior where it can elicit a variety of actions. One of those actions is the production of an intracellular signaling molecule called cyclic AMP. In the brains of people with depression, cyclic AMP is low; but with effective antidepressant treatment, cyclic AMP is returned to normal.For their new study, Rasenick and Senese looked at the activity of Gs alpha molecules by using fluorescent light to determine how they moved in and out of the lipid rafts. They found that while withdrawal of some antidepressant drugs balances Gs alpha action in and out of the lipid rafts, other drugs suppress the return of Gs alpha to rafts. This suppression, the researchers believe, is what causes persistent and undesired effects of some antidepressants.Lipid rafts appear to be relevant for both the delayed therapeutic effects of antidepressants as well as the difficulty in weaning off from these drugs. It takes a long time for these drugs to sort into rafts and a long time for the drugs to exit --- some more than others. Curiously, rapid-acting antidepressants like ketamine have similar effects on Gs alpha and lipid rafts, but without the delay, Rasenick said.""This validates the notion that intracellular molecules that result from an active Gs alpha protein are a very good biomarker for the functioning of antidepressants,"" Rasenick said. ""We think we have achieved some clarity on this issue and we'd like to move forward toward using technology to create a personalized treatment for depression.""Rasenick explained that by looking at how an individual patient's cells metabolize Gs alpha proteins, they can better predict what antidepressant medication could work for them. This can be accomplished in days and not weeks and months of trial and error to find the right medication. A company using this UIC-developed technology, Pax Neuroscience, has been formed to develop the technology for the market.Additionally, the cellular fluorescent indicators allow testing at a cellular level to develop new antidepressant medications.Reference: Senese NB, Rasenick MM.

Through laboratory experiments, the NTU Singapore team found that human bone-forming cells seeded onto the biomaterial scaffold successfully attached themselves and started multiplying - a sign of growth. They also found that the risk of the biomaterial triggering an inflammatory response is low. Such a scaffold could be used to help with the regeneration of bone tissue lost to disease or injury, such as jaw defects from trauma or cancer surgery. It could also assist bone growth around surgical implants such as dental implants. The scientists believe the biomaterial is a promising alternative to the current standard practice of using a patient's own tissues, which requires additional surgery for bone extraction. At the same time, the production of this biomaterial tackles the problem of aquaculture waste, said Assistant Professor Dalton Tay of the NTU School of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), who led the multidisciplinary study. More than 20 million tonnes of fishery by-products, such as fins, scales, and skins, are discarded every year. In Singapore, the combined annual consumption of frog flesh and fish is estimated to be around 100 million kilograms, making bullfrog skin and fish scales two of Singapore's largest aquaculture waste side streams. Asst Prof Dalton Tay said: ""We took the 'waste-to-resource' approach in our study and turned discards into a high-value material with biomedical applications, closing the waste loop in the process. Our lab studies showed that the biomaterial we have engineered could be a promising option that helps with bone repair. The potential for this biomaterial is very broad, ranging from repairing bone defects due to injury or ageing, to dental applications for aesthetics. Our research builds on NTU's body of work in the area of sustainability and is in line with Singapore's circular economy approach towards a zero-waste nation."" Professor Matthew Hu Xiao, the study's co-author and Director of the Environmental Chemistry and Materials Centre, Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute (NEWRI), added: ""These waste streams can also be converted into green chemicals and materials for environmental remediation and timely treatment can reduce wastewater contamination."" Clinical Associate Professor Goh Bee Tin, Director for Research at the National Dental Centre Singapore, who was not involved in the study, said: ""The National Dental Centre Singapore is excited about the use of bullfrog skin as a natural biomaterial for tissue regeneration. We see many potential dental applications ranging from the regeneration of gum tissues in periodontal disease, to bone for placement of dental implants, to jawbone following tumour surgery. Obviating the need for additional bone harvesting surgery also translates to time and cost savings, and less pain for patients."" The research findings were published online in Materials Science and Engineering C in April and will be published in Volume 126 of the journal in July. The research team has filed patents for the biomaterial's wound healing and bone tissue engineering applications. The team is now further evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of the biomaterial as dental products under a grant from the China-Singapore International Joint Research Institute and aims to bring the waste-to-resource technological pipeline closer to commercialisation.With the combined annual consumption of frog flesh and fish in Singapore estimated to be around 100 million kilograms, bullfrog skin and fish scales are two of Singapore's largest aquaculture waste side streams. The fishery waste used by the NTU team was collected from Khai Seng Fish Farm and Jurong Frog Farm. To make the biomaterial, the team first extracted Type 1 tropocollagen (many molecules of which form collagen fibres) from the discarded skins of the American bullfrog, locally farmed and imported into Singapore in large numbers for consumption; and hydroxyapatite (a calcium-phosphate compound) from the scales of snakehead fish, commonly known as the Toman fish. Collagen and hydroxyapatite (HA) are two predominant components found in bones, thus conferring on the biomaterial a structure, composition, and ability to promote cell attachment that are like the bone. These two components also make the biomaterial tough. The scientists removed all impurities from the bullfrog skin, then blended it to form a thick collagenous paste that is diluted with water. Collagen was then extracted from this mix. ""Using this approach, we were able to obtain the highest ever reported yield of collagen of approximately 70 per cent from frog skin, thus making this approach commercially viable,"" said Asst Prof Tay, who is also from the NTU School of Biological Sciences (SBS). HA was harvested from discarded fish scales through calcination - a purification process that requires high heat - to remove the organic matter, and then air-dried. The biomaterial was synthesised by adding HA powder to the extracted collagen, then cast into a mould to produce a 3D porous scaffold. This entire process took less than two weeks and the team believes it can be both further shortened and scaled-up. To assess the biological performance of the porous biomaterial scaffold for bone repair, the scientists seeded bone-forming cells onto the scaffold. In their laboratory experiments, they found that the number of cells increased significantly. After a week, the cells were uniformly distributed across the scaffold - an indicator that the scaffold could promote proper cellular activities and eventually lead to the formation of tissues. The scientists also found that the presence of HA in the biomaterial significantly enhanced bone formation. The biomaterial was also tested for its tendency to cause an inflammatory response, which is common after a biomaterial is implanted in the body. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the scientists found that the expression level of pro-inflammatory genes in human immune cells exposed to the biomaterial remained ""relatively modest"" when compared to a control exposed to endotoxins, a compound known to stimulate immune response, said Asst Prof Tay. For instance, the expression of the gene IL6 in the biomaterial group was negligible and at least 50 times lower than that of the endotoxins-exposed immune cells. This suggests that the risk of the NTU-developed biomaterial to trigger an excessive acute inflammatory response is low. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of the biomaterial scaffold, synthesised from discarded bullfrog skin and fish scales, as a promising waste-to-resource bone graft substitute material for bone repair and regeneration. Ms Chelsea Wan, Director, Jurong Frog Farm said: ""The aquaculture industry is an important avenue to meet the global growing demand for safe and quality seafood, but a big challenge we face is the huge wastage and downcycling of valuable aquatic resources. In Singapore, the combined annual consumption of frog flesh and fish is estimated to be around 100 million kilograms, making bullfrog skin and fish scales two of the largest aquaculture waste side streams here. The integration of multiple seafood waste streams into a single high value product is a leading example of sustainable innovation for the aquaculture industry."" Going forward, the research team hopes to work with clinical and industrial partners on animal studies to find out how tissues in the body would respond to this biomaterial in the long term, and the material's ability to repair bone defects and dermal wounds, as well as to bring the entire waste-to-resource technological pipeline closer to commercialisation.

Their brain activity was measured with EEG and their sleep-wake activity was measured before and after the experiment. Each participant was given cognitive tests--designed to measure reaction speed, memory, and other functions--before receiving anesthesia, right after the return of consciousness, and then every 30 minutes thereafter.The study team sought to answer several fundamental questions: Just how does the brain wake up after profound unconsciousness--all at once or do some areas and functions come back online first? If so, which?""How the brain recovers from states of unconsciousness is important clinically but also gives us insight into the neural basis of consciousness itself,"" says Mashour.After the anesthetic was discontinued and participants regained consciousness, cognitive testing began. A second control group of study participants, who did not receive general anesthesia and stayed awake, also completed tests over the same time period.Analyzing EEG and test performance, the researchers found that recovery of consciousness and cognition is a process that unfolds over time, not all at once. To the investigators' surprise, one of the brain functions that came online first was abstract problem solving, controlled by the prefrontal cortex, whereas other functions such as reaction time and attention took longer to recover.""Although initially surprising, it makes sense in evolutionary terms that higher cognition needs to recover early. If, for example, someone was waking up to a threat, structures like the prefrontal cortex would be important for categorizing the situation and generating an action plan,"" says Kelz.The EEG readings revealed that the frontal regions of the brain were especially active around the time of recovery. Importantly, within three hours of being deeply anesthetized for a prolonged period of time, participants were able to recover cognitive function to approximately the same level as the group that stayed awake during that time. Furthermore, their sleep schedule in the days after the experiment did not appear to be affected.""This suggests that the healthy human brain is resilient, even with a prolonged exposure to deep anesthesia. Clinically, this implies that some of the disorders of cognition that we often see for days or even weeks during recovery from anesthesia and surgery--such as delirium--might be attributable to factors other than lingering effects of anesthetic drugs on the brain,"" says Avidan.Reference: Mashour GA, Palanca BJ, Basner M, et al.

At the same time, the results show that the disease is underdiagnosed as the annually reported figures are considerably lower than those discovered in the study. The primary cause of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is the Bordetella pertussis agent which spreads through the respiratory mucosa and produces toxins that damage the mucous membrane. These toxins incapacitate the body s defence mechanisms and the infection is marked by severe, spasmodic coughing episodes. Pertussis is often categorised as a childhood disease, but adults can also contract it. Before the vaccination programmes, whooping cough was one of the deadliest childhood diseases. In Finland, the vaccinations started in 1952, and the pertussis vaccination is included in the national DTP vaccination programme. Even though the vaccination programmes are effective in Europe, the number of pertussis cases has increased in several countries. 200 500 whooping cough cases are reported in Finland each year, while globally there were over 150,000 reported cases in 2018. The University of Turku in Finland leads an extensive European follow-up study on pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus. The study is part of the EUPert-LabNet laboratory network funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The EUPert-LabNet network is led by the Head of Finnish National Reference Laboratory for Pertussis and Diphtheria, Professor Qiushui He from the University of Turku. 18 European countries have participated in the study.   To our best knowledge, this is the largest follow-up study in Europe since the DTP vaccines were introduced. On the basis of the results, whooping cough seems to be more common in Europe than previously thought. The disease was most common in Norway, France and Denmark, and most uncommon in Finland and Hungary, says Professor He and continues:   A very alarming finding in our research was the low levels of antibodies against diphtheria in many European countries. This clearly indicates that the herd immunity in middle-aged adults is decreasing. Attention should be paid to this matter in the entire Europe.   On the other hand, antibodies against tetanus are on a sufficient level in different European countries, says He.ReferenceBerbers G, van Gageldonk P, Kassteele J van de, et al.

The investigators analyzed the samples using a genomic sequencing technique called shotgun sequencing to detect the presence of various microbes, including bacteria, archaea (single-celled organisms that are distinct from bacteria), and viruses that use DNA as their genetic material. (Other types of viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, would not have been detected with the DNA analysis methods used in this pre-pandemic study.) This field of research has important implications for detecting outbreaks of both known and unknown infections and for studying the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microbes in different urban environments. ""Every time you sit down in the subway, you are likely commuting with an entirely new species,"" said senior author Dr. Christopher Mason, co-director of the WorldQuant Initiative for Quantitative Prediction and a professor of physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine. Dr. Mason is also co-founder and a paid consultant of Biotia and Onegevity Health, and a paid speaker for WorldQuant LLC. The current study led to the discovery of 10,928 viruses and 748 bacteria that are not present in any reference databases. Dr. Mason founded MetaSUB (short for Metagenomics and Metadesign of Subways and Urban Biomes) in 2015, along with Dr. Evan Afshin, who was then an undergraduate student at Macaulay Honors College at Queens College and is now a clinical fellow in physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine and a paid consultant for Onegevity Health. The newly released study was led by Drs. Mason, David Danko, a Weill Cornell Graduate School doctoral student in Dr. Mason's lab during the study, and Daniela Bezdan, who was a research associate in computational biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine at that time. By collecting samples of microbes and analyzing their genes--collectively known as the microbiome--the researchers hope to learn more about the bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms that live among humans. For example, the research may help to identify the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Predicting antibiotic resistance from genetic sequences alone is challenging, but the researchers were able to map some genes known to be linked to resistance, quantify their abundance and confirm the genetic markers' ability to confer resistance. They found that some cities had more resistance genes than others, and that there might be city-specific signatures for some of these genes. Antimicrobial resistance remains a major global health challenge. ""While further research is needed, this dataset demonstrates the value and potential for microbiome mapping and monitoring, and the insights it can provide physicians, scientists and public health officials,"" Dr. Afshin said. Moreover, learning about the small molecules and proteins made by microbes could also lead to the discovery of new antibiotics as well as other molecules that have the potential to be developed as drugs. Many antibiotics and drugs that are currently in use have been derived from microbial sources. Discoveries made about new microbial species could also lead to new laboratory tools and approaches, such as novel ways to use the molecular editing tool known as CRISPR. In this study, the researchers found 838,532 novel CRISPR arrays--snippets of viral DNA found inside bacteria--and 4.3 million new peptides (small proteins). Due to these sampling efforts, Dr. Mason said that he can predict with about 90 percent accuracy where a person lives, just by sequencing the DNA on their shoes. Many factors were found to influence a city's microbiome, including overall population and population density, elevation, proximity to the ocean and climate. The findings about these distinct signatures could enable future forensic studies. ""A microbiome contains molecular echoes of the place where it was collected. A coastal sample may contain salt-loving microbes while a sample from a densely populated city may show striking biodiversity,"" Dr. Danko said. Drs. Mason and Afshin began collecting and analyzing microbial samples in the New York City subway system in 2013. After they published their first findings, dubbed PathoMap, they were contacted by researchers from around the world who wanted to do similar studies for their own cities. The international interest inspired Dr. Mason's lab to create MetaSUB and recruited Daniela Bezdan as the research director. ""We needed internationally accepted protocols, logistics and collaboration agreements with scientists, vendors, government offices and philanthropic foundations for potentially 100 cities in 20 countries,"" Bezdan said. Today MetaSUB continues to grow and has expanded to collecting RNA and DNA samples from air, water and sewage, in addition to hard surfaces. This has led to a $5 million grant on wastewater sequencing and viral tracking across three states (Florida, New York and Wisconsin), and which is part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's new National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS). The group also oversees projects such as Global City Sampling Day (gCSD), held every year on June 21, and has done wide-ranging studies including a comprehensive microbial analysis of Rio de Janeiro before, during and after the 2016 Summer Olympics. Many of the samples analyzed in the current study were collected on Global City Sampling Day in 2016 and 2017. The New York City sampling effort was conducted with support from the Weill Cornell Medicine Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC), in collaboration with senior CTSC program manager Jeff Zhu. Dr. Mason and his colleagues are currently preparing for this year's event. ""When we started in 2015, the consortium consisted of 16 cities; six years later we have more than 100 cities. It's great to have this group of curious, self-starting and enthusiastic co-investigators,"" said Dr. Mason, who is also professor of computational genomics in computational biomedicine in the HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. ""Although samples are collected all over the world, much of the analysis is done right here in New York City at Weill Cornell Medicine,"" said Dr. Mason. The analysis and assemblage of sequences also leveraged Bridges and Bridges-2, Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) supercomputers at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. MetaSUB researchers in Switzerland (Drs. Andre Kahles and Gunnar R tsch) used these assemblies and raw data to build a searchable, global DNA sequence portal (MetaGraph) that indexed all known genetic sequences (including MetaSUB data). The portal maps any known or newly discovered genetic elements to their location on Earth and can aid in the discovery of new microbial interactions and putative functions. DNA isolation from samples were largely performed with support from Zymo Research and Promega, and sequenced in collaboration with Dr. Shawn Levy at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, Dr. Klas Udekwu from Stockholm University and the New York Genome Center. Future and ongoing studies will look at RNA and DNA with long reads and spatial-imaging methods, as well as trace the metabolites from the global sites, and continue to update the planetary-scale genetic map.ReferenceDanko D, Bezdan D, Afshin EE, et al.

They found that while soil lead levels have generally decreased since the 1970s, they have decreased much less near residential foundations than along streets. The researchers collected soil samples near foundations of houses built before 1978. Samples within a meter of the older homes averaged 649 milligrams (mg) of lead per kilogram (kg) of soil, more than three times the average level detected near streets, which was 150 mg/kg. EPA guidelines say exposure to soil lead concentrations above 400 mg/kg is associated with potential long-term health risks to children, including possible damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, learning and behavior problems and hearing and speech problems. ""Urban soil processes are driving lead concentrations down over time, but it's alarming that lead levels in some locations -- typically older, poorer neighborhoods -- still far exceed safe levels decades after leaded gasoline and lead paint were phased out,"" said lead author Anna Wade, a postdoctoral researcher at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a 2020 Ph.D. graduate of Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment. The Duke team shared its findings with Durham public health groups and plans to conduct similar mapping studies in five or six other cities nationwide. Determining where contamination risks persist, and why contamination is decreasing at different rates in different locations, is essential for mitigating those risks, she said. However, many cities lack the resources to conduct the regular city-wide sampling needed to obtain that data. ""Our study had to go all the way back to the 1970s to find comparable data for portions of the 35-square-kilometer area we sampled,"" Wade said. Daniel D. Richter, professor of soils at Duke, said, ""There's been a lot of interest in mitigating lead exposure in cities, but most is focused on reducing risks within the home. Our study reminds us about the outdoor environment where exposure risks also exist."" Wade, Richter and their team published their peer-reviewed, open-access study May 21 in Environmental Science & Technology. Curbside soil lead levels have dropped over time as the result of human and natural causes, the study suggests. Those causes include accelerated erosion and stormwater runoff, which has carried away some contaminated surface soils, depositing them in nearby floodplains. Digging for road construction and repair also contributed to the drop by mixing and burying some contaminated soil deeper underground. Foundation soils are less affected by these processes. Also, soils near many older homes continue to receive chips and dust from old leaded paint. Soil lead levels are thus decreasing more slowly near older homes, and those soils continue to pose a higher risk. Traffic density also factors into the risk equation. In larger cities that see more traffic, such as New York or Chicago, soil lead levels along heavily travelled streets have historically been high. In larger cities, those levels may still be unacceptably high, Wade said. Implementing regular, widespread soil testing is the only way to know for certain. ""Large-scale sampling reveals patterns of soil lead distribution that you miss through spot checking,"" Richter said. ""That can make the problem more predictable and remediable and encourage cities to act on this issue rather than just letting it be.""ReferenceWade A M et al.

According to a recent study published in the journal Chemosphere, the combined presence of nanoplastics and arsenic affects the biological functions of oysters. This study was conducted by the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) in Qu bec City and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) at the University of Bordeaux in France.The international research team chose to study arsenic, since it is one of the most common metals absorbed by the plastic debris collected from the beaches of Guadeloupe. ""Oysters easily accumulate metals from the environment into their tissues. We therefore wanted to test whether the combined exposure to nanoplastics and arsenic would increase the bioaccumulation of this contaminant,"" reported Marc Lebordais, the Master's student in charge of the research. The scientists proved that the bioaccumulation of arsenic does not increase when nanoplastics are also present. However, it remained higher in the gills of the Canadian Crassostrea virginica oyster than in the Isognomon alatus oyster, found in Guadeloupe. These results are the first to highlight the diverging sensitivity of different species.In addition to bioaccumulation, the team also observed an overexpression of genes responsible for cell death and the number of mitochondria--a cell's energy centres--in C. virginica. In I. alatus, the expression of these same genes was less significant. ""Evaluating the expression of genes involved in important functions, such as cell death and detoxification, gives us information on the toxicity of nanoplastics and arsenic on a cellular level,"" explained the young researcher, who is co-directed by Professors Val rie Langlois of INRS and Magalie Baudrimont of the University of Bordeaux.The next step, after characterizing the presence of nanoplastics and arsenic in oysters, would be to study how these contaminants are transferred through the food chain.

Offering some relief, however, Gavi Vaccine Alliance has signed an advanced purchase agreement (APA) with Moderna to secure 500 million doses of the biotechnology company's mRNA vaccine   mRNA-1273   against COVID-19. This is being done in an effort to help the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). We are very pleased to sign this new agreement with Moderna, giving COVAX Facility participants access to yet another highly efficacious vaccine. Expanding and having a diverse portfolio has always been a core goal for COVAX, and to remain adaptable in the face of this continually evolving pandemic   including the rising threat posed by new variants. This agreement is a further step in that direction,  stated Gavi CEO, Seth Berkley, in an official press release. Earlier in April, Moderna s vaccine against COVID-19 was approved by the WHO for emergency use, making it the fifth vaccine to be given this accreditation. This, in turn, makes the mRNA-1273 vaccine eligible to be given to COVAX facilities. It is important to remember that the company s mRNA vaccine is one that is given in two doses, 28 days apart. Evidence from clinical trials showed that the vaccine efficacy was 94.1% in protecting against severe COVID-19. The other vaccines which have been approved by the WHO for emergency use are those made by Pfizer, Astrazeneca-SK Bio, Serum Institute of India and Johnson & Johnson.COVAX was launched in April 2021 by the World Health Organization, the European Commission and France as one of the  pillars of access to COVID-19 Tools  (ACT). COVAX focuses on bridging inequalities in accessing vaccines. Gavi, CEPI and the WHO coordinate on matters of vaccine related research, development and manufacturing for COVAX. The initial goal of the platform was to produce 2 billion doses of vaccines against COVID-19 by the end of 2021 to protect high risk and vulnerable individuals, including frontline healthcare workers. COVAX is also a lifeline for low-income countries who would otherwise not be able to easily access COVID-19 vaccines and also for countries who do not have bilateral deals with manufacturers of the vaccine.Earlier in April, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had criticized vaccine inequality, noting the unfair distribution of vaccines around the world. ""On average in high-income countries, almost one in four people have received a COVID-19 vaccine. In low-income countries, it is one in more than 500,"" he said during a press conference. At the time, he also cited the threat of ""vaccine nationalism"" and stated that there needed to be widespread focus on vaccinating a few individuals in some countries rather than all the people in some countries.It is estimated that 34 million doses of the vaccine will be ready by the fourth quarter of 2021 and another 466 million doses will be made available in 2022. CEPI s early investment in Moderna s vaccine development program helped to get the project off the ground, so I m proud that the vaccine will be made available to protect people in countries around the world through COVAX,  said CEPI CEO Dr Richard Hatchett.  This highly effective vaccine is already saving lives, and will play a vital role in the global control of COVID-19,  he added.Now that the APA has been signed between Gavi and Moderna, a long-term agreement will soon be signed between UNICEF and Moderna to ensure that the logistics of the agreement are worked out and the doses of the vaccine are delivered to participating Gavi COVAX centers.However, concerns continue to remain with the Serum Institute of India (SII) unable to supply vaccines to COVAX due to the ongoing surge of COVID-19 cases in the country. The Pune-based institute is the  largest single supplier  of vaccines to COVAX. ","Published: May 27, 2021"

However, the PCR portion of the test requires bulky, expensive machines and takes about an hour to complete, making it difficult to quickly diagnose someone at a testing site. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Nano have developed a plasmofluidic chip that can perform PCR in only about 8 minutes, which could speed diagnosis during current and future pandemics.Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and other highly contagious viral diseases is important for timely medical care, quarantining and contact tracing. Currently, RT-PCR -- which uses enzymes to reverse transcribe tiny amounts of viral RNA to DNA, and then amplify the DNA so that it can be detected by a fluorescent probe -- is the most sensitive and reliable diagnostic method. But because the PCR portion of the test requires 30-40 cycles of heating and cooling in special machines, it takes about an hour to perform, and samples must typically be sent away to a lab, meaning that a patient usually has to wait a day or two to receive their diagnosis. Ki-Hun Jeong and colleagues wanted to develop a plasmofluidic PCR chip that could quickly heat and cool miniscule volumes of liquids, allowing accurate point-of-care diagnosis in a fraction of the time.The researchers devised a postage stamp-sized polydimethylsiloxane chip with a microchamber array for the PCR reactions. When a drop of sample is added to the chip, a vacuum pulls the liquid into the microchambers, which are positioned above glass nanopillars with gold nanoislands. Any microbubbles, which could interfere with the PCR reaction, diffuse out through an air-permeable wall. When a white LED is turned on beneath the chip, the gold nanoislands on the nanopillars quickly convert light to heat, and then rapidly cool when the light is switched off. The researchers tested the device on a piece of DNA containing a SARS-CoV-2 gene, accomplishing 40 heating and cooling cycles and fluorescence detection in only 5 minutes, with an additional 3 minutes for sample loading. The amplification efficiency was 91%, whereas a comparable conventional PCR process has an efficiency of 98%.

A number of different proteins in mitochondria facilitate these processes, but it s not fully understood how these proteins are arranged inside mitochondria and the factors that can influence their arrangement.Now, scientists at the University of Copenhagen have used state-of-the-art proteomics technology to shine new light on how mitochondrial proteins gather into electron transport chain complexes, and further into so-called supercomplexes. The research, which is published in Cell Reports, also examined how this process is influenced by exercise training. This study has allowed for a comprehensive quantification of electron transport chain proteins within supercomplexes and how they respond to exercise training. These data have implications for how exercise improves the efficiency of energy production in muscle,  says Associate Professor Atul S. Deshmukh from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR) at the University of Copenhagen.","Published: May 27, 2021"

Relying on caffeine to get you through the day isn't always the answer, says a new study from Michigan State University.Researchers from MSU's Sleep and Learning Lab, led by psychology associate professor Kimberly Fenn, assessed how effective caffeine was in counteracting the negative effects of sleep deprivation on cognition. As it turns out, caffeine can only get you so far.The study -- published in the most recent edition of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, & Cognition -- assessed the impact of caffeine after a night of sleep deprivation. More than 275 participants were asked to complete a simple attention task as well as a more challenging ""placekeeping"" task that required completion of tasks in a specific order without skipping or repeating steps.Fenn's study is the first to investigate the effect of caffeine on placekeeping after a period of sleep deprivation.""We found that sleep deprivation impaired performance on both types of tasks and that having caffeine helped people successfully achieve the easier task. However, it had little effect on performance on the placekeeping task for most participants,"" Fenn said.She added: ""Caffeine may improve the ability to stay awake and attend to a task, but it doesn't do much to prevent the sort of procedural errors that can cause things like medical mistakes and car accidents.""Insufficient sleep is pervasive in the United States, a problem that has intensified during the pandemic, Fenn said. Consistently lacking adequate sleep not only affects cognition and alters mood, but can eventually take a toll on immunity.""Caffeine increases energy, reduces sleepiness and can even improve mood, but it absolutely does not replace a full night of sleep, Fenn said. ""Although people may feel as if they can combat sleep deprivation with caffeine, their performance on higher-level tasks will likely still be impaired. This is one of the reasons why sleep deprivation can be so dangerous.""Fenn said that the study has the potential to inform both theory and practice.""If we had found that caffeine significantly reduced procedural errors under conditions of sleep deprivation, this would have broad implications for individuals who must perform high stakes procedures with insufficient sleep, like surgeons, pilots and police officers,"" Fenn said.

The study updates a vaccine safety review that was released by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2014. This in-depth analysis found no evidence of increased risk of serious adverse events following vaccines, apart from a few previously known associations,  said Susanne Hempel, director of the Southern California Evidence Review Center.The meta-analysis, published in the journal Vaccine, does not address the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, but summarizes the results of 338 studies of other vaccines commonly given across the lifespan. These findings support decisions to vaccinate to protect ourselves and our communities from a variety of diseases,  said Dr. Courtney Gidengil, the study's lead author and a senior physician policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization.  This research is an important reminder that vaccines are safe and any risk they may pose is far outweighed by their ability to protect against diseases. The study included reviews of vaccines for diseases such as influenza, measles, mumps, shingles, whooping cough, tetanus, and human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cancers. While vaccination rates for children remain high, rates for adults and pregnant women consistently lag.With funding from AHRQ, researchers conducted a systematic review of relevant vaccine safety research for key adverse events, which are events of special interest that were selected with the help of vaccine experts.Among the findings about individual vaccines, researchers found that the strength of evidence was high for no increased risk of autism among children following the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The strength of evidence was high that MMR is associated with an increased but still low risk of febrile seizures, an adverse event that seldom has long-term consequences.For older children and adolescents, there was no evidence of increased risk for key adverse events for newer vaccines such as 9-valent HPV vaccine, which prevents infections that lead to cervical and other types of cancers, and serogroup B meningococcal vaccines, which prevent a type of bacterial meningitis, though there was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions for some key adverse events that are rare.For adults, there was no evidence of increased risk for key adverse events for the new recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine which prevents shingles, the hepatitis B vaccine with novel immunostimulatory adjuvant, and newer influenza vaccines such as the adjuvanted influenza vaccine recommended for older adults.The study found no evidence of increased risk for key adverse events among pregnant women following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), including stillbirth.Researchers say that studying adverse events associated with vaccines can be difficult because the events are rare and can be caused by other factors. Therefore, it is important to continue to conduct ongoing population-based vaccine safety studies and post-marketing surveillance of vaccine safety after vaccines are licensed by the FDA to identify rare and serious adverse events.Future vaccine safety research needs to take into account the expanding landscape of new vaccines and vaccine technologies, in particular the new COVID-19 vaccines, according to the researchers.In addition to the journal article, AHRQ has made available findings from the systematic review, Safety of Vaccines Used for Routine Immunization in the United States: An Update, on the AHRQ website.Reference: Gidengil C, Goetz MB, Newberry S, et al.

The study, published in Cell Host & Microbe, was conducted by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) scientists at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana.Salmonella Typhimurium bacteria (hereafter Salmonella) live in the gut and often cause gastroenteritis in people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates Salmonella bacteria cause about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths in the United States every year. Contaminated food is the source for most of these illnesses. Most people who get ill from Salmonella have diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps but recover without specific treatment. Antibiotics typically are used only to treat people who have severe illness or who are at risk for it.Salmonella bacteria also can infect a wide variety of animals, including cattle, pigs and chickens. Although clinical disease usually resolves within a few days, the bacteria can persist in the GI tract for much longer. Fecal shedding of the bacteria facilitates transmission to new hosts, especially by so-called  super shedders  that release high numbers of bacteria in their feces.NIAID scientists are studying how Salmonella bacteria establish and maintain a foothold in the GI tract of mammals. One of the first lines of defense in the GI tract is the physical barrier provided by a single layer of intestinal epithelial cells. These specialized cells absorb nutrients and are a critical barrier that prevents pathogens from spreading to deeper tissues. When bacteria invade these cells, the cells are ejected into the gut lumen the hollow portion of the intestines. However, in previous studies, NIAID scientists had observed that some Salmonella replicate rapidly in the cytosol the fluid portion of intestinal epithelial cells. That prompted them to ask: does ejecting the infected cell amplify rather than eliminate the bacteria?To address this question, the scientists genetically engineered Salmonella bacteria that self-destruct when exposed to the cytosol of epithelial cells but grow normally in other environments, including the lumen of the intestine. Then they infected laboratory mice with the self-destructing Salmonella bacteria and found that replication in the cytosol of mouse intestinal epithelial cells is important for colonization of the GI tract and fuels fecal shedding. The scientists hypothesize that, by hijacking the epithelial cell response, Salmonella amplify their ability to invade neighboring cells and seed the intestine for fecal shedding.The researchers say this is an example of how the pressure exerted by the host immune response can drive the evolution of a pathogen, and vice versa. The new insights offer new avenues for developing novel interventions to reduce the burden of this important pathogen.Reference: Chong A, Cooper KG, Kari L, et al.

It has the potential to play an important role in the creation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The market for these therapeutic antibodies is worth over  70 bn.Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein derived from natural antibodies and then refined and mass produced in the lab. They are steadily transforming the way we treat and prevent diseases, from cancer and conditions affecting the immune system to viral infections. The coronavirus pandemic has triggered particular interest in mAbs, as a number of protein candidates are showing great promise as therapies to treat Covid-19, and are currently being trialled in humans.Stability is keyOnly mAbs that are known to be stable (that is, they neither break down easily nor clump together to form toxic compounds) are suitable for development, and finding a stable candidate adds massively to the cost and time of finding new drugs.Until now, the process of determining protein stability has been a big headache for drug companies, with researchers testing vast libraries of molecules in their search for proteins with medicinal properties. However, the tool developed in Bath   called Quantitative Understanding of Bio-molecular Edge-Shift (QUBES)   is able predict the stability of proteins with startling speed and accuracy.Dr Chris Pudney from the University s Department of Biology & Biochemistry and developer of QUBES, said:  We re really excited by the potential of QUBES because it can be used immediately in the biopharmaceutical industry in quality assurance, formulation and development. He added:  Proteins are notoriously unstable for a good reason   the body wants to recycle them constantly. But with a therapeutic product, you need stability   if a protein breaks down and aggregates, it becomes toxic. Finding stable proteins is hugely expensive for pharmaceutical companies, but using our tool to find the best molecule possible will cut down on the time and cost of development massively. QUBES fingerprintingQUBES works by allowing researchers to accurately  fingerprint  a protein s structure and predict stability under nearly any condition of concentration or formulation. The technique uses fluorescence to map protein structure and then applies a mathematical algorithm, based on the position and type of the protein s atoms, to calculate stability. Thanks to an online suite of software   also developed in Bath   laboratories can interpret their fluorescent data from anywhere in the world, using equipment found in most biochemistry labs without modifications.Elaborating on the fingerprinting technique, Dr Pudney said:  Proteins contains tryptophan   an amino acid that emits fluorescent light. Every protein molecule has a unique fluorescent signature, and QUBES leverages this optical phenomenon, applying mathematical techniques to analyse and interpret the fluorescence. The software suite takes this academic work and makes it incredibly easy for people to use. You can run it on any machine   even on your mobile phone. It s ultra-rapid and ultra-easy, and it offers an incredibly high level of security   in fact, we have a grade of security that s normally reserved for the financial service industry. What sets QUBES apart from its competitors is the quality of its readings and its extreme flexibility. Dr Pudney explains:  Not only is our approach faster, more accurate and more sensitive than anything else on the market, but it can also predict stability at any concentration and in any formulation   unlike other tools on the market, which require set conditions. Dr Pudney s team have recently conducted a validation study of the QUBES technology with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) under the government backed  Measurement for Recovery Scheme  scheme, which provides independent validation of technology by the country s leading analytical facility.Dr Alex Jones, who led the study at NPL, said:  We tested the QUBES approach using a range of analytical methodologies and found that it tracks subtle changes in protein structure and stability with remarkable sensitivity when compared to established methodologies. The approach is fast and simple to implement. Reference: Knight MJ, Woolley RE, Kwok A, et al.

Scientists have conducted extensive research on so-called ""professional"" immune cells that are defensive specialists. Much less is known about how ""non-professional"" cells handle such threats.Tecle, Troemel and their colleagues at Pennsylvania State University focused their research on roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), animals that lack dedicated immune cells, to help decipher details of such dynamics.As described in the journal PLOS Pathogens, the researchers conducted experiments involving roundworms under attack by viruses and microsporidia, which are natural pathogens of worms and humans. The results indicate that roundworms may sense changes in their metabolism in order to unleash protective defenses, even if they don't directly sense the pathogen incursion.In their study, the researchers examined how hosts may respond when pathogens such as viruses and microsporidia steal key compounds from C. elegans cells known as nucleotides. Pathogens like these are required to pilfer such components from their hosts in order to survive. The study's results focused on biological pathways related to the breakdown of chemical compounds known as purine nucleotides. This purine metabolism pathway is key to the cells' ability to sense alterations as a way to induce an immune response.""We hypothesize that the host has ways to surveil what's going on inside of its cells in an active process,"" said Tecle. ""Our results suggest that the host has developed ways to sense the theft of purine metabolites. It seems that when these key cellular building blocks are stolen by the pathogen, the host senses this theft to mount an immune response to the pathogen.""This research may shed light on why purine-related compound mutations have been found to underlie many human diseases, including adenosine deaminase deficiency, which damages the immune system, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which involves neurological and behavioral abnormalities. While these mutations result in various disorders in humans, they may persist in the human population to provide some protection against infections, for example during viral pandemics.""Particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's so important that we continue to study these questions of immunity in lots of different systems to build new tools so that we can learn how to prevent and treat infections,"" said Troemel.Reference: Tecle E, Chhan CB, Franklin L, et al.

However, the amount of microplastic pollution swept away by this runoff is currently unknown. Now, researchers in ACS ES&T Water report that stormwater can be a large source of microplastics and rubber fragments to water bodies and, with a proof-of-concept experiment, show that a rain garden could keep these microscopic pieces out of a storm drain.Most cities' storm drains end up discharging directly into wetlands, creeks or rivers. Rainwater running into these drains becomes a concoction of whatever is on the ground, including dirt and grass clippings, leaked car fluids, fertilizer and garbage. Recently, researchers also found that strong rains can displace microplastics, sweeping them into stormwater, but the importance of this runoff as a source of contamination is not well understood. So, Chelsea Rochman and colleagues wanted to see whether microplastics and other tiny particles are carried into waterways by storms in urban areas, and whether a rain garden could prevent that from happening. The researchers collected water during heavy rainstorms from 12 streams flowing into the San Francisco Bay. First, they separated floating microparticles -- which they define as less than 5 mm in size -- by color and shape and tallied them, finding higher concentrations in the streams than previous researchers had found in treated wastewater that was discharged into the bay. Microscopic fibers and black rubbery fragments were the most common microparticles, while natural debris, glass, paint and wool were only minor components. Then, the team identified a subset of plastic- or rubbery-looking fragments as being made mostly of plastic polymers or other synthetic materials, and many of the black rubbery particles originated from tires. Finally, the researchers compared the microparticles entering a rain garden to those at the garden's outflow into a storm drain. Their results showed that the rain garden captured 91 to 98% of the microparticles and 100% of the black rubbery fragments during three rain events. The researchers say that while rain gardens are known to reduce the amount of metals, nutrients and other pollutants in stormwater runoff, this study shows rain gardens could also be effective at reducing microplastic pollution.ReferenceWerbowski LM, Gilbreath AN, Munno K, et al.

But different arrangements of the fats in chocolate can influence its taste and texture. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Crystal Growth & Design have found that the side of a chocolate bar facing the mold has a more orderly crystalline structure than the side facing air, knowledge that might help chocolatiers produce tastier confections, the researchers say.Chocolate is a mixture of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar and other ingredients that interact with each other in complex ways. In particular, the fat molecules, or triacylglycerols, can remain liquid or crystallize into several phases with different melting points. The temperature at which a particular chocolate melts affects its taste and texture, with a melting point near body temperature being ideal. When chocolatiers make bars, they pour tempered chocolate into a mold and let it cool at temperatures that favor the most desirable crystal form. Fumitoshi Kaneko and colleagues wondered how the mold, which conveys heat more efficiently than air and also provides a physical barrier, affects fat crystallization. To find out, the researchers analyzed the structure of fat components at three different positions in a chocolate bar using polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection sampling. They found that the mold-side face of the bar contained highly ordered, regularly packed fatty acid chains, whereas the air-side face had disordered, irregularly packed chains, and the midpoint showed intermediate characteristics. The mold side also contained more of the most desirable fat crystal form than the other locations. These results could be explained by the large difference in thermal conductivity between the mold s material and air, which causes the chocolate to preferentially cool and crystallize on the mold-side face. The mold also provides a barrier that controls the direction of crystallization, yielding a more orderly arrangement. These results suggest that a chocolate bar s structure is much less uniform than previously thought, and that improving the crystallization process might lead to better-tasting, melt-in-your-mouth and better-looking chocolate bars, the researchers say.ReferenceKaneko F, Oonishi K, Uehara H, Hondoh H.

MCAD prevents toxic lipid buildup, in addition to its normal role in energy production, so targeting MCAD causes irreversible damage and cell death specifically in cancer cells.The study was published today in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. Preclinical findings reveal an important new understanding of metabolism in GBM and support the development of MCAD inhibitors as a novel treatment strategy. The researchers currently are working to develop targeted therapies against the enzyme.""With altered metabolism being a key feature of glioblastoma, we wanted to better understand these processes and identify therapeutic targets that could have real impact for patients,"" said lead author Francesca Puca, Ph.D., instructor of Genomic Medicine. ""We discovered that glioblastoma cells rely on MCAD to detoxify and protect themselves from the accumulation of toxic byproducts of fatty acid metabolism. Inhibiting MCAD appears to be both potent and specific in killing glioblastoma cells.""To uncover metabolic genes that are key to GBM survival, the research team performed a functional genomic screen in a unique preclinical model system that permitted an in vivo study using patient-derived GBM cells. After analyzing 330 metabolism genes in this model, they discovered that several enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism were important for GBM cells.The team focused on MCAD because it was identified in multiple GBM models and found at high levels in GBM cells relative to normal brain tissue. In-depth studies determined that blocking MCAD in GBM cells resulted in severe mitochondrial failure caused by the toxic buildup of fatty acids, which normally are degraded by MCAD.This resulted in a catastrophic and irreversible cascade of events from which GBM cells could not recover, explained senior author Andrea Viale, M.D., assistant professor of Genomic Medicine.""It appears that the downregulation of this enzyme triggers a series of events that are irreversible, and the cells are poisoned from the inside,"" Viale said. ""Usually, tumor cells are able to adapt to treatments over time, but, based on our observations, we think it would be very difficult for these cells to develop resistance to MCAD depletion.""While blocking MCAD appears to be detrimental to the survival of GBM cells, the research team repeatedly found that normal cells in the brain were not affected by loss of the enzyme, suggesting that targeting MCAD could be selective in killing only cancer cells.

These findings, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, suggest that if transmissible cancers occurred historically in devils, they imposed natural selection on different sets of genes.Tasmanian devils suffer from a transmissible cancer called devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). Unlike typical cancers, tumor cells from transmissible cancers are directly transferred from one individual to another like an infectious disease. DTFD is most commonly transmitted from host to host as devils bite each other during mating season. The tumors become malignant and can kill their hosts within six months.DFTD was first discovered in 1996, and the recent discovery of a second transmissible cancer in Tasmanian devils in 2016 suggests that they may be prone to this unique type of disease. The threat of these two cancers has prompted conservation efforts.""For the conservation of Tasmanian devils, our work adds to the growing list of genes that we have observed to be evolving in response to DFTD,"" said Paul Hohenlohe, U of I Department of Biological Sciences associate professor, Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies (IBEST) principal investigator and senior author on the paper. ""We can monitor genetic diversity of these genes in wild populations to understand whether and how these populations can adapt and survive in the face of DFTD.""Using genomic sequencing and data analysis, the research team tested for natural selection in Tasmanian devils in response to DFTD to find out whether they are evolving as a result of the disease. They also looked for evidence of natural selection in the devils' evolutionary history to test whether the genes that are evolving under DFTD show evidence of historical natural selection.Finding little overlap in what genes are involved at historical and modern timescales, the team determined that if transmissible cancers have occurred historically in devils, they caused natural selection on different sets of genes. Their results and analysis of historical selection suggest that DFTD is a newly emerging selective force that distinctly shapes today's wild devils.This information can be used to inform conservation efforts by identifying targets for genetic monitoring and guiding maintenance of adaptive potential in Tasmanian devil populations.""Our work suggests that maintaining genetic diversity across a wide set of functionally important genes is critical to make sure Tasmanian devils are able to adapt to transmissible cancers and other threats to their survival,"" Hohenlohe said.Reference: Stahlke AR, Epstein B, Barbosa S, et al.

Until scientists can agree on one way of measuring them, life on land and sea will continue to ingest who knows how much plastic, affecting health for generations. A new study, published today in Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, by the University of Portsmouth has examined one method, using a chemical solution called 'Fenton reagent' to remove organic matter from sewage. It found it has significant advantages in processing times and costs over other currently available methods of testing. Project Lead Dr Fay Couceiro, Senior Research Fellow in Biogeochemistry at the University of Portsmouth, said: ""Multiple digestion with Fenton reagent involves mixing the sewage with hydrogen peroxide and iron sulphide multiple times to breakdown the organic matter. When followed by density separation, where you float off the plastics from everything else, it provides a cleaner sample so the size and type of microplastic can be determined with much less interference."" Professor Steve Fletcher, Director of the University's Revolution Plastics initiative, said: ""Having some idea of the amount of microplastics in the environment is key to understanding and stopping the potential harmful impacts that this new category of emerging pollutants could have on life on earth. The need for protocols that are robust, simple and reliable together with their standardisation are of crucial importance in the fight against plastic pollution."" The study targeted the detection of microplastics in the sub-hundred-micron size range, which often get missed because of their tiny size, yet they have potentially higher health risks associated with them. This size of particle also has limited data available from previous wastewater research. To show the value of this method, samples of raw sewage, final effluent and sludge were mixed with two different sizes and types of microplastics. The multiple digestion with Fenton reagent method showed good recovery of the added microplastics. Considering the various stages required for the separation of microplastics, time is a limiting factor in sample processing. The multiple digestion using Fenton reagent is an inexpensive and time-efficient procedure compared to other currently available methods when analysing large numbers of samples. Dr Couceiro says: ""The Fenton reagent method used in this study has huge potential for bringing about a much needed standardistation of the measuring of microplastics. Without being able to compare and contrast concentrations of microplastics, our ability to make significant strides forward in limiting pollution will be restricted. We would welcome further research that could investigate other types of plastics and the recovering of even smaller plastic particles.""ReferenceCunsolo S, Williams J, Hale M, Read DS, Couceiro F.

By metabolizing chemotherapy drugs, the protective bacteria could temper short- and long-term side effects of treatment.Eventually, the research could potentially lead to new dietary supplements, probiotics or engineered therapeutics to help boost cancer patients' gut health. Because chemotherapy-related microbiome changes in children are linked to health complications later in life -- including obesity, asthma and diabetes -- discovering new strategies for protecting the gut is particularly important for pediatric cancer patients.""We were really inspired by bioremediation, which uses microbes to clean up polluted environments,"" said Northwestern's Erica Hartmann, the study's senior author. ""Usually bioremediation applies to groundwater or soil, but, here, we have applied it to the gut. We know that certain bacteria can breakdown toxic cancer treatments. We wondered if, by breaking down drugs, these bacteria could protect the microbes around them. Our study shows the answer is 'yes.' If some bacteria can break down toxins fast enough, that provides a protective effect for the microbial community.""The research will be published on May 26 in the journal mSphere.Hartmann is an assistant professor of environmental biology at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. Ryan Blaustein, a former postdoctoral fellow in Hartmann's laboratory, is the paper's first author. He is now a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health.Although cancer treatments are life-saving, they also cause profoundly harsh and painful side effects, including gastrointestinal issues. Chemotherapies, in particular, can obliterate the healthy, ""good"" bacteria in the human gut.""Chemotherapy drugs do not differentiate between killing cancer cells and killing microbes,"" Hartmann said. ""Microbes in your gut help digest your food and keep you healthy. Killing these microbes is especially harmful for children because there's some evidence that disruption in the gut microbiome early in life can lead to potential health conditions later in life.""Working with Dr. Patrick Seed, a professor of pediatrics and microbiology-immunology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Hartmann's lab learned from Raoultella planticola. Naturally occurring in the human gut in low abundances, Raoultella planticola can break down chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, which has been demonstrated in other research.To test whether or not this breakdown effect could protect the entire microbiome, the team developed simplified microbial communities, which included various types of bacteria typically found in the human gut. The ""mock gut communities"" included bacteria strains (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) that are good at breaking down doxorubicin, strains (Clostridium innocuum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) that are especially sensitive to doxorubicin and one strain (Enterococcus faecium) that is resistant to doxorubicin but does not break it down.The team then exposed these mock gut communities"" to doxorubicin and found increased survival among sensitive strains. The researchers concluded that, by degrading doxorubicin, certain bacteria made the drugs less toxic to the rest of the gut.Although the research highlights a promising new pathway for potentially protecting cancer patients, Hartmann cautions that translating the new findings into treatments is still far off.""There are several eventual applications that would be great to help cancer patients -- particularly pediatric patients -- not experience such harsh side effects,"" she said. ""But we're still far from actually making that a reality.""Reference: Blaustein RA, Seed PC, Hartmann EM.

The H6PD levels also were elevated in biopsied patient tumors, suggesting the protein might be targeted in patients for treatment.""New treatment approaches for drug-resistant prostate cancer are desperately needed,"" said Dr. Sharifi, director of Cleveland Clinic's Genitourinary Malignancies Research Center. ""These findings suggest an entirely new strategy for treatment of men with this aggressive form of prostate cancer.""Enzalutamide, a current standard-of-care hormone therapy for metastatic prostate cancer, works by blocking androgen receptors, which are proteins that help drive cancer cells. While initially effective, most patients eventually develop resistance to the treatment. This resistance occurs when androgen receptors are blocked and cancer cells adapt to get their ""fuel"" from a similar receptor, called the glucocorticoid receptor.These glucocorticoid receptors bind to and interact with the stress hormone cortisol. In an earlier study published in eLife, Dr. Sharifi and his team linked enzalutamide resistance to increased tumor cortisol levels. They found that tumors typically express a protein called 11 -HSD2, which inactivates cortisol. However, when this protein expression is inhibited in some tumors, cortisol and the glucocorticoid receptor are stimulated and become available for use by cancer cells.""Taken together, our study findings suggest that pharmacologically inhibiting the H6PD protein can reverse drug resistance in prostate cancer cells,"" said Dr. Sharifi. ""By blocking this protein, we are able to prevent cancer cells from utilizing their backup fuel supply - cortisol and its receptor. When we block this pathway, tumors begin to become responsive to standard treatments again.""In this new study, the researchers demonstrated that, in addition to decreased expression of 11 -HSD2, resistant tumors also have increased H6PD levels.""With lower levels of 11 -HSD2, which normally functions to cut off the fuel supply to drug-resistant cancer cells, the cells are free to continue to grow and spread unchecked,"" said Dr. Sharifi. ""By inhibiting the H6PD protein, however, we were able to reinstate anti-cortisol effects. This finding is key to better understanding how disruptions in cortisol metabolism contribute to cancer cells' growth and spread.""Dr. Sharifi's clinical collaborator Eric Klein, M.D., chair of Cleveland Clinic's Urology & Kidney Institute and a co-author on the study, said, ""We found elevated levels of H6PD in both animal models and patient tissues, particularly after treating tumors with enzalutamide. These findings hold promise for novel precision medicine approaches in the management of men with aggressive prostate cancer.""The researchers targeted H6PD with rucaparib, a drug already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Sharifi collaborated with scientists from Cleveland Clinic's Center for Therapeutics Discovery to identify what parts of rucaparib are chemically necessary to inhibit the protein.Researchers administered enzalutamide to mouse models of aggressive prostate cancer that expressed H6PD and those where the protein was blocked with rucaparib. The models where H6PD was blocked had significantly smaller tumors and longer progression-free survival following enzalutamide treatment.Reference: Li J, Berk M, Alyamani M, et al.

We have discovered an intricate interplay of brain activity - slow oscillations and sleep spindles   which create windows of opportunity enabling this reactivation. Co-author Dr Thomas Schreiner, from Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, commented:  Memory reactivation is specifically bound to the presence of SO-spindle complexes. These results shed new light on the memory function of sleep in humans and emphasise the importance of orchestrated sleep rhythms in strengthening our powers of recall and orchestrating the creation of memories. Before this study, evidence of the brain s capacity to reactivate memories during sleep was scarce, but the team devised novel tests where participants were shown information before taking a nap and closely monitored brain activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep using EEG recording. Those taking part were then tested on their memory recall after waking up, allowing the researchers to link the extent of memory reactivation during sleep to memory performance.The results revealed reactivation of learning material during SO-spindle complexes, with the precision of SO-spindle coupling predicting how strongly the memory would be reactivated by the brain. This in turn predicted the level of memory consolidation across participants and the subsequent clarity of recall.Reference: Schreiner T, Petzka M, Staudigl T, et al.

Most people ingest lithium on a daily basis in drinking water.

This link helps bacteria to efficiently update their immune memory when infected by mutant viruses that learned to evade the CRISPR-Cas defense. The paper was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.CRISPR-Cas, a defense mechanism that provides bacteria with resistance to their viruses (bacteriophages), destroys DNA from previously encountered adversaries by 'comparing' it to spacers, short bits of genetic information stored as a 'library' in a ""memory chip"" located in a special site of the bacterial genome. CRISPR-Cas ""learns"" to recognize new enemies by incorporating new viral-derived spacers into this library during the infection. The two stages of CRISPR functioning, acquisition of spacers and their use to fight reinfections, are called adaptation and interference, correspondingly.""To avoid CRISPR, phages acquire mutations that introduce mismatches with spacers. So, in order to maintain an effective defense, the CRISPR-Cas system needs to update the set of spacers faster than mutant phages with escape mutations arise. To meet this requirement, CRISPR-Cas systems have evolved a special mechanism of ""primed adaptation"". During primed adaptation preexisting spacers that recognize a target, even inefficiently, promote very efficient acquisition of additional spacers from the same DNA molecule on which the target is located,"" Olga Musharova, Skoltech research scientist and the paper's first author, explains.The exact molecular mechanism of priming is still unclear but it clearly requires tight coordination between the killing and the memorizing parts of the CRISPR mechanism. In the new paper, Skoltech Professor Konstantin Severinov, Musharova and their colleagues were able to confirm the existence of a ""priming complex"" that includes both the Cas1-Cas2 proteins responsible for acquiring new spacers, and the Cas3 protein that cleaves enemy DNA.""The part that destroys foreign DNA and the part that acquires new information for the future protective function of CRISPR-Cas system are linked. It's as if the mallet in a Whac-A-Mole game could also take pictures of the moles for future reference,"" Severinov said.In experiments with E. coli, the team showed that fragments of DNA being degraded by Cas3 are directly passed over to Cas1-Cas2 as ""prespacers"" that eventually become spacers. ""This result is of fundamental significance. We uncovered the link between the interference and the adaptation processes,"" Musharova says.

Yet some strains of this species can cause infections - in catheters, artificial joints, heart valves, and in the bloodstream - which are difficult to treat. These bacteria are often resistant to a particularly effective antibiotic, methicillin, and are among the most feared germs in hospitals. How these usually harmless skin microbes become deadly pathogens has been unclear up to now.An international research team has now discovered what distinguishes peaceful S. epidermidis microorganisms from the many dangerous invaders. The scientists have identified a new gene cluster that enables the more aggressive bacteria to produce additional structures in their cell walls. This morphological alteration allows the staphylococci to attach more easily to human cells forming the blood vessels, a process via which they can persist in the bloodstream to become pathogens. These new cell wall structures may also allow the spread of methicillin resistance, by transferring it, for example, from Staphylococcus epidermidis to its more dangerous relative Staphylococcus aureus.The study was carried out under the direction of researchers of the Cluster of Excellence ""Controlling Microbes to Fight Infections"" (CMFI) of the University of T bingen and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) in cooperation with universities in Copenhagen, Hamburg, Shanghai and Hanover as well as the German Center for Lung Research (DZL) in Borstel.

One theory is that hormonal differences between men and women may make men more susceptible to severe disease. And since men have much more testosterone than women, some scientists have speculated that high levels of testosterone may be to blame.But a new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis suggests that, among men, the opposite may be true: that low testosterone levels in the blood are linked to more severe disease. The study could not prove that low testosterone is a cause of severe COVID-19; low levels could simply serve as a marker of some other causal factors. Still, the researchers urge caution with ongoing clinical trials investigating hormonal therapies that block or lower testosterone or increase estrogen as a treatment for men with COVID-19.The study appears online In JAMA Network Open. During the pandemic, there has been a prevailing notion that testosterone is bad,  said senior author Abhinav Diwan, MD, a professor of medicine.  But we found the opposite in men. If a man had low testosterone when he first came to the hospital, his risk of having severe COVID-19   meaning his risk of requiring intensive care or dying   was much higher compared with men who had more circulating testosterone. And if testosterone levels dropped further during hospitalization, the risk increased. The researchers measured several hormones in blood samples from 90 men and 62 women who came to Barnes-Jewish Hospital with symptoms of COVID-19 and who had confirmed cases of the illness. For the 143 patients who were admitted to the hospital, the researchers measured hormone levels again at days 3, 7, 14 and 28, as long as the patients remained hospitalized over these time frames. In addition to testosterone, the investigators measured levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen produced by the body, and IGF-1, an important growth hormone that is similar to insulin and plays a role in maintaining muscle mass.Among women, the researchers found no correlation between levels of any hormone and disease severity. Among men, only testosterone levels were linked to COVID-19 severity. A blood testosterone level of 250 nanograms per deciliter or less is considered low testosterone in adult men. At hospital admission, men with severe COVID-19 had average testosterone levels of 53 nanograms per deciliter; men with less severe disease had average levels of 151 nanograms per deciliter. By day three, the average testosterone level of the most severely ill men was only 19 nanograms per deciliter.The lower the levels of testosterone, the more severe the disease. For example, those with the lowest levels of testosterone in the blood were at highest risk of going on a ventilator, needing intensive care or dying. Thirty-seven patients   25 of whom were men   died over the course of the study.The researchers noted that other factors known to increase the risk of severe COVID-19, including advanced age, obesity and diabetes, also are associated with lower testosterone.  The groups of men who were getting sicker were known to have lower testosterone across the board,  said first author Sandeep Dhindsa, MD, an endocrinologist at Saint Louis University.  We also found that those men with COVID-19 who were not severely ill initially, but had low testosterone levels, were likely to need intensive care or intubation over the next two or three days. Lower testosterone levels seemed to predict which patients were likely to become very ill over the next few days. In addition, the researchers found that lower testosterone levels in men also correlated with higher levels of inflammation and an increase in the activation of genes that allow the body to carry out the functions of circulating sex hormones inside the cells. In other words, the body may be adapting to less testosterone circulating in the bloodstream by dialing up its ability to detect and use the hormone. The researchers don t yet know the implications of this adaptation and are calling for more research. We are now investigating whether there is an association between sex hormones and cardiovascular outcomes in long COVID-19, when the symptoms linger over many months,  said Diwan, who is a cardiologist.  We also are interested in whether men recovering from COVID-19, including those with long COVID-19, may benefit from testosterone therapy. This therapy has been used in men with low levels of sex hormones, so it may be worth investigating whether a similar approach can help male COVID-19 survivors with their rehabilitation.""Reference: Dhindsa S, Zhang N, McPhaul MJ, et al.

To counter this loss, scientists at the Salk Institute are studying ways to accelerate the regeneration of muscle tissue, using a combination of molecular compounds that are commonly used in stem-cell research.In a study published on May 25, 2021, in Nature Communications, the investigators showed that using these compounds increased the regeneration of muscle cells in mice by activating the precursors of muscle cells, called myogenic progenitors. Although more work is needed before this approach can be applied in humans, the research provides insight into the underlying mechanisms related to muscle regeneration and growth and could one day help athletes as well as aging adults regenerate tissue more effectively.""Loss of these progenitors has been connected to age-related muscle degeneration,"" says Salk Professor Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, the paper's senior author. ""Our study uncovers specific factors that are able to accelerate muscle regeneration, as well as revealing the mechanism by which this occurred.""The compounds used in the study are often called Yamanaka factors after the Japanese scientist who discovered them. Yamanaka factors are a combination of proteins (called transcription factors) that control how DNA is copied for translation into other proteins. In lab research, they are used to convert specialized cells, like skin cells, into more stem-cell-like cells that are pluripotent, which means they have the ability to become many different types of cells.""Our laboratory previously showed that these factors can rejuvenate cells and promote tissue regeneration in live animals,"" says first author Chao Wang, a postdoctoral fellow in the Izpisua Belmonte lab. ""But how this happens was not previously known.""Muscle regeneration is mediated by muscle stem cells, also called satellite cells. Satellite cells are located in a niche between a layer of connective tissue (basal lamina) and muscle fibers (myofibers). In this study, the team used two different mouse models to pinpoint the muscle stem-cell-specific or niche-specific changes following addition of Yamanaka factors. They focused on younger mice to study the effects of the factors independent of age.In the myofiber-specific model, they found that adding the Yamanaka factors accelerated muscle regeneration in mice by reducing the levels of a protein called Wnt4 in the niche, which in turn activated the satellite cells. By contrast, in the satellite-cell-specific model, Yamanaka factors did not activate satellite cells and did not improve muscle regeneration, suggesting that Wnt4 plays a vital role in muscle regeneration.According to Izpisua Belmonte, who holds the Roger Guillemin Chair, the observations from this study could eventually lead to new treatments by targeting Wnt4.""Our laboratory has recently developed novel gene-editing technologies that could be used to accelerate muscle recovery after injury and improve muscle function,"" he says. ""We could potentially use this technology to either directly reduce Wnt4 levels in skeletal muscle or to block the communication between Wnt4 and muscle stem cells.""The investigators are also studying other ways to rejuvenate cells, including using mRNA and genetic engineering. These techniques could eventually lead to new approaches to boost tissue and organ regeneration.Reference: Wang C, Rabadan Ros R, Martinez-Redondo P, et al.

In fact, every part of our daily routines became subject to analysis: How risky is the action and is its value worth the potential cost?Risk analysis, though seemingly more ever-present in our thoughts today, has always been a part of how we operate and how the systems around us work. As new pressures, such as climate change, deepen, the accuracy and reliability of risk analysis models regarding issues as basic as the cleanliness of our drinking water have become more important than ever.USC researchers, including Felipe de Barros, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, have developed a variety of models that can help assess how emerging contaminants disperse, dissolve and ultimately impact water quality and the resilience of aquifers.""The subsurface environment is very complex and challenging to track, because we cannot see it,"" de Barros said. ""We don't have detailed information on how deep the contaminants are, how far out they are spread, where they are coming from, what other contaminants they have mixed with or how the geological properties vary in space.""These questions are exactly what de Barros and his team work on. Recently, de Barros and collaborators developed an analytical model that can help predict contaminant spreading in fractured porous media under different water flow scenarios. This work was featured in Physics Review Fluids. The advantage of the analytical model developed by de Barros and collaborators is that it allows to look at the relationships between varying geological and physical parameters to see how they impact dissolution of a contaminant as water flows from one point to another.""It's like studying alternative realities--like in a comic book universe,"" de Barros said. ""If you can understand what happens with each different scenario, you can better predict outcomes in real time and better allocate resources to mitigate the problem.""""With tools like this one, you can do probabilistic risk analysis and compute and assess the risks associated with a waste disposal facility, for example, or with an accidental leak,"" he said. ""We can also understand how fast these chemicals are going to travel in these environments.""For example, say there was a chemical spill near an aquifer. With accurate risk modeling that accounts for key heterogeneous variables in the environment, health professionals and regulatory bodies could better understand how much of a contaminant they can expect to be in the end water source, de Barros said.""This modeling can help with questions like, 'Should I invest more money in public health or in characterizing the geological site? Should I shut down the well--which is very costly--or bring in tap water from another location or buy bottled water, or is there reasonable knowledge that the water can still be used, once treated?"" he said.","Published: May 26, 2021"

The method, called SARSeq, is published in the journal Nature Communications and could be adapted to many more pathogens.The COVID-19 pandemic has lasted more than a year and continues to impact our lives tremendously. Although some countries have launched speedy vaccination campaigns, many still await large-scale immunization schemes and effective antiviral therapies - before that happens, the world urgently needs to regain a semblance of normalcy.One way to bring us closer to that point is massive parallel testing. Molecular tests that detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 have become the best way to isolate positive cases and contain the spread of the virus. Several methods have come forward, some that detect viral proteins from nasopharyngeal swabs (such as antigen tests), and some that detect the presence of viral RNA from swabs, gargle samples, or saliva samples (such as reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction tests, or RT-PCR).Although antigen tests facilitate some logistical aspects of mass testing, their detection power is relatively weak - infected individuals carrying low amounts of virus remain undetected and can continue to infect other people. PCR tests, on the other hand, are more sensitive because they multiply fragments of the viral genome before scanning samples for the virus. However, they rely on the detection of fluorescent labels that tag viral sequences, which means that pooling samples coming from different people makes the process rather inefficient: if a pool tests positive, all the samples within the pool must be tested again individually to identify the source of the fluorescent signal. Too many machines needed, too expensive, too slow.During the very first lockdown, scientists at the Vienna BioCenter were mulling over the situation: there had to be a way to scale up testing. Ulrich Elling, group leader at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (IMBA), and Luisa Cochella, group leader at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), decided to channel their frustration into an innovative solution. IMP group leader Alexander Stark and IMBA postdoc Ramesh Yelangandula joined their efforts, and the project took off.Combining their expertise in genomics, RNA biochemistry and data analysis, they developed a method that could enable large groups to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the same sensitivity as regular PCR tests. SARSeq, or 'Saliva Analysis by RNA sequencing', achieves high sensitivity, specificity, and the power to process up to 36,000 samples in less than 48 hours. The method is now published in the journal Nature Communications.The testing principle is conceptually simple: individual patient samples are collected into the wells of a testing plate - one well for each sample. Then, a fragment of viral RNA unique to SARS-CoV-2 - the nucleocapsid gene - is selectively converted to DNA and PCR-amplified in any well that contains it.""Amplifying the viral material from individual samples to a maximum homogenizes its quantity across positive samples, making SARSeq highly sensitive,"" explains Luisa Cochella. ""Within the thousands of samples that we could test simultaneously, some may contain up to 10 million times more coronavirus particles than others - if we pooled such samples before amplification, those with high amounts of viral material could mask other positive cases.""What distinguishes this first step to the usual PCR test is that each sample receives a unique set of short DNA sequences - or barcodes - that attach to the amplifying viral DNA. In a second amplification step, all the samples from one plate are pooled into one well, which receives a second set of unique DNA barcodes. The contents of multiple plates can be pooled once more, as the DNA molecules from each sample carry a unique combination of two sets of barcodes. This pooling and barcoding strategy makes SARSeq highly specific and scalable.""We combine the sensitivity of PCR with the high throughput of Next Generation Sequencing technology, or NGS, the same used to sequence the human genome. The NGS machine processes the pooled samples and tells us which samples contained any SARS-CoV-2 material. The barcodes allow us to distinguish each positive sample from the others, and trace it back to a patient,"" says Ramesh Yelagandula, first author of the study. Moreover, the NGS-based method allows to test several RNAs in parallel, including RNAs that control the sample quality or RNAs from other pathogens for differential diagnostics.""The Next Generation Sequencing facility and other colleagues at the Vienna BioCenter were of tremendous help to develop and optimize the method,"" says Alexander Stark. ""With our machines, home-made enzymes, and analysis pipeline, we expect each test to cost less than five Euro.""The testing procedure can run in parallel to existing diagnostics, while being independent of the bottlenecks in supply chains. Therefore, it does not compete with other testing methods for reagents or equipment.""We developed SARSeq to try and circumvent the limitations of other tests, and to process thousands of samples in parallel. Not only is it an excellent method to detect SARS-CoV-2, but it can also be applied to other respiratory pathogens like the flu virus, the common cold rhinoviruses, and potentially many others,"" says Ulrich Elling.The principles behind SARSeq are simple and adaptable to any respiratory pathogen. As the world's population skyrockets along with our proximity to animals, cutting-edge diagnostic methods like SARSeq will be crucial to prevent future diseases from spreading like wildfire.Reference: Yelagandula R, Bykov A, Vogt A, et al.

The disease has been reducing acreage and increasing the price of wheat production in the United States since the early 1990s, which in turn increases costs for downstream producers, such as millers and brewers. The disease is caused by a fungus that produces heat-stable trichothecene mycotoxins, which help the disease spread. To stop the spread, plant breeders are working to develop cultivars with improved resistance to FHB. A team of plant pathologists primarily based at Rutgers University recently generated wheat overexpressing two non-specific lipid transfer proteins and found that this enhanced protection against the fungus and led to a reduction of one of the major mycotoxins.  We found that the AtLTp4.4 protein, from the large gene family of nsLTPs, had both antifungal and antioxidant properties,  said John McLaughlin.  This is the first study to show that nsLTPs have dual functions and the first study to explore how these functions contribute to FHB-resistance in wheat.  The discovery that genes like nsLTPs can improve FHB-resistance in wheat adds to the catalog of genes that plant breeders can use in their breeding programs. This discovery also opens new research avenues for McLaughlin and his colleagues.  We are exploring if nsLTP overexpression in barley can impact FHB resistance and if the increase of nsLTPs in the grain improves the antioxidant properties of malt,  said McLaughlin.  Additionally, nsLTPs are predicted to improve beer shelf life and flavor stability, and we will be testing that.  Their research also highlights the need to better understand the connection between the induction of reactive oxygen species and mycotoxin production/accumulation in small grain cereals as the scientists found that application of trichothecenes to wheat leaf tissue and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, independent of the fungus, can be significantly impacted by the overexpression of nsLTPs.  Our research shows that gain-of-function mutants can be used to enhance plant disease resistance, and our article shows some of the techniques involved to explore the mechanisms of disease resistance,  McLaughlin added.

They facilitate proper nerve function, the degradation of toxic substances, the formation of bacterial cell walls and the conversion of certain drugs into their active form (the best known conversion is seen with ibuprofen, which is taken as a mixture of isomers and converted in the liver to the active S-isomer). But while normal levels of racemase and epimerase function are generally beneficial, increased levels can be harmful. Because of this, there is considerable interest in developing drugs that impact these enzymes.There have been promising outcomes in lab experiments where racemases (and related epimerases) have been targeted with experimental drug molecules. These molecules reduce the functional activity of racemases and have the potential to be developed into new treatments for a wide range of diseases, including prostate, breast and brain cancers; Alzheimer's disease and other dementias; bacterial and viral infections; Chagas disease, and the complications of diabetes.Notable successes in developing racemase-fighting molecules include the identification of D-cycloserine (a natural product discovered in 1954), which is used in the treatment of tuberculosis - a major global health threat.Until now, there has been no general review of how drugs can be used to stop these potent enzymes from working. The new Bath paper explores all known strategies used to design or discover such drugs, including methods adopted to measure racemase function and by extension drug effectiveness. The paper also surveys recent advances in the development of drugs targeting specific enzymes, including alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase - an enzyme that is linked to prostate cancer, and which is the focus of the team's own research.In addition, the Bath researchers set out to develop a coherent model of how racemases and epimerases perform their functions. Their hope is to use this model to design and develop more effective drugs.What makes racemases and epimerases special is their ability to change the chirality of molecules - that is, the way in which groups in the molecules twist. Many biological molecules exhibit chirality, and the direction of a given molecule's twists determines how it functions: mirror-image molecules with the exact same structure can behave very differently in biological systems. This mirror-image phenomenon is known as stereochemical isomerism, and the mirror-image molecules are the isomers.In biological systems, one of the two stereochemical isomers predominates, but there are many examples where the less abundant isomer plays a specific, critical role in the cell. For example, the amino-acid L-serine is abundant in the proteins and the membranes of all cells, while its isomer D-serine has a specialised role in neurotransmission in humans and other higher animals. Racemases and epimerases catalyse the formation of the less abundant of the two isomers from the more abundant, and hence change the way in which the molecule twists. They perform their reactions using several different chemical strategies, but by far the most common is the removal of a proton from an activated carbon atom followed by delivery of a proton from the opposite side to quench the resulting intermediate.As well as the role they play in human health, racemases and epimerases have important biotechnology applications in green and sustainable routes to chemicals with high economic value. These enzymes can be used to produce difficult-to-access stereochemical isomers of amino acids and other molecules that are important in the food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries.For many years, the Bath team has worked on the  -methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) - an enzyme that is overactivated in prostate and other cancers. Research on this enzyme, and on finding compounds to stop it from working, has been funded by several organisations, including Prostate Cancer UK.Dr Matthew Lloyd, lead author of the paper, said: ""Racemases and epimerases have traditionally been seen as niche enzymes, however their pivotal position within biological processes means they make excellent drug targets and can be exploited in the manufacture of important chemicals that have great economic value because they are used in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and other industries.""Our systematic analysis of racemase enzymes, the reactions they catalyse and the ways in which they can be stopped from working reveal several common themes and suggest several new avenues of research. Thanks to our detailed review, we now have a much better theoretical understanding of how these enzymes work, and this knowledge is essential if these enzymes are to be effectively targeted by the new drugs being developed.""He added: ""It's also clear that there are several potential strategies to develop new drugs, such as fragment-based drug design and virtual screening, which are ripe for exploitation. We hope this paper will stimulate new research on these under-appreciated enzymes.""Simon Grieveson, head of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ""Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and we desperately need better treatments. That's why we're committed to funding research like this which explores promising new ways of tackling the disease.""Through their detailed lab work, Dr Lloyd and his team have successfully found ways to target and suppress a key protein involved in prostate cancer growth.

This unsustainable practice is both costly and environmentally unfriendly, so researchers have been searching for new ways to recycle these organic materials into useful products. ""Our goal was to use seaweed and common food scraps to construct materials that were at least as strong as concrete,"" explains Yuya Sakai, the senior author of the study. ""But since we were using edible food waste, we were also interested in determining whether the recycling process impacted the flavor of the original materials."" The researchers borrowed a ""heat pressing"" concept that is typically used to make construction materials from wood powder, except they used vacuum-dried, pulverized food scraps, such as seaweed, cabbage leaves, and orange, onion, pumpkin, and banana peels as the constituent powders. The processing technique involved mixing the food powder with water and seasonings, and then pressing the mixture into a mold at high temperature. The researchers tested the bending strength of the resulting materials and monitored their taste, smell, and appearance. ""With the exception of the specimen derived from pumpkin, all of the materials exceeded our bending strength target,"" says Kota Machida, a senior collaborator. ""We also found that Chinese cabbage leaves, which produced a material over three times stronger than concrete, could be mixed with the weaker pumpkin-based material to provide effective reinforcement."" The new, robust materials retained their edible nature, and the addition of salt or sugar improved their taste without reducing their strength. Furthermore, the durable products resisted rot, fungi, and insects, and experienced no appreciable changes in appearance or taste after exposure to air for four months. Given that food waste is a global financial burden and environmental concern, it is crucial to develop methods for recycling food scraps. Using these substances to prepare materials that are strong enough for construction projects, but also maintain their edible nature and taste, opens the door to a wide range of creative applications from the one technology.ReferenceDevelopment of Novel Construction Material from Food Waste.

They discovered that mibefradil selectively inhibits a key DNA repair pathway, alternative non-homologous end joining.Then, they initiated a phase I clinical trial that revealed promising initial efficacy of mibefradil, but further development was hampered by dose-limiting toxicities, including CCB-related cardiotoxicity, off-target hERG channel and cytochrome P450 enzymes interactions.Here, the authors show that mibefradil inhibits DNA repair independent of its CCB activity, and report a series of mibefradil analogues which lack CCB activity and demonstrate reduced hERG and CYP activity while retaining potency as DNA repair inhibitors. They also report a targeted siRNA-based screen which suggests a possible role for mTOR and Akt in DNA repair inhibition by this class of drugs.Taken together, these Oncotarget data reveal a new class of mibefradil-based DNA repair inhibitors which can be further advanced into pre-clinical testing and eventually clinical trials, as potential GBM radiosensitizers.Dr. Yulia V. Surovtseva and Dr. Ranjit S. Bindra from Yale University said, ""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS).""Cells utilize several DNA double-strand break repair pathways to repair DNA damage induced by irradiation.This pathway repairs only 0.5 1% of total DSBs, but serves as a crucial back-up pathway for both NHEJ and HR and for the repair of complex DNA lesions arising from IR-induced damage.The EJ-DR assay was utilized in a high-throughput chemical screen for novel DNA repair inhibitors, which identified the T-type and L-type calcium channel blocker, mibefradil, as a selective inhibitor of alt-NHEJ repair.Based on these findings, the authors sought to create a new class of radiosensitizers which retained mibefradil's activity as a DNA repair inhibitor, but showed reduced hERG and CYP450 enzyme inhibition.Finally, through the knockdown of DNA damage response proteins in the high-throughput imaging-based assay, we identified potential targets or regulators of mibefradil, which phenocopied the selective inhibition of alt-NHEJ over HR.The Surovtseva/Bindra Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that, the use of DNA repair inhibitors as radiosensitizers in GBM could represent a viable approach to achieve better response owing to the range of DDR pathways activated in response to radiation-induced DNA damage.Additionally, the identification of selective inhibitors of alt-NHEJ could also be tested in other settings where alt-NHEJ activity is critical, such as in HR-deficient tumors.The synthesis and validation of the mibefradil analogue, YU252386, shows great promise towards the development of a potent and selective radiosensitizer for GBMs and beyond, and warrants further in vivo study in clinically relevant GBM models.Reference: Paradkar S, Herrington J, Hendricson A, et al.

The results may point to new ways to treat autoimmune diseases that cause the immune system to attack the body, or lead to improvements in cutting-edge cancer treatments. It is widely believed that T cells can discriminate perfectly between infected cells and healthy ones based on how tightly they are able to bind to molecules called antigens on the surface of each. They bind tightly to antigens derived from viruses or bacteria, but less tightly to our own antigens on normal cells. But recent studies by scientists looking at autoimmune diseases suggest that T cells can attack otherwise normal cells if they express unusually large numbers of our own antigens, even though these bind only weakly.  We set out to resolve this discrepancy between the idea that T cells are near perfect at discriminating between healthy and infected cells based on the antigen binding strength, and clinical results that suggests otherwise,  says co-first author Johannes Pettmann, a D.Phil student at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology and Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, UK.  We did this by very precisely measuring the binding strength of different antigens.  The team measured exactly how tightly receptors on T cells bind to a large number of different antigens, and then measured how T cells from healthy humans responded to cells loaded with different amounts of these antigens.  Our methods, combined with computer modelling, showed that the T cell s receptors were better at discrimination compared to other types of receptors,  says co-first author Anna Huhn, also a D.Phil student at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford.  But they weren t perfect   their receptors compelled T cells to respond even to antigens that showed only weak binding.   This finding completely changes how we view T cells,  adds Enas Abu-Shah, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Kennedy Institute and the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, and also a co-first author of the study.  Instead of thinking of them as near-perfect discriminators of the antigen binding strength, we now know that they can respond to normal cells that simply have more of our own weakly binding antigens.  The authors say that technical issues with measuring the strength of T cell receptor binding in previous studies likely led to the mistaken conclusion that T cells are perfect discriminators, highlighting the importance of using more precise measurements.  Our work suggests that T cells might begin to attack healthy cells if those cells produce abnormally high numbers of antigens,  says senior author Omer Dushek, Associate Professor at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, and a Senior Research Fellow in Basic Biomedical Sciences at the Wellcome Trust, UK.  This contributes to a major paradigm shift in how we think about autoimmunity, because instead of focusing on defects in how T cells discriminate between antigens, it suggests that abnormally high levels of our own antigens may be responsible for the mistaken autoimmune T-cell response. On the other hand, this ability could be helpful to kill cancer cells that mutate to express abnormally high levels of our antigens.  Dushek adds that the work also opens up new avenues of research to improve the discrimination abilities of T cells, which could be helpful to reduce the autoimmune side-effects of many T-cell-based therapies without reducing the ability of these cells to kill cancer cells.ReferencePettmann J, Huhn A, Abu Shah E, et al.

The findings include entirely novel information on the links between microbial biofilms and cell behavior in head and neck cancer.The researchers discovered that metabolites secreted by biofilms, termed the secretome, can modulate the expression of proto-oncogenes and cell cycle genes associated with tumor cell growth and survival. Their analysis of gene expression focused on two signaling pathways (EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR) that play a key role in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Alterations to gene expression in these pathways are highly prevalent in various types of tumor.The researchers analyzed head and neck and oral cavity squamous carcinoma cells. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, which produces functional and aesthetic changes that degrade the patient s quality of life.The cells were challenged via stimulation by metabolites from biofilms of Candida albicans fungi and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. These microorganisms are very frequent in users of dentures: prior research found both in 30%-40% of subjects examined.Oral microbiota is known to play an important role in the development of cancer. Genetic markers associated with the presence of microorganisms have been identified for some types, such as stomach cancer, but there is no consensus regarding the most prevalent genes linked to head and neck cancer, and no molecular markers had hitherto been found for this disease, especially HPV-negative cancer, which has a worse prognosis.According to a report on the study published in Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, metabolites from C. albicans and S. aureus biofilms can endanger the homeostasis of normal and neoplastic oral epithelial cells, altering the expression of important genes such as CDKN1A, Bcl-2, PI3K, BRAF, hRAS and mTOR, impairing cell viability and survival, and disrupting the cell cycle profile.The study was supported by FAPESP and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). The project was also awarded funding by Colombia s COLCIENCIAS and SAPIENCIA agencies (2015 call for doctorates abroad), and involved partnerships with UNESP s Araraquara Dental School (FOAr) and Araraquara School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFAr).Understanding the cell cycle is important because cancer entails unchecked cell division and growth, with tumor cells potentially invading tissues and organs throughout the body. Failure of the inhibitors of this cycle and excessive signaling by cell division regulators can lead to tumor progression.The oral microbiome is a diversified community of microorganisms with as many as 700 species of viruses, protozoans, bacteria and fungi. When biofilms develop, they produce metabolites that alter the immune response and can lead to chronic inflammation and even production of cancerous substances.According to Paula Aboud Barbugli, a professor at FOAr-UNESP and co-leader of the study, the findings show that  molecules secreted by these microorganisms in biofilms may modulate host cell activities even far away from the primary infection site .For Carlos Eduardo Vergani, also a professor at FOAr-UNESP and principal investigator for the project, the results serve as a warning on the treatment of cancer patients who have dentures.  Control of biofilms, including denture and oral cavity hygiene, is extremely important to minimize inflammatory processes, as shown by our prior research and the study just published, which points to interference with the expression of genes associated with tumor progression,  Vergani told Ag ncia FAPESP.Another study led by Vergani and published in 2017 showed that soluble factors in methicillin-sensitive C. albicans and S. aureus biofilm promoted cell death and inflammatory responses.According to a report issued in March by Brazil s National Cancer Institute (INCA), some 22,800 new cases of laryngeal and oral cavity cancer are reported each year, most of them in male patients.","Published: May 26, 2021"

Saliva's role in immune responses, as well as the ease with which it may be collected as a fluid sample, make it a desirable tool in precision medicine and noninvasive diagnostics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used to detect the virus and track the body's immune response.A challenge in saliva's study, however, is the high level of variability in the thousands of salivary proteins. Therefore, normal ranges for the composition of saliva need to be established to define the status of health, says Ruhl, who in 2020, co-authored research on how saliva is made, pinpointing the origins of proteins in human saliva back to its sources.""Saliva has become an attractive body fluid for on-site, remote and real-time monitoring of oral and systemic health. The scientific community needs a saliva-centered information platform that keeps pace with the rapid accumulation of new data and knowledge,"" says William Lau, PhD, of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and first author of the study.""The Human Salivary Proteome Wiki will improve salivary sciences, saliva-based diagnostics, precision medicine and dentistry, and ultimately facilitate personalized treatment for both oral and systemic diseases,"" says Preethi Chander, PhD, program director of the NIDCR Salivary Biology and Immunology Program.Modernized to 'harness the full potential of the salivary proteome'Funded by NIDCR and developed in collaboration with the NIH Center for Information Technology, the Human Salivary Proteome Wiki was released in 2019 as a user-friendly public database to provide rich analytical, curation, and annotation tools for the biomedical research community.The database compiles information and research on the salivary proteome, genome, transcriptome (types and levels of mRNA expressed in salivary gland tissue), and glycome (array of sugars attached to salivary glycoproteins).Users may submit proposals to add, and remove or modify data to an interdisciplinary team of curators who ensure information is accurate and supported by sound scientific evidence. Annotations are also credited to the researchers and clinicians who submit them to the wiki, helping drive references to critical research.The researchers will also host a series of activities that bring contributors together to inspire novel ideas and foster cross-discipline collaborations.Reference: Lau WW, Hardt M, Zhang YH, Freire M, Ruhl S.

The study was published May 25 in Molecular Psychiatry. It was very surprising that a single treatment with a low dose had such dramatic effects within a day,  said corresponding author Yi Zuo, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.  I had a hard time believing it even when I saw the initial data. TBG was developed in the lab of coauthor David Olson at UC Davis. Zuo s lab worked with Olson on the initial studies of TBG, reported in Nature in 2020. The new study focused on the deleterious effects of stress using a protocol in which mice are subjected to mild, unpredictable stressors over a period of several days.On the behavioral level, stress causes increased anxiety, deficits in sensory processing, and reduced flexibility in decision-making. In the brain, stress disrupts the connections between neurons and alters the neuronal circuitry, resulting in an imbalance between excitation and inhibition. Amazingly, TBG reversed all of the effects of stress,  Zuo said.In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the use of psychedelic substances for treating illnesses such as addiction, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The hallucinogenic effects of these drugs remain a concern, however, and scientists have been unsure whether the hallucinations are therapeutically important or just a side effect.Ibogaine has shown promise for treating addiction, but it causes dangerous heart arrhythmias in addition to being a powerful hallucinogen. TBG has not yet been tested in humans, but it lacks ibogaine s toxicity in animal tests, and it doesn t induce the head-twitch behavior in mice caused by known hallucinogens.Initial studies of TBG found that it had antidepressant effects and reduced addictive behaviors in rodents. The new study was initiated by co-first author Michelle Tjia, then a graduate student in Zuo s lab studying the effects of stress. After Tjia left for a postdoctoral position, co-first author Ju Lu, a project scientist in the lab, led additional studies. The researchers conducted a range of tests to evaluate behavioral responses to stress and the effects of treatment with TBG. They also performed imaging studies to assess changes in the brains of the mice at the neuronal level. This study provides significant insights into neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psychedelic analogs on mental illnesses and paves the way for future investigations to understand their cellular and circuit mechanisms,  Zuo said.Studies using animal models conducted in accordance with NIH regulations and reviewed and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees remain vital to investigating complex psychiatric disorders.In addition to Lu, Tjia, Olson, and Zuo, the coauthors include Brian Mullen, Kacper Lukasiewicz, Sajita Shah-Morales, and Sydney Weiser at UC Santa Cruz, Bing Cao and Lu Chen at Stanford University, and Lindsay Cameron at UC Davis.

Changes in these properties, which occur in a number of human pathologies, including cancer, can elicit abnormal responses from cells. How the cells adapt to such changes in the mechanical microenvironment is not well understood.A team of researchers at Texas A&M University are working to understand cellular mechanosensing -- the ability to sense and respond to the mechanical properties of the microenvironment -- in a unique way. Dr. Tanmay Lele, Unocal Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering and the Department of Translational Medical Sciences, partnered with Dr. Charles Baer, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Florida. Together they used methods of experimental cellular evolution as a means to understand cellular adaptation to biomaterials of controlled mechanical properties.The experiments were led by doctoral student Purboja Purkayastha from the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering and technical laboratory coordinator Kavya Pendyala from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&M.""Before our work, it was basically unknown if cells would evolve in controlled mechanical environments,"" Lele said. ""We set out to test this possibility.""Cells are products from hundreds of millions of years of evolution, and their response to environments -- whether chemical or mechanical -- has likely evolved through a process of natural selection. Chemical constraints are well known to exert selection pressure on cell populations, but whether the mechanical properties of a cell's environment constitutes a significant agent of natural selection has never been investigated before.Many types of animal cells exhibit ""phenotypic plasticity"" -- they look and function differently -- in different mechanical environments. There are two possible explanations for the plasticity of cells in different mechanical environments. First, the phenotypes may be optimal, such that there is no better way for a cell to function in each environment. Alternatively, the plasticity may be a compromise such that the phenotypic trait is optimal for a given mechanical context, but suboptimal in other mechanical contexts.The team's research demonstrated that cellular mechanosensing is, in fact, not optimal but a tradeoff. Using a combination of experimental cellular evolution on biomaterials of controlled stiffness, genome sequencing, simulations and gene expression analysis, the team showed that cells evolve under selection pressure from biomaterials of controlled mechanical stiffness.The team's research was recently published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution.Lele said that experimental cell evolution is a good approach to better understand the mechanisms underlying cellular mechanosensing.""We are currently using experimental cellular evolution to understand how cancer cells, which have great genomic variation, respond to the altered mechanical stiffness and other mechanical properties of tumor microenvironments,"" Lele said. ""Further, the fact that cells can be evolved on biomaterials of controlled properties in vitro opens up new ways to generate engineered cells with properties optimal for those properties.""Reference: Purkayastha P, Pendyala K, Saxena AS, et al.

This mutation did not occur in Neanderthals, so the scientists believe that it affected metabolism in brain tissues and thereby strongly contributed to modern humans evolving into a separate species. The research was published in the journal eLife.The predecessors of modern humans split from their closest evolutionary relatives, Neanderthals and Denisovans, about 600,000 years ago, while the evolutionary divergence between our ancestors and those of modern chimpanzees dates as far back as 65 million years ago. Evolutionary biologists are after the particular genetic features that distinguish modern humans from their ancestors and may give a clue as to why humans are what they are.Researchers from the Skoltech Center for Neurobiology and Brain Restoration (CNBR) led by Professor Philipp Khaitovich and their colleagues from the Max Planck Institutes in Leipzig, Dresden and Cologne and the University of Denver studied metabolic differences in the brain, kidney and muscle of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques.The research supervisor was a renowned evolutionary biologist, Professor Svante P bo, who earlier on had discovered the Denisovan and led the Neanderthal Genome Project.The team looked at an interesting human mutation that leads to amino acid substitution in adenylosuccinate lyase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of purine inside DNA. This substitution reduces the enzyme s activity and stability, which results in a lower concentration of purines in the human brain. The team showed that the new mutation is typical for humans only and does not appear in other primates or Neanderthals. The researchers proved that this mutation is indeed the reason for the metabolic peculiarities in humans by introducing it into the mouse genome. The mice subjected to mutation produced fewer purines, whereas an ancestral gene, when introduced into human cells, led to apparent metabolic changes. Although a powerful tool for scientists, the decoded human genome, unfortunately, cannot account for all the phenotypic differences between humans. The study of the metabolic composition of tissues can give clues about why functional changes occur in humans. I am delighted that we have succeeded in predicting the metabolic characteristics of modern humans and validated our hypotheses on mouse and cell models, even though we did not have  live Neanderthals  to work on,  says lead author and Skoltech PhD student Vita Stepanova.Reference: Stepanova V, Moczulska KE, Vacano GN, et al.

Every year, ten million tonnes of plastic are estimated to be mismanaged, resulting in entry into the ocean, of which half will float initially. Yet, only 0.3 million tonnes of plastic can be found floating on the surface of the ocean. Where has the rest of the plastic gone?The key mechanisms for plastic transport are currents, wind, and waves. Currents and wind transport ocean debris in a straightforward manner like the forces on a sailing boat. However, ocean waves predominantly move objects in circular-like orbits. The orbits do not quite close, resulting in a so-called Stokes drift in the direction in which the waves travel. A joint team from the Universities of Oxford, Plymouth, Edinburgh, Auckland and TU Delft have investigated how waves transport floating ocean debris while including, for the first time, the effects of an object s size, buoyancy, and inertia on its transport. Their results are published today in The Journal of Fluid Mechanics. Dr Ross Calvert from the University of Oxford s Department of Engineering Science and his co-authors found that larger floating ocean debris can be transported at a rate faster than Stokes drift due to inertial effects. The Stokes drift induced by waves has been shown to be important for the movement of ocean debris towards the coast, resulting in plastic beaching, which may be where some of the unaccounted-for plastic pollution is. It has also been shown to increase plastic pollution being transported to polar regions. Very small objects will trace exactly what the water does and are thus transported with the exact Stokes drift. Dr Calvert said:  Larger objects being transported faster than smaller objects was an unintuitive result. We expected inertia to reduce the speed at which floating debris was transported in waves, analogous to wind and currents. After checking our result experimentally and numerically, we then went on to discover the mechanisms by which these inertial objects moved faster than the water around them.  After observing that larger floating plastic spheres were transported faster than smaller ones in the COAST wave flume at the University of Plymouth, the team developed a model to further investigate the result. Through this model, which included gravity, buoyancy, drag and added-mass forces in a coordinate system that rotated and translated with the wave, they found that object size relative to the wavelength was the predominant driver for a change in transport, with a secondary effect from the density of the object. Prof Ton van den Bremer at University of Oxford and TU Delft, who directed the research, said:  Although anyone walking on the beach will know waves transport floating debris towards the shore, the rate at which they do so depends on many factors existing models, which are highly simplified, ignore. Examples of such factors are whether waves break and the size of the floating debris. This research provides a theoretical underpinning for the latter.  This research is the start to understanding the mechanisms for an increase in wave-induced drift. Further study into the effect of object shape, including wave-flume and numerical testing of idealised and real ocean debris, are underway.ReferenceCalvert R et al.

The results suggest that injection of a protein, GAD, into lymph nodes can be effective in a subgroup of individuals. The results have been published in Diabetes Care.In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks the cells that produce insulin. When the insulin-producing cells have disappeared, the body can no longer regulate blood sugar level, and a person with type 1 diabetes must take exogenous insulin for the rest of his or her life.A highly topical question in research into type 1 diabetes is whether, and if so how, the attack of the immune system can be slowed or even completely stopped. One possible strategy is based on altering the immune defence by injecting a protein that the cells of the immune system react to, in a form of vaccination. One of the proteins against which the immune system often forms antibodies in type 1 diabetes is known as GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase). Professor Johnny Ludvigsson at Link ping University has studied for many years the possibility of vaccinating people who have newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes with GAD. It is hoped that the immune system will become more tolerant against the body's own GAD, and stop damaging the insulin-producing cells, such that the body can continue to form some insulin.""Studies have shown that even an extremely small production of insulin in the body is highly beneficial for patient health. People with diabetes who produce a certain amount of insulin naturally do not develop low blood sugar levels, hypoglycaemia, so easily. They have also a lower risk of developing the life-threatening condition ketoacidosis, which can arise when the insulin level is low"", says Johnny Ludvigsson, senior professor in the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at Link ping University.Johnny Ludvigsson has led DIAGNODE-2, a clinical phase 2 study in which researchers investigated the effect of GAD-alum (Diamyd) injections into the lymph nodes of 109 young people with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The natural insulin production of the participants was measured at the start of the study and again after 15 months. Several other outcome measures were also followed, such as change in long-term blood sugar levels (HbA1c), and how much supplementary insulin the patients needed to take every day.Previous studies of immunotherapy in diabetes have suggested that genetic factors play a role in how patients respond to the treatment. This led the researchers in DIAGNODE-2 to look at several variants of what are known as ""HLA genes"". These genes code for proteins located on the surface of some cells. They function as holders of proteins, and expose them to immune system cells passing by. If the protein fragment exposed in this way comes from, for example, bacteria, the immune system should form antibodies against the foreign protein. However, the immune system sometimes reacts against the body's own substances, and certain types of HLA are associated with an increased risk of type 1 diabetes. The HLA variant HLA-DR3-DQ2 exposes the GAD65 protein to cells of the immune system, and patients with this variant often form antibodies against GAD65 at an early stage of the disease. Around half of the participants in the study had the HLA-DR3-DQ2 variant.For the complete patient group, there was no difference between treatment and placebo in the degree to which insulin production was preserved. GAD-alum did, however, have a positive effect for the subgroup of patients who had the DR3-DQ2 variant of HLA genes.""The patients in the subgroup with the DR3-DQ2 type of HLA genes did not lose insulin production as quickly as the other patients. In contrast, we did not see any significant effect in the patients who did not have this HLA type"", says Johnny Ludvigsson.No undesired effects that could be related to treatment with GAD-alum were seen during the study.""Treatment with GAD-alum seems to be a promising, simple and safe way to preserve insulin production in around half of patients with type 1 diabetes, the ones who have the right type of HLA. This is why we are looking forward to carrying out larger studies, and we hope these will lead to a drug that can change the progress of type 1 diabetes"", says Johnny Ludvigsson.Reference: Ludvigsson J, Sumnik Z, Pelikanova T, et al.

The microbes, many unknown to science, occupy a one-meter-thick area overlying the Suakin Deep, an expansive 80-meter-deep brine lake, 2,771 meters below the central Red Sea. The chemical properties of this thin ""brine-seawater interface,"" along with the composition of microbial communities, change surprisingly rapidly across a sharp gradient.""Our study sheds light on how microorganisms in the Suakin Deep's brine-seawater interface make an oasis of life in the desert of the deep Red Sea,"" says microbial ecologist Daniele Daffonchio, who led the study. Daffonchio and his colleagues at KAUST, with collaborators in Germany and Spain, found that microbial cell densities are more than double in this interface than in normal deep Red Sea water and the brine below. The Suakin Deep is one of around 25 deep brine lakes in the Red Sea. Few studies have analyzed the thin brine-seawater interface above it, and none have taken into account how its properties change from top to bottom. Daffonchio's team used a sampler called a Niskin Rosette to analyze water every nine centimeters within this interface. This cylindrical apparatus holds 23 identical 90-centimeter-long 10-liter bottles, along with a detector that measures salinity, temperature and depth. The sampler was deployed by KAUST's research vessel with the bottles open until the detector signaled that the apparatus had reached the Suakin Deep's brine-seawater interface. The bottles were then filled with interface water and remotely shut, and the apparatus then returned to the ship. This way, the water column in the bottles represented most of the water column in the interface. One-liter fractions of water, each corresponding to a different depth in the actual interface, were analyzed for their chemical and microbial contents. The team found many types of microbial communities, which changed with variations in oxygen and salinity within the water column. ""Many of the microbes were new, with their closest relatives coming from hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the sea and from subsurface sediments,"" says environmental microbiologist Gr goire Michoud, the study's first author. The team sequenced the genome of a microbe they called Candidatus Scalindua arabica, which was concentrated within a 20-centimeter-layer in the middle of the brine-seawater interface. The metabolic processes conducted by this and other microbes suggest this transition zone is a critical niche for nitrogen cycling. Oceanic brine pools could be similar to extraterrestrial environments like the saline ocean that is expected to exist under the surface of Jupiter's satellite Europa. ""Knowledge of the microbial networks in extreme Earth environments could help us hypothesize how lifeforms on extraterrestrial bodies thrive and function,"" explains Daffonchio. ""These microbes could also harbor enzymes and other properties that could be useful in medical and biotechnology applications.""

Using multiple advanced techniques in immunology, genetics and biochemistry, our study found leptin directly promoted the development and function of cells which are vital in triggering an antibody response,  Professor Yu said. In collaboration with global teams, we identified the reduction of an essential metabolic hormone called leptin was associated with compromised vaccine responses in both young and older individuals. As a result, we can now identify those who are at risk of not generating an antibody response after vaccination. Professor Yu said leptin was a metabolic hormone largely produced by fat tissue. Vaccines have been known for a very long time to have a different efficacy for individuals,  he said. Although our genetics partially contribute to the difference, other factors are also essential. When we are fit and healthy, we have a much better vaccine efficacy. If we are healthy, we have a good metabolism and a normal level of leptin, but if we have malnutrition or some disease conditions, we may have a low level of leptin, which limits our vaccine response and immune protection. Professor Yu said many people with obesity and high levels of leptin conversely often had leptin resistance which could potentially lead to a poorer vaccine response   an area that should be carefully investigated in the future.The researchers are keen to test responses to the COVID-19 vaccines to determine biomarkers that could identify those people at risk of not generating a strong vaccine response. During the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the successful vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 is the major hope to bring society back to normalcy,  he said.

The findings are published in Nature Medicine.Approximately 20-30% of patients with Alzheimer's disease are wrongly diagnosed within specialist healthcare, and diagnostic work-up is even more difficult in primary care. Accuracy can be significantly improved by measuring the proteins tau and beta-amyloid via a spinal fluid sample, or PET scan. However, those methods are expensive and only available at a relatively few specialized memory clinics worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD is becoming even more important, as new drugs that slow down the progression of the disease will hopefully soon become available.A research group led by Professor Oskar Hansson at Lund University have now shown that a combination of relatively easily acccessible tests can be used for early and reliable diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The study examined 340 patients with mild memory impairment in the Swedish BioFINDER Study, and the results were confirmed in a North American study of 543 people.A combination of a simple blood test (measuring a variant of the tau protein and a risk gene for Alzheimer's) and three brief cognitive tests that only take 10 minutes to complete, predicted with over 90% certainty which patients would develop Alzheimer's dementia within four years. This simple prognostic algorithm was significantly more accurate than the clinical predictions by the dementia experts who examined the patients, but did not have access to expensive spinal fluid testing or PET scans, said Oskar Hansson.""Our algorithm is based on a blood analysis of phosphylated tau and a risk gene for Alzheimer's, combined with testing of memory and executive function. We have now developed a prototype online tool to estimate the individual risk of a person with mild memory complaints developing Alzheimer's dementia within four years"", explains Sebastian Palmqvist, first author of the study and associate professor at Lund University.One clear advantage of the algorithm is that it has been developed for use in clinics without access to advanced diagnostic instruments. In the future, the algorithm might therefore make a major difference in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's within primary healthcare.""The algorithm has currently only been tested on patients who have been examined in memory clinics. Our hope is that it will also be validated for use in primary healthcare as well as in developing countries with limited resources"", says Sebastian Palmqvist.Simple diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's could also improve the development of drugs, as it is difficult to recruit the suitable study partcipants for drug trials in a time- and cost-effective manner.""The algorithm will enable us to recruit people with Alzheimer's at an early stage, which is when new drugs have a better chance of slowing the course of the disease"", concludes Professor Oskar Hansson.Reference: Palmqvist S, Tideman P, Cullen N, et al.

Most controlled release methods encapsulate drug particles in biodegradable, bubble-like containers that dissolve over time to release the drug, making it difficult to deliver drugs on a schedule. Others involve a battery-powered device that is not biocompatible.Jin Nam, an associate professor of bioengineering in UC Riverside's Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering, runs a lab that works with biocompatible polymers to build frameworks known as scaffolds that help stem cells repair tissues and organs. One of these polymers, poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluro-ethylene), or P(VDF-TrFE), can produce an electrical charge under mechanical stress. Nam realized this property, known as piezoelectricity, made the polymer a potentially viable candidate for a drug release system.His team used a technique called electrospinning to produce P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers layered in a thin mat. Structuring the material in nanoscale by electrospinning optimized the sensitivity of the resulting nanofibers so the drug delivery system would respond to physiologically safe magnitudes of force while remaining insensitive to daily activities. The large surface area of the nanofibers allowed them to adsorb a relatively large quantity of drug molecules.After embedding the film in a hydrogel that mimics living tissue, a series of tests using therapeutic shockwaves generated enough electric charge to release an electrostatically attached model drug molecule into the surrounding gel. The researchers could tune the drug release quantity by varying the applied pressure and duration.""This piezoelectric nanofiber-based drug delivery system enables localized delivery of drug molecules on demand, which would be useful for diseases or conditions that require long-term, repeated drug administration, such as cancer treatments,"" Nam said. ""The large surface area-to-volume ratio of nanofibrous structure enables a greater drug loading, leading to a single injection or implantation that lasts longer than conventional drug delivery.""Compared to traditional drug delivery systems based on degradation or diffusion release that typically show an initial burst release followed by different rates of release, the linear profile of drug release from the piezoelectric-based system allows for the precise administration of drug molecules regardless of implantation duration. Repeated on-demand drug release tests showed a similar amount of drug release per activation, confirming the robust control of release rate.The sensitivity of the drug release kinetics can be tuned by controlling the nanofiber size to a range that is activated by therapeutic shockwaves, often used for musculoskeletal pain treatment with a handheld device. Smaller, more sensitive nanofiber sizes can be utilized for implantation in deep tissues, such as near a bone under muscles, while less sensitive larger nanofibers could find use in subcutaneous applications to avoid false activation by accidental impact.Reference: Jariwala T, Ico G, Tai Y, et al.

People who carry a certain variant of a gene that is key to this mechanism show improved jumping performance.Tendons are what connect muscles to bones. They are relatively thin but have to withstand enormous forces. Tendons need a certain elasticity to absorb high loads, such as mechanical shock, without tearing. In sports involving sprinting and jumping, however, stiff tendons are an advantage because they transmit the forces that unfold in the muscles more directly to the bones. Appropriate training helps to achieve an optimal stiffening of the tendons.Researchers from ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich, working at Balgrist University Hospital in Zurich, have now deciphered how the cells of the tendons perceive mechanical stress and how they are able to adapt the tendons to the demands of the body. Their findings have just been published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering.At the core of the newly discovered mechanism is a molecular force sensor in the tendon cells consisting of an ion channel protein. This sensor detects when the collagen fibres, that make up the tendons, shift against each other lengthwise. If such a strong shear movement occurs, the sensor allows calcium ions to flow into the tendon cells. This promotes the production of certain enzymes that link the collagen fibres together. As a result, the tendons lose elasticity and become stiffer and stronger.Gene variant overreactsInterestingly, the ion channel protein responsible for this occurs in different genetic variants in humans. A few years ago, other scientists found that a particular variant called E756del is clustered in individuals of West African ancestry. At that time, the importance of this protein for tendon stiffness was not yet known. One- third of individuals of African descent carry this gene variant, while it is rare in other populations. This gene variant protects its carriers from severe cases of the tropical disease malaria. Scientists assume that the variant was able to prevail in this population because of this advantage.The researchers led by Jess Snedeker, Professor of Orthopaedic Biomechanics at ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich, have now shown that mice carrying this gene variant have stiffer tendons. They believe that tendons  overshoot  in their adaptive response to exercise due to this variant.Major performance advantageThis also has direct effects on people s ability to jump, as the scientists showed in a study with 65 African American volunteers. Of the participants, 22 carried the E756del variant of the gene, while the remaining 43 did not. To account for various factors that influence a person s ability to jump (including physique, training, and general fitness), the researchers compared the performance during a slow and a fast jump. Tendons play only a minor role during slow jumping manoeuvres but are particularly important during fast jumps. With their study design, the scientists could isolate the effect of the gene variant on the jumping performance.This showed that carriers of variant E756del performed 13 percent better on average.  It s fascinating that a gene variant, which is positively selected due to an anti- malaria effect, at the same time is associated with better athletic abilities. We certainly did not expect to find this when we started the project,  says Fabian Passini, doctoral student in Snedeker s group and first author of the study. It may well be that this gene variant explains in part why athletes hailing from countries with a high E756del frequency excel in world- class sports competitions, including sprinting, long- jumping and basketball. To date, there has been no scientific investigation into whether this gene variant is overrepresented among elite athletes. However, such a study would be of scientific interest, Passini says.The findings about the force sensor and the mechanism by which tendons can adapt to physical demands are also important for physiotherapy.  We now have a better understanding of how tendons work. This should also help us treat tendon injuries better in future,  Snedeker says. In the medium term, it may also be possible to develop drugs that dock onto the newly discovered tendon force sensor. These could one day help to heal tendinopathies and other connective tissue disorders.Reference: Passini FS, Jaeger PK, Saab AS, et al.

Relevant results were detailed in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.SERS is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules. It's commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. In this research, using the principle of capillary suction, they constructed a nanocapillary pumping model, for the first time, with ubiquitous hot spots, leading to the first systematic study of small gaps to actively capture molecules. ""What makes this method stand out is the highly universal characteristic of it,"" said YANG, a scientist of medicine. It could be used for highly sensitive detection of almost all types of molecules, including plasticizers, organic contaminants, antitumor drugs, poisons, toxins, pesticide residues, dyes, antibiotics, explosives, and amino acids. On top of that, they successfully analyzed the changes in single A549 cells at the molecular level during photothermal stimulation with this method, which proved that it could be applied to actively capture target molecules in small gaps to study the death of a single cell resulting from photothermal stimulation. This general method has provided a new way for stimulating active transport of target molecules to optimal hot spots to achieve ultrasensitive detection and real-time monitoring of cell behavior or chemical kinetics.ReferenceGe M et al.

Trigger sounds are often the sound of someone chewing, breathing or speaking and for sufferers, usually related to mouth, throat or facial activity.Their reaction is often extreme, and tends to consist of a combination of anger, disgust, fight-or-flight response, sometimes an urge to hurt the person making the sound or to leave the situation.The condition is common affecting anywhere between 6% to 20% of people. Those with the more severe forms can find themselves unable to tolerate family, work, public or social situations.Previously, misophonia had been considered a disorder of sound processing. This new research suggests that alongside this there is an abnormal type of communication between the brains hearing centre, the auditory cortex, and the areas of the ventral pre-motor cortex that are responsible for movement of the face, mouth and throat.In response to trigger or neutral sound, scans on people with misophonia showed that the brain's auditory cortex (hearing centre) responded similarly to people without the condition, however, people with misophonia showed increased communication between the auditory cortex and the motor control areas related to the face, mouth and throat. These motor control regions were strongly activated by trigger sounds in people with misophonia in response only to their trigger sounds, but not to other sound types or in people without the condition.Dr Kumar adds: ""What surprised us was that we also found a similar pattern of communication between the visual and motor regions, which reflects that misophonia can also occur when triggered by something visual.""This lead us to believe that this communication activates something called the 'mirror system', which helps us process movements made by other individuals by activating our own brain in a similar way - as if we were making that movement ourselves.""We think that in people with misophonia involuntary overactivation of the mirror system leads to some kind of sense that sounds made by other people are intruding into their bodies, outside of their control.""Interestingly, some people with misophonia can lessen their symptoms by mimicking the action generating the trigger sound, which might indicate restoring a sense of control. Using this knowledge may help us develop new therapies for people with the condition.""Tim Griffiths, Professor of Cognitive Neurology at Newcastle University, who is a senior author on the study and also a neurologist, added: ""The study provides new ways to think about the treatment options for misophonia. Instead of focussing on sound centres in the brain, which many existing therapies do, effective therapies should consider motor areas of the brain as well.""The team will be further investigating whether this understanding can help develop more effective treatments for misophonia in future.Reference: Kumar S, Dheerendra P, Erfanian M, et al.

This transient expression technique uses Virus Like Particles (VLPs) which are mimics of the authentic virus. The capsid or protein coat of the virus is expressed by plant cells and the research team then analyses the purified material from infiltrated leaves. The research demonstrated that maturation of procapsids   immature viral structures   can occur within plant cells to yield fully functional mature capsids. This has not been observed previously in the absence of a natural infection and is a new application for the transient expression system pioneered by Professor George Lomonossoff at the John Innes Centre. Comparative cryo-EM analysis of the structures of the procapsids and mature capsids revealed the large structural rearrangements both within and between the protein subunits of the capsid that accompany maturation and create the conditions necessary for viral replication and infection. Professor George Lomonossoff said:  Most structural studies of virus particles to date have given a static picture of the particles. By isolating particles from plants that are undergoing the process of maturation, we have managed to obtain a picture of the dynamics of an essential part of a virus infection cycle.  Maturation plays a critical role for all animal and bacterial viruses studied to date and is required to produce infectious virions or particles. Though the outlines of the process have been determined for many groups of viruses, detailed mechanistic studies have not been reported. The present study, a collaboration involving scientists at the University of Leeds and colleagues in Brazil and the USA reveals details of the structures at the beginning and the end of the maturation process. What is now required is an analysis of intermediate steps to get a complete understanding of the dynamics. This will enable the research team to determine the 3-D structures of intermediates in the maturation process to create a  movie.   We have shown that maturation occurs over time within plant cells and that means we have discovered a valuable tool for studying virus maturation. We hope it will be of interest to potential collaborators and industry,  said Professor Lomonossoff.ReferenceCastells-Graells R, Ribeiro JRS, Domitrovic T, et al.

There are surprisingly high levels of mercury in the glacier meltwaters we sampled in southwest Greenland,  said Jon Hawkings, a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University and and the German Research Centre for Geosciences.  And that s leading us to look now at a whole host of other questions such as how that mercury could potentially get into the food chain.  The study was published today in Nature Geoscience. The international study began as a collaboration between Hawkings and glaciologist Jemma Wadham, a professor at the University of Bristol s Cabot Institute for the Environment. Initially, researchers sampled waters from three different rivers and two fjords next to the ice sheet to gain a better understanding of meltwater water quality from the glacier and how nutrients in these meltwaters may sustain coastal ecosystems. One of the elements they measured for was the potentially toxic element mercury, but they had no expectation that they would find such high concentrations in the water there. Typical dissolved mercury content in rivers are about 1   10 ng L-1 (the equivalent of a salt grain-sized amount of mercury in an Olympic swimming pool of water). In the glacier meltwater rivers sampled in Greenland, scientists found dissolved mercury levels in excess of 150 ng L-1, far higher than an average river. Particulate mercury carried by glacial flour (the sediment that makes glacial rivers look milky) was found in very high concentrations of more than 2000 ng L-1. With any unusual finding, the results raise more questions than answers. Researchers are unclear if the mercury levels will dissipate farther away from the ice sheet and whether this  glacier  derived mercury is making its way into the aquatic food web, where it can often concentrate further.  We didn t expect there would be anywhere near that amount of mercury in the glacial water there,  said Associate Professor of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science Rob Spencer.  Naturally, we have hypotheses as to what is leading to these high mercury concentrations, but these findings have raised a whole host of questions that we don t have the answers to yet.  Fishing is Greenland s primary industry with the country being a major exporter of cold-water shrimp, halibut and cod.  We ve learned from many years of fieldwork at these sites in Western Greenland that glaciers export nutrients to the ocean, but the discovery that they may also carry potential toxins unveils a concerning dimension to how glaciers influence water quality and downstream communities, which may alter in a warming world and highlights the need for further investigation,  Wadham said. The finding underscores the complicated reality of rapidly melting ice sheets across the globe. About 10 percent of the Earth s land surface is covered by glaciers, and these environments are undergoing rapid change as a result of rising temperatures. Scientists worldwide are working to understand how warming temperatures   and thus more rapidly melting glaciers   will affect geochemical processes critical to life on Earth.  For decades, scientists perceived glaciers as frozen blocks of water that had limited relevance to the Earth s geochemical and biological processes,  Spencer said.  But we ve shown over the past several years that line of thinking isn t true. This study continues to highlight that these ice sheets are rich with elements of relevance to life.  Hawkings also said it was worth noting that this source of mercury is very likely coming from the Earth itself, as opposed to a fossil fuel combustion or other industrial source. That may matter in how scientists and policymakers think about the management of mercury pollution in the future.  All the efforts to manage mercury thus far have come from the idea that the increasing concentrations we have been seeing across the Earth system come primarily from direct anthropogenic activity, like industry,  Hawkings said.  But mercury coming from climatically sensitive environments like glaciers could be a source that is much more difficult to manage. ReferenceHawkings JR, Linhoff BS, Wadham JL, et al.

It also demonstrates that the factor, when applied in combination with cell therapies, can eliminate tumors in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer. The findings are reported in the current issue of Nature Immunology. We ve found, for the first time, that terminally exhausted TILs can be directly rejuvenated so that their potent anti-cancer activity is restored, and that this rejuvenation is accomplished through the metabolic reprogramming of the cells induced by interleukin-10,  said Ho, associate member of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Lausanne.Deprived of oxygen and vital nutrients within tumors, the TILs most capable of killing cancer cells are typically pushed into a stubbornly sluggish state known as exhaustion. Recent research has identified two distinct types of exhausted TILs. One, known as  progenitor exhausted  TILs, can recognize cancer cells with nominal efficiency and proliferate in response to the immunotherapy PD-1 blockade. But it is their descendants,  terminally exhausted  TILs, that are best equipped to detect and destroy cancer cells. They are, however, functionally disabled, prone to self-destruction and utterly incapable of proliferation. Even PD-1 blockade cannot restore the function of these terminally exhausted TILs,  said Ho.  In fact, many patients do not respond to PD-1 blockade because their tumors lack progenitor exhausted TILs and have only terminally exhausted TILs. This is why researchers are looking for ways to revive terminally exhausted T cells for cancer therapy. Three lines of evidence prompted the current study. First, Ho and his team recently showed that terminally exhausted TILs could be functionally revived by restoring the health of their mitochondria the bean-shaped organelles in cells that generate energy and help regulate metabolism. Second, IL-10 is known to stimulate anti-cancer immune responses and has been tested as a therapy for lung cancer in an early phase clinical trial, albeit with mixed results. Finally, IL-10 was recently found to restore mitochondrial fitness and reprogram the metabolism of immune cells known as macrophages.Ho and his colleagues wondered whether IL-10 might similarly influence terminally exhausted TILs.To find out, they added an engineered, long-lived version of IL-10 (IL-10/Fc) to adoptive cell therapy (ACT) the infusion of tumor-targeting T cells to treat cancer and tested the combination in a mouse model of melanoma. The treatment boosted the number and functionality of terminally exhausted TILs and led to tumor regression and cures in 90% of treated mice, compared to limited regressions with IL-10/Fc alone and none with ACT alone. Notably, 80% of surviving mice developed an immune memory for the cancer, spontaneously rejecting the same tumors implanted two months after therapy. This suggests that if IL-10 is added to ACT, it could confer long-term protection from cancer growth,  said Ho.The researchers also tested IL-10/Fc on CAR-T cells, which are engineered to target cancer cells bearing specific molecular markers. IL-10/Fc treated CAR-T cells induced complete cures of roughly 90% of mice implanted with colon cancer tumors.Ho, Tang and colleagues found that IL-10/Fc specifically acts on terminally exhausted TILs, not on progenitor exhausted TILs. They also showed it reprograms the metabolism of terminally exhausted TILs beginning with the process they employ to extract energy from nutrients. That, in turn, leads to sweeping changes in their gene expression programs, which drives their functional re-activation and proliferation. IL-10/Fc had the same effect on human TILs, and on CAR-T cells as well. With IL-10, we reset the energy-generation program of the most exhausted soldiers of the anti-cancer immune response and revived their ability to kill tumor cells,  said Ho.The researchers are now investigating the precise mechanisms by which metabolic reprogramming alters gene expression patterns in the terminally exhausted TILs. They are also conducting preclinical studies to advance the application of their discoveries to human cancer therapy.Ping-Chih Ho is an Associate Member of the Lausanne Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and an Associate Professor at the University of Lausanne.Reference: Guo Y, Xie Y-Q, Gao M, et al.

Over extended periods of time, however, levodopa becomes less effective, and increased doses are needed. Professor David Smith, from the University of York s Department of Chemistry, said:  The current drug used for Parkinson s Disease is effective to a point, but after a long period of use the body starts to breakdown the drug before it gets to the brain where it is most needed.  This means increased dosage is necessary, and in later stages, sometimes, instead of tablets, the drug has to be injected.  Investigations into nasal sprays have long been of interest as a more effective delivery because of its direct route to the brain via the nerves that service the nose, but the challenge here is to find a way of making it adhere to the nasal tissue long enough to release a good dosage of the drug.  The researchers created a gel, loaded with levodopa, that could flow into the nose as a liquid and then rapidly change to a thin layer of gel inside the nose.  The method was tested in animal models by a team at King s College London, where levodopa was successfully released from the gel into the blood and directly to the brain.  Professor Smith said:  The results indicated that the gel gave the drug better adhesion inside the nose, which allowed for better levels of uptake into both the blood and brain.  The team are now working to incorporate these materials in nasal spray devices to progress to clinical trials in humans.  The approach may also be relevant to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s. Khuloud Al-Jamal, Professor of Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine from King s College London, said:  Not only did the gel perform better than a simple solution, but the brain uptake was better than that achieved using intravenous injection of the drug. This suggests that nasal delivery of Parkinson s drugs using this type of gel may have clinical relevance. Reference: Wang JT-W, Rodrigo AC, Patterson AK, et al.

These plastics often make their way into the ocean, affecting not only marine life and the environment but also threatening food safety and human health.Eventually, many of these plastics break down into microscopic sizes, making it hard for scientists to quantify and measure them. Researchers call these incredibly small fragments ""nanoplastics"" and ""microplastics"" because they are not visible to the naked eye. Now, in a multiorganizational effort led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), researchers are turning to a lower part of the food chain to solve this problem.The researchers have developed a novel method that uses a filter-feeding marine species to collect these tiny plastics from ocean water. The team published its findings as a proof-of-principle study in the scientific journal Microplastics and Nanoplastics.Plastics consist of synthetic materials known as polymers that are usually made from petroleum and other fossil fuels. Each year more than 300 million tons of plastics are produced, and 8 million tons end up in the ocean. The most common kinds of plastics found in marine environments are polyethylene and polypropylene. Low-density polyethylene is commonly used in plastic grocery bags or six-pack rings for soda cans. Polypropylene is commonly used in reusable food containers or bottle caps.""Sunlight and other chemical and mechanical processes cause these plastic objects to become smaller and smaller,"" said NIST researcher Vince Hackley. ""With time they change their shape and maybe even their chemistry.""While there isn't an official definition for these smaller nanoplastics, researchers generally describe them as being artificial products that the environment breaks down into microscopic pieces. They're typically the size of one millionth of a meter (one micrometer, or a micron) or smaller.These tiny plastics pose many potential hazards to the environment and food chain. ""As plastic materials degrade and become smaller, they are consumed by fish or other marine organisms like mollusks. Through that path they end up in the food system, and then in us. That's the big concern,"" said Hackley.For help in measuring nanoplastics, researchers turned to a group of marine species known as tunicates, which process large volumes of water through their bodies to get food and oxygen -- and, unintentionally, nanoplastics. What makes tunicates so useful to this project is that they can ingest nanoplastics without affecting the plastics' shapes or size.For their study, researchers chose a tunicate species known as C. robusta because ""they have a good retention efficiency for micro- and nanoparticles,"" said European Commission researcher Andrea Valsesia. The researchers obtained live specimens of the species as part of a collaboration with the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology and the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn research institute, both in Naples, Italy.The tunicates were exposed to different concentrations of polystyrene, a versatile plastic, in the form of nanosize particles. The tunicates were then harvested and then went through a chemical digestion process, which separated the nanoplastics from the organisms. However, during this stage some residual organic compounds digested by the tunicate were still mixed in with the nanoplastics, possibly interfering with the purification and analysis of the plastics.So, researchers used an additional isolation technique called asymmetrical-flow field flow fractionation (AF4) to separate the nanoplastics from the unwanted material. The separated or ""fractionated"" nanoplastics could then be collected for further analysis. ""That is one of the biggest issues in this field: the ability to find these nanoplastics and isolate and separate them from the environment they exist in,"" said Valsesia.The nanoplastic samples were then placed on a specially engineered chip, designed so that the nanoplastics formed clusters, making it easier to detect and count them in the sample. Lastly, the researchers used Raman spectroscopy, a noninvasive laser-based technique, to characterize and identify the chemical structure of the nanoplastics.The special chips provide advantages over previous methods. ""Normally, using Raman spectroscopy for identifying nanoplastics is challenging, but with the engineered chips researchers can overcome this limitation, which is an important step for potential standardization of this method,"" said Valsesia. ""The method also enables detection of the nanoplastics in the tunicate with high sensitivity because it concentrates the nanoparticles into specific locations on the chip.""The researchers hope this method can lay the foundation for future work. ""Almost everything we're doing is at the frontier. There are no widely adopted methods or measurements,"" said Hackley. ""This study on its own is not the end point. It's a model for how to do things going forward.""Among other possibilities, this approach might pave the way for using tunicates to serve as biological indicators of an ecosystem's health. ""Scientists might be able to analyze tunicates in a particular spot to look at nanoplastic pollution in that area,"" said J r mie Parot, who worked on this study while at NIST and is now at SINTEF Industry, a research institute in Norway.The NIST and JRC researchers continue to work together through a collaboration agreement and hope it will provide additional foundations for this field, such as a reference material for nanoplastics. For now, the group's multistep methodology provides a model for other scientists and laboratories to build on. ""The most important part of this collaboration was the opportunity to exchange ideas for how we can do things going forward together,"" said Hackley.Reference: Valsesia A, Parot J, Ponti J, et al.

A new study from scientists at Scripps Research, along with collaborators in Germany and the Netherlands, has revealed key details of how these escape mutations work.The scientists, whose study appears in Science, used structural biology techniques to map at high resolution how important classes of neutralizing antibodies bind to the original pandemic strain of SARS-CoV-2 and how the process is disrupted by mutations found in new variants first detected in Brazil, the United Kingdom, South Africa and India.The research also highlights that several of these mutations are clustered in one site, known as the  receptor binding site,  on the spike protein of the virus. Other sites on the receptor binding domain are unaffected. An implication of this study is that, in designing next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies, we should consider increasing the focus on other vulnerable sites on the virus that tend not to be affected by the mutations found in variants of concern,  says co-lead author Meng Yuan, PhD.Yuan is a postdoctoral research associate in the laboratory of senior author Ian Wilson, DPhil, Hansen Professor of Structural Biology and Chair of the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at Scripps Research.","Published: May 24, 2021"

Previously, we had limited understanding of how Pu was released from these  hot  particles into the environment for uptake by wildlife around Maralinga. But now, a new study published today in Scientific Reports and led by Monash University researchers warns that the particles are actually more complex and varied than previously thought. This means that the processes which slowly release Pu into the environment are also much more complex and varied.  The British detonated nine nuclear bombs and conducted hundreds of nuclear tests in outback South Australia between 1953 and 1963,  said lead study author Megan Cook, a PhD student from the Monash University School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment.  The resulting radioactive contamination and cover-up continues to haunt us.   The results of our study profoundly changes our understanding of the nature of hot particles at Maralinga   despite the fact that those were some of the best studied particles anywhere in the world,  said study co-author Associate Professor Vanessa Wong. The research team used synchrotron radiation at the Diamond Light Source near Oxford, UK to decipher the physical and chemical make-up of the particles. At Monash University they dissected some of the hot particles using a nano-sized ion beam, and further characterised the complex make-up of these particles down to the nano-size in exquisite details. The researchers demonstrated that the complexity of the hot particles arose from the cooling of polymetallic melts from thousands of degrees Celsius in the explosion cloud during their formation.  We found that the particles contained low-valence plutonium-uranium-carbon compounds that are typically highly reactive, yet, had been stabilised in the hot-particle matrix for nearly 60 years,  said corresponding author Dr Barbara Etschmann. Between 1950 and 1988 alone there were more than 230 recorded nuclear weapon accidents, including at least 10 with documented release of radioactive particles into the environment. The risks of such incidents are only increasing as international treaties such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty were cancelled.  Understanding the fate of hot particles in the unique setting of the Australian outback is critical for securing Australia in case of nuclear incidents in the region, and returning all the native land affected by the British tests to the traditional Anangu owners of the Maralinga Tjarutja lands,  said study co-author Professor Jo l Brugger.ReferenceCook, M., Etschmann, B., Ram, R. et al.

Microglia, the immune sentinels of the brain, are not only responsible for eliminating foreign invaders, but also maintaining brain homeostasis by clearing toxic waste such as the amyloid plaques.However, the role of microglia in Alzheimer's Disease and its relationship to amyloid plaque accumulation remain unclear. Now, a team of scientists from Duke-NUS Medical School and Monash University have found the gene expression signatures underlying microglia associated with amyloid plaque phagocytosis - i.e. the engulfing of deposits of the amyloid beta (A ) protein in the brain. The findings, reported in the journal Nature Communications, offer a new target for interventions that aim to address the underlying disease mechanism of this incurable disease.To investigate the differences between healthy brains and those of patients with Alzheimer's Disease at the single cell resolution, the team of scientists at Duke-NUS and Monash embarked on an ambitious project to comprehensively study gene expression changes in specific human brain cell types that are associated with progression of Alzheimer's disease. From that study, which was published in Nature Neuroscience in 2019, the team have honed in on microglia.""We sought to understand the molecular mechanisms and differences between microglia that were actively engulfing amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease and those that weren't,"" said Associate Professor Enrico Petretto from Duke-NUS's Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Programme, a co-senior author of the study.The team did this by using a stain, called methoxy-XO4, that specifically targets microglia that have engulfed amyloid plaques. They used the stain in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and then examined gene expression in the stained microglia. They investigated differences in gene expression underlying microglia's ability to ingest particles (e.g. amyloid plaque) and identified associated regulatory molecules.""Understanding this mechanism is important because now we have several new targets to go after, and in the future, these targets may open a new front against this devastating disease,"" said Professor Jose M. Polo from the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, a co-senior author of the study.The studies revealed that for microglia that have not taken up amyloid, their gene expression patterns are most similar to aged microglia, which are known to be dysfunctional and a major player in Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis. In addition, after microglia engulfed the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's Disease, they develop a characteristic gene expression pattern or signature. This change in gene expression is induced, in part, by a gene called Hif1a. The changed gene expression increases the ability of microglia to take up proteins such as amyloid, while reducing Hif1a does the reverse, highlighting the importance of Hif1a in controlling this microglia function. This regulatory role of Hif1a might also apply to the microglia function of removing damaged synapses.""It is possible that this process is initially protective,"" said Assoc Prof Petretto, ""with the microglia effectively pruning damaged synapses located near plaques."" The scientists suspect, however, that this pruning process later goes awry as the disease progresses.The team also used computational models to predict the networks of molecules involved in microglia uptake of proteins and identified potential targets to study for drug development. The widely used immunosuppressant drug rapamycin, for example, was found to block the gene Hif1a from triggering microglia to engulf amyloid plaques.""This relationship between Hif1a and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is yet to be comprehensively uncovered,"" said PhD student Gabriel Chew, who is a co-first author of the paper.

But what happens when you have harmful modifications in your genome that you don't want to pass down?Baby plants have evolved a method to wipe the slate clean and reinstall only the modifications that they need to grow and develop. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor & HHMI Investigator Rob Martienssen and his collaborators, Jean-S bastien Parent and Institut de Recherche pour le D veloppement Universit  de Montpellier scientist Daniel Grimanelli, discovered one of the genes responsible for reinstalling modifications in a baby plant's genome.A plant's genomic modifications--called epigenetic modifications--help turn off genes at the right times. Epigenetic changes accumulate with age. Martienssen explains:""If you think about a tree, the flowers that arise a hundred years after it germinated, they're obviously a long way from the original acorn, and an awful lot of epigenetic changes could happen in that period. And so, these are important resets for development so that you don't inherit this epigenetic collateral damage.""Martienssen's team discovered that after baby plants remove the epigenetic modifications, the SUVH9 protein puts back the ones they need to survive. Without SUVH9, plants develop poorly because the wrong genes turn on at the wrong time. Parent, a research scientist at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, says:""I remember this moment where we were like, 'Wow! This is not what we expected.' There was an opening for an actor that was not accounted for in the standard models, and that was the most innovative part of our story.""The SUVH9 protein uses small snippets of RNA to look for the right places to reinstall the beneficial modifications, which are on mobile genetic elements known as transposons. The SUVH9 protein adds the epigenetic modifications to them, and this ensures nearby genes are turned off at the right time. Reinstalling the beneficial modifications also stops the transposons from jumping around in the genome and disrupting other genes.The scientists think SUVH9 protein contributed to today's plant diversity. By stopping harmful transposons from disrupting genes, the protein allowed different species to evolve. Parent says:""One of the big mysteries about flowering plants is how they manage to become so diverse and to generate so many different species so quickly in evolutionary history. And, we believe that we are touching here a part of a molecular mechanism that can allow this sort of flexibility.""Reference: Parent J-S, Cahn J, Herridge RP, Grimanelli D, Martienssen RA.

Until now, easily scalable water treatment technologies that remove them efficiently and sustainably have been lacking. Scientists at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) developed a new chemical process for removing hormones. It takes advantage of the mechanisms of photocatalysis and transforms the pollutants into potentially safe oxidation products. The team reports on this in the scientific journal Applied Catalysis B: Environmental.Organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and hormones   even at nanoscale concentrations   contaminate drinking water in a way that poses significant risks to humans, animals, and the environment. In particular, the steroid hormones estrone, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone can cause biological damage in humans and wildlife. The European Union has therefore set strict minimum quality standards for safe and clean drinking water, which must also be taken into account in the development of new technologies for water treatment.  The challenge for science is to develop more sensitive methods to target the hormone molecules,  says Professor Andrea Iris Sch fer, Head of the Institute for Advanced Membrane Technology (IAMT) at KIT. The main problem is that steroid hormones are very hard to detect in water.  There is one hormone molecule for every quintillion water molecules. This is an extremely low concentration,  explains the expert.With conventional water treatment technologies, wastewater treatment plants can neither find nor remove micropollutants. Researchers at the IAMT and the KIT Institute of Microstructure Technology (IMT) are therefore working on new methods to not only detect and measure micropollutants, but also remove them. A new, photocatalytic process proves to be promising. The scientists coated a commercially available large-pore polymer membrane with Pd(II)-porphyrin, a palladium-containing, light-sensitive molecule that can absorb visible radiation. Exposure to radiation with simulated sunlight initiates a chemical process that produces so-called singlet oxygen, a highly reactive oxygen species. The singlet oxygen specifically  attacks  the hormone molecules and converts them into potentially safe oxidation products.  It is crucial that we coat the surface of each pore with the photosensitizer molecule, increasing the surface area of attack,  explains Roman Lyubimenko, a scientist at IAMT and IMT.The chemical decomposition of steroid hormones and the filtration of other micropollutants can be realized in a single module. With this process, filtering of 60 to 600 liters of water per square meter of membrane is possible in one hour. The scientists were able to reduce the concentration of estradiol, the most biologically active steroid hormone, by 98 percent from 100 to 2 nanograms per liter.  This means that we are already very close to the EU target value of one nanogram per liter,  emphasizes Sch fer. The next goal of the research team is to further optimize the photocatalytic process and transfer it to a larger scale. Open issues are to find out how much light intensity and how much porphyrin will be needed and whether the costly palladium from the platinum group of metals can be replaced by other metals.ReferenceLyubimenko R et al.

It only worked with ultrathin samples that were a few atoms thick. Anything thicker would cause the electrons to scatter in ways that could not be disentangled.Now a team, again led by David Muller, the Samuel B. Eckert Professor of Engineering, has bested its own record by a factor of two with an electron microscope pixel array detector (EMPAD) that incorporates even more sophisticated 3D reconstruction algorithms.The resolution is so fine-tuned, the only blurring that remains is the thermal jiggling of the atoms themselves.The group s paper,  Electron Ptychography Achieves Atomic-Resolution Limits Set by Lattice Vibrations,  published May 20 in Science. The paper s lead author is postdoctoral researcher Zhen Chen. This doesn t just set a new record,  Muller said.  It s reached a regime which is effectively going to be an ultimate limit for resolution. We basically can now figure out where the atoms are in a very easy way. This opens up a whole lot of new measurement possibilities of things we ve wanted to do for a very long time. It also solves a long-standing problem   undoing the multiple scattering of the beam in the sample, which Hans Bethe laid out in 1928   that has blocked us from doing this in the past. Ptychography works by scanning overlapping scattering patterns from a material sample and looking for changes in the overlapping region. We re chasing speckle patterns that look a lot like those laser-pointer patterns that cats are equally fascinated by,  Muller said.  By seeing how the pattern changes, we are able to compute the shape of the object that caused the pattern. The detector is slightly defocused, blurring the beam, in order to capture the widest range of data possible. This data is then reconstructed via complex algorithms, resulting in an ultraprecise image with picometer (one-trillionth of a meter) precision. With these new algorithms, we re now able to correct for all the blurring of our microscope to the point that the largest blurring factor we have left is the fact that the atoms themselves are wobbling, because that s what happens to atoms at finite temperature,  Muller said.  When we talk about temperature, what we re actually measuring is the average speed of how much the atoms are jiggling. The researchers could possibly top their record again by using a material that consists of heavier atoms, which wobble less, or by cooling down the sample. But even at zero temperature, atoms still have quantum fluctuations, so the improvement would not be very large.This latest form of electron ptychography will enable scientists to locate individual atoms in all three dimensions when they might be otherwise hidden using other imaging methods. Researchers will also be able to find impurity atoms in unusual configurations and image them and their vibrations, one at a time. This could be particularly helpful in imaging semiconductors, catalysts and quantum materials   including those used in quantum computing   as well as for analyzing atoms at the boundaries where materials are joined together.The imaging method could also be applied to thick biological cells or tissues, or even the synapse connections in the brain   what Muller refers to as  connectomics on demand. While the method is time-consuming and computationally demanding, it could be made more efficient with more powerful computers in conjunction with machine learning and faster detectors. We want to apply this to everything we do,  said Muller, who co-directs the Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science and co-chairs the Nanoscale Science and Microsystems Engineering (NEXT Nano) Task Force, part of Cornell s Radical Collaboration initiative.  Until now, we ve all been wearing really bad glasses. And now we actually have a really good pair. Why wouldn t you want to take off the old glasses, put on the new ones, and use them all the time?

Investigators recently examined EAA changes during and following cancer treatment, and they looked for a potential link between these changes and fatigue in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC).In the study of 133 patients with HNC, half of the patients experienced severe fatigue at some point. EAA was most prominent immediately after radiation therapy, when the average epigenetic age was accelerated by 4.9 years. Increased EAA was associated with elevated fatigue, and patients with severe fatigue experienced 3.1 years higher EAA than those with low fatigue. Also, patients with high levels of markers of inflammation exhibited approximately 5 years higher EAA, and inflammation appeared to account for most of the effects of EAA on fatigue.""Our findings add to the body of evidence suggesting that long-term toxicity and possibly increased mortality incurred from anti-cancer treatments for patients with HNC may be related to increased EAA and its association with inflammation,"" said lead author Canhua Xiao, PhD, RN, FAAN, of the Emory University School of Nursing, in Atlanta. ""Future studies could examine the vulnerabilities that may account for sustained high EAA, fatigue, and inflammation among patients.""The authors noted that interventions to reduce inflammation, including prior to cancer treatment, might benefit patients by decelerating the aging process and subsequently reducing age-related chronic health problems such as fatigue.An accompanying editorial stresses that chronic fatigue in patients receiving treatment for cancer is not just a symptom; it may also play an important role in influencing patients' health.Reference: Xiao C, Beitler JJ, Peng G, et al.

However, some bacteria have their own mechanism to thwart this attack, nullifying the deadly protein by tagging it for destruction.The findings, published online today in Cell, could lead to new antibiotics to fight bacterial infections. And insight into this cellular conflict could shed light on a number of other conditions in which this protein is involved, including asthma, Type 1 diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis, and Crohn s disease.  This is a wonderful example of an arms race between infectious bacteria and human cells,  says study leader Neal M. Alto, Ph.D., professor of microbiology at UTSW and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Previous research has shown that the protein, called gasdermin B (GSDMB), was different from other members of the mammalian gasdermin family. Related gasdermin proteins form pores in the membranes of infected cells, killing them while allowing inflammatory molecules to leak out and incite an immune response. However, GSDMB   found in humans but not in some other mammalian species, including rodents   doesn t form pores in the membranes of cultured mammalian cells, leaving its target a mystery. Using a novel screening technology, Alto and colleagues discovered that a protein toxin called IpaH7.8 from shigella flexneri, a bacterium that causes diarrheal disease, directly inhibits GSDMB. Biochemical experiments show that IpaH7.8 places a chemical tag on GSDMB that marks it for cellular destruction. To understand why shigella flexneri rids human cells of GSDMB, the researchers placed GSDMB within synthetic mammalian and bacterial cell membranes. While GSDMB left the synthetic mammalian membranes unharmed, it poked holes in the bacterial membranes. Further investigation showed that immune cells called natural killer cells stimulate this process. Alto notes that inhibiting the ability of shigella IpaH7.8 to counteract GSDMB could lead to new types of antibiotics. And because genetic variants of GSDMB have been linked to a variety of inflammatory diseases and cancer, better understanding this protein could lead to new treatments for these conditions too.ReferenceHansen J M et al.

Since the mixed DNA template must first be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), metabarcoding experiments in the field have only recently been possible thanks to battery-operated thermocyclers and other portable devices.Determining the identity of a species from small bits of DNA filtered from seawater requires the use of a Next Generation Sequencer (NGS), a machine that traditionally takes up the whole desktop counter in a laboratory and requires an electrical outlet. A novelty of the portable technology used in this study - Nanopore MinION -- is that as pieces of DNA pass through a microscopic pore in the device, differences in electrical current determine the unique code of each DNA strand.Instead of the typically large sequencing machines used to complete such a task, Ames and her team were testing a Nanopore system the size of a cellphone, powered by a laptop computer. A drop of the prepared eDNA mixture added to the portable sequencer reveals on the screen the genetic code of all the DNA passing through it in real-time.Then, DNA sequences are searched against a huge database of sequences to determined which species are represented by the eDNA collected onsite that day. Upgraded ""offline"" versions of the necessary software and pre-downloading of the reference database to the laptop meant that the whole metabarcoding process could be conducted beyond the walls of a laboratory, away from internet connection.Ames and the team detected 53 species of jellyfish including Cassiopea, the upside-down jellyfish, two venomous species of box jellyfish, many species with hydroid forms, and two species of stalked jellyfish which were previously unreported in the Florida Keys, indicating that the process could reveal species that would otherwise go unnoticed.""My hope is that one day this system is used for sting mitigation, almost like a weather forecast app that also reports 'jellyfish stings risk' at certain beaches,"" said Ames.Ames has spent much of her time conducting research in areas where jelly stings are common, and warnings about whether venomous jellies are in the area could prevent countless injuries to swimmers. Besides practical purposes in fisheries and conservation, the fact that a sample of ocean water can reveal the organisms in the vicinity is truly a marvel.Reference: Ames CL, Ohdera AH, Colston SM, et al.

Canada is the only country with universal healthcare that does not have a universal pharmacare program.A group of researchers led by St. Michael's Hospital of Unity Health Toronto recruited a total of 786 patients across nine primary care sites in Ontario who reported cost-related non-adherence to medications. Most of the study participants were recruited from St. Michael's Department of Family and Community Medicine and others were recruited from three rural sites. Participants were randomized into two groups - half received free medications via mail, the other half had their usual access to medications.Two years into the study, adherence to all appropriate prescribed medicines was 35 per cent higher in the free distribution group compared with the group that had usual access to medications. Free distribution of medication also showed to reduce healthcare costs, including hospitalization, by an average of $1,222 per patient per year.""The cost savings are substantial, but they are less important than people simply being able to afford taking lifesaving medications,"" said Dr. Nav Persaud, a scientist at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's and lead author of the study.""This is the first study of providing people with free access to a comprehensive set of medicines, and hopefully it will be the last one needed before policy changes,"" said Dr. Persaud, who is also a family physician at St. Michael's Hospital.In June 2019, the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare recommended a universal, single-payer, public pharmacare, estimating such a program would save Canada an estimated $5 billion per year. The report cited a list of medicines like the one used in the CLEAN Meds study as ""a starting point"" for determining which drugs all Canadians should have free access to.The CLEAN Meds Trial focused on 128 essential medicines, adapted from the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and removed treatments not needed in Canada. The medicines in the study included treatments for acute conditions, such as antibiotics and pain relievers, as well as chronic conditions, such as antipsychotics and HIV-AIDS medications.The paper is the final result of the CLEAN Meds Trial. Preliminary results of the trial after one year of free medication indicated improved adherence, improvements in some health outcomes, and that free distribution of essential medicines led to a 160 per cent increase in the likelihood of participants being able to make ends meet.Reference: Persaud N.

""For us, it has been very important to identify how these circuits are formed during brain development, in order to detect potential alterations that could be related to social disorders,"" says Dr. Jurado, who has led the research.To date, most of the studies to characterize the expression of oxytocin and vasopressin projections have used histological methods and in situ hybridization in brain sections that provide relevant information, but which are difficult to extrapolate to the formation of three-dimensional circuits in the brain.In addition, most previous work has focused on the rat brain, although an increasing number of studies employ the mouse as an experimental model, highlighting the need for more accurate connectivity maps for this commonly-used species in the laboratory.","Published: May 24, 2021"

Upon ELISA validation, urine IL-1 , IL-1ra, and IL-8 were able to distinguish control urine from urine drawn from various bladder cancer stages, with IL-8 being the best discriminator.These Oncotarget findings suggest that urine IL-1 , IL-1ra and IL-8 are useful indicators of bladder cancer. Urine IL-8 not only distinguishes bladder cancer from controls, it also discriminates high grade from low grade disease, and the successive clinical stages of bladder cancer.Dr. Chandra Mohan from The University of Houston said, ""Bladder cancer (BC) is the sixth most common cancer diagnosis in the United States and is over four times more common in men than women.""Urine biomarkers could potentially provide preliminary confirmation of low-grade BC before invasive procedures are performed and facilitate surveillance of BC, as reviewed.The present study implements a Luminex based screening platform with a cytokine/chemokine panel that simultaneously interrogates 16 urine biomarkers, followed by ELISA validation of 4 prospective urine biomarkers.Of the 16 proteins screened by Luminex, 12 were within the detectable range and among these, 10 urine biomarkers showed significant elevation in BC compared to the controls.ELISA validation for these 4 urine biomarkers was carried out using an independent cohort of 20 urology clinic controls and 60 BC subjects.Of these 4 proteins, IL-8 displayed the highest significance in discriminating between controls and BC patients and discriminating highly advanced stages/grades of BC from less advanced stages/grades of BC.The Mohan Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that these studies indicate that urine IL-1 , IL-1ra, and IL-8 are potential biomarkers of BC, two of which re-affirm previous reports.These studies shed additional light on the potential utility of these markers, since some of them also exhibit the ability to discriminate T1 and/or T2-T4 from Ta BC, as well as high grade from low grade BC.Looking forward, systematic studies in larger patient cohorts are warranted to establish the specific clinical contexts in which these markers may be used, including the following: for initial diagnosis of BC, for surveillance of tumor recurrence, and/or for assessing treatment response following BCG therapy or other therapeutic modalities.Finally, these newer urine biomarkers need to be compared against the performance of current yardsticks such as the Bladderchek and UroVysion FISH assay.Reference: Vanarsa K, Enan S, Patel P, et al.

Among the major pollutants, nitrogen oxide (NOx) accumulation can cause severe respiratory diseases and imbalance in the Earth's nitrogen cycle. Reducing NOx accumulation is, therefore, an issue of utmost importance.Recently, the conversion of NOx into harmless or even useful nitrogen products has emerged as a promising strategy. Particularly appealing to scientists is the reduction of NOx to hydroxylamine (NH2OH), which can be utilized as a renewable source of energy.The ""make-or-break"" step that determines the formation of hydroxylamine is the catalytic electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide (NO), which can either yield hydroxylamine or nitrous oxide (N2O), depending on the electrolyte pH and electrode potential. Studies show that for hydroxylamine formation to dominate over N2O formation, very acidic electrolytes with a pH less than 0 are required. However, such a harshly acidic environment rapidly degrades the catalyst, limiting the reaction. ""The development of a new catalyst with high activity, selectivity, and stability is the next challenge,"" says Prof. Chang Hyuck Choi from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) in Korea where he works on the catalysis of electrochemical reactions.In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Prof. Choi and his colleagues from Korea and France investigated NO reduction in the presence of a new iron-nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe-N-C) catalyst made of isolated FeNxCy moieties bonded to a carbonaceous substrate. The catalyst was chosen for its high selectivity for the NH2OH pathway as well as its resistance to extremely acidic conditions.The team performed in operando (i.e., during the reaction) spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis of the catalyst to determine its catalytic site and the pH dependence of NH2OH production.They identified the active site of the catalyst as the ferrous moieties bonded to the carbon substrate where the rate of NH2OH formation showed a peculiar increase with decreasing pH. The team attributed this peculiarity to an uncertain oxidation state of NO. Finally, they achieved efficient (71%) NH2OH production in a prototypical NO-H2 fuel cell, establishing the catalyst's practical utility. Moreover, they found that the catalyst exhibited long-term stability, showing no signs of deactivation even after operating for over 50 hours!The approach not only reduces harmful air pollutants, but also provides a useful byproduct that may find use in ushering in a renewable energy society. ""Apart from the applications of hydroxylamine in the nylon industry, it can also be used as an alternative hydrogen carrier. Thus, the new catalyst will not only help reduce the amount of NOx pollutants in our atmosphere but also lead us to a renewable energy future,"" Prof. Choi explains.We can breathe easy knowing that the team's findings take us a few steps closer to a pollution-free renewable energy society.Reference: Kim DH, Ringe S, Kim H, et al.

As the team writes in the current issue of the journal  Science Advances , they were able to achieve this effect for the first time with a laser source on a laboratory scale and thus investigate the surface of a titanium sample down to the atomic level.Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when charging and discharging a battery, take place primarily on surfaces and at interfaces. While it is very easy to study the macroscopic products of a reaction, it has so far been difficult to gain a more accurate picture of the course of chemical reactions at the atomic level. This requires measurement methods that allow observations to be made on the extremely short time scales on which chemical reactions take place.In principle, spectroscopic methods with very short laser pulses for temporal resolution are suitable for this. At the same time, the laser light must be of a very short wavelength, as physicist Tobias Helk of Friedrich Schiller University Jena explains: ""To be able to specifically investigate individual elements using core electron resonance, laser light with a wavelength of a few nanometres is required - i.e., radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) or X-ray range of the spectrum.""To observe chemical processes, it is also important to be able to study the interfaces between media and material surfaces where chemical reactions take place, adds Helk. In addition to short wavelengths and short durations, the laser pulses must also have an extremely high intensity to be able to cause non-linear effects, as they are called, which allow the measurement signal to be traced back to the interface.So far, however, there are very few methods for generating such intense laser radiation in the XUV and X-ray range. ""Until now, this has only been possible at large-scale research facilities such as the FLASH free-electron laser at DESY,"" says Prof. Christian Spielmann of the Institute of Optics and Quantum Electronics at the University of Jena.

The research was published today in Nature Computational Science.This computational tool, called SCMER (Single-Cell Manifold presERving feature selection), can help researchers sort through the noise of complex datasets to study cells that would likely not be identifiable otherwise.SCMER may be used broadly for many applications in oncology and beyond, explained senior author Ken Chen, Ph.D., associate professor of Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, including the study of minimal residual disease, drug resistance and distinct populations of immune cells.""Modern techniques can generate lots of data, but it has become harder to determine which genes or proteins actually are important in those contexts,"" Chen said. ""Small groups of cells can have important features that may play a role in drug resistance, for example, but those features may not be sufficient to distinguish them from more common cells. It's become very important in analyzing single-cell datasets to be able to detect these rare cells and their unique molecular features.""Developing methods to effectively study small or rare cell populations in cancer research is a direct response to one of the provocative questions posed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 2020, designating this an important and underexplored research area. SCMER was designed to address the issue and to enable researchers to get the most out of increasingly complex datasets.Rather than the traditional approach of sorting cells into clusters based on all data contained in a dataset, SCMER takes an unbiased look to detect the most meaningful distinguishing features that define unique groups of cells. This allows researchers not only to detect rare cell populations, but to generate a compact set of genes or proteins that can be used to detect those cells among many others. To highlight the utility of SCMER, the research team applied it to analyze several published single-cell datasets and found it compared favorably to currently available computational approaches.In a reanalysis of more than 4,500 melanoma cells, SCMER was able to distinguish the cell types present using the expression of just 75 genes. The results also pointed to a number of genes involved in tumor development and drug resistance that were not identified as meaningful in the original study.In a complex dataset of nearly 40,000 gastrointestinal immune cells, SCMER separated cells using only 250 distinct features. This analysis identified all the original cell types detected in the original study, but in many cases further defined subgroups of rare cells that were not previously identified.Finally, the research team applied SCMER to study more than 1,400 lung cancer cells taken at various points in time after drug treatment. Using just 80 genes, the tool was able to accurately distinguish cells based on treatment responses and pointed to possible novel drivers of therapeutic resistance.""Using state-of-the-art AI techniques, we have developed an efficient and user-friendly tool capable of uncovering new biological insights from rare cell populations,"" Chen said.

Researchers made the discovery after a unique study where they examined populations of great tits in nine large European cities, including Glasgow.The researchers compared the city bird genes with the genes of their relatives in the countryside. The findings, which are published today in Nature Communications, showed that it didn t matter if the great tits lived in Barcelona, Malm  or Glasgow: in order to handle an environment created by humans, the city birds all evolved in a similar way.The European research, which was led by Lund University in collaboration with researchers at the University of Glasgow, included a study of birds from Kelvingrove Park together with birds from around the forest in the University of Glasgow s SCENE (Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment) facility, located near Loch Lomond.The researchers found that different genes linked to important biological functions regulated by serotonin, including aggression and circadian rhythms, were found to have been selected and passed on from generation to generation in the city birds. In rural populations, these behaviours are also important, however, the genes that control them do not confer the same advantage as they do in an urban environment.Caroline Isaksson, Senior Lecturer at Lund University, led the study together with Dr Pablo Salm n, now a research fellow at the University of Glasgow. She said:  This indicates that these behaviours, and cognition, are very important in order to live in urban environments with a lot of stress in the form of noise pollution, light at night, air pollution and constant proximity to people. The study is the largest carried out on how urban environments affect the genome, and thus the genetic material of the animals that live there. In total, 192 great tits were examined among populations in Malm , Gothenburg, Madrid, Munich, Paris, Barcelona, Glasgow, Lisbon and Milan. For each urban population, the researchers had a control group of great tits living nearby, but in a rural environment. Blood samples have been taken from the birds and analysed genetically.Dr Pablo Salm n, from the University of Glasgow, said:  It is surprising that cities, which from an evolutionary perspective are a recent phenomenon, are already leaving their footprint in the genome of birds. The researchers analysed more than half a million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spread over the entire genome, and found that a handful of genes that had clearly changed in response to the urban environment.Great tits are common throughout Europe, and it has long been known that they are quite similar genetically. Despite this, researchers have now identified clear genetic differences between great tits in the city and great tits in the countryside.Reference: Salm n P, Jacobs A, Ahr n D, et al.

Her high genetic diversity shows that the out of Africa migration was not the great bottleneck in human development but rather this occurred during and after the most recent Ice Age. This is the finding of a new study led by Mattias Jakobsson at Uppsala University and being published in Current Biology.""She is a bit more like modern-day Europeans than the individuals in Europe 5,000 years earlier, but the difference is much less than we had thought. We can see that she is not a direct ancestor of modern Europeans, but she is a predecessor of the hunter-gathers that lived in Europe until the end of the last Ice Age,"" says Mattias Jakobsson, professor at the Department of Organismal Biology at Uppsala University and the head of the study.Very few complete genomes older than 30,000 years have been sequenced. Now that the research team can read the entire genome from Pe tera Muierii 1 (see the fact box below), they can see similarities with modern humans in Europe while also seeing that she is not a direct ancestor. In previous studies, other researchers observed that the shape of her cranium has similarities with both modern humans and Neanderthals. For this reason, they assumed that she had a greater fraction of Neanderthal ancestry than other contemporaries, making her stand out from the norm. But the genetic analysis in the current study shows that she has the same low level of Neanderthal DNA as most other individuals living in her time. Compared with the remains from some individuals who lived 5,000 years earlier, such as Pe tera Oase 1, she had only half as much Neanderthal ancestry.The spread of modern humans out of Africa about 80,000 years ago is an important period in human history and is often described as a genetic bottleneck. Populations moved out of Africa and into Asia and Europe. The effects of these migrations can be seen even today. Genetic diversity is lower in populations outside of Africa than in African. That Pe tera Muierii 1 has high genetic diversity implies that the greatest loss of genetic diversity occurred during the last Ice Age (which ended about 10,000 years ago) instead of during the out of Africa migration.""This is exciting since it teaches us more about the early population history of Europe. Pe tera Muierii 1 has much more genetic diversity than expected for Europe at this time. This shows that genetic variation outside of Africa was considerable until the last Ice Age, and that the Ice Age caused the decrease in diversity in humans outside of Africa.""The researchers were also able to follow the genetic variation in Europe over the last 35,000 years and see a clear decrease in variations during the last Ice Age. The reduced genetic diversity has previously been linked to pathogenic variants in genomes being more common among populations outside of Africa, but this is in dispute.""Access to advanced medical genomics has allowed us to study these ancient remains and even be able to look for genetic diseases. To our surprise, we did not find any differences during the last 35,000 years, even though some individuals alive during the Ice Age had low genetic diversity.Now we have accessed everything possible from these remains. Pe tera Muierii 1 is important from a cultural history perspective and will certainly remain interesting for researchers within other areas, but from a genetic perspective, all the data is now available.""Reference: Svensson E, G nther T, Hoischen A, et al.

At this point, we don t see any reasons to expect another pandemic from this virus, but I can t say that s never going to be a concern in the future,  said Anastasia Vlasova, an assistant professor in The Ohio State University College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES).She conducted the study with Gregory C. Gray, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases of the Duke University School of Medicine, and Teck-Hock Toh, a professor at SEGi University in Sarawak, Malaysia.In 2018, researchers analyzed the nasal swabs of 301 patients treated in an East Malaysian hospital for pneumonia. Eight patients, all but one of them children, were found to have been infected with the newly discovered coronavirus that the study s researchers named CCoV-HuPn-2018. All eight patients were treated and released after four to six days in the hospital, where they were given oxygen to help them breathe.In a study published today (May 20, 2021) in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, researchers describe the genetic characteristics of CCoV-HuPn-2018, suggesting it s a new coronavirus that moved from infecting dogs to infecting people.Vlasova and her colleagues plan to further study the CCoV-HuPn-2018 virus to determine how harmful it is   or could become   to people. It s unknown if the virus can be passed from person to person, or how well the human immune system can fight it off. We don t really have evidence right now that this virus can cause severe illness in adults,  Vlasova said, citing the fact that only one person in the study found to have been infected with the new coronavirus was an adult.  I cannot rule out the possibility that at some point this new coronavirus will become a prevalent human pathogen. Once a coronavirus is able to infect a human, all bets are off. Viruses change constantly. When a virus alters its genetic makeup enough to go from infecting only a certain type of animal to infecting people, a combination of factors determine how well the new virus can replicate and spread among people.For an animal coronavirus to infect people, the virus must first enter the human body and recognize something on the surface of the cells, then bind to those cells. We know this virus can do that,  Vlasova said.However, that transmission from a dog to a person may be a dead end for CCoV-HuPn-2018 if the virus does not replicate well once inside the person, or if the person s immune system fends it off, Vlasova said.Only about half of the genetic makeup of the newly discovered coronavirus is similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, Vlasova said.Although only eight patients in the study were found to have been infected with the CCoV-HuPn-2018 virus, the study s researchers say that this or highly similar viruses likely have circulated much further than that among dogs and people in Malaysia. A one-time sampling is not going to tell you with accuracy how prevalent it is,  Vlasova said.  The sampling has to be repeated and done over a period time to see how many people become infected. If confirmed through further epidemiological studies, this new coronavirus could be the eighth coronavirus shown to trigger illnesses in people. If you had mentioned this 20 years ago, that a virus that affects dogs could change to be able to infect people, many would have been skeptical,  Vlasova said.Even though this new coronavirus comes from a dog, it may not be necessary for people to change how they interact with their dogs in light of this study, Vlasova said. But I would definitely be watching a little more how much I allow my babies around dogs,  she said. Seven of the eight people hospitalized in Malaysia and found to be infected with the CCoV-HuPn-2018 virus were children, one as young as 5 1/2 months old.The CCoV-HuPn-2018 virus has different symptoms from the dog virus it came from, which caused gastrointestinal problems in dogs such as diarrhea and upset stomach. People infected with the CCoV-HuPn-2018 virus experience a respiratory illness that does not include the gastrointestinal issues. We are likely missing important animal viruses that are beginning to adapt to humans,  Gray said.  We need to conduct such virus discovery work among people with pneumonia and also among people who have intense exposure to animals so that we get early warning of a new virus which may become a future pandemic virus. The potential threat posed by the viruses of dogs or cats, which also suffer illnesses from coronaviruses, has not been studied widely, though it should be, Vlasova said. Monitoring animal viruses is a way of protecting public health, she said. We primarily put the emphasis on studying emerging disease in humans not animals,  Vlasova said.  That s a big flaw in the current approach.""Reference: Vlasova AN, Diaz A, Damtie D, et al. Novel Canine Coronavirus Isolated from a Hospitalized Pneumonia Patient, East Malaysia.

A subset of patients with tumors known as Group 3 MYC-amplified medulloblastoma have an overall survival rate of less than 25%. In these patients, the cancer-promoting MYC oncogene drives cancer cell growth by altering cancer cell metabolism. Cancer cells use energy in ways that are different from normal cells, so they are potentially vulnerable to therapies that target the abnormal metabolic pathways downstream of MYC.In the first study, published March 22 in the Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology, pediatric oncologist and senior author Eric Raabe, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, focused on the metabolism altering drug DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine). DON is a naturally occurring compound studied in adult and pediatric cancer clinical trials since the 1980s, but it was never systematically tested against MYC-driven brain tumors.Although DON was safe in children in early cancer clinical trials, it is not currently clinically available.The research team, led by Barbara Slusher, Ph.D., M.A.S., director of Johns Hopkins Drug Discovery and professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, modified DON to increase its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, creating a DON prodrug, JHU395. In a prodrug, the chemistry is changed so that the drug is activated only in cancer cells.""The promise of DON prodrugs is to develop a treatment that wouldn't hurt normal cells but could be released preferentially in brain cancer cells,"" says Raabe.In one set of experiments, investigators treated human high-MYC medulloblastoma cell lines with JHU395 and with DON. They found the prodrug effectively suppressed growth and killed the cancer cells at lower concentrations compared to DON alone.Next, mice bearing implanted human medulloblastoma tumors were treated with JHU395. The researchers found the treatment led to selective killing of the MYC-driven cancer cells, while normal brain cells were spared. Furthermore, JHU395 treatment significantly extended survival. Treated mice lived nearly twice as long as mice given placebo.""JHU395 is equally effective as DON at a lower dose because it has better penetration of the brain cancer cells,"" Raabe says. ""Coming up with a new therapy with potentially reduced side effects means we can combine drugs for better patient survival, which is what this is all about.""In a second study, published online Feb. 8 in Cancer Letters, Raabe and colleagues at three other cancer research institutions targeted the mammalian rapamycin complexes involved in cell metabolism. The protein mTOR signals cancer cells to grow, invade healthy tissue and resist therapy. Previous research showed that, in addition to high MYC expression, aggressive pediatric medulloblastoma tumors have high-level mTOR expression, pointing investigators toward mTOR inhibitors as having possible therapeutic value. A bioinformatics drug screen identified TAK228 (also known as sapanisertib), a brain-penetrating mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitor as a potentially effective agent for children, Raabe says.Researchers found that TAK228 inhibited mTORC1/2, suppressed tumor cell growth up to 75% and effectively killed MYC-driven human medulloblastoma cancer cells.Next, investigators focused on measuring the abnormal metabolism of MYC-driven medulloblastoma. In cancer, elevated glutathione is one means by which tumor cells become resistant to chemotherapy. Glutathione specifically allows cells to block the effect of chemotherapy drugs containing platinum, such as cisplatin and carboplatin. These platinum-containing drugs are some of the major components of medulloblastoma therapy. In human medulloblastoma tumors grown in mice, Raabe and colleagues found that the tumor cells have more glutathione than normal brain cells. Using the excess glutathione may be one way these cancer cells resist chemotherapy.The researchers found that the TAK228 mTOR inhibitor disrupted and decreased glutathione synthesis in cancer cells. When they treated mice that had high-MYC medulloblastoma brain tumors with a combination of TAK228 and carboplatin, the combination effectively killed tumor cells and extended survival more than either drug used alone. Mice treated with combination therapy lived nearly twice as long as control mice. Of the combination-treated mice, 20% were considered very long survivors, living nearly 80 days after the start of the experiment, while all control mice died from their tumor within 25 days.""By targeting the mTOR pathway, TAK228 overcame a key resistance mechanism that cancer cells have to traditional chemotherapy,"" Raabe says. ""These MYC-driven cancers make a lot of glutathione -- they're growing so fast they need a lot of it. TAK228 reduces the amount they can make, and that makes them vulnerable to the chemotherapy.""""This is valuable pre-clinical data for future trials in children of combination mTOR inhibitor with traditional chemotherapy, which could ultimately change outcomes for children who will be diagnosed with MYC-driven medulloblastoma,"" he adds.References: 1.

The study, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, was carried out together with researchers from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, ??the University of Barcelona, and the University of Lisbon.At present, there are two main types of pain relievers prescribed based on the severity of the pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol) are often used to treat mild pain, while opioids are used for severe pain. These, although effective, have significant addictive potential. A therapeutic window is not covered between these extremes, as there is a lack of safe and effective drugs to treat moderate chronic or neuropathic pain (such as that caused by nerve damage for people with diabetes or herpes). In this scenario, cannabis-derived drugs have an excellent opportunity to provide relief, but their therapeutic use is limited by their side effects, including problems with memory and other cognitive functions.THC produces analgesia by binding to cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. However, these receptors interact with the serotonin receptor 5HT2A, and this interaction causes memory loss when THC is present. To address this problem, the interaction between the two receptors must be avoided. That is why scientists from the Proteomics and Protein Chemistry Research Group and the Neuropharmacology-Neurophar Laboratory have designed and produced peptides that interrupt the interaction between the two receptors, so the THC can ease pain without activating the serotonin receptor.In a previous study, when researchers injected a peptide into the brains of mice, the memory problems caused by THC decreased. Based on molecular dynamics simulations and current pharmaceutical chemistry strategies, the researchers have optimized the original prototype by developing a smaller peptide with high stability, allowing oral administration while increasing its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier to access and act on brain cells.After administering mice with the peptide orally, along with an injection of THC, they assessed pain threshold and memory capacity. Mice treated with both THC and the optimized peptide obtained the benefits of THC in relieving pain and also showed better memory compared to those treated with THC alone. ""Our results suggest that the optimized peptide is an ideal candidate for reducing the cognitive side effects of pain treatment with cannabis derivatives,"" says Rafael Maldonado, Professor of Pharmacology in the Department of Experimental and Health Sciences (DCEXS) at UPF.""Given the results obtained so far, the team is motivated to advance in the development of this promising candidate discovered,"" explains David Andreu, UPF Professor of Chemistry.""The INNOValora programme will allow us to partially cover the proof-of-concept experiment in chronic pain that we need to ensure investors' participation in the project,"" says Maria Gallo, a PhD student from the Proteomics and Protein Chemistry group at the DCEXS-UPF, whose doctoral thesis recapitulates much of the project's experimental work.""We envision the use of the peptide in combination with THC as the first drug approved by the EMA / FDA for the treatment of chronic pain,"" concludes Rafael Maldonado.These results have been the basis for an international patent application that is expected to be transferred to the pharmaceutical sector once the preclinical and clinical validation experiments required by drug regulations are completed.Reference: Gallo M, Moreno E, Defaus S, et al.

This three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation is fundamental, given that it regulates gene expression. A study led by scientists at the Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona (UAB) now demonstrates using mice models that the 3D organisation of the genome is extremely dynamic during the formation of male germ cells (precursors of spermatozoa) and that alterations in this structure can affect fertility. The research, published in Nature Communications, describes the 3D genome organisation in germ cells of wild populations of house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) with chromosomal rearrangements, alterations in the genome which change the structure of chromosomes. The study represents a significant advance in research into mechanisms generating and regulating the structure and function of the genome during the formation of gametes (oocytes and sperm). Sexually-reproducing organisms produce haploid gametes (with one single set of chromosomes) through two consecutive cell divisions preceded by one only round of genome replication. During this process (called meiosis), the organisation of the genome is tightly regulated to allow for recombination, a fundamental mechanism that maintains the genetic diversity of the organism through the exchange of the progenitors  homologous chromosomes, while at the same time allowing the resulting chromosomes to be transmitted integrally, with no alterations in their structure and/or number, to the next generation. The study shows that both the dynamics of the genome organisation during the formation of gametes and the recombination is affected by the presence of chromosomal rearrangements , explains Aurora Ruiz-Herrera, Associated Professor at the Department of Cellular Biology, Physiology and Immunology and the Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine (IBB) of the UAB, and head of the research.  We detected that these chromosomal rearrangements affect chromosome folding within the nucleus of the germ cells, thus altering the pairing pattern of homologous chromosomes and meiotic recombination. These results will pave the way for new investigations into the genetic mechanisms responsible for infertility.   The results point to the importance of the three-dimensional genomic context in which the recombination takes place, where factors such as chromosomal reorganizations can shape the genomic makeup of a given species , explains Covadonga Vara, member of the research  group coordinated by Aurora Ruiz-Herrera and co-author of the paper.According to scientists, determining the mechanisms regulating the structure and function of the genome during the formation of gametes is fundamental, given that the deregulation of this process can cause disorders such as infertility and an alteration in the number of chromosomes, such as trisomy-21.Participating in this study led by the UAB (Department of Cellular Biology, Physiology and Immunology and the Department of Animal Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology) were also the research teams from the National Centre for Genomic Analysis at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CNAG-CRG), Sequentia Biotech and Cornell University (USA).Reference: Vara C, Paytuv -Gallart A, Cuartero Y, et al.

This newly described antibody has the ability to attach to the outer layer of HIV at a patch of glycans -- the chain-like structures of sugars that are on the surfaces of cells, including the outer shells of viruses. ""This represents a new form of host defense,"" said senior author Barton Haynes, M.D., director of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI). ""These new antibodies have a special shape and could be effective against a variety of pathogens. It's very exciting."" Haynes and colleagues -- including lead author Wilton Williams, Ph.D., director of the Viral Genetics Analysis Core at DHVI and co-author Priyamvada Acharya, Ph.D., director of the Division of Structural Biology at DHVI -- found the antibody during a series of studies exploring whether there might be an immune response targeted to glycans that cover the outer surface of HIV. More than 50% of the virus's outer layer is comprised of glycans. Haynes said it has long been a tempting approach to unleash anti-glycan antibodies to break down these sugar structures, triggering immune B-cell lymphocytes to produce antibodies to neutralize HIV. ""Of course, it's not that simple,"" Haynes said. Instead, HIV is cloaked in sugars that look like the host's glycans, creating a shield that makes the virus appear to be part of the host rather than a deadly pathogen. But the newly identified group of anti-glycan antibodies -- referred by the Duke team as Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) antibodies -- had gone undiscovered as a potential option. To date, there was only one report of a similar anti-glycan HIV antibody with an unusual structure that was found 24 years ago (termed 2G12). The Duke team has now isolated several FDG antibodies and found that they display a rare, never-before-seen structure that resembled 2G12. This structure enables the antibody to lock tightly onto a specific, dense patch of sugars on HIV, but not on other cellular surfaces swathed in host glycans. ""The structural and functional characteristics of these antibodies can be used to design vaccines that target this glycan patch on HIV, eliciting a B-cell response that neutralizes the virus,"" Williams said. ""These antibodies are actually much more common in blood cells than other neutralizing antibodies that target specific regions of the HIV outer layer,"" Williams said. ""That's an exciting finding, because it overcomes one of the biggest complexities associated with other types of broadly neutralizing antibodies."" Williams said the FDG antibodies also bind to a pathogenic yeast called Candida albicans, and to viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Additional studies will explore ways of harnessing the antibody and deploying it against these pathogens.ReferenceWilliams WB et al.

The dendritic cells cause aggressive, proinflammatory behavior in T cells, as now discovered by researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in collaboration with colleagues from Israeli research institutes. Blocking these dendritic cells alleviates symptoms in mice. This type of approach might also prevent the development of serious liver damage in NASH patients.Obesity is extremely widespread in the Western world, and 90 percent of those affected show signs of fatty degeneration of the liver. If they maintain an unhealthy lifestyle over a long period (high-calorie diet, sedentary lifestyle), liver cell death occurs in around a fifth of these people, resulting in inflammation of the liver, referred to as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH can lead to liver fibrosis, life-threatening liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. In addition to its well-known role in metabolism and in filtering toxins, the liver also has a strategic function as part of the immune system, acting as the primary line of defense against all microbial toxins and food contaminants that enter the body from the intestines via the portal vein. In order to perform this task, a whole army of different immune cells patrol the liver. ""We wanted to find out which immune or inflammatory cells in the liver promote NASH and the liver damage associated with it,"" explained Mathias Heikenw lder from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). DKFZ researchers have now addressed the topic in collaboration with colleagues from the Weizmann Institute of Sciences and Sheba Medical Center in Israel. To do so, they analyzed the connection between the composition of the immune cell population in the liver and the degree of NASH-related liver damage. This enabled them to identify a particular type of immune cell that promotes progression of the disease - in both mice and humans.In order to investigate the immune system in NASH, the researchers fed laboratory mice a diet lacking essential nutrients but enriched with lipids and cholesterol - comparable to our ""junk food"" - and observed the development of NASH. They studied the liver immune cells using single-cell RNA sequencing and discovered an unusually high number of a particular kind of cell, known as type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), in the liver of NASH mice. This phenomenon was not limited to mice. In tissue samples taken from patients in liver biopsies, the researchers found a correlation between the number of cDC1 cells and the extent of liver damage typical of NASH. Do the cDC1 cells actually have an effect on liver pathology? The researchers pursued two channels of investigation here. They studied genetically modified mice lacking cDC1. In addition, they blocked cDC1 in the liver using specific antibodies. In both approaches, lower cDC1 activity was associated with a decrease in liver damage. Dendritic cells normally only survive for a few days and need to be continually replaced by the immune system. The researchers discovered that the NASH-related tissue damage modulates the hematopoietic system in the bone marrow, as a result of which the cDC1 precursors divide more often and replenish the supply more readily.In a normal immune response, dendritic cells screen the organs for conspicuous immunologic features and then continue on to the neighboring lymph nodes - the command centers of the immune response - to pass on this information to the T cells. In NASH subjects, the German-Israeli team has now discovered that the cDC1 induce inflammatory and more aggressive behavior in T cells in the lymph nodes responsible for the liver, causing liver damage and leading to progression of the disease. ""It is only recently that we identified these autoaggressive T cells as being responsible for liver damage in NASH. Now we also understand what induces this harmful behavior,"" Mathias Heikenw lder remarked. Now that the cDC1 have been shown to play a key role in the progression of NASH, targeted manipulation of these cells might offer a new way of treating inflammation of the liver and its serious repercussions. ""We are increasingly recognizing that certain cells of the immune system are involved in the development of different diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Medicine is thus increasingly using ways of modulating the immune system and using drugs to push it in the right direction. This kind of approach might also work to prevent serious liver damage in NASH patients,"" Heikenw lder explained. Eran Elinav, also a senior author of the study and head of research groups at DKFZ and the Weizmann Institute, believes that it is highly probable that gut bacteria affect the immune cells in this disease: ""We now aim to find out how the gut and its bacteria influence activation of the immune cells in the liver. By doing so, we hope to be able to develop new treatment strategies.""ReferenceDeczkowska A et al. XCR1+ type 1 conventional dendritic cells drive liver pathology in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

The meeting is virtual, May 20-21 and offers the latest science on population-based health and wellness and implications for lifestyle.Ultra-processed foods (UPF) are ready-to-eat formulations of industrially formulated products, typically containing added flavors, colors, and other cosmetic additives, that have been extracted or refined from whole foods, and are typically high in salt, added sugar, and fat. These food products are inexpensive, heavily marketed, and are readily available with a long shelf life. People experiencing food insecurity, the state of not having reliable access to enough affordable, nutritious food, are more likely to eat UPF. While there is growing evidence that UPF have little nutrients and contribute to energy imbalance, few studies have examined the impact of UPF on high blood pressure, a condition that can be affected by high salt intake and disproportionately affects people from diverse racial and ethnic groups.  The increase in food insecurity over the past year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic makes this research especially timely,  says the study s lead author Carol R. Oladele, Ph.D., M.P.H., assistant professor at the Equity Research and Innovation Center of the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. Oladele explains that  people experiencing food insecurity are more likely to purchase and eat UPF because they cost less and have a longer shelf life. These foods may have become more central in the diet of population groups that were disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  For this analysis, researchers extracted data from the ongoing Reasons for Geographic and Racial Disparities in Stroke (REGARDS) study to examine the differences in UPF consumption among Black and white adults and its association with high blood pressure rates. REGARDS is a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study that enrolled more than 30,000 Black and white adults across the United States between 2003-2007. The NOVA system, the international criteria developed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, defines the level of processing in foods from 1 (minimal processing) to 4 (ultra-processed). The United Nations-recognized system was used in this analysis to categorize the level of processing for foods consumed. A total of nearly 6,000 participants (23% Black and 77% white, ages 45 and older) were included in the analysis, and researchers defined  incident hypertension  as a blood pressure reading higher than 140/90 mm Hg. (Note: the American Heart Association s 2017 hypertension guidelines define high blood pressure as  130/80 mm Hg). Researchers used food consumption data from study participants to calculate total ultra-processed calories consumed and analyzed participants in quartiles of the least to the most ultra-processed foods consumed. The analysis found: - Black adults who were in the top 25% of all participants for total ultra-processed food consumption were 55% more likely than white adults to have incident hypertension. - More Black adults (27%) compared to white adults (24%) fell within the top 25% of all participants who consumed the most ultra-processed foods. - Men and adults who had less education, lower levels of physical activity and household income below $35,000 annually were more likely to regularly consume ultra-processed foods.  We believe that these results indicate the need for lifestyle interventions to address the inequities in access to affordable, healthy food,  noted Oladele  Additionally, we suggest a reexamination of food policies to advance food justice in the U.S. ReferencePresented at the American Heart Association s Epidemiology, Prevention, Lifestyle & Cardiometabolic Health Conference 2021.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Now, a research study funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has explored the immunogenicity of this extended vaccination period, focusing on the BNT162b2 vaccine. First author Dr Helen Parry, NIHR academic clinical lecturer at the University of Birmingham, explained why this research is important for elderly people: ""It is known that immunity reduces with aging and responses to vaccination also decline with age. People of older age are also more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Therefore, it is crucial that we study the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines in this vulnerable cohort,"" she said.The study recruited a sample of 172 individuals aged 80 years and above. Ninety nine participants were allocated to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine at the standard 3-week interval between doses (median age 84 years), and 73 participants received their second vaccine 11-12 weeks after the first dose (median age 84 years). The researchers compared the spike-specific antibodies and cellular immune responses across the groups. It is important to measure both antibody and cellular responses to the vaccine as they represent two different arms of the adaptive immune response.Antibody response measurements were performed by Public Health England (PHE), whereas the cellular response measurements were performed at Oxford Immunotec. ""The technique involves stimulating blood cells overnight with Spike specific peptides and then looking to see how much IFN-gamma is released by the T cells,"" explained Parry.

One such lipoprotein, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), can transport thousands of fat molecules, such as cholesterol, per particle. High levels of LDL in the blood are clinically associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Since LDL can also carry cholesterol into smaller vessels and thus supply more distant tissues, it can increasingly block the artery lumen, which leads to atherosclerosis.","Published: May 20, 2021"

Brain regions affected by Alzheimer's are also involved in controlling eating behaviors and weight regulation.""We don't want people to think they can eat everything they want because of this lower BMI association,"" said senior study author Jasmeet Hayes, assistant professor of psychology at The Ohio State University.""We know that maintaining a healthy weight and having a healthy diet are extremely important to keeping inflammation and oxidative stress down - that's a risk factor that is modifiable, and it's something you can do to help improve your life and prevent neurodegenerative processes as much as possible,"" she said. ""If you start to notice rapid weight loss in an older individual, that could actually be a reflection of a potential neurodegenerative disease process.""The study was published online recently in the Journals of Gerontology: Series A.Previous research has found a link between obesity and negative cognitive outcomes, but in older adults closer to the age at which Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed, the results have been mixed, Hayes said. And though a variant to the gene known as APOE4 is the strongest single genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's, it explains only about 10 to 15% of overall risk, she said.Hayes has focused her research program on looking at multiple risk factors at the same time to see how they might interact to influence risk - and to identify health behaviors that may help reduce the risk.""We're trying to add more and more factors. That is my goal, to one day build a more precise and better model of the different combinations of risk factors,"" said Hayes, also an investigator in Ohio State's Chronic Brain Injury Initiative. ""Genetic risk is important, but it really explains only a small part of Alzheimer's disease, so we're really interested in looking at other factors that we can control.""For this study, the research team obtained data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, compiling a sample of 104 people for whom BMI and polygenic risk scores were available. Fifty-two individuals whose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) had progressed to Alzheimer's in 24 months were matched against demographically similar people whose MCI diagnosis did not change over two years. Their average age was 73.Statistical analysis showed that individuals with mild cognitive impairment who had both a lower BMI and higher genetic risk for Alzheimer's were more likely to progress to Alzheimer's disease within 24 months compared to people with a higher BMI.""We think there's interaction between the genetics and lower BMI, and having both of these risk factors causes more degeneration in certain brain regions to increase the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease,"" said Jena Moody, a graduate student in psychology at Ohio State and first author of the paper.The effect of the BMI-genetic risk interaction was significant even after taking into account the presence of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the patients' cerebrospinal fluid - the core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.The relationship between low BMI and high genetic risk and progression to Alzheimer's was stronger in males than in females, but a larger sample size and additional biological data would be needed to expand on that finding, the researchers said.Because brain changes can begin long before cognitive symptoms surface, a better understanding of the multiple risk factors for Alzheimer's could open the door to better prevention options, Moody said.""If you can identify people at higher risk before symptoms manifest, you could implement interventions and prevention techniques to either slow or prevent that progression from happening altogether,"" she said.To date, scientists have suggested preventive steps include maintaining a healthy weight and diet and participating in activities that reduce inflammation and promote neurofunctioning, such as exercise and mentally stimulating activities.""We're finding again and again how important inflammation is in the process,"" Hayes said. ""Especially in midlife, trying to keep that inflammation down is such an important aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing accelerated aging.""Reference: Moody JN, Valerio KE, Hasselbach AN, et al.

However, in healthy people, these responses are prevented by a process known as immune tolerance. Many complex biological mechanisms maintain the necessary balance between immune activation and suppression to ensure immune tolerance does not prevent the body from effectively fighting pathogens.In a new study published in PNAS, a group of researchers from the University of Tsukuba uncovered how the relationship between two receptors called DNAM-1 and TIGIT helps preserve the balance for optimal immune function. Both of these molecules have previously been studied in a subset of immune cells called regulatory T cells, or Tregs.Tregs are crucial mediators of immune tolerance and autoimmunity prevention. Treg activity is typically inhibited during inflammatory reactions to infection to allow the body to efficiently fight and clear the invader. However, the molecular mechanisms that control this balance in Treg behavior are not fully understood. When a specific activating molecule (CD155) binds to the receptors DNAM-1 and TIGIT, they trigger signals that tell the T cells how to behave and what functions to perform.The Tsukuba team found that DNAM-1 and TGIT compete for CD155 under inflammatory conditions. When CD155 binds to DNAM-1, this receptor sends messages that tell the immune system to wake up and activate. However, when CD155 binds to TIGIT, this receptor acts the opposite way and suppresses the immune system, thereby telling the T cells to stop activating.To investigate the molecular interplay between DNAM-1 and TIGIT, the researchers studied mice (an acute graft-versus-host disease mouse model) infused with either Tregs lacking DNAM-1 or normal Tregs. ""We found that the absence of DNAM-1 resulted in enhanced TIGIT-mediated signaling. This shift in balance occurs because more CD155 is available to bind to TIGIT when DNAM-1 is not present. This help the Tregs maintain immune suppression during periods of inflammation,"" explains Professor Kazuko Shibuya, senior author of the study. ""We observed similar dynamics in a humanized mouse model, supporting the relevance of these findings to humans."" In short, this mechanism helps tell the Tregs to not block the immune system when a true danger is lurking.Given that Tregs play an important role in autoimmune diseases, the results suggest that the balance between DNAM-1 and TIGIT may be improperly regulated in individuals suffering from autoimmunity. This potential disease mechanism will be the focus of future research. These findings in mice suggest DNAM-1 could be used as a novel molecular target for treating autoimmune diseases.Reference: Sato K, Yamashita-Kanemaru Y, Abe F, et al.

But the scientists conducting the newer research now say that result was most likely caused by genetic artifacts in the testing.Majid Kazemian, a Purdue University assistant professor of biochemistry and computer science and one of the three co-lead authors on the research study, said that this finding has two important implications.""Relatively little is known about why some individuals persistently test positive for the virus even long after clearing the infection. This is important because it s not clear whether such individuals have been re-infected or whether they continue to be infectious to others. So-called 'human genome invasion' by SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested as an explanation for this observation, but our data do not support this case.""If the virus was able to integrate its genetic material into the human genome, that could have meant that any other mRNA could do the same. But because we have shown that this is not supported by current data, this should allay any concerns about the safety of mRNA vaccines, he said.""It is possible for the genetic material of some viruses to be incorporated into the DNA of humans and other animals, resulting in what scientists call ""chimeric events."" Human DNA contains approximately 100,000 pieces of DNA from viruses that our species have accumulated over millions of years of evolution. In total, this lost-and-found DNA from viruses makes up a bit less than 10% of the genetic material in our cells.Recent scientific journal articles have claimed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can also cause these chimeric events. Even before this new research team conducted experiments showing this was not the case, the researchers suspected it was unlikely, said Dr. Ben Afzali, an Earl Stadtman Investigator of the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and a co-lead author on the study.""While an earlier study suggested that, in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, genetic material from the virus copied and pasted itself into human DNA, our group thought this seemed unlikely,  Afzali said.  SARS-CoV-2, like HIV, has its genetic material in the form of RNA but, unlike HIV, does not have the machinery to convert the RNA into DNA. SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to paste itself into the genome and coronaviruses, in general, does not go near human DNA. As our study shows, we find it highly improbable that SARS-CoV-2 could integrate into the human genome. Christiane Wobus, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, also a co-lead author on the study, said that although the collective understanding of RNA viruses is that integration of SARS-CoV-2 into the human genome would be very unlikely, it was important to examine the question.""Unexpected findings in science   when confirmed independently   lead to paradigm shifts and propel fields forward. Therefore, it is good to be open-minded and examine unexpected results carefully, which I believe we did in our study,"" she said. ""However, we did not find conclusive evidence for SARS-CoV-2 integration, but instead showed that during the RNA sequencing methodology, chimeras are produced at a very low level as an artifact of the laboratory technique.""To examine the proposed integration event, the researchers developed a novel technique in which they extracted the genetic material from infected cells and then amplified or reproduced the genetic material 30-fold. If there were chimeric events in the host cell DNA, these bits of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 should also increase 30 times. The data did not show this.""We found the frequency of host-virus chimeric events was, in fact, not greater than background noise,"" Kazemian said. ""When we enriched the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the bulk RNA of infected cells, we found that the chimeric events are, in all likelihood, artifacts. Our work does not support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 fuses or integrates into human genomes.""This research was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant R35GM138283 and in part by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, project number ZIA/DK075149, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, project number ZIA/AI001175.Reference: Yan B, Chakravorty S, Mirabelli C, et al.

It demonstrates that many variables, not just dietary habits, influence the selection of dog food,  said study lead author Sydney Banton, a master s student in U of G s Department of Animal Biosciences. The international Pet Food Consumer Habit Survey is the first of its kind to examine factors involved in pet owners choosing grain-free dog food in both Europe and North America. It has just been published in PLOS One. The study found dog owners who are on gluten-free, organic or grain-free diets are likely to look for the same characteristics in the dry dog food they purchase. Feeding their dog grain-free pet food was common among pet owners who prefer  premium  food, avoid grains or processed foods, follow vegetarian, vegan or ketogenic diets, or have strict diet routines.  Grain-free brands make up more than 40 per cent of dry dog foods available in the U.S.,  said Banton, who co-authored the study with pet nutrition and pet food expert Dr. Anna Kate Shoveller, Animal Biosciences, with help from Dr. Mike von Massow, Department of Food, Agricultural and Resource Economics.  We wanted to identify the variables that predict why dog owners choose grain-free food for their pet.  The research was supported through an agreement between the University and Montreal-based Rolf C. Hagen Group, the world s largest privately owned, multinational pet products manufacturer and distributor. Researchers surveyed 3,300 pet owners from Canada, the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K. Participants were asked where they get their information about dog food, where they buy it and the most important factors in their choices. Just over 21 per cent said they look for  no grain  as an attribute that influences their purchase. Dog owners in Germany showed the highest preference for grain-free dog food at 30 per cent, followed by 27 per cent in the U.S., 22 per cent in Canada and eight per cent in France. Shoveller said the pet food industry is highly influenced by human trends and what pet owners believe about nutrition. Researchers focused on pet food innovations for dogs and cats must consider consumer trends and try to supply the best food formulations for consumers  beliefs, she said.  We felt to best understand the risks associated with feeding a pet food formula without grains and with legumes, we should understand the consumers that chose that food and whether they do anything else that may put their dogs at risk for secondary metabolic disorders, such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).  A warning was issued in 2018 by the United States Food and Drug Administration indicating grain-free dog food may be linked to the occurrence of secondary DCM. The agency continues to investigate the possible link between DCM and grain-free dog food in dogs not believed to be genetically prone to its occurrence. While some pet owners feed their dogs diets similar to their own, Banton said it is unclear why vegetarian or vegan pet owners would choose grain-free for their dog. While most European and North American food-based dietary guidelines recommend consuming whole grains as part of a healthy diet, grains are perceived as unhealthy for dogs by many pet owners, said Banton.  This is happening despite there being no scientific evidence that grains are detrimental to the health of dogs. Marketing strategies in the pet industry may be influencing these attitudes.  Research can provide a lot of scientific evidence for the development of pet foods, but it comes down to what the consumer decides, said Shoveller.  They are the one making the choice at the pet store,  she said.  If we can understand fully how they make decisions, we are better able bridge the gap in knowledge and assist them to make the right choices.

Now the rest of the scientific world can share in his confusion. The San Francisco State University associate professor of Biology s most recent research, published earlier this month in one of the scientific world s most prestigious journals, catalogues a strange and confounding system of genes in a tiny rodent that scientists have ignored for decades. This is basically the weirdest sex chromosome system known to science,  Roy said.  Nobody ordered this.  But he s serving it anyway.The owner of those chromosomes is the creeping vole, a burrowing rodent native to the Pacific Northwest. Scientists have known since the  60s that the species had some odd genes: Their number of X and Y chromosomes (bundles of DNA that play a large role in determining sex) is off from what s expected in male and female mammals.That finding caught Roy s eye when presented by a guest speaker at a San Francisco State seminar, and he realized that modern technology might be able to shed new light on the mysteries hiding in the voles  DNA. After working with collaborators to disentangle the voles  genetic history   resulting in one of the most completely sequenced mammal genomes that exists, according to Roy   the story only got stranger.The team found that the X and Y chromosomes had fused somewhere in the rodents  past, and that the X chromosome in males started looking and acting like a Y chromosome. The numbers of X chromosomes in male and female voles changed too, along with smaller pieces of DNA getting swapped between them. The researchers published their results in Science.Drastic genetic changes like these are exceptionally rare: The way genes determine sex in mammals has stayed mostly the same for about 180 million years, Roy explains.  Mammals, with few exceptions, are kind of boring,  he said.  Previously we would have thought something like this is impossible. So how did the genes of this unassuming rodent end up so jumbled? It s not an easy question to answer, especially since evolution is bound to produce some strangeness simply by chance. Roy, however, is determined to figure out the  why.  He suspects that what the team found in the vole s genome is something like the aftermath of an evolutionary battle for dominance between the X and Y chromosome.The research couldn t have happened, Roy says, without collaborations with Oregon fish and wildlife biologists who had a creeping vole sample sitting in a lab freezer. He also teamed up with a group from Oklahoma State University when the two groups started chatting about creeping vole DNA sequences that were posted on the internet   and both realized they were working on the same question.Another key was working at a teaching-focused institution. Roy says he has the time to develop ideas with colleagues and students at SF State, and he can do research where he doesn t quite know what he ll find.  This is a great example of non-hypothesis-based biology,  Roy explained.  The hypothesis was,  This system is interesting. I bet if you looked into it some more, there d be other interesting things. It won t be the last time Roy s lab goes out on a limb. He and his collaborators plan to look into the genomes of other species related to the voles to chart the evolutionary path that led to this strange system. He ll also continue DNA sequencing curiosities across the tree of life. These bizarre systems give us a handhold to start to understand why the more common systems are the way they are and why our biology works as it does,  he explained. By delving into the weirdest that nature has to offer, maybe we can come to understand ourselves better, too.Reference: Couger MB, Roy SW, Anderson N, et al.

Their study of close to 400 respiratory samples from patients with bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition, has shown that microbes in the body exist as a network, and that an infection's severity could be a result of interactions between these microbes. Through statistical modelling of data from these respiratory samples, the scientists found that flare-ups of coughs and breathlessness (known as exacerbations) occurred more often when there were 'negative interactions' between communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi in the airways. A negative interaction occurs when the microbes compete rather than cooperate with one another. These findings, published in one of the world's leading scientific journals Nature Medicine in April, bring the scientists one step closer to developing a new way of tackling infections, by targeting microbial interactions rather than the specific microbes. Assistant Professor Sanjay Haresh Chotirmall from the NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, who led the study, said: ""Our current understanding of infections is that they occur when harmful microbes enter our bodies. This model of understanding, however, fails to account for resident microbes or explain why some patients with infection respond to antibiotics to which the microbe is resistant in laboratory testing. We are therefore proposing that microbes exist as networks, where interactions happen and that the resistant antibiotic in this case targets another microbe with which the culprit is interacting. We therefore can potentially improve clinical outcomes by breaking such crosstalk. ""The findings of our study are the first steps in providing a more holistic view of how infections occur. While our study looked at patients with bronchiectasis, we believe this concept applies to all forms of infection - whether skin, lung, or a gastrointestinal infection. This way of looking at infections potentially changes our understanding of infection and may offer fresh ways of treating them."" Associate Professor John Abisheganaden, co-author of the study and Head of Department of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said: ""By applying an integrated and holistic method, this study provides a new and fresh approach to our understanding of respiratory infection. Applying this precision-medicine approach can help the managing physician better understand and choose the most appropriate antibiotic or other therapy to confer clinical benefit - in short, to guide us to the right treatment at the right time, and for the best outcome.""For their study, the scientists looked at patients with bronchiectasis, a disease of high Asian prevalence, where airways dilate irreversibly and, where infection promotes progression. Targeting bacteria with antibiotics reduces bacterial load and accompanying inflammation, which in turn alleviates symptoms and improves clinical outcomes. To investigate interactions between microbes in the airways of patients with bronchiectasis, the team collected respiratory (sputum) samples from 383 patients from Singapore, Malaysia, Italy, and Scotland, including samples before, during and after bronchiectasis flare-ups. After analysing the genetic material from bacteria, fungi and viruses in the samples, the scientists assessed for possible microbial interactions and found that patients with frequent flare-ups had more negative interactions, where microbes compete rather than cooperate, and that the number of such negative interactions increased even further during a flare-up. While changes to interactions between microbes during flare-ups was detected, there was surprisingly minimal change to the type and quantity of microbes present during a flare-up, and even after antibiotics were administered.The scientists believe that these findings suggest that microbial interactions potentially drive frequent flare-ups in patients. Using these findings, the scientists have developed an online tool to help other researchers and physicians analyse microbial interactions in their own patient samples through the microbes' genetic sequences. Asst Prof Chotirmall, who is also NTU Provost's Chair in Molecular Medicine, said: ""We are proposing a fresh way to view infection, as networks rather than individual microbes. Targeting microbial interactions within an established network may promote more judicious antibiotic use and help curb rising antimicrobial resistance."" The team is currently exploring the use of probiotics to treat bronchiectasis by regulating microbiomes within the air passages.ReferenceMac Aog in M, Narayana JK, Tiew PY, et al.

Their findings, published in Cell Reports, could serve as a guidepost for developing new therapies to prevent the onset of this devastating neurological disease.Among his many contributions to research on AD, Rudolph Tanzi, PhD, vice chair of Neurology and co-director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at MGH, led a team in 1986 that discovered the first Alzheimer's disease gene, known as APP, which provides instructions for making amyloid protein precursor (APP). When this protein is cut (or cleaved) by enzymes--first, beta secretase, followed by gamma secretase--the byproduct is amyloid beta (sometimes shortened to Abeta). Large deposits of amyloid beta are believed to cause neurological destruction that results in AD. Amyloid beta formed in the brain's axons and nerve endings causes the worst damage in AD by impairing communication between nerve cells (or neurons) in the brain. Researchers around the world have worked intensely to find ways to block the formation of amyloid beta by preventing cleavage by beta secretase and gamma secretase. However, these approaches have been hampered by safety issues.Despite years of research, a major mystery has remained. ""We knew that Abeta is made in the axons of the brain's nerve cells, but we didn't know how,"" says Tanzi. He and his colleagues probed the question by studying the brains of mice, as well as with a research tool known as Alzheimer's in a dish, a three-dimensional cell culture model of the disease created in 2014 by Tanzi and a colleague, Doo Yeon Kim, PhD. Earlier, in 2013, several other MGH researchers, including neurobiologist Dora Kovacs, PhD (who is married to Tanzi), and Raja Bhattacharyya, PhD, a member of Tanzi's lab, showed that a form of APP that has undergone a process called palmitoylation (palAPP) gives rise to amyloid beta. That study indicated that, within the neuron, palAPP is transported in a fatty vesicle (or sac) known as a lipid raft. But there are many forms of lipid rafts. ""So the question was, Which lipid rafts? And which ones are most relevant to the neuronal processes making up the neural networks of the brain?"" says Tanzi.The new investigation revealed that palAPP is stabilized and prepared for cleavage by beta secretase in special lipid rafts within the neuron known as mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). ""We showed for the first time not only that the MAM is where palAPP is processed by beta secretase to make Abeta, but that this happens exclusively in axons and neuronal processes where Abeta does most of its damage,"" says Bhattacharyya, lead author of the Cell Reports paper. This role for MAMs was previously unknown, though earlier research indicated that they are increased in number and activity in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.Next, the MGH team wanted to learn what happens when MAM levels and activity were intentionally altered. They showed for the first time that preventing assembly of MAMs, either with gene therapy or a drug that blocked a key protein called the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), dramatically decreased beta secretase cleavage of palAPP in axons and lowered Abeta production. Conversely, a drug that activated S1R triggered an increase in beta secretase cleavage of palAPP and increased production of amyloid beta in axons.""Our results suggest that the sigma-1 receptor might be a viable therapeutic target for reducing Abeta production, specifically in axons,"" says Tanzi. The study also lends support for a strategy already under investigation by Tanzi and his team, which is developing an experimental treatment that inhibits the palmitoylation of APP, the process that produces palAPP. It's also known that another class of drugs that Kovacs is studying for preventing formation of amyloid beta, called ACAT inhibitors, works directly in MAMs. In the future, these and other interventions that thwart production of this most dangerous pool of axonal amyloid beta could be used in concert with early detection (through blood or imaging tests) to stop or slow the progression of AD.Reference: Bhattacharyya R, Black SE, Lotlikar MS, et al.

Now, a new study in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology indicates that in China, indoor air pollution from residential coal burning causes a disproportionate number of premature deaths from exposure to tiny, inhalable pollutants known as PM2.5.In China, coal is still the largest source of energy, although recent mitigation actions have replaced some coal-fired power plants with petroleum- or natural gas-powered plants. Also, many coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers have installed equipment that reduces emissions. However, some households continue to use coal for heating and cooking, especially in rural areas, and the health impacts of this indoor PM2.5 exposure compared with other forms of indoor and outdoor exposure are largely unknown. Therefore, Shu Tao and colleagues wanted to quantify health risks of exposure to indoor and outdoor PM2.5 from coal used in the power, industrial and residential sectors in China from 1974 to 2014. The researchers compiled data on coal consumption by power plants, industry, and rural and urban residences over the 40-year period. Using atmospheric chemical transport and statistical models, they calculated outdoor and indoor PM2.5 levels. Then, the team used exposure response functions   mathematical relationships that calculate health effects resulting from specific exposures   to estimate premature deaths caused by five diseases associated with PM2.5, including lung cancer and heart disease. From 1974 to 2014, the contribution of indoor residential coal use to overall PM2.5 exposure decreased in urban populations but remained steady in rural populations. The researchers calculated that in 2014, residential coal accounted for 2.9% of total energy use in China but 34% of premature deaths associated with PM2.5. The number of premature deaths caused by unit coal consumption in the residential sector was 40 times higher than that in the power and industrial sectors. These results indicate that efforts to reduce residential coal use should be a key focus of future air pollution mitigation actions in China, the researchers say.ReferenceYun X et al.

Adiponectin, as a protein hormone and adipokine, regulates glucose levels and improve lipid metabolism, and is a major player in the pathogenesis of obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Obese patients have low adiponectin levels, a condition known as hypoadiponectinemia, which contributes to increase risks of cardiovascular, metabolic diseases as well as aggressive development of malignancies with poor prognoses. Adiponectin supplementation is a long-sought-after strategy for the prevention and treatment of cancer and metabolic diseases, especially in obese patients. However, the adiponectin application in therapy has been hampered by the difficult production of human adiponectin.The teams have been working on the development of synthetic compounds which can mimic the bioactivity of adiponectin over the past seven years. Finally, they developed an efficient synthetic approach to produce the adiponectin-derived glycopeptides that exhibit potent anti-tumour, insulin-sensitising and metabolic activities in various mouse models. The products hold greater potentials for clinical application in obesity and related medical complications, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease and cancer.Professor Li and Professor Wang believe that this finding opens the door to explore the opportunity of using the synthetic glycopeptide as a potential adiponectin downsized mimic supplementary in clinical treatment. The apparent advantage of these synthetic glycopeptides is that they can be readily produced by chemical process. The two teams are continuing to apply for research grants which can support them to further evaluate the potential of these agents in preclinical studies for drug development.Reference: Wu H, Zhang Y, Li Y, Xu J, Wang Y, Li X.

The results contribute to a better understanding of the disease. The study has recently been published in the leading journal ""Gut"".The most prevalent form of pancreatic cancer, Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC) is usually divided into two subtypes, a classical subtype and a basal subtype. The latter is highly aggressive and tends towards early metastasis. One of the distinguishing features between the two subtypes is that the classical subtype exhibits the protein GATA6. This is no longer present in the basal subtype, while the protein DeltaNp63 can be detected in this type.The study team led by Paola Martinelli, who, at the time of the study, was research group leader at the Institute of Cancer Research and member of the Comprehensive Cancer Center of MedUni Vienna and Vienna General Hospital, found that the switch-over of the cancer cells from the classical to the basal type occurs in two stages: first of all, GATA6 is lost but this is not yet sufficient for the expression of DeltaNp63. Only after the concomitant loss of two additional proteins, transcription factors HNF1A and HNF4A, does DeltaNp63 emerge and the tumour switch to the aggressive form.Martinelli comments: ""This suggests that reinstating the classical subtype could serve to reduce metastasis. Moreover, the tumour would once again be easier for the immune system to detect, since GATA6 not only hinders the ability of tumours to adapt to their surroundings but also blocks the mechanisms that hide tumours from the immune system.""Reference: Kloesch B, Ionasz V, Paliwal S, et al. 3A GATA6-centred gene regulatory network involving HNFs and  Np63 controls plasticity and immune escape in pancreatic cancer.

Data from 20 randomized controlled trials, which included a total of almost 12,000 patients, were analyzed in the study.Dual-drug inhalers used to treat asthma typically contain an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to reduce inflammation, as well as a long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) that acts as a bronchodilator. High-certainty evidence showed that the inclusion of a third drug to ICS-LABA combination therapy, known as a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), reduced severe asthma exacerbations and slightly improved asthma control without an increase in adverse events. Previously, the benefits and harms of adding a LAMA to ICS-LABA therapy for asthma treatment were unclear and based off of only 1300 patients   mainly adults   leading to weak recommendations in treatment guidelines. Our findings provide clear, high-quality evidence on the benefits and harms of triple therapy that will inform asthma care and should prompt revision of current asthma guidelines,  said Derek Chu, lead author of the study.Chu is a clinical scholar in the Departments of Medicine and Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact (HEI) at McMaster University and an affiliate of The Research Institute of St. Joe s Hamilton. If we can reach optimal control of patients  asthma and reduce asthma exacerbation rates through the LAMA add-on therapy, patients may be able to avoid other treatments that carry a higher risk of adverse events, such as oral corticosteroids, or therapies that are substantially more expensive, such as biologics,  said Lisa Kim, a clinical scholar in the Department of Medicine at McMaster and co-author of the study.Inhaled LAMAs are currently available in separate inhalers or as three-in-one inhalers that also contain an ICS and LABA. According to the study, both approaches to administering the third drug work similarly.More than 8 percent of Canadians over the age of 12 have been diagnosed with asthma, making it the most common chronic condition among children. The disease is characterized by constriction of the bronchial tubes, which impedes air flow to and from the lungs.

Prof. Furuichi and his colleagues have previously worked on developing mouse models of autism to unravel the condition's neurochemical mechanisms, and in a paper recently published in the prestigious Journal of Neuroscience, they provide evidence that a genetic mutation associated with autism can impair the release of a peptide called oxytocin that plays an important role in regulating social behavior. This finding promises to broaden our understanding of the neurobiology of social behavior.The gene that Prof. Furuichi's team chose to study is Caps2, which encodes a protein called Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CAPS2) that regulates the release of brain chemicals (or ""neurotransmitters""). Previous studies have shown that CAPS2 deficiencies in mice cause behavioral impairments such as reduced sociality, increased anxiety, and disrupted circadian rhythms. Furthermore, a study of Japanese patients with autism spectrum disorder revealed that some of them had Caps2 mutations that adversely affect the CAPS2 protein's functions. Prof. Furuichi and his colleagues had previously discovered that the CAPS2 protein is expressed in neurons in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that release the neuropeptide oxytocin. This information formed the basis of their recent study. As Prof. Furuichi explains, ""We hypothesized that CAPS2 deficiencies in mice should alter oxytocin release, which should in turn result in impaired social behavior.""To test this hypothesis, researchers Shuhei Fujima, Graduate Student at Tokyo University of Science; Yoshitake Sano, Junior Associate Professor at Tokyo University of Science; Yo Shinoda, Associate Professor at Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences; Tetsushi Sadakata, Associate Professor in Gunma University; Manabu Abe, Associate Professor at Niigata University; and Kenji Sakimura, a Fellow of Niigata University, among others, led by Prof. Furuichi conducted a series of experiments involving mice that carried genetic alterations that prevented them from expressing the CAPS2 protein. These mice had lower-than-normal oxytocin levels in their blood but higher-than-normal oxytocin levels in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The researchers interpreted this finding as evidence that CAPS2 deficiencies impede the normal release of oxytocin from these brain regions into the bloodstream.Unsurprisingly, the reduced bloodstream levels of oxytocin had clear behavioral effects. When placed inside a rectangular box, the oxytocin neuron-specific CAPS2-deficient mice were unwilling to spend much time in the center of the box, and the researchers interpreted this as evidence of increased anxiety about the risk of a predator attacking them. The CAPS2-deficient mice also exhibited diminished willingness to engage in social interactions when introduced to unfamiliar mice. Interestingly, spraying an oxytocin solution into the noses of the CAPS2-deficient mice acted to restore their willingness to socially interact with unfamiliar mice.Based on these findings, Prof. Furuichi and his colleagues conclude that the CAPS2 protein plays a critical role in facilitating the release of peripheral oxytocin into the bloodstream. They similarly suggest that CAPS2 is also involved in the release of central oxytocin into the brain regions relating to the control of sociality. Given the key role that oxytocin plays in regulating social behaviors, this could help to explain how mutations in the Caps2 gene could lead to atypical patterns of social behavior in persons with autism spectrum disorder. When asked about the social significance of his team's work, Prof. Furuichi remarks, ""We believe that this research, although basic, is an important achievement that will contribute to the development of tools for the early molecular diagnosis and effective treatment of autism spectrum disorder.""Given the relatively high prevalence of autism and how extremely disabling severe cases can be, the development of effective treatments would have major benefits for people with autism and the society as a whole.Reference: Fujima S, Yamaga R, Minami H, et al.

Symptoms vary widely, and can include high mood (mania), depression, confusion, hallucinations and delusions.Although the disorder affects only one in every 1,000 women who have a baby, it is much more common in mothers with a history of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder (a condition which has symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), or women who have suffered a previous episode of postpartum psychosis.There are currently no biological markers that help to identify women who could go on to develop postpartum psychosis, and the role of brain connectivity - how different areas of the brain talk to each other, measured using brain scans - is yet to be fully explored.Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College London, and the University of Padova in Italy, found that compared with healthy women, women at risk of postpartum psychosis show altered connectivity in brain networks associated with 'goal-directed behaviour' - i.e. areas of the brain involved in planning, organising and completing short and long-term tasks.Their study also offers the first evidence that increased connectivity within the brain's executive network (responsible for attention, working memory and decision-making) could represent a marker of resilience to postpartum psychosis relapse.32 women 'at risk' of postpartum psychosis, and 27 healthy women, were followed up from pregnancy through to eight weeks after giving birth. They were considered 'at risk' of postpartum psychosis if they had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder, or if they had suffered a previous episode of postpartum psychosis. In the first four weeks after delivery, 15 women became unwell with symptoms indicating postpartum psychosis.Eight weeks after giving birth, the women had brain scans while resting, followed by further scans during an emotional processing task, to study how different brain areas were activated, and the interplay between them. For the task, participants looked at images of faces expressing different emotions and had to identify that emotion (for example, a face showing a fearful expression). The researchers measured how long it took for them to successfully identify these emotions and analysed how different networks of the brain were activated.All women at risk of postpartum psychosis, and particularly those who later became unwell, struggled more with understanding and decoding negative emotions, compared to the healthy women. This was indicated by reduced connectivity between certain brain networks during the task, and longer reaction times to the negative emotional images.While similar connectivity changes have also been revealed in patients with other psychiatric disorders, the King's study found that these changes were more marked specifically in women who become unwell, potentially reflecting the emotional instability women experience during the course of the disorder.Paola Dazzan, Professor of Neurobiology of Psychosis at King's College London, said: ""Although rare, postpartum psychosis is a very serious mental health problem that can be really frightening for new mothers, their partners, friends and family.""Previously, it's been difficult to spot women at risk of postpartum psychosis or explain why some are more vulnerable than others, as we really haven't known enough about the neurobiology of the illness. Our study is the first step towards a better understanding of brain connectivity as a marker of vulnerability to postpartum psychosis.""Professor Dazzan added: ""We recently published another paper looking at the role of stress in postpartum psychosis, which found that higher levels of cortisol (the main stress hormone) in the third trimester of pregnancy predicted postpartum psychosis relapse. If subtle alterations in the brain's executive network, and its interaction with other brain areas, were also detectable in pregnancy, these could offer vital clues to the development of postpartum psychosis.

""These regions seem to be active when people aren't asked to do anything in particular, as opposed to being asked to do something cognitively,"" says Penn neuroscientist Joseph Kable.Though the field has long suspected that this neural network plays a role in imagining the future, precisely how it works hadn't been fully understood. Now, research from Kable and two former graduate students in his lab, Trishala Parthasarathi, associate director of scientific services at OrtleyBio, and Sangil Lee, a postdoc at University of California, Berkeley, sheds light on the matter.In a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the research team discovered that, when it comes to imagining the future, the default mode network actually splits into two complementary parts. One helps create and predict the imagined event, what the researchers call the ""constructive"" function. The other assesses whether that newly constructed event is positive or negative, what they call the ""evaluative"" function.""It's a neat division,"" says Kable. ""When psychologists talk about why humans have the ability to imagine the future, usually it's so we can decide what to do, plan, make decisions.

The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, reports that the signal glutamate likely plays a role in this unusual transmission.Information flows in a well-defined direction in the brain: Chemical and electrical signals are passed from one neuron to the other across the synapse, from the pre-synaptic to the post-synaptic neuron. Now, Peter Jonas and his group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) show that information also travels in the opposite direction at a key synapse in the hippocampus, the brain region responsible for learning and memory. At the so-called mossy fiber synapse, the post-synaptic CA3 neuron influences how the pre-synaptic neuron, the so-called mossy fiber neuron, fires. ""We have shown, for the first time, that a retrograde information flow is physiologically relevant for pre-synaptic plasticity,"" says Yuji Okamoto, a postdoc in the group of Peter Jonas at IST Austria and co-first author of the paper published in Nature Communications.The mossy fiber synapse is crucial for information storage in the neuronal network. Synaptic transmission is plastic meaning that a variable amount of chemical signal, the so-called neurotransmitter, is released into the synapse. To understand the mechanism of plasticity at work in this synapse, Okamoto precisely stimulated the pre-synaptic terminal of the mossy fiber synapse in rats and at the same time recorded from the post-synaptic neuron. ""We need to know the synapse's exact properties - with the numerical values, e.g., for its conductance - to create an exact model of this synapse.

Less IT cortex activity, on the other hand, indicated familiarity.But something about that theory, called repetition suppression, didn't hold up for University of Pennsylvania neuroscientist Nicole Rust. ""Different images produce different amounts of activation even when they are all novel,"" says Rust, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology. Beyond that, other factors an image's brightness, for instance, or its contrast result in a similar effect.In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, she and postdoctoral fellow Vahid Mehrpour, along with Penn research associate Travis Meyer and Eero Simoncelli of New York University, propose a new theory, one in which the brain understands the level of activation expected from a sensory input and corrects for it, leaving behind the signal for familiarity.

Predictions from this new method of simulation, developed at Lehigh University, can be used to optimize the design of the mechanical pumps known as left ventricular assist devices used in heart failure patients. The method also has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment of von Willebrand disease, the most common inherited bleeding disorder in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The article, ""Predicting pathological von Willebrand factor unraveling in elongational flow,"" appears today in the May 18 issue of Biophysical Journal. In it, the team of researchers used an enhanced sampling technique called Weighted Ensemble, in conjunction with Brownian Dynamics simulations (i.e., the WEBD method), to identify blood flow conditions that cause pathological unraveling of the human blood protein vWF. The method allowed them to compute the globular-to-unraveled transition rate of the protein on timescales inaccessible to standard simulation methods.""This method is all about studying the kinetics of rare events,"" says co-author Edmund Webb III, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and mechanics in Lehigh's P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. ""That typically means some type of transition. With proteins, that often comes down to folding.""The protein known as vWF promotes blood clotting by helping platelets in blood stick to collagen within the walls of damaged blood vessels and form a plug that stops the bleeding from a wound.Typically, vWF circulates in the blood as a compact ball, or globule. When it approaches an injury site, the increase in blood flow caused by the laceration prompts the globule to unravel. As the protein transitions into more of a string-like shape, sites that are typically shielded when vWf is in a globule shape become exposed. Those sites are ""sticky""--and they bind with platelets and collagen to initiate blood clot formation. There are a number of ways in which the clotting process can go awry, leading to bleeding disorders. One of these is called von Willebrand disease (vWD), and it affects about 1 percent of Americans (or 1 in every 100 people), according to the CDC. Its primary symptoms include frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising, and heavy and/or longer bleeding after injury, childbirth, surgery, or dental work, or during menstrual periods. There are several types of vWD, and they range in severity based on the degree to which vWF is depleted in a patient's blood. Some people don't even know they have the condition, because the vWF concentration in their blood, though depleted, is still sufficiently high to initiate clotting. Some have to steer clear of certain activities to avoid injury. Others need regular infusions of vWF, because they are severely lacking in the protein. The lead study author is Sagar Kania, a Rossin College PhD student in mechanical engineering and mechanics. Kania and Webb performed the work with their Lehigh coauthors, Alp Oztekin, a professor of mechanical engineering and mechanics, Xuanhong Cheng, a professor of bioengineering and materials science and engineering, and X. Frank Zhang, an associate professor of bioengineering. The team focused on first understanding blood flow conditions in which otherwise healthy vWF would exhibit undesired unraveling. This is a question whose answer has a direct impact on the design of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), which have been associated with causing unexpected vWF depletion and associated bleeding disorders, akin to vWD. The symptoms are essentially the same so, medically speaking, in addition to being hereditary, von Willebrand disease can be acquired either by the action of a medical device or as a result of a separate medical condition.Undesired unraveling of vWF is considered a necessary first step to pathological vWF depletion and associated bleeding disorders. In normal conditions, vWF is made within the walls of blood vessels and then secreted into the blood. ""And when it gets secreted, it's way too big,"" Webb says. So that secretion simultaneously activates an enzyme (called ADAMTS13) that cuts the very long proteins into shorter lengths that are appropriately sized for their blood-clotting duties. Those shorter proteins contract to a globule shape, and then flow through the blood until they encounter an injury site, at which point they unravel, stick to platelets and collagen, and initiate the process of plugging the hole in damaged blood vessels.The specific problem that the team studied for this paper arises when vWF unravels when it shouldn't. In other words, not in response to a wound. When that happens, the cutting enzyme may again be activated.""So upon secretion into blood, von Willebrand factor proteins are circulating in normal blood flow conditions, and yet they're unraveling because they are very long,"" says Webb. ""Since they are unraveling, they're getting cut down to the normal size distribution. But in pathological conditions they continue to unravel, and they get cut to the point where they are too small to be functional. They become short segments that are no longer hemostatically active; so if you get a cut, you can't clot because you don't have enough properly sized von Willebrand factor circulating around.""So what are the blood flow conditions that cause vWF to unravel when it shouldn't? To answer that question, Kania and coauthors combined the enhanced sampling technique (Weighted Ensemble) with molecular scale (Brownian Dynamics) simulations. This required executing parallel simulations--computations that are performed across many computers at the same time--supported by Lehigh's Sol and Hawk computational clusters, as well as resources from the Xtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), a national supercomputing resource made possible by the National Science Foundation.  ""The big problem,"" says Webb, ""is that bleeding disorders can be associated with the clearance of von Willebrand factor on timescales that might be on the order of minutes to hours. Molecular-scale simulations have to go through time sequentially, using a really, really tiny time step. For us to get a one-second simulation is effectively a state-of-the-art calculation."" Webb further points out that developing a robust understanding of the statistical nature of rare unraveling events requires many such simulations, making such an approach intractable.""What this paper did was use a new method of simulation combined with our preexisting method of simulation to answer questions on longer timescales. It's generally referred to as timescale bridging, because we're taking a model designed to address questions on the order of micro- to milliseconds and combining it with a new theoretical technique that allows us to answer questions about things that would happen on timescales of seconds, minutes, hours, even days."" It's truly a novel approach to predicting this type of an event, he says.""This Weighted Ensemble method and the marriage of it to this type of problem has never been done before,"" Webb explains. ""Sagar has made some predictions about pathological flow conditions that appear to be quantitatively more accurate than what previously exists in the literature. So we can now say, 'If a certain blood flow exposure occurs, you're going to have issues.'"" The breakthrough is potentially very good news for patients with heart failure. It may help manufacturers of LVADs design the blood pumps so the flow they generate doesn't create pathological conditions for vWF.Beyond benefiting those in need of medical implants, the team's method may eventually help medical professionals better understand and potentially manipulate the complex flow conditions affecting the size distribution of vWF in their patients. This could lead to improved treatment of both acquired and hereditary vWD.The ultimate goal, Webb says, is to take this type of capability and knowledge beyond just vWF to develop targeted drug therapy using flow-responsive molecules that mimic the unraveling of vWF. So if a patient is at risk for heart attack or stroke because of plaque buildup (stenosis), the molecule could deliver a drug to that precise area.""You design a molecule that unravels in specific flow fields associated with certain degrees of stenosis,"" says Webb. ""The hope is that you would get the drug to the spot where you want it, and not anywhere else in the body. We're working on this right now.""Reference: Kania S, Oztekin A, Cheng X, Zhang XF, Webb E.

""We wanted to combine whole-brain gene activity measurements with clinical scan data in a comprehensive and personalised model, which we then validated in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease.""The study involved 460 people who had at least four different types of brain scan at four different time points as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Among the 460 participants, 151 were clinically identified as asymptomatic or healthy control (HC), 161 with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 113 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and 35 with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD).Data from these multimodal scans was combined with data on gene activity from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, which provides detail on whole-brain gene expression for 20,267 genes. The brain was then split into 138 different gray matter regions for the purposes of combining the gene data with the structural and functional data from the scans.The team then explored causal relationships between the spatial genetic patterns and information from their scans, and cross-referenced this to age-related changes in cognitive function. They found that the ability of the model to predict the extent of decline in cognitive function was highest for Alzheimer's disease, followed in order by the less pronounced decline in cognition (LCMI, ECMI) and finally the healthy controls. This shows that the model can reproduce the individual multifactorial changes in the brain's accumulation of toxic proteins, neuronal function and tissue structure seen over time in the clinical scans.Next, the team used the model to look for genes that cause cognitive decline over time during the normal process of healthy aging, using a subset of healthy control participants who remained clinically stable for nearly eight years. Cognitive changes included memory and executive functions such as flexible thinking. They found eight genes which contributed to the imaging dynamics seen in the scans and corresponded with cognitive changes in healthy individuals. Of note, the genes that changed in healthy aging are also known to affect two important proteins in the development of Alzheimer's disease, called tau and amyloid beta.Next, they ran a similar analysis looking for genes that drive the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Here, they identified 111 genes that were linked with the scan data and with associated cognitive changes in Alzheimer's disease.Finally, they studied the functions of the 111 genes identified, and found that they belonged to 65 different biological processes - with most of them commonly linked to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.""Our study provides unprecedented insight into the multiscale interactions among aging and Alzheimer's disease-associated biological factors and the possible mechanistic roles of the identified genes,"" concludes senior author Yasser Iturria-Medina, Assistant Professor at the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University. ""We've shown that Alzheimer's disease and healthy aging share complex biological mechanisms, even though Alzheimer's disease is a separate entity with considerably more altered molecular and macroscopic pathways.

This offers a novel opportunity for crop improvement.The production of fruit is a vital process for plants because it enables them to reproduce and thrive. One strategy that plants use to ensure that their fruit are successful is to give them a colourful appearance, so that they are attractive to animals for seed dispersal. In tomato, the fruit ripening process involves dramatic changes in tiny  organelles  inside the fruit cells called plastids. It is these plastids that are responsible for giving colour to the fruit. In spite of their central importance in delivering fruit colour, surprisingly little was known about how plastids participate in the ripening process. The Oxford team has now discovered a function in fruit for a protein located in the plastids called SP1 (this SP1 protein controls a regulatory pathway called CHLORAD, which was discovered by the group in 2019). The new finding reveals an important regulatory or controlling role for plastids in the fruit ripening process in tomato. Significantly, the results published today in Nature Plants provide a theoretical basis for the modification or manipulation of the ripening of fleshy fruits such as tomato, providing a novel opportunity for crop improvement. Corresponding author, Professor Paul Jarvis from Oxford s Department of Plant Sciences, said:  The regulatory properties of SP1 revealed in our study show that it has real potential as a technology for crop improvement. For example, it could be used to develop early or late fruiting varieties of fleshy fruits, or to improve the transportability or shelf-life of fruit by delaying ripening without compromising the quality of the ripe fruit.  It s fascinating that the amount of a single protein in these tiny subcellular structures called plastids can have such far-reaching consequences for fruit ripening in tomato.  The work is based on the modification of the expression of the tomato SP1 gene (as well as the related tomato SPL2 gene) in transgenic tomato plants. Transgenic plants with reduced or elevated levels of expression of SP1 were studied in detail, using a range of techniques including phenotyping, electron microscopy, gene expression analysis, and metabolomics.ReferenceLing Q, Sadali NM, Soufi Z, et al.

Another group of students were taught a technique developed by Australian Aboriginal people over more than 50,000 years of living in a custodial relationship with the Australian land.The students who used the Aboriginal method of remembering had a significantly improved retention of facts compared to the control and the ""memory palace"" group.The study led by Dr David Reser, from the Monash University School of Rural Health and Dr Tyson Yunkaporta, from Deakin University's NIKERI Institute, has just been published in PLOS One.Medical students, and doctors, need to retain large amounts of information from anatomy to diseases and medications.Because one of the main stressors for medical students is the amount of information they have to rote learn, we decided to see if we can teach them alternate, and better, ways to memorise data,"" Dr Reser said.The memory palace technique dates back to the early Greeks and was further utilised by Jesuit priests. Handwritten books were scarce and valuable, and one reading would have to last a person's lifetime, so ways to remember the contents were developed.In Aboriginal culture, which relies on oral history, important facts like navigation, food sources, tool use and inter and intra tribal political relationships are important for survival. Aboriginal methods of memorising also used the idea of attaching facts to the landscape, but with added stories which describe the facts and the placement to facilitate recall.Working with Dr Yunkaporta, formerly at the Monash School of Rural Health, the research team randomly divided 76 medical students attending Monash's Churchill Campus, in rural Victoria, into three groups. The students were given 30 minutes of training in the memory palace, Aboriginal techniques, or were in a control group who watched a video rather than undergo training. The students were then asked to memorize 20 common butterfly names (to dissociate from medical curriculum).They were then tested on their recalls at 10 minutes and then 30 minutes after using their assigned techniques to memorize the list.The researchers found the students who used the Aboriginal technique for remembering ie a narrative plus locations from around the campus were almost three times more likely to correctly remember the entire list than they were prior to training (odds ratio: 2.8). The students using the memory palace technique were about twice as likely to get a perfect score after training (2.1), while the control group improved by about 50% (1.5) over their pre-training performance.Importantly a qualitative survey found the students using the Aboriginal technique found it more enjoyable, ""both as a way to remember facts but also as a way to learn more about Aboriginal culture,"" Dr Reser said.Dr Reser said the Monash School of Rural Health is considering incorporating these memory tools into the medical curriculum once teaching returns to a post-COVID normal. ""This year we hope to offer this to students as a way to not only facilitate their learning but to reduce the stress associated with a course that requires a lot of rote learning,""he said.Reference: Reser D, Simmons M, Johns E, et al.

Biofuels turned out to be very good options because they have zero or very, very low sulfur compared to fossil fuels,  said Eric Tan, a senior research engineer at NREL and lead author of a new article published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. His co-authors of  Biofuel Options for Marine Applications: Techno-Economic and Life-Cycle Analyses  are Ling Tao, also from NREL, along with scientists with Argonne National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department of Transportation s Maritime Administration. The International Marine Organization (IMO) has been ratcheting down the allowed amount of sulfur oxides emissions from ships since 2005. The newest upper limit, which took effect at the start of 2020, reduced the sulfur content of ships  fuel oil to 0.5% from 3.5%. IMO said the reduction should have major benefits for the environment and the health of people, particularly those living near ports and along coasts. Additionally, IMO has set aggressive targets to decarbonize marine shipping, targeting at least a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from international shipping by 2050, relative to 2008 levels. The new regulation, which is enforced by individual countries, requires changes to bring ships into compliance. Ship owners can either install sulfur scrubbers to reduce emissions, or they can adopt a different, low-sulfur fuel. Both options carry an additional cost. The NREL-directed research provides a starting point for establishing the feasibility of ships using biofuels. Fueling costs already account for a significant part of running a shipping line, so the researchers examined both prices and emissions. The economics are weighed against the cost of burning heavy fuel oil (HFO), which accounts for about three-quarters of the fuel used by ships. A low-sulfur HFO costs slightly more a gallon than traditional HFO. The low-sulfur HFO prices would be the maximum ship owners are willing to pay for biofuels for a one-to-one replacement. The biofuels are considered to be potential drop-in fuels compatible for use in marine engines, but further work is needed to confirm that compatibility. Upon examining different types of fuels for their ability to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, the researchers found biofuels produced entirely from biomass offer much higher reductions in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from 67% to 93% less than HFO. Biomass-derived fuels also are mostly free of sulfur and exhibit reductions in criteria air pollutant emissions such as particulate matter. Tan s research concluded that, if shipping had no competition, the United States has a large supply of bio-feedstocks for producing substantial amounts of marine biofuels to displace fossil fuels. With ships using 400 million metric tons of fuel annually, a blend of 5% biofuels translates to about 5 billion gallons.ReferenceTan ECD et al.

Their guidance was published in the May 18, 2021 issue of Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology (""Value-Generating Exploratory Trials in Neurodegenerative Dementias"").These efficiencies in clinical trials can help to achieve proof of concept more rapidly and at lower costs. The estimated cost of developing an Alzheimer's drug is eight times more than a cancer drug and takes nearly twice as long to develop. The panel, which comprised clinicians, researchers, and statisticians from academia, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, as well as ADDF and AFTD scientific staff, focused on early phase 1 and 2 exploratory trials, which assess a drug's safety and pharmacologic effects on patients. Exploratory studies with optimized study designs can terminate programs not likely to succeed and efficiently move promising programs through the clinical trial process. Later phase 2 and phase 3 trials measure clinical outcomes such as memory and ability to perform daily functions.""The majority of clinical development costs come from later stage phase 2b and phase 3 studies, which require long treatment periods and a large number of patients to detect meaningful changes in cognitive, behavioral, and functional endpoints,"" said Howard Fillit, M.D., ADDF founding executive director and chief science officer. ""Results from exploratory phase 2a trials are the critical inflection point when researchers decide which drugs to move into these larger and more expensive trials, so clearly these phase 2a trials need to be as rigorous and well-designed as possible.""Panel makes four key recommendations for exploratory trial study designsBy adopting best practices in designing exploratory trials, researchers and companies can be more confident in using their results to make the all-important go/no-go decisions about advancing drugs to larger later-stage trials. The four key panel recommendations are to: ""These four recommendations can lead to more efficient trials, with substantial financial savings, as well as more strategic and effective engagement of patients,"" said AFTD CEO Susan L-J Dickinson.

How would you feel if your daily job involved handling human eggs and any mistakes would affect someone's life?Typical egg collection requires a healthy woman to go through weeks of hormone therapy and then undergo an operation to retrieve eggs. These hard-earned and precious eggs are fertilized in vitro, and the best embryos are selected for future transfer.But not all transfers succeed, which gives rise to the practice of freezing the extra embryos from an IVF cycle for future transfers. This allows those with at-risk fertility, due to age or treatments such as chemotherapy, to delay their transfer.In the journal Biomicrofluidics, from AIP Publishing, researchers from the National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in Iran and McGill University and the University of British Columbia in Canada introduce a standalone microfluidics system to automate the process of embryo vitrification of replacing water with cryoprotectants.Water is the enemy of any low-temperature system. Before embryos are frozen, the water inside must be replaced by cryoprotectants. But sudden removal of water kills embryos, so traditionally, embryos are transferred through multiple droplets with increasing concentrations of cryoprotectants. These transfers and washing steps added unnecessary pipetting steps.""What if embryos simply stayed in the same place, and cryoprotectants were brought to them? Microfluidics systems are really good at controlling flow and concentration,"" said Mojtaba Dashtizad, an assistant professor at the National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.The researchers' microfluidics setup has one chamber for an embryo to be placed, and three channels to gradually introduce cryoprotectants into it, while existing water is simultaneously emptied through an exit channel. Their single-inlet design of the chip simplifies technicians' tasks to adding the cryoprotectant solution, placing the embryo, and waiting until the process is completed. The concentration of cryoprotectants is automatically adjusted by the chip.Unlike the traditional method of cryopreservation, the new approach exposes embryos to a slow and constantly increasing concentration of cryoprotectants.""Our genetic studies show this reduces molecular damage caused by cryopreservation,"" said Dashtizad. ""And embryos can be cryopreserved faster and with a lower concentration of cryoprotectants -- a huge advantage because of the toxicity of these chemicals.""This approach enables cryopreservation workflows to be simplified, more reproducible, and less prone to human error.""Our findings emphasize the importance of moving away from droplet-based loading of cryoprotectants to gradual concentration controls,"" said Dashtizad. ""These can ultimately reduce damage to embryos during the cryoprocedure, and it moves us one step closer to increasing the efficiency of assisted reproduction and the improved health of future babies.""Reference: Tirgar P, Sarmadi F, Najafi M, et al.

Scientists at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), together with ELANTAS, a division of the specialty chemicals group ALTANA, have developed a new process that enables the dyes to be directly integrated into the insulation. By changing colour, they reveal how much the insulating resin layer around the copper wires in the motor has degraded. The results were published in the journal ""Advanced Materials"".Modern combustion engines have long had detectors that recognise, for example, when an oil change is needed, saving unnecessary inspections. Electric motors also show signs of wear. Inside, they are usually made up of tightly wound copper wires - and these in turn are coated with an insulating resin. ""This insulation changes over time. It becomes brittle as it degrades dues to heat and chemical processes,"" explains Professor Wolfgang Binder from the Institute of Chemistry at MLU. However, it is not possible to tell from the outside whether the insulation around the wires inside is still intact or whether the entire motor needs to be replaced. The scientists from MLU were tasked with finding a solution to this problem on behalf of the ELANTAS division of ALTANA, which produces special resin systems for such insulation. ""Until now, developers have focused on the degree to which material degrades under specific conditions,"" explains Alexander Funtan, a chemist at MLU. Recommendations were then made as to how long it would take before a replacement would be necessary. However, the actual wear depends on the conditions under which it is used, most particularly temperature. Funtan therefore developed a test rig which he used to analyse four different resin systems over several months to determine which degradation products form at different temperatures. He discovered that the four resin systems consistently released a specific alcohol under the different temperature conditions. ""We then worked closely with the researchers and developers at ELANTAS to find a sensor molecule for this alcohol,"" he says. In other words, a substance that is easily detectable and whose properties change when the alcohol binds to it. The sensor molecule must also withstand high temperatures and normal production processes. Another requirement was that it did not change the insulation s electrochemical properties. The choice fell on a dye that normally glows reddish orange under UV light; but when alcohol binds to it, the colour spectrum shifts to a light green. The different colour spectra could then be analysed using special devices that could be installed directly in the engine. ""This way, you can see if a replacement is necessary without having to open up the engine,"" says Binder. This will hopefully avoid unnecessary motor replacements in the future. The new insulation could be used in the motors of electric vehicles as well as in machines and other equipment. ""These results reveal what can be achieved by combining basic university research with commercial application know-how,"" says Dr Simon Rost, head of research & development at ELANTAS in Hamburg. ""In the future, this will enable us to provide added value to our customers and further contribute to sustainable development."" ReferenceFuntan A, Michael P, Rost S, Omeis J, Lienert K, Binder WH.

This discovery effectively calls for a rewrite of the standard identification protocols issued by food safety regulators, Carlin said.As listeria species are often found co-existing in environments that support the growth of L. monocytogenes, food facilities will monitor for all listeria species to verify their sanitation practices.Listeria monocytogenes can have profound pathogenic influence on food processing plants and those plants must be kept clean. Listeriosis has a mortality rate of 20% to 30% - even with a patient taking antibiotics, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 1,600 people in the U.S. get listeriosis annually and nearly 260 die.""This paper describes some unique characteristics of listeria species that are closely related to listeria monocytogenes, which will be important from an evolutionary perspective and from a practical standpoint for the food industry,"" said co-author Martin Wiedmann, the professor in food safety and food science.

That is, apart from their actual intended effects, they also inhibit acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is important in brain signaling and in a number of other body functions. Apart from schizophrenia, which is estimated to affect roughly 1.5 million Americans, drugs with anticholinergic properties are used to treat a wide variety of conditions, including urinary incontinence, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and some muscle disorders.""Many medications have anticholinergic effects, and we are becoming increasingly aware about their potential long-term risks,"" said lead study author Yash Joshi, MD, assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine.In fact, anticholinergic drugs have been linked to cognitive impairment and increased dementia risk in healthy adults. For example, a 2020 study by UC San Diego School of Medicine researchers found an association between anticholinergic medications and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Another study cited by authors reported that taking just one strong anticholinergic medication for three years was associated with a 50 percent increase in the odds of developing dementia over the 11-year study period.Persons living with schizophrenia commonly experience significant difficulties with attention, learning, memory, executive function (such as reasoning and planning) and social cognition. Since these mental processes are critical for many daily activities, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia can lead to significant disability.In the latest study, Joshi and colleagues sought to comprehensively characterize how the cumulative anticholinergic burden from different classes of medications impact cognition in patients with schizophrenia.""We wanted to better understand how anticholinergic medication burden impacted cognitive functioning in individuals who may have already some cognitive difficulties due to schizophrenia,"" he said.Researchers assessed medical records, including prescribed medications, of 1,120 study participants with schizophrenia. They found that 63 percent of participants had an anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) score of at least 3.""This is striking because previous studies have shown that an ACB score of 3 in a healthy, older adult is associated with cognitive dysfunction and a 50 percent increased risk for developing dementia,"" said Joshi.Notably, roughly one-quarter of the schizophrenia patients in the study had ACB scores of 6 or more.The authors wrote that while such numbers may be high for persons living without any psychiatric illness, they are not difficult to achieve in patients receiving routine psychiatric care, which often includes medications with anticholinergic properties. For example, a patient prescribed daily olanzapine for symptoms of psychosis already starts with an ACB score of 3; add hydroxyzine for anxiety and insomnia in the same patient and their ACB score doubles. Many patients with schizophrenia are treated with multiple psychotropic drugs -- other medications for other health conditions could increase this burden further.""It is easy even for well-meaning clinicians to inadvertently contribute to anticholinergic medication burden through routine and appropriate care,"" said Gregory Light, PhD, professor of psychiatry and senior author. ""The unique finding here is that this burden comes from medications we don't usually think of as typical anticholinergic agents.""The authors said ACB should be considered when physicians prescribe medications for patients with schizophrenia, noting that emerging data suggests reducing anticholinergic burden is associated not only with cognitive benefit, but an improved quality of life.""Brain health in schizophrenia is a game of inches, and even small negative effects on cognitive functioning through anticholinergic medication burden may have large impacts on patients' lives,"" said Joshi.""Everyone caring for those living with schizophrenia -- mental health providers, primary care providers, specialists, and loved ones -- should be vigilant in trying to reduce anticholinergic burden in a holistic way so that we can be good stewards of our patients' long-term cognitive health. If clinically feasible and safe, this could include reducing the number of psychotropic medications, changing some psychotropic medications to others with lower anticholinergic properties, or using complementary approaches to enhance cognitive functioning.""Reference: Joshi YB, Thomas ML, Braff DL, et al.

Human beings play host to trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms that make up the human microbiome. In recent years, the mix of these resident bacteria, and the presence of specific bacterial species, has been linked to conditions ranging from obesity to multiple sclerosis.Now, going a step farther, researchers at Harvard Medical School and Joslin Diabetes Center have gone beyond microbial species. Analyzing the genetic makeup of bacteria in the human gut, the team has successfully linked groups of bacterial genes, or ""genetic signatures,"" to multiple diseases.The work brings scientists closer to developing tests that could predict disease risk or identify disease presence based on a sampling of the genetic makeup of a person's microbiome.The findings, to be published May 18 in Nature Communications, link sets of bacterial genes to the presence of coronary artery disease, cirrhosis of the liver, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and type 2 diabetes. The analysis indicates that three of these conditions--coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver cirrhosis--share many of the same bacterial genes. In other words, people whose guts harbor these bacterial genes seem more likely to have one or more of these three conditions.The work represents a significant advance in the current understanding of the relationship between microbes residing in the human gut and specific diseases, the team said. If confirmed through further research, the results could inform the design of tools that could gauge a person's risk for a range of conditions based on analysis of a single fecal sample, they added.""This opens a window for the development of tests using cross-disease, gene-based indicators of patient health,"" said first author Braden Tierney, a graduate student in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences program at HMS. ""We've identified genetic markers that we think could eventually lead to tests, or just one test, to identify associations with a number of medical conditions.""The researchers caution that their study was not designed to elucidate exactly how and why these microbial genes may be linked to different diseases. Thus far, they said, it remains unclear whether these bacteria are involved in disease development or are mere bystanders in this process.The goal of the study was to determine whether groups of genes could reliably indicate the presence of different diseases. These newly identified microbial genetic signatures, however, could be studied further to determine what role, if any, the organisms play in disease development.""Our study underscores the value of data science to tease out complex interplay between microbes and humans,"" said study co-senior author Chirag Patel, associate professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.The researchers started out by collecting microbiome data from 13 groups of patients totaling more than 2,500 samples. Next, they analyzed the data to pinpoint linkages between seven diseases and millions of microbial species, microbial metabolic pathways, and microbial genes. By trying out a variety of modeling approaches--computing a total of 67 million different statistical models--they were able to observe what microbiome features consistently emerged as the strongest disease-associated candidates.Of all the various microbial characteristics--species, pathways, and genes--microbial genes had the greatest predictive power. In other words, the researchers said, groups of bacterial genes, or genetic signatures, rather than merely the presence of certain bacterial families, were linked most closely to the presence of a given condition.Some of the main observations included:Clusters of bacterial genes, or genetic signatures, rather than individual bacterial genes, appear implicated in various types of human disease.Coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver cirrhosis have similar gut microbiome genetic signatures.Type 2 diabetes, by contrast, has a microbiome signature unlike any other phenotype tested.The analysis did not find a consistent link between the presence of the bacterial species Solobacterium moorei and colon cancer--an association previously reported in numerous studies. However, the researchers did identify particular genes from a S. moorei subspecies associated with colorectal cancer. This finding indicates that gene-level analysis can yield biomarkers of disease with greater precision and more specificity compared with current approaches. Patel said this result underscores the notion that it is not merely the presence of a given bacterial family that may portend risk, but rather the strains and gene signatures of the microbes that matter. The ability to identify interconnections with such precision will be critical for designing tests that can measure risk reliably, he added. Thus, in this specific example, a test intended to measure colon-cancer risk by merely detecting the presence of S. moorei in the gut may not be as reliable as a more refined test that measures bacterial genes to detect the presence of specific strains of S. moorei that are associated with colon cancer.Two conditions--ear inflammation and benign soft-tissue tumors called adenomas--showed weak associations with the gut microbiome, suggesting that microorganisms residing in the human gut are not likely to play a role in the development of these conditions, nor are they likely to be reliable indicators that these conditions are present.In a previous study, the HMS team used massive amounts of publicly available DNA-sequencing data from human oral and gut microbiomes to estimate the size of the universe of microbial genes in the human body. The analysis revealed that there may be more genes in the collective human microbiome than stars in the observable universe.Given the sheer number of microbial genes that reside within the human body, the new findings represent a major step forward in understanding the complexity of the interplay between human diseases and the human microbiome, the researchers said.""The ultimate goal of computational science is to generate hypotheses from a huge swath of data,"" said Tierney. ""Our work shows that this can be done and opens up so many new avenues for research and inquiry that we are only limited by the time, people, and resources needed to run those tests.""Reference: Tierney BT, Tan Y, Kostic AD, Patel CJ.

For the most part, these reactions are carried out in the liquid phase, by dissolving the reactants in a solvent. However, there are a significant number of chemicals that are partially or completely insoluble, and thus have not been used for synthesis. The starting materials required for the synthesis of many cutting-edge organic materials--such as organic semiconductors and luminescent materials--are often poorly soluble, leading to problems in solution-based synthesis. Therefore, the development of a solvent-independent synthetic approach to overcome these long-standing solubility issues in organic synthesis is highly desired to synthesize new valuable organic molecules.In recent years, synthetic techniques using ball milling have been used to carry out solvent-free reactions in the solid phase. It has been proposed that the use of ball milling would potentially overcome the aforementioned solubility issues in synthetic chemistry, but a systematic study for such purpose has never been carried out.A team of four scientists from Hokkaido University's Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery (WPI-ICReDD), led by Associate Professor Koji Kubota and Professor Hajime Ito, have developed a rapid, efficient, solvent-free protocol for Suzuki Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of insoluble aryl halides. The protocol was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.Aryl halides are popular starting materials for the synthesis of organic functional molecules, primarily by the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction -- for which Hokkaido University's Professor Emeritus Akira Suzuki shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Although the cross-coupling reactions have been employed for the synthesis of a wide range of valuable molecules, insoluble aryl halides are not suitable substrates because Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions have primarily been carried out in solution.Given this limitation, the scientists focused on the development of an efficient solid-state Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of a number of extremely unreactive insoluble aryl halides. The key equipment consisted of a ball mill, for mixing the reactants; a heat gun, to increase the temperature at which the reactions took place; and the use of a catalytic system composed of palladium acetate (the catalyst), SPhos (a high-performance ligand for Suzuki Miyaura cross-coupling reactions) and 1,5-cyclooctadiene (dispersant and stabilizer).The capstone of this study was the application of the solvent-free solid-state reaction to mostly-insoluble aryl halides. These reactants did not yield any products in conventional solution-based reactions. The solid-state reactions using the high-temperature ball milling, however, gave the desired products. Importantly, the team discovered a new strong photoluminescence material prepared from insoluble pigment violet 23.""The high-temperature ball-milling technique and our catalytic system are essential for these cross-coupling reactions of insoluble aryl halides, and the protocol we have developed expands the diversity of organic molecules derived from insoluble starting materials,"" says Koji Kubota.Reference: Seo T, Toyoshima N, Kubota K, Ito H.

When Paneth cells aren t functioning properly, the gut immune system is excessively prone to inflammation, putting people at risk of inflammatory bowel disease and undermining effective control of disease-causing microbes. The findings, published May 18 in Cell Host & Microbe, open up new approaches to regulating gut immunity by restoring normal Paneth cell function.  Inflammatory bowel disease has historically been a problem primarily in Western countries such as the U.S., but it s becoming more common globally as more and more people adopt Western lifestyles,  said lead author Ta-Chiang Liu, MD, PhD, an associate professor of pathology & immunology at Washington University.  Our research showed that long-term consumption of a Western-style diet high in fat and sugar impairs the function of immune cells in the gut in ways that could promote inflammatory bowel disease or increase the risk of intestinal infections.  Paneth cell impairment is a key feature of inflammatory bowel disease. For example, people with Crohn s disease, a kind of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, anemia and fatigue, often have Paneth cells that have stopped working. Liu and senior author Thaddeus Stappenbeck, MD, PhD   chair of the Department of Inflammation and Immunity at Cleveland Clinic, and former co-director of the Division of Laboratory and Genomic Medicine at Washington University   set out to find the cause of Paneth cell dysfunction in people. They analyzed a database containing demographic and clinical data on 400 people, including an assessment of each person s Paneth cells. The researchers found that high body mass index (BMI) was associated with Paneth cells that looked abnormal and unhealthy under a microscope. The higher a person s BMI, the worse his or her Paneth cells looked. The association held for healthy adults and people with Crohn s disease. To better understand this connection, the researchers studied two strains of mice that are genetically predisposed to obesity. Such mice chronically overeat because they carry mutations that prevent them from feeling full even when fed a regular diet. To the researchers  surprise, the obese mice had Paneth cells that looked normal. In people, obesity is frequently the result of eating a diet rich in fat and sugar. So the scientists fed normal mice a diet in which 40% of the calories came from fat or sugar, similar to the typical Western diet. After two months on this chow, the mice had become obese and their Paneth cells looked decidedly abnormal.  Obesity wasn t the problem per se,  Liu said.  Eating too much of a healthy diet didn t affect the Paneth cells. It was the high-fat, high-sugar diet that was the problem.  The Paneth cells returned to normal when the mice were put back on a healthy mouse diet for four weeks. Whether people who habitually eat a Western diet can improve their gut immunity by changing their diet remains to be seen, Liu said.  This was a short-term experiment, just eight weeks,  Liu said.  In people, obesity doesn t occur overnight or even in eight weeks. People have a suboptimal lifestyle for 20, 30 years before they become obese. It s possible that if you have a Western diet for so long, you cross a point of no return and your Paneth cells don t recover even if you change your diet. We d need to do more research before we can say whether this process is reversible in people.  Further experiments showed that a molecule known as deoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid formed as a byproduct of the metabolism of gut bacteria, forms the link between a Western diet and Paneth cell dysfunction. The bile acid increases the activity of two immune molecules   farnesoid X receptor and type 1 interferon   that inhibit Paneth cell function. Liu and colleagues now are investigating whether fat or sugar plays the primary role in impairing Paneth cells. They also have begun studying ways to restore normal Paneth cell function and improve gut immunity by targeting the bile acid or the two immune molecules.ReferenceLiu T-C et al.

Many of the components of the hand-held device used in this technology can be 3D-printed, and the test can detect as little as one viral particle per 1-microliter drop of fluid.""We developed a rapid, highly sensitive and accurate assay, and a portable, battery-powered device for COVID-19 testing that can be used anywhere at any time,"" said University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Huimin Zhao, who led the research. Though it is still in the prototype stage, the device is estimated to cost less than $78 and the reagents and other materials needed for testing would amount to $6-$7 per test, the researchers found.Current coronavirus testing technologies are complex, expensive, time-consuming and require bulky equipment and expert analysts, whereas the new device can be operated by anyone with minimal training who is careful when loading samples, Zhao said.The innovation was made possible by the recent discovery in Zhao's laboratory of a system for making artificial restriction enzymes that can be programmed to recognize and cleave specific genes in an organism's genome. In the new device, these enzymes carry DNA guides that tag the viral genes of interest. The enzyme cleaves the genes, which have been tagged with a dye that fluoresces only after the genes are cut. The resulting fluorescence signals that those genes are present - a positive test result.The new technology, called Scalable and Portable Testing, does away with the complicated process of heating and cooling each sample to get results, as many current testing protocols require. SPOT also can detect multiple genes per sample, making it more accurate than single-gene tests, which can yield incorrect or inconclusive results. Another advantage is that it utilizes saliva, which is easier to collect and less invasive than a nasal swab.The research team tested SPOT using 104 clinical saliva samples.

Their results showed that safe drugs such as low-dose 6-mercaptopurine singly or combined with 5-azacitidine, which are suitable for use prior to disease relapse, have a potential of inhibiting highly resistant triple-negative breast cancer cells.Dr. Anthony Lucci and Dr. Balraj Singh both from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center said, ""Breast cancer patients who have minimal residual disease (MRD) after surgery or systemic therapies are at a higher risk of relapse.""The model involves choosing cancer cell lines established from therapy-resistant breast cancers, such as inflammatory breast cancer, and subjecting them to prolonged glutamine deficiency to select progenitor-like cancer cells that are highly resistant and can metastasize to multiple organs in nude mice.To explain this experimental strategy for therapeutic evaluation against resistant cancer cells, although their selection protocol for resistant cells is very robust, a majority of the progeny cells would gradually revert back to non-resistant cells in non-selective in vitro conditions.Since a majority of relatively sensitive cells are preferentially eliminated first by most therapies, lengthy therapeutic evaluations in cell culture provide more useful information about the resistant subpopulation of cancer cells than rapid cell proliferation assays.6-MP treatment affects cells via mis-incorporation of 6-thioguanine triphosphate into RNA and deoxy-6-thioguanine triphosphate into DNA along with other effects on nucleoside pools and cell signaling. The authors chose low-dose 6-MP for evaluation in our model of adaptable cancer cells because of 6-MP's ability to induce and maintain remission in inflammatory bowel disease and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.It has also been shown to stabilize quiescence in cancer cells and to sensitize resistant cancer cells to cell death with an apoptosis-inducing agent in a preclinical model of multiple myeloma.The Lucci/Balraj Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that finally, because immune checkpoint blockade therapy is likely to become common in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in a heterogeneous cancer such as TNBC, the industry must consider any new therapy in this new context.A common hurdle with the immune checkpoint therapy is severe autoimmune reaction toxicities.When such therapies are given in the setting of metastasis, they may be combined with other therapies such as cytotoxic agents, which may also adversely affect immunity.Although therapies like TNF antibodies are useful in managing the acute phase of IBD, 6-MP has been a mainstay for several decades for keeping the disease in remission.Applying the lessons from IBD treatment to the setting cancer treatment, low-dose 6-MP followed by immune checkpoint blockade could be a good way of limiting severe autoimmune toxicities, thereby increasing the chances of success with these promising therapies.Reference: Singh B, Sarli VN, Lucci A.

This has the potential to dramatically cut development times for new vaccines, by measuring neutralising antibody levels as a  proxy  for immune protection from COVID-19. Neutralising antibodies are tiny Y-shaped proteins produced by our body in response to infection or vaccination. They bind to the virus, reducing its ability to infect,  says Dr Deborah Cromer from the Kirby Institute. While we have known for some time that neutralising antibodies are likely to be a critical part of our immune response to COVID-19, we haven t known how much antibody you need for immunity. Our work is the strongest evidence to date to show that specific antibody levels translate to high levels of protection from disease. The researchers analysed data from seven COVID-19 vaccines to examine the how the response measured soon after vaccination correlated with protection. They then used statistical analysis to define the specific relationship between immune response and protection. Their analysis was remarkably accurate and was able to predict the efficacy of a new vaccine.Dr Cromer said that this finding has the potential to change the way we conduct COVID-19 vaccine trials in the future. Antibody immune levels are much easier to measure than directly measuring vaccine efficacy over time. So, by measuring antibody levels across the range of new vaccine candidates during early phases of clinical trials, we can better determine whether a vaccine should be used to prevent COVID-19.

The vaccine, which contains a new immune stimulant that is also suitable for use in humans, was able to partially rid the mice treated in the study of tumors. The study also showed that combining the vaccine with an immune checkpoint inhibitor - an established immunotherapy drug with a success rate of up to 20% in humans - can significantly increase the proportion of mice that respond to treatment, so that the tumor disappears in 75% of the cases. The results suggest that this new approach, where a vaccine is used in combination with established drugs, could be an effective cancer immunotherapy that should be tested in future clinical trials. The results were published in Nature Communications on May 18, 2021.Cancer therapy has made a major breakthrough in recent years through a certain type of immunotherapy known as  immune checkpoint inhibition . Immune checkpoint inhibitors work by stopping the body's natural immune response from shutting down and instead causing the body to continue attacking the tumor cells. This has been shown to be effective in certain types of cancer, such as melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and liver cancer.But not all cancer patients respond to this immunotherapy. For example, only 20% of melanoma patients can be cured. The reason why many of them do not respond well to treatment can be explained by the fact that the body itself has to initiate an immune response, which the drugs then prolong. If the body does not recognize its tumor cells as foreign, the immune checkpoint inhibitors have no immune cells as a starting point.Now the team of immunologist Prof. Dr. Marcus Groettrup at the University of Konstanz developed a technique that triggers such an immune response against the tumor. The microparticle-based cancer vaccine, which uses the human-approved immune stimulant riboxxim, can evoke the body's T-cell response, which is necessary for immune checkpoint blockade drugs to be effective. A major shortcoming of cancer vaccines is the availability of immune stimulants that can be used in humans,  says Marcus Groettrup, senior author of the study. ""In combination with the immune checkpoint blockade, our clinically applicable vaccine leads to an increase in the proportion of mice that can be cured of existing tumors to 75 percent.""","Published: May 19, 2021"

It can screen for all forms of TB and rapidly evaluate a patient's response to treatment, said lead study author Tony Hu, PhD, Weatherhead Presidential Chair in Biotechnology Innovation at Tulane University.""This is a breakthrough for infants with tuberculosis because we don't have this kind of screening technology to catch early infections among those youngest groups who are most likely to be undiagnosed,"" Hu said. ""I hope this method can be pushed forward quickly to reach these children as early as possible.""Each year, nearly a million children develop TB and 205,000 die of TB-related causes. More than 80% of childhood TB deaths occur in those under the age of 5. Most of these deaths occur because their disease is undiagnosed as children with TB, particularly infants, usually have symptoms that are not specific for the disease. These children also have difficulty producing the respiratory samples used for TB detection by the best TB tests now in use.Even when it is possible to obtain these samples from children, they tend to be less effective for diagnosis, since they often contain much less of the bacteria than samples from adults, Hu said. His test's assay, however, uses a small blood sample that can be easily obtained from children of any age to detect a specific protein (CFP-10) that the bacteria secrete to maintain the infection that develops into TB. Since this protein is present at very low levels in the blood, Hu's assay uses an antibody specific for this protein to enrich it from other proteins in blood and a mass spectrometer to detect it with high sensitivity and accuracy.Hu and his team used this test to screen stored blood samples collected from 284 HIV-infected and 235 children without the virus who participated in a large clinical trial conducted between 2004-2008. Hu's group found their test identified children diagnosed with TB by the current gold-standard TB tests with 100% accuracy. The assay also detected 83.7% of TB cases that were missed by these tests, but that were later diagnosed by a standard checklist employing an array of other information collected by each child's physician (unconfirmed TB cases). Hu's test also detected CFP-10 in 77% of the blood samples that were collected 24 weeks before children were diagnosed with TB by other methods, indicating its strong potential for early TB diagnosis. The biomarker from some positive cases can be detected as early as 60 weeks before their TB diseases were confirmed.The researchers are working to develop an inexpensive, portable instrument to read the test to allow it to be more easily used in resource-limited settings often encountered in areas where TB is prevalent.Reference: Mao L, LaCourse SM, Kim S, et al.

They also developed a novel KDM5 inhibitor and showed that it inhibits cancer cell growth in a myeloma mouse model. The researchers expect that new therapies targeting KDM5A will be developed in the future.The prognosis for multiple myeloma is improving every year with the introduction of new therapeutic agents, but there is still no cure. Further elucidation of the pathogenesis of this cancer and the development of therapeutic agents are required. The molecular pathogenesis of cancers, including multiple myeloma, is deeply related not only to genetic alterations but also to epigenetic changes. The epigenetic regulator KDM5 family proteins are highly expressed in myeloma cells, but their function is not clear.To clarify the role of KDM5 family proteins in myeloma cells, researchers from Kumamoto University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute used genetic manipulation to suppress the expression of KDM5 in human myeloma cell lines. They found that among KDM5 family members, KDM5A in particular had a strong effect on cell proliferation which prompted them to analyze its molecular mechanisms. They also developed a novel KDM5 inhibitor and validated its efficacy using both myeloma patient cells and myeloma mouse models.Genetic suppression of KDM5A expression or pharmacological inhibition of KDM5 inhibited the growth of myeloma cells. Furthermore, by using myeloma mouse models in which a human myeloma cell line was transplanted into immunodeficient mice, the researchers demonstrated that their KDM5 inhibitor suppresses myeloma cell growth even in vivo. Functional analysis revealed that KDM5A cooperates with MYC, an important transcription factor in myeloma development and growth, to promote the expression of MYC target genes. Although a high level of histone methylation (H3K4me3) was originally observed near the transcription start site of MYC target genes, this modification level was further increased by repressing KDM5A. This indicates that excess H3K4me3 acts as a barrier to transcription thereby inhibiting transcription contrary to previous theories that H3K4me3 promoted transcription. Further analysis suggested that KDM5A helps switch transcription-associated complexes as they proceed from transcription initiation to transcription elongation by transiently releasing H3K4me3.This study proposed a new model of epigenetic regulation in which KDM5A regulates histone methylation at the transcription start site to optimal levels during the required phase, thereby promoting the transcription of MYC target genes and leading myeloma cells to proliferation. It also showed that KDM5 inhibitor inhibits the growth of myeloma cells.""Our research has elucidated part of the mechanism of myeloma cell proliferation mediated by histone modification regulation, and has shown the potential for therapies targeting KDM5A,"" said Associate Professor Hiroto Ohguchi, who led this study. ""It is also becoming clear that the KDM5 family is involved in the growth of other carcinomas. The problem with the KDM5 inhibitors so far is that they have weak cell membrane permeability and are not effective in cells or in vivo. However, if a therapeutic drug is developed based on the KDM5 inhibitor developed in this study, it is expected to develop into a new therapeutic strategy for not only multiple myeloma but also various other types of cancer by combining it with conventional treatment methods.""Reference: Ohguchi H, Park PMC, Wang T, et al.

Up until now, the only kinds of similarly sugar-decorated biomolecules known to science were fats (lipids) and proteins. These glycolipids and glycoproteins appear ubiquitously in and on animal, plant and microbial cells, contributing to a wide range of processes essential for life.The newfound glycoRNAs, neither rare nor furtive, were hiding in plain sight simply because no one thought to look for them - understandably so, given that their existence flies in the face of well-established cellular biology.A study in the journal Cell, published May 17, describes the findings.""This is a stunning discovery of an entirely new class of biomolecules,"" said Carolyn Bertozzi, the Anne T. and Robert M.

The study investigated five such thiols in Cypriot wines comprising the white variety Xynisteri, and two red varieties, Maratheftiko and Giannoudhi, comparing them to Australian Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Shiraz wines.Researchers found that each white wine contained compounds responsible for 'grapefruit', 'tropical fruit' and 'passionfruit' aromas at well above their sensory threshold, whereas compounds associated with 'struck flint' and 'meaty' characters were much lower in concentration. A compound responsible for aromas likened to 'roasted coffee' was only detected in the Chardonnay and four of the Xynisteri wines. A final thiol, with aroma attributes of 'blackcurrant' and 'boxwood' was only detected in Pinot Gris and three Xynisteri wines.Overall, researchers found the concentration of flavour compounds in the Cypriot wines was comparable to those in popular Australian wines such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc.Corresponding author Dr Dimitra Capone, an ARC Research Associate with the ARC Training Centre for Innovative Wine Production at the University of Adelaide, has more than 25 years experience in the area of aroma and flavour chemistry.Dr Capone said: ""Finding the presence of these desirable flavour compounds in Cypriot grape varieties is exciting and opens up further questions regarding their sensory contributions at varying concentrations in Cypriot wines.""Mr Copper added: ""In better understanding the thiol composition of Cypriot varieties, producers can better tailor their products to consumer preferences in a changing climate.""The presence of flavour compounds enjoyed by consumers in the Cypriot wines aligns with the findings of the earlier consumer sensory project conducted by the researchers.""The panel of wine experts in the sensory study identified flavours upon tasting Xynisteri wines that were comparable to Pinot Gris, which aligns with what we found when analysing the compounds present in both Pinot Gris and several varieties of Xynisteri,"" said Mr Copper.""In consumer trials, consumers 'liked' the flavour of the Cypriot varieties, and in one segment of consumers, Xynisteri was preferred to Pinot Gris.""Since bringing the Cypriot vines to Australia for research at the University's Waite campus, Mr Copper said they have been approached by several grape growers interested in the varieties, particularly Xynisteri. In recent weeks the project has had discussions with renowned South Australian viticulturist Paul Georgiadis and the project will begin its first vineyard trials at Paulmara Wines in the Barossa Valley later this year.""This latest research adds further support for considering Cypriot varieties for use in Australia and other hot wine growing regions,"" he said.Mr Copper's PhD project is supported by an Adelaide Graduate Research Scholarship and a supplementary scholarship from Wine Australia.Reference: Copper AW, Collins C, Bastian SEP, Johnson TE, Capone DL.

The work in fruit flies, published in PLoS Biology opens up a new research avenue for developing better treatments for chronic kidney disease.Eating foods high in fats can cause inflammation and metabolic stress in the kidneys, leading to chronic disease, which in severe cases requires dialysis or a transplant. And with obesity on the rise globally, it's a growing problem - around 10% of people in the UK are living with chronic kidney disease.Scientists at the Crick have been studying a common characteristic of the disease, the appearance of lipid droplets inside kidney cells, to solve a long-standing mystery of whether this protects or harms kidney function.Working with electron microscopy experts at the Crick, the team used the sophisticated genetic methods available in the fruit fly (Drosophila) to show that lipid droplets protect the renal system against damage from excess dietary fats.When fed a high-fat diet, lipid droplets accumulate inside nephrocytes, the flies' equivalent of human kidney cells called podocytes. Here, the droplets act as a 'safe haven' for storing excess fats away from the rest of the cell. An enzyme called ATGL sits on the surface of lipid droplets and helps to dispose of the stored fats in a safe way. ATGL does this by feeding the fats in a digestible form to nearby mitochondria, where they can be broken down into less toxic molecules.Lipid droplets are essential for the protective process as when the scientists used genetic methods to prevent their formation, the fats left free inside the nephrocytes caused substantial damage and impaired kidney function.Alex Gould, head of the Physiology and Metabolism Laboratory at the Crick and lead researcher of the study says: ""It has been known for many years that lipid droplets pop up in a wide range of diseases, all the way from diabetes to brain cancer. What's been far less clear is whether they are making things better or worse.""""It's exciting to find that lipid droplets are an essential part of the kidney's fight back against fat overload. These fascinating structures are turning out to be so much more than tiny balls of fat, and we now want to find out whether their protective role in the kidney also applies to other disease contexts.""The scientists also found that boosting the expression of the ATGL enzyme in fruit flies was able to repair most of the damage caused by a high-fat diet, restoring normal function to the kidney cells.Fruit flies are a useful model for understanding the biology of kidney disease in humans because there are important similarities in the renal systems of both species, including the presence of the ATGL enzyme.Ola Lubojemska, who carried out much of this work in the Physiology and Metabolism Laboratory at the Crick, explains: ""These findings are at an early stage but open up a new direction for clinical research into chronic kidney disease. It may, for example, be possible to develop a drug that boosts the ATGL enzyme in renal patients. This would allow excess dietary fats to be more efficiently detoxified by kidney cells, thus improving kidney function.""Reference: Lubojemska A, Stefana MI, Sorge S, et al.

Studies have shown that rodents placed in enriched environments, compared to sparse environments, experience increased generation of nerve cells in brain regions that are critical for memory encoding and retrieval. Humans may also experience similar neurological benefits from novel environments. However, this exposure can be hindered by those who remain indoors, potentially due to viral pandemics or mobility impairments.While memory performance was equivalent across groups prior to engaging in video game play, two weeks of Angry Birds  or Super Mario  gameplay resulted in improved recognition memory. Memory continued to improve after an additional two weeks for the Super Mario  players compared to the Solitaire players and these improvements persisted after daily gameplay ended. No additional memory improvements were found in Angry Birds  players.These findings suggest that both novel experiences and exposure to rich three-dimensional environments may work together to improve cognition. Interventions for improving cognition are particularly important for older individuals because they are at risk for cognitive decline. In addition, video game interventions may be beneficial for individuals at any age and particularly for those who are homebound, thus unable to experience a wide variety of new environments.

When carbonate rocks weather, karst areas develop, from which around a quarter of the world's population gets their drinking water. Scientists have investigated how quickly pollutants can reach the groundwater deposits in karst areas and how this could impair the quality of drinking water. An international team led by junior professor Dr. Andreas Hartmannfrom the Professorship for Hydrological Modeling and Water Resources at the University of Freiburg compared the transport time of water from the surface to the subsurface with the degradation time of pollutants in carbonate rock regions in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The researchers have published their results in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Previous continental or global hydrological model applications have mainly focused on the occurrence of floods or dry seasons and the general availability of drinking water. Scientists, however, have largely neglected the water quality as an important factor for the drinkability of the water on these large scales, in particular how quickly pollutants can seep through cracks or crevices from the earth's surface into the groundwater. The current research results by Hartmann and his team show that in karst regions, which are characterized by the increased occurrence of cracks or crevices, the risk of pollution from degradable pollutants such as pesticides, drugs or pathogens is significantly higher than previously expected. Although pollutants are considered to be short-lived, up to 50 percent of them can still reach the groundwater, depending on the degradation time. The main reason for this, the researchers show, are fast seepage paths that allow large amounts of infiltrating water to reach groundwater in a short time. Especially in regions with less thick soils such as the Mediterranean area, the pollutants on the surface can be transported into the subsoil quickly and in high concentrations during large rain events. Hartmann's scientists demonstrated the consequences using the example of the degradable pesticide glyphosate. According to their calculations, this can exceed its permitted limit value by up to 19 times as a result of rapid transport into the groundwater. The increased risk of pollution for drinking water or ecosystems that are dependent on groundwater is particularly relevant for regions in which agriculture is dependent on degradable fertilizers and pesticides.ReferenceHartmann A, Jasechko S, Gleeson T, et al.

From parasitic flatworms transmitted by snails into humans in developing nations, to zoonotic spillover events from mammals and insects to humans--which have caused global pandemics like COVID-19 and West Nile virus--an infected creature's immune response is a vital variable to consider in calculating what happens next.""One of the biggest patterns that we're seeing in disease ecology and epidemiology is the fact that not all hosts are equal,"" said Tara Stewart Merrill, lead author of the paper and a postdoctoral fellow in ecology. ""In infectious disease research, we want to build host immunity into our understanding of how disease spreads.""Invertebrates are common vectors for disease, which means they can transmit infectious pathogens between humans or from animals to humans. Vector-borne diseases, like malaria, account for almost 20% of all infectious diseases worldwide and are responsible for more than 700,000 deaths each year.Yet epidemiological studies have rarely considered invertebrate immunity and recovery in creatures that are vectors for human disease. They assume that once exposed to a pathogen, the invertebrate host will become infected.But what if it was possible for invertebrates to fight off these diseases, and break the link in the chain that passes them on to humans?While observing a tiny species of zooplankton (Daphnia dentifera) throughout its lifecycle and exposure to a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia bicuspidata), the researchers saw this potential in action. Some of the plankton were good at stopping fungal spores from entering their bodies, and others cleared the infection within a limited window of time after ingesting the spores.""Our results show that there are several defenses that invertebrates can use to reduce the likelihood of infection, and that we really need to understand those immune defenses to understand infection patterns,"" said Stewart Merrill.","Published: May 18, 2021"

Curiously, lead levels in blood samples from 85 volunteers   averaging 20 micrograms per deciliter of blood (20  g/dl)   were lower than the acceptable ceiling defined in Brazilian law (60  g/dl).The study was supported by FAPESP and reported in an article published in Frontiers in Genetics. The authors are affiliated with the Federal University of S o Paulo (UNIFESP), the Federal University of the ABC (UFABC), Anhembi Morumbi University, and the University of S o Paulo (USP) in Brazil, and the New University of Lisbon (UNL) in Portugal. The study was part of a project funded by FAPESP. What all the studies conducted to date suggest, albeit incipiently, is that low-level exposure to lead isn t necessarily associated with a lack of adverse effects but may correlate with molecular events that precede the events that are well-established in the literature as deriving from chronic lead poisoning, such as neurological and hematological problems,  said Gustavo Rafael Mazzaron Barcelos, last author of the article. Barcelos is a professor at UNIFESP s Institute of Health and Society (ISS) in Santos, S o Paulo state.Although low doses did not correlate directly with health problems, he added, the DNA alterations should serve as a warning.  These levels cannot be considered safe. It would be great if lead exposure levels could be minimal, but a whole industrial system depends on production of lead. We need good public policy to minimize exposure, which we ve been observing systematically in Brazil for decades,  Barcelossaid.In Brazil, any lead exposure exceeding 60  g/dl must be reported to the SUS, the national health service, and the social security authorities. In China, research has shown that local workers have higher blood lead levels, averaging around 40  g/dl. We analyzed DNA methylation, one of the epigenetic changes that occur mainly in promoter regions, which control gene functions. When methylation in these regions undergoes such changes, protein synthesis may become dysregulated, potentially causing problems. There s evidence that lead exposure can inhibit DMNT1, the enzyme responsible for controlling DNA methylation. In the samples we analyzed, we found an abundance of miR-148a, a miRNA that targets the gene for DMNT1,  said Marilia Ladeira de Ara jo, first author of the article. The study was part of her PhD research at ISS-UNIFESP. She performed part of the analysis while working as a research intern at UNL s Medical School with a scholarship from FAPESP.","Published: May 18, 2021"

These white blood cells patrol the body s tissues, collect components of pathogens and vaccines and transport them via lymphatic vessels to the nearest lymph node. There, they present the collected material to other immune cells in order to trigger an immune response. How exactly dendritic cells get from the tissue into lymphatic vessels and from there to the lymph node is the focus of research conducted by Cornelia Halin, Professor of Pharmaceutical Immunology at ETH Zurich. For a long time, scientists assumed that dendritic cells choose the path of least resistance and migrate from the tissue into the smallest branches of the lymphatic vessels, the lymphatic capillaries. This is because, unlike other lymphatic vessels, capillaries are surrounded only by a thin, barely closed layer of cells, allowing dendritic cells to slip through the spaces between neighbouring cells relatively easily. However, this route is slow. While cells in blood vessels and in most other lymphatic vessels are carried along by a flow of fluid, virtually no flow is present in lymphatic capillaries. Consequently, cells in these capillary vessels need to actively move themselves forward, which only happens at an extremely low speed.With her team, ETH Professor Halin has now discovered that dendritic cells can take a shortcut. In studies performed on mouse tissues and employing microscopy, the scientists were able to show that dendritic cells can also migrate directly into those lymphatic vessels into which the capillaries merge: the collecting lymphatics. These vessels are surrounded by a well- sealed layer of cells and a thicker membrane of connective tissue. Consequently, migration across these barriers is more difficult for dendritic cells, and entry takes longer than into capillaries. All in all, however, dendritic cells taking this path arrive in the lymph nodes much faster, since immediately after entry they are carried along by the lymph flow present in the collecting vessels and can bypass the slow active migration step in the capillaries.At present, it is not yet completely understood under which circumstances dendritic cells choose the known path via the capillaries and under which they  take the newly discovered shortcut. As ETH Professor Halin and her colleagues have shown, the shortcut becomes available when there is an ongoing inflammatory response in the tissue. Specifically, the researchers were able to show that the connective tissue membrane surrounding the collecting lymphatics becomes degraded during inflammation, making it easier for dendritic cells to penetrate into the collectors. It thus appears that an inflammatory response is the key factor that allows dendritic cells to take this shortcut and arrive more quickly in the lymph nodes. The scientists will now investigate whether all dendritic cells or only specific subtypes can travel via this route. In particular, they plan to explore the importance of the newly discovered pathway for the activation of the immune system and for installing immune responses. They suspect that the ability to sound the alarm in the lymph node more quickly may provide an advantage in fighting certain infections.ReferenceArasa J et al.

The research has been published in Communications Chemistry.Heparin is naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) but is also widely used widely as a medication. It is often used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner) before and after surgery but is also used in kidney dialysis and in blood processing. Pharmaceutical-grade heparin is derived from mucosal tissues of pig intestines or cow lungs. The majority of Heparin is made in China and in 2008 there were a number of deaths and illnesses caused by a contaminated batch. Continuing problems with the supply chain remain a concern.Using a state-of-the-art chemical imaging technique called Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) the researchers developed a new analytical approach that is more than 100 times more sensitive at detecting contaminants in Heparin, whilst also being faster and requiring less material to analyse. This technique blasts high-energy beams of positive ions at the sample's surface to produces secondary ions. These ions are then accelerated into a time-of-flight analyser and where their mass can be measured. The spectrum of ions provides a detailed measurement of the sample's chemical make-up.Dr Andrew Hook from the School of Pharmacy led the research and said: ""Heparin is particularly susceptible to contamination, commonly from other glycosaminoglycans and as they are all very similar chemically it is difficult to tell them apart using traditional analysis techniques. Whilst there are safety measures in place already to prevent contamination we saw room for improvement and using the ToF-SIMS techniques we were able to create a faster and more sensitive method for analysing Heparin that can be achieved with a very small amount of sample material.""Professor of Stem Cell Glycobiology, Cathy Merry adds: ""There are many real risks to the heparin supply chain, not least of which are the increasing prevalence of animal viruses. The previous heparin crisis was linked to a reduction in the supply of porcine heparin following an outbreak of swine flu. There is a real risk this will happen again and there is now even tighter control on the international trade in animals so it is even more likely that vast numbers of animals could be destroyed if there's another outbreak. There's also been a huge drive to create synthetic heparin and, although this is still a way off, when it is available there will still be a need for a rapid, sensitive comparative technique to characterise the drug heparin which this technique can provide.""This new technique is scalable for commercial use with the ability to analyse large numbers of samples at a time.Dr Hook continues; ""It is critical that safety measures are as accurate and sensitive as possible. This technique will be a cost-effective way for manufacturers to take their safety and quality control to the next level. We are also looking at how this technique could be adapted to diagnose GAG based disorders that are typically difficult to diagnose like Hunter's Syndrome.""Reference: Hook AL, Hogwood J, Gray E, Mulloy B, Merry CLR.

Led by graduate student Chuhua Jia and Hongfei Lin, associate professor in the Gene and Linda Voiland School of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering, they report on their work in the journal, Chem Catalysis.  In the recycling industry, the cost of recycling is key,  Lin said.  This work is a milestone for us to advance this new technology to commercialization.  In recent decades, the accumulation of waste plastics has caused an environmental crisis, polluting oceans and pristine environments around the world. As they degrade, tiny pieces of microplastics have been found to enter the food chain and become a potential, if unknown, threat to human health. Plastics recycling, however, has been problematic. The most common mechanical recycling methods melt the plastic and re-mold it, but that lowers its economic value and quality for use in other products. Chemical recycling can produce higher quality products, but it has required high reaction temperatures and a long processing time, making it too expensive and cumbersome for industries to adopt. Because of its limitations, only about 9% of plastic in the U.S. is recycled every year. In their work, the WSU researchers developed a catalytic process to efficiently convert polyethylene to jet fuel and high-value lubricants. Polyethylene, one of the most commonly used plastics, is utilized in a huge variety of products from plastics bags, plastic milk jugs and shampoo bottles to corrosion-resistant piping, wood-plastic composite lumber and plastic furniture. For the process, the researchers used a ruthenium on carbon catalyst and a commonly used solvent. They were able to convert about 90% of the plastic to jet fuel components or other hydrocarbon products within an hour at a temperature of 220 degrees Celsius (428 degrees Fahrenheit), which is more efficient and lower than temperatures that would be typically used. Jia was surprised to see just how well the solvent and catalyst worked.  Before the experiment, we only speculated but didn t know if it would work,  he said.  The result was so good.  Adjusting processing conditions, such as the temperature, time or amount of catalyst used, provided the critically important step of being able to fine-tune the process to create desirable products, Lin said.  Depending on the market, they can tune to what product they want to generate,  he said.  They have flexibility. The application of this efficient process may provide a promising approach for selectively producing high-value products from waste polyethylene.  With support from the Washington Research Foundation, the researchers are working to scale up the process for future commercialization. They also believe their process could work effectively with other types of plastics.ReferenceJia C et al.

The percent with both a M/N ratio over 1 and expression levels over 0.1% of testis was 23.4% for CABYR-a/b and 25.5% for CABYR c. CABYR expression in tumors was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Dr. Richard L. Whelan from The Lenox Hill Hospital as well as The Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell said, ""Colorectal cancer is the third diagnosed cancer type as well as the second most common reason of cancer death in the United States, [1] however, in the last 30 years, there has been a substantial improvement in colorectal cancer associated mortality.""Cancer Testis Antigens, a subcategory of Tumor Associated Antigens, are a group of proteins that hold specific promise because they are expressed in the human germ line, but not in adult human tissues.As mentioned, because tumors express these proteins while normal adult tissues do not, select CTAs may have value as vaccine targets.By performing real-time PCR to determine expression levels of CABYR a/b and c in the tissues of lung cancer patients, they were able to find expression in 36% and 42% of lung cancer tissues, respectively.Additionally, CABYR c is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and may play an oncogenic role in hepatocarcinogenesis, thus far, the expression of CABYR in colorectal tumors has not been previously studied.The Whelan Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output that as regards the shortcomings of this study, the lack of plasma or serum auto-antibody data was already mentioned.Other shortcomings of the study include the fact that while this study did include tumor samples from CRC stages 2 4 there were only two samples from stage IV patients and none from stage I patients.Ideally, reasonable numbers of specimens for each cancer stage would be assessed; the need for Stage 4 tumors is especially important to determine if CABYR expression, in general and for the individual isoforms, correlates with disease stage.Presently, because of the relatively small number of samples studied it is not possible to state whether CABYR expression correlates with tumor stage.Finally, this report supplies no oncologic outcome data for the patients included in this study.Reference: Kumara HMCS, Sutton E, Caballero OL, et al.

More than 5 million Americans currently live with Alzheimer's disease -- a number that is expected to triple by 2050 as the population ages. Health care costs for those patients are predicted to grow from $305 billion in 2020 to $1.1 trillion by 2050.UC Davis toxicologist Pamela Lein, senior author of the study recently published in Environmental Health Perspectives, said their findings underscore the urgent need to identify factors that contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's to develop effective preventive measures for reducing the individual and societal burden of this disease.Lein worked with UC Davis atmospheric scientist Anthony Wexler and first author Kelley Patten, while she was a doctoral student in the UC Davis graduate group for pharmacology and toxicology, to develop a novel approach to study the impacts of traffic-related air pollution in real time.

A promising class of therapeutics that uses synthetic nucleic acids to target and shut down specific, harmful genes and prevent viruses from spreading is gaining steam.However, only a handful of siRNA, or other RNA interference-based therapeutics have been approved. One of the main problems is getting the siRNA into the body and guiding it to the target.Chemical engineering researchers in the Cockrell School of Engineering aim to solve that problem, while improving the targeting effectiveness of siRNA. In a new paper in the Journal of Controlled Release, the researchers created several different types of nanoparticles and analyzed them for the ability to deliver and protect siRNA from the body's immune system.""The human body is such a diverse place with so many systems to protect us from foreign materials,"" said Aaliyah Shodeinde, a fourth-year graduate researcher in the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering working in professor and drug delivery pioneer Nicholas Peppas' lab. ""So, whenever you try to introduce a synthetically derived material, it almost immediately activates the immune system's defenses, so you need some kind of protection for the siRNA.""Several different types of nanoparticles created in Peppas' lab proved effective at siRNA delivery. The research team measured how well the particles can take in stimuli from their environment, such as changing levels of pH, and adjust accordingly without breaking down.The team sought to find the right balance between protection and effectiveness of the siRNAs in silencing harmful genes while also minimizing the toxicity of the particles.""Researchers need to keep in mind that a perfect system may not be feasible at this time because of the need to find a balance with so many moving parts,"" Shodeinde said. ""What we've been able to achieve successfully is modulating so many different parameters to find that sweet spot.""siRNA is so exciting to researchers because it can be fine-tuned to hinder many different kinds of genes in the body. They then specifically target the mRNA -- short for messenger RNA -- that tell cells what to do. mRNA has become a part of the popular lexicon lately because several of the COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA to tell cells to produce antibodies to fight off the coronavirus spike proteins.Shodeinde notes that symptoms in many diseases come from the over- or under-production of proteins. siRNA can be configured to find genes enabling this irregular protein production and, more or less, shut them down. This ""upstream"" solution is something that traditional therapies can't achieve, Shodeinde said.""siRNAs come in before the protein expression level, so we're hoping that using them to alter the gene expression levels can give us better results,"" she said.This work builds on several previous papers that have come out of Peppas' lab focused on developing hydrogels and nanoparticles for drug delivery. Just last week Peppas, Shodeinde and Deidra Ward, a chemical engineering Ph.D. student, published a new paper about this in Advanced Healthcare Materials. In it, the authors discuss their vision for the future of RNA-based therapeutics in the treatment of certain types of cancers.""The results of this new research from our laboratories are promising and add on to our previous research on siRNA delivery that commenced about 10 years ago and has led to about 15 refereed publications and two issued U.S. patents,"" said Peppas, the principal investigator of the siRNA paper.Up next, the researchers want to improve cell targeting. It is key, Shodeinde said, to making sure the siRNAs only interact with target cells and don't shut down anything they're not supposed to.Reference: Spencer DS, Shodeinde AB, Beckman DW, Luu BC, Hodges HR, Peppas NA.

Researchers currently find PD-L1 levels using immunohistochemistry tests from a biopsy, or by using a scan or imaging techniques.Now the UNSW researchers, have released nanoparticles in blood samples to detect very low amounts of PD-L1 in undiluted whole blood for the first time. The nanoparticles are, in effect, dispersible electrodes,  first author and PhD Candidate in the School of Chemistry under supervison of Scientia Professor Justin Gooding, Parisa Moazzam says. When they are circulated through the matrices of undiluted whole blood, they capture PD-L1, a cancer biomarker, before a magnet is used to re-collect the nanoparticles with newly attached PD-L1. The findings have been published in Chemical Communications.Ms Moazzam says the levels of PD-L1 in patients with cancer can show a strong correlation with the predicted response to immunotherapy and assessment of cancer treatment outcomes. A PD-L1 expression measurement in the blood means researchers can potentially identify patients who might respond well to immunotherapy treatment and evaluate treatment responses,  she says.Ms Moazzam says while immunotherapy is showing excellent therapeutic results in multiple cancers for some patients, it is expensive.Current tests for PD-L1 only result in relative amounts of the biomarker, but she says this latest research can give absolute amounts, which greatly increases sensitivity and test accuracy. This is the first electrochemical detection process which has the potential to improve conventional tests with an early, sensitive and accurate diagnosis; to reduce treatment costs; and improve outcomes and patient survival rate,  she says.Ms Moazzam said she is now working on detecting other immune inhibitor biomarkers in human serum, plasma and blood.The research group is also working to develop a high-throughput test with screen-printed electrochemical sensors. This technology is not only of interest to Australia s medical and diagnostic services, but also in worldwide clinical services laboratories in the UK and the US,  she says.The finding follows work by UNSW researchers in 2018, which modified gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles with DNA to match the microRNAs they wanted to detect in half of a whole blood sample, to diagnose cancer and other illnesses quickly and more efficiently.Reference: Moazzam P, Myekhlai M, Alinezhad A, et al.

For example, ""slurp"" sounds like the noise we make when we drink from a cup, and ""teeny"" sounds like something that is very small. This resemblance between how a word sounds and what it means is known as iconicity.In her lab at the University of Miami, Lynn Perry, an associate professor in the College of Arts and Sciences Department of Psychology, previously found that children tend to learn words higher in iconicity earlier in development then they do words lower in iconicity. She also found that adults tend to use more iconic words when they speak to children than when they speak to other adults.""That got us curious about why,"" said Stephanie Custode, a doctoral student in psychology, who worked with Perry to answer questions posed by her prior work. ""Does iconicity play a causal role in children's language development, helping them learn new words, eventually even those words that have non-iconic, or arbitrary, sound-meaning associations?""For their new study, published in the journal Cognitive Science, the researchers explored whether parents' who used iconic words as they played with novel objects with children between 1 and 2 helped them learn those objects' names. The objects were novel toys and foods that the researchers made and gave names to, like the word ""blicket"" to describe a clay toy with a made-up shape. They found that when parents named a novel object, their children were more likely to remember those novel names later if the parent also used highly iconic words in the same sentence. This was true both for parents speaking English and Spanish.""Consider when a parent teaches their child about 'cats' by talking about how they 'meow,' or about a sweater by talking about how 'fuzzy' it is, or about 'honey' by talking about how sticky it is,"" Perry said. ""The resemblance between the sound of a word like 'sticky' and the texture of the honey helps the child pay attention to that property. If the parent also says 'honey' while describing its stickiness, the child can form a stronger memory of that new word and its meaning, because they're paying attention to its important properties--its sticky texture in this case.""The researchers found it was beneficial for parents to use iconic language specifically when they introduced a novel name. ""If a parent talks about stickiness without saying the name 'honey', there's no new name to associate with that sticky texture, and if a parent names the honey but talks about it being yellow, a word that doesn't particularly sound like its meaning, the child might pay less attention to the honey and forget about it. In both cases, the child wouldn't learn the new word 'honey',"" said Perry.From these findings, the researchers concluded that iconicity could be an important cue that parents and other caregivers can use to facilitate word learning.Next the researchers plan to investigate whether using more iconic words can help children with language delays learn new words. They also are interested in studying how parents talk to children changes over time and whether they decrease their use of iconic language as they recognize that their child is becoming a stronger word learner.Reference: Perry LK, Custode SA, Fasano RM, Gonzalez BM, Savy JD.

These biomarkers are different messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules found in the blood; differences in their levels can detect and predict with high probability if an infection is viral or bacterial. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a grim testimony to the damage an infectious disease can cause to human health and welfare. A major challenge in treating such diseases is misdiagnosis, which can lead to trial-and-error treatments, and improper use of antibiotics. Identifying the correct type of infection is therefore critical.The human body responds to bacterial and viral infections differently. It produces different types of molecules   such as proteins and RNA   in the blood, depending on the type of infection. While antibiotics can treat bacterial infections, they are ineffective against viral infections. However, indiscriminate use of antibiotics to treat any kind of infection has given rise to bacterial strains that are now resistant to our entire arsenal of antibiotics.  Antibiotics are given even for viral infections in some cases because of misdiagnosis. With current methods, it can take a lot of time to test for bacterial or viral infections,  explains first author Sathyabaarathi Ravichandran, Research Associate in the lab of Nagasuma Chandra, Professor at the Department of Biochemistry.A quick method to detect acute viral and bacterial infections and distinguish between them can be immensely useful in the clinic, as accurate diagnosis will win half the battle and guide the clinician towards the optimal treatment path. It will also prevent the rise of such antimicrobial resistance. In the new study, published in the journal EBioMedicine, the researchers have developed such a test using patient blood transcriptomes and sophisticated computational modelling.  A transcriptome is a full set of mRNA molecules expressed by a biological cell, which is measured using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. During an infection, there are specific genes that get turned on and these in turn lead to higher amounts of specific mRNAs and ultimately higher amounts of the corresponding proteins. The scientists analysed transcriptomic data of patients (from publicly available databases, and samples collected from MS Ramaiah Medical College in collaboration with a clinical team) and discovered a ten-gene RNA signature in the patients  blood that is produced in varying quantities for viral and bacterial infections.  To make it useful in the clinic, the researchers devised a standalone score called VB10, which could be used for diagnosis, monitoring the stage of recovery after infection, and estimating the severity of the infection. VB10 accurately indicated whether a given blood sample had a bacterial or viral infection, across different bacteria and viruses and across different age groups.  The authors suggest that the test could be useful for differentiating COVID-19 infection from bacterial infections as well. In the study, they looked at various viral infections for which transcriptomic data is publicly available. This allowed them to develop a generic VB10 test score for viral infections. As soon as transcriptomic data became available for COVID-19, the team tested their approach and found that the test scores could differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 infection and common bacterial respiratory infections.  This work was done in collaboration with clinicians at MS Ramaiah Medical College and researchers Amit Singh, Dipshikha Chakravortty and KN Balaji at IISc. The team hopes to begin a trial study to translate their research from the lab to the clinic.  This test can be done using qRT-PCR. Given how common RT-PCR has become due to the pandemic, getting this test off the ground should not pose a major challenge,  says Chandra. The researchers expect it to be useful early on during the infection, and work against any strain.  This can supplement the current COVID-19 diagnosis tests.

Understanding the mechanics of this spread, a process called metastasis, could lead to new treatments that block this migration.In their multidisciplinary study published today (17 May) in Nature Ecology and Evolution, scientists led by the Litchfield lab at UCL and the Turajlic, Swanton, and Bates labs at the Crick, analysed 756 cancer biopsy samples from different regions within tumours from the TRACERx Renal study.They found that cells at the centre of tumours have a less stable genome and a higher potential to spread to secondary sites around the body. By contrast cells at the tumour edge had lower rates of metastasis, as well as lower rates of growth and genetic damage.""Cancer cells in the central zone of the tumour face harsh environmental conditions, as there's a lack of blood supply and oxygen. They have to adapt to survive, which makes them stronger and more aggressive. This also means they are more likely to successfully evolve into cells that can disseminate and take hold in distant organs,"" says Kevin Litchfield, paper author and group leader at the UCL Cancer Institute.The results highlight a need to pay close attention to the tumour centre to understand how cancer spreads and to find the cancer cells of greatest threat to the patient. It also shows the importance of developing treatments that target the unique environmental conditions found within the tumour core, in order to successfully eliminate the most aggressive tumour cells.The scientists also looked at how genetically different populations of cancer cells grow within a tumour. Using a unique map building tool to reconstruct the growth of tumour cells, they found that, while most tumours follow a pattern where populations of cells grow in the local area - like a plant growing up and outwards - two cases demonstrated a ""jumping"" pattern where cells took hold in a new region of the tumour by seemingly 'jumping' over other populations of tumour cells.The researchers are now planning to reconstruct 3D tumour maps, which will provide an even clearer visualisation of the spatial patterns within tumours.Samra Turajlic, head of the Crick's Cancer Dynamics Laboratory, Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and the Chief Investigator of TRACERx Renal, said: ""Cancer spread is one of the biggest barriers to improving survival rates. In the context of the TRACERx Renal study we previously resolved the genetic make up of different tumour areas, but until now, there has been no understanding of how these differences relate spatially. The most critical question is the part of the tumour from which cancer cells break away and migrate making cancer incurable.""Using this unique clinical cohort and a multidisciplinary approach, including mathematical modeling, we identified with precision the place in the tumour where genetic chaos emerges to give rise to metastases. Our observations shed light on the sort of environmental conditions that would foster emergence of aggressive behaviour. These findings are a critical foundation for considering how we target or even prevent distinct populations of cells that pose the biggest threat.""Reference: Zhao Y, Fu X, Lopez JI, et al.

By comparison, a human brain has 86 billion neurons, and a rodent brain contains about 12 billion. The figure probably represents a ""floor"" for the number needed to perform the bugs' complex behaviors.""Even though these brains are simple [in contrast to mammalian brains], they can do a lot of processing, even more than a supercomputer,"" says Christopher Potter, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""They enable the insects to navigate, find food and perform other complicated tasks at the same time, and our study offers one answer to the question of how many brain cells come together to conduct these behaviors,"" Potter adds.Results of the research are summarized May 14 in PLOS ONE.Those who study insect behavior and brain function have long suspected these insects must have hundreds of thousands of brain cells, says Potter, but when he and postdoctoral fellow Joshua Raji, Ph.D., followed chains of scientific papers that referenced the count, they did not find proof for it.In response, they report, they set out to find proof using a relatively simple counting method called an isotropic fractionator, a technique familiar to pathologists when they tally the number of any type of cell in a tissue.First, Raji used a plastic pestle to break down all the brain tissue of the individual insects. Then, he used a pipette to break apart the tissue and distribute the cells evenly through a buffered solution.  Whole brain of a fruit fly (Left). Nuclei of neurons in fruit fly brain tissue (Right). Credit: Joshua Raji and Christopher Potter, Johns Hopkins Medicine. Knowing the precise total volume of the solution, they could then count cells within a small fraction of the solution, and scale it up to account for and estimate the total number of cells in the entire solution.To make the actual count, the small amount of solution was spread on a microscope slide and placed on top of a small grid. With painstaking precision, Raji counted the cells on each slide, one by one.The researchers concluded that the total sum of brain cells was 199,380 plus or minus 3,400 for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. For three species of mosquito, the researchers found 217,910 plus or minus 6,180 in Aedes aegypti; 223,020 plus or minus 4,650 in Anopheles coluzzii; and 225,911 plus or minus 7,220 in Culex quinquefasciatus.Raji and Potter found that the brain cells in each species contained mostly neurons -- about 90%. The rest are most likely supportive cells called glia, they say.Potter says that researchers have determined the number of brain cells in only a few species of insects, including wasps and ants. ""It would be interesting to apply this approach to social insects like bees, and see if there are differences between queens and drones,"" he says.Potter also notes that the counting technique is a simple one that most researchers could perform, and it's an opportunity for any researcher to perform the counts and contribute them to scientific literature.Raji noted that he did most of the work for the study as a side project during times when COVID-19 restrictions halted his main research projects.The most challenging part of the technique, says Potter, was the microdissection of a brain that is smaller than the tip of a pencil. ""It takes a really steady hand and lots of practice,"" he says.Reference: Raji JI, Potter CJ. The number of neurons in Drosophila and mosquito brains.

This finding reported in the May 5 issue of Nature can lead to a better understanding of malnutrition in humans.""All organisms require a balanced intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats for their well being,"" explained KAIST neuroscientist and professor Greg Seong-Bae Suh. ""Taking in sufficient calories alone won't do the job, as it can still lead to severe forms of malnutrition including kwashiorkor, if the diet does not include enough proteins,"" he added.Scientists already knew that inadequate protein intake in organisms causes a preferential choice of foods rich in proteins or essential amino acids but they didn't know precisely how this happens. A group of researchers led by Professor Suh at KAIST and Professor Won-Jae Lee at Seoul National University (SNU) investigated this process in flies by examining the effects of different genes on food preference following protein deprivation.The group found that protein deprivation triggered the release of a gut hormone called neuropeptide CNMamide (CNMa) from a specific population of enterocytes - the intestine lining cells. Until now, scientists have known that enterocytes release digestive enzymes into the intestine to help digest and absorb nutrients in the gut. ""Our study showed that enterocytes have a more complex role than we previously thought,"" said Professor Suh.Enterocytes respond to protein deprivation by releasing CNMa that conveys the nutrient status in the gut to the CNMa receptors on nerve cells in the brain. This then triggers a desire to eat foods containing essential amino acids.Interestingly, the KAIST-SNU team also found that the microbiome - Acetobacter bacteria - present in the gut produces amino acids that can compensate for mild protein deficit in the diet. This basal level of amino acids provided by the microbiome modifies CNMa release and tempers the flies' compensatory desire to ingest more proteins.The research team was able to further clarify two signalling pathways that respond to protein loss from the diet and ultimately produce the CNMa hormone in these specific enterocytes.The team said that further studies are still needed to understand how CNMa communicates with its receptors in the brain, and whether this happens by directly activating nerve cells that link the gut to the brain or by indirectly activating the brain through blood circulation. Their research could provide insights into the understanding of similar process in mammals including humans.""We chose to investigate a simple organism, the fly, which would make it easier for us to identify and characterize key nutrient sensors. Because all organisms have cravings for needed nutrients, the nutrient sensors and their pathways we identified in flies would also be relevant to those in mammals. We believe that this research will greatly advance our understanding of the causes of metabolic disease and eating-related disorders,"" Professor Suh added.Reference: Kim B, Kanai MI, Oh Y, et al.

Our findings suggest that much of this work may be on unstable footing,"" said lead researcher Dr Doug Parry at Stellenbosch University.""The screen time discrepancies highlight that we simply do not know enough yet about the actual effects (both positive and negative) of our media use. Researchers, journalists, members of the public, and crucially policy makers need to question the quality of evidence when they consider research on media uses and effects. We can no longer simply take claims of harmful effects at face value.""The researchers also investigated whether questionnaires and scales addressing 'problematic' media use, such as excessive or so-called 'addictive' media use, were suitable substitutes for logged usage. They found an even smaller association with usage logs for these measures.Published in Nature Human Behaviour, the research identified every existing study that compares logged or tracked media use measures with equivalent self-reports. They screened over 12,000 articles for inclusion and found 47 studies that included both types of measures. From here they were able to identify and extract 106 comparisons, based on 50,000 individuals, to address the question of how closely self-report estimates relate to logs of actual usage.""These highly flawed studies are over-inflating the relationships between digital media use and typically negative outcomes, such as mental health symptoms and cognitive impairments, which of course explains the pervading view that smartphones among other technologies are bad for us,"" said Dr Brit Davidson from the University of Bath's School of Management.""Media and technology use takes the blame for everything from increases in teenage depression and suicide to higher incidence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and violence. If we want to properly investigate harms, we must first tackle assumptions about screen time and disentangle how people are actually using their phones or other technologies of interest.""Importantly, these questionable studies are also being used to influence policy. The UK and Canada both have forms of screen time guidelines based on poorly conducted research, which is clearly worrying and hard to reverse.""The research team also included Dr Craig Sewall at The University of Pittsburgh; Dr Jacob Fisher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Hannah Mieczkowski at Stanford University; and Dr Daniel Quintana at the University of Oslo.The researchers hope that their study will lead to a shift in measurement practices regarding technology, alongside starting to correct the narrative regarding technology and society.

The case study is part of a larger Rutgers study of 1,000 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted and discharged between March and May 2020.While there have been reports of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis following COVID-19, this is the first study in which COVID-19 triggered a recurrence in the upper arm of an active 85-year-old man who had a prior diagnosis of upper extremity blood clots. The patient presented to his primary care physician with complaints of swelling in his left arm and was sent to the hospital for further management where he was diagnosed with an upper arm blood clot and an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection,  said Payal Parikh, an assistant professor of medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, who led the study along with Martin Blaser, director of the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine and a professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  While his oxygen levels were not diminished, he was hospitalized for the management of the upper extremity deep vein blood clot. Often, blood clots are preceded by chronic inflammatory conditions exacerbated by immobility, and rarely do they occur in patients who are otherwise healthy and active at baseline. Most cases of deep vein thrombosis occur in the legs. Only about 10 percent of blood clots occur in the arms and of those cases only 9 percent recur. This is of concern since in 30 percent of these patients, the blood clot can travel to the lung and be possibly fatal,  said Parikh.  Other disabling complications include persistent swelling, pain and arm fatigue. The study suggests that clinicians should consider testing for deep vein thrombosis and COVID-19 in patients who present with complaints of unexplained swelling. People who test positive for COVID-19 should seek medical attention if they have declining oxygen levels, shortness of breath and any unexplained swelling. If you have been previously diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis or have chronic medical illness that predisposes you to blood clots, you have a higher risk for recurrence of a deep vein thrombus in the setting of a COVID-19 infection and thus, should be vigilant,  said Parikh.Reference: ","Published: May 17, 2021"

They discovered that brain waves travel back and forth across this structure, integrating messages from different areas of the brain, and showed for the first time what scientists previously had only been able to hypothesize. Brain recordings are an important part of guiding epilepsy surgery,  said Edward Chang, MD, PhD, chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery and the senior author on the study, which appears May 12 in Nature Communications.  The new high-density electrode grid technology used here allowed us to see a novel property of hippocampal activity that was previously unknown. Chang specializes in treating epilepsy with brain surgery, during which the hippocampus, a long structure deep the brain within an area called the temporal lobe, is exposed and sometimes fully or partially removed. The hippocampus can be a source of seizures for people with epilepsy and is one of the first brain regions affected in Alzheimer s disease.Previous studies had suggested that waves of activity in the hippocampus only travel in one direction: from the back end, which encodes most of the information about physical location, to the front, which encodes most emotional information. To Jon Kleen, MD, PhD, lead author on the study and assistant professor of neurology in the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, this one-way travel wasn t sufficient to explain how this small brain region manages to link multiple types of information to form a memory.As an example, he said, imagine that you ve lost your keys in Times Square.  You remember the spatial  where  aspect   Times Square   but you also remember the emotional feeling  Ack, I lost my keys!  he said. To process a memory, Kleen noted, there must be some way to integrate many parts of a memory together. To accomplish this, he surmised, it would make sense for brain waves to travel via multiple routes to process information.","Published: May 17, 2021"

According to new research by scientists at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, retinal scans can detect key changes in blood vessels that may provide an early sign of Alzheimer's, while offering important insights into how one of the most common Alzheimer's risk genes contributes to the disease.""The most prevalent genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease is a variant of the APOE gene, known as APOE4,"" said lead author Fanny Elahi, MD, PhD. ""We still don't fully understand how this variant increases risk of brain degeneration, we just know that it does, and that this risk is modified by sex, race, and lifestyle. ""Our research provides new insights into how APOE4 impacts blood vessels and may provide a path forward for early detection of neurodegenerative disease.""Studies in mice have explored the effect of APOE4 on capillaries in the brain. Elahi, an assistant professor of neurology and member of the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC), has long suspected these tiny blood vessels may play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease, since they deliver nutrients and oxygen, carry away waste, and police immune system responses through the protective shield known as the blood-brain barrier. Damage to these blood vessels could cause a host of problems, she says, including the protein buildup and cognitive decline seen in individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease.Because the technology does not exist to visualize individual capillaries in living people's brains, Elahi and colleagues turned to the eye. In the new study, which published May 11, 2021, in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring, Elahi and her team have shown that APOE4-associated capillary changes can be detected in humans through an easy, comfortable eye scan. As a light-penetrating tissue that shares biology with the brain, the retina, researchers believe, may help determine what APOE4 variants may be doing to similar capillaries inside the brain, even in those without dementia.The team - which includes Ari Green, MD, a neuro-ophthalmologist, professor, and director of the UCSF Neurodiagnostics Center, and Amir Kashani, MD, PhD, associate professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute - used an advanced retinal imaging technique known as optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to peer into the eyes of aging people with and without APOE4 mutations to evaluate the smallest blood vessels at the back of the eye.The team leveraged the well-characterized cohorts of people enrolled in ongoing studies of brain aging and neurodegenerative disease at the MAC. By adding OCTA scans to existing MRI and PET scan data, they gain comparative insights without putting volunteer participants through additional discomfort. ""That's the beauty of this technique,"" Elahi said. ""It's very easy, noninvasive and participant-friendly.""Analyzing the retinal scans, the researchers found reduced capillary density in APOE4 carriers, an effect that increased with participant age. To test whether those scans accurately reflected what was happening in the brain, the team then compared the abnormalities seen in OCTA scans of retinal capillaries to measurements of brain perfusion, or the flow of blood through the brain, as measured via MRI. They found that people with higher retinal capillary density also had greater blood flow in the brain.Finally, the team looked to participants with prior PET scans of beta-amyloid, the protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, to see how their retinal capillary measurements related to the burden of amyloid plaques in the brain, which is the major focus of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, research and treatment to date. They found that capillary density did not differ between groups with and without amyloid plaques, nor did it vary along with amyloid burden. According to Elahi, that independence suggests that capillary abnormalities are unlikely to be driven by amyloid pathology, or that their relation may at most be indirect.""This is the first time that we have demonstrated in living, asymptomatic humans that the smallest blood vessels are affected in APOE4 gene carriers,"" said Elahi. That's important, she added, because it suggests that the increased risk of brain degeneration and Alzheimer's disease in APOE4 carriers may be through its effect on blood vessels.Elahi and her colleagues plan to follow their study participants to better understand blood vessel dysfunction at a molecular level. That work could help detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease before significant damage occurs to the brain and identify new vascular targets for early treatment.""This is just the beginning,"" Elahi said. ""But the implications for early detection and possible intervention can be significant in combatting Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. It's much harder to regenerate neurons than to stop their degeneration from happening in the first place. Similar to cancer, early detection can save lives,""Reference: Elahi FM, Ashimatey SB, Bennett DJ, et al.

However, a team of researchers at the University of Vienna, the IQOQI Vienna (Austrian Academy of Sciences) and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical physics have recently shown that in certain extreme quantum scenarios it is not possible to make such probabilistic predictions, provided that certain key assumptions of quantum mechanics hold true. This work, published in Communications Physics, sheds some light on the debate concerning the interpretation of quantum mechanics.In 1961, the Nobel prize winning theoretical physicist Eugene Wigner proposed what is now known as the Wigner's friend thought experiment as an extension of the notorious Schroedinger's cat experiment. In the latter, a cat is trapped in a box with poison that will be released if a radioactive atom decays. Governed by quantum mechanical laws, the radioactive atom is in a superposition between decaying and not decaying, which also means that the cat is in a superposition between life and death. What does the cat experience when it is in the superposition? Wigner sharpened the question by pushing quantum theory to its conceptual limits. He investigated what happens when an observer also has quantum properties.In the thought experiment an observer, usually called Wigner's friend, performs a quantum measurement and perceives an outcome. From the point of view of another observer, called Wigner, the measurement process of the friend can be described as a quantum superposition. The fact that quantum theory sets no validity limits for its application leads to a clear tension between the perception of the friend, who sees a specific single result, and the description of Wigner, who observes the friend in a superposition of different perceptions. This thought experiment thus raises the question: What does it mean for an observer in a quantum superposition to observe the result of a measurement? Can an observer always trust what they see and use this data to make predictions about future measurements?In their recent paper published in Communications Physics, a team of researchers, led by Caslav Brukner,  from the University of Vienna, the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI-Vienna) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics investigate the limits that Wigner's friend's thought experiment imposes on an observer's ability to predict their own future observations. To this end, the authors identify a number of assumptions, all traditionally considered to be at the core of quantum formalism. These allow an observer in standard experimental situations to predict the probabilities for future outcomes, on the basis of their past experiences. The assumptions constrain the probabilities to obey quantum mechanical laws. However, the researchers prove that these assumptions for Wigner's friend cannot all be satisfied in the thought experiment. This work raises important questions about the ""persistent reality"" of the friend's perceptions. Indeed, the authors show that in a Wigner's friend scenario, it is impossible to consider the friend's perceptions to be coexistent at different points in time. This makes it questionable whether a quantum observer in general can consider their own past or future experiences to be as real as their present ones. Philippe Allard Gu rin, the lead author of the study, says ""Our work shows that at least one of three key assumptions of quantum mechanics must be violated; which one depends on your preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics.""Reference: Allard Gu rin P, Baumann V, Del Santo F, Brukner  .

Grayson Mullen, who was a cognitive science undergraduate at the time, worked with Psychology Professor Nicolas Davidenko to design an experiment that tested how virtual reality's effects on a game player's sense of time differ from those of conventional monitors. The results are now published in the journal Timing & Time Perception.Mullen designed a maze game that could be played in both virtual reality and conventional formats, then the research team recruited 41 UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students to test the game. Participants played in both formats, with researchers randomizing which version of the game each student started with. Both versions were essentially the same, but the mazes in each varied slightly so that there was no repetition between formats.Participants were asked to stop playing the game whenever they felt like five minutes had passed. Since there were no clocks available, each person had to make this estimate based on their own perception of the passage of time.Prior studies of time perception in virtual reality have often asked participants about their experiences after the fact, but in this experiment, the research team wanted to integrate a time-keeping task into the virtual reality experience in order to capture what was happening in the moment. Researchers recorded the actual amount of time that had passed when each participant stopped playing the game, and this revealed a gap between participants' perception of time and the reality.The study found that participants who played the virtual reality version of the game first played for an average of 72.6 seconds longer before feeling that five minutes had passed than students who started on a conventional monitor. In other words, students played for 28.5 percent more time than they realized in virtual reality, compared to conventional formats.This time compression effect was observed only among participants who played the game in virtual reality first. The paper concluded this was because participants based their judgement of time in the second round on whatever initial time estimates they made during the first round, regardless of format. But if the time compression observed in the first round is translatable to other types of virtual reality experiences and longer time intervals, it could be a big step forward in understanding how this effect works.While there are many informal descriptions of time compression in virtual reality from people who have experienced it first-hand, it's still an active area of research. One particularly well-known prior study applied virtual reality time compression to shorten the perceived duration of treatment for chemotherapy patients, but that experiment didn't compare virtual reality with conventional screen formats.""This is the first time we can really isolate that it's not just that you're playing a video game, or the content of whatever you're seeing,"" Mullen said. ""It's really the fact that it is virtual reality versus a conventional screen that contributes to this time compression effect.""Time compression could be useful in some situations--like enduring an unpleasant medical treatment or passing the time on a long flight--but in other circumstances, it could have harmful consequences.""As virtual reality headsets get more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time, and as more immersive games are made for this format, I think it would be good to avoid having it become like a virtual casino, where you end up playing more because you don't realize how much time you're spending,"" Mullen said.Research on game addiction shows that losing track of time during gameplay can negatively affect a player's sleep cycle and mood. These effects could be more pronounced in virtual reality, but Mullen says game designers can help to minimize the risk, perhaps by integrating a clock that would appear at regular intervals during gameplay.It will also be important to discover why virtual reality seems to contribute to time compression. In the paper, Mullen describes one possibility, which relates to the fact that, in virtual reality, a player has less body awareness. Psychology Professor Nicolas Davidenko, a coauthor and advisor on the paper, explained why this might be important.""In virtual reality, when you look down, you might see nothing where your body normally would be, or you might see a schematic of a body, but it won't feel like your body,"" Davidenko said. ""There are theories that we may rely on our heartbeat and other bodily rhythms to help our brain track the passage of time, so if you have a less vivid sense of your body in virtual reality, you might be missing the pulses of this timekeeping mechanism.""Future experiments to test this theory could yield new insights to help designers maximize benefits and minimize harm from time compression as virtual reality technology continues to grow.Reference: Mullen G, Davidenko N.

In short, do you possess that specific personality trait defined as agreeableness in the language of psychologists? New research from SISSA recently published in the journal NeuroImage sheds light on brain mechanisms underlying this trait.The study showed that detached and individualistic subjects seem to process information associated with social and non-social contexts in similar ways, as demonstrated by similar activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex, whereas in more agreeable subjects the activation patterns arising from social and non-social situations show more differences. This suggests that individuals with high levels of agreeableness are able to discern social contents that are important, and particularly informative, for achieving successful interactions with others. This should not be surprising, since individual agreeableness is associated with characteristics, such as empathy, cooperation and generosity, which require the ability to recognise the cognitive, emotional and motivational aspects of others in social situations. These findings could contribute to future development of more objective and sensitive personality tests, including individuals' brain responses to stimuli varying in social content as a measure of agreeableness. The research was carried out by Dr. Sandra Arbula and Elisabetta Pisanu, and coordinated by Professor Raffaella I. Rumiati.","Published: May 17, 2021"

But can scientists predict which animals will be able to adapt and survive? Using genome sequencing, researchers from McGill University show that some fish, like the threespine stickleback, can adapt very rapidly to extreme seasonal changes. Their findings could help scientists forecast the evolutionary future of these populations.A popular subject of study among evolutionary ecologists, stickleback are known for their different shapes, sizes, and behaviours - they can even live in both seawater and freshwater, and under a wide range of temperatures. But what makes this species so resilient?Identifying the genetic basis of adaptations, for example, to freshwater or in response to climate change, can be challenging. ""The modern version of Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection posits that organisms with genes that favour survival and reproduction will tend to leave more offspring than their peers, causing the genes to increase in frequency over generations. As a result, populations become adapted or better-suited to their environments over time,"" says lead author Alan Garcia-Elfring, a Doctoral Candidate under the supervision of Rowan Barrett, the Canada Research Chair of Biodiversity Science at McGill University.""However, this process has typically been studied retrospectively, in populations that adapted to their current environments long in the past. This can make it difficult to understand the sequence of events - for example, which traits were most important and when - that led to their adaptation,"" he adds.","Published: May 17, 2021"

The research team have discovered magnesium, which usually has a double positive charge in chemical compounds, in the elemental zero-oxidation state. They have published their ground-breaking findings in the journal Nature.In the periodic table of elements, magnesium (Mg) is a metal with low electronegativity, which means it does not easily attract electrons but easily loses both the electrons in its outer shell during chemical reactions. It therefore only exists in nature as a compound with other elements in the form of a positively charged Mg2+ cation. For example, this most stable form of Mg2+ is found in various minerals or in chlorophyll, which is the pigment that makes plants green.The team at FAU led by Prof. Dr. Sjoerd Harder, Chair of Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry, has now discovered the first complexes of magnesium in which the metal has a zero-oxidation state. The oxidation numbers in chemical compounds indicate the charge of the atoms, which means in this case that the researchers have managed to isolate elemental Mg in complex compounds. As is so often the case in scientific research, this discovery was purely accidental. The research team had actually planned to split magnesium-magnesium bonds in order to produce magnesium radicals. Metallic sodium was used during this synthesis. The predicted result of the experiment was that the sodium would transfer one electron to the magnesium. Astonishingly, however, two sodium atoms transferred electrons to the magnesium and an Mg(0) complex that has never previously been observed was formed. The Mg centres in these complexes formally even carry a negative charge due to a unique magnesium sodium bond and thus react completely differently than conventional Mg2+ compounds. Whereas the electron-poor Mg2+ cations can accept electrons, the electron-rich Mg(0) reacts like a negatively charged anion by losing electrons. This complex is soluble in organic solvents like toluene or benzene and is an extremely strong reducing agent, which is an element or compound that donates electrons to another element or compound. Slightly heating the complex led the Mg(0) to donate some of its electrons to the positively charged sodium cation (Na+), which then became elemental sodium metal Na(0). This is quite unusual, since sodium itself is a metal that has an even stronger tendency to lose electrons. This reaction created a new complex: three atoms of magnesium strung together like beads on a necklace. This triple core magnesium cluster reacts like atomic Mg(0) and can be considered as the smallest form of magnesium metal, one that is soluble in organic solvents. This new class of magnesium complexes represents a landmark in the chemistry of magnesium. The FAU research team led by Prof. Harder expect to discover further unusual reactivity of this soluble and extremely strong reducing agent.ReferenceR sch B, Gentner T X, Eyselein J et al.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/compound-may-prevent-risk-of-drug-induced-arrhythmia-348816,Compound May Prevent Risk of Drug Induced Arrhythmia Researchers have identified a compound that prevents the lengthening of the heart s electrical event  resulting in a major step toward improved safety and expanded therapeutic efficacy of drugs that are known to induce arrhythmia  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Dozens of commonly used drugs, including antibiotics, antinausea and anticancer medications, have a potential side effect of lengthening the electrical event that triggers contraction, creating an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrhythmia called acquired Long QT syndrome. While safe in their current dosages, some of these drugs may have a more therapeutic benefit at higher doses, but are limited by the risk of arrhythmia.Through both computational and experimental validation, a multi-institutional team of researchers has identified a compound that prevents the lengthening of the heart's electrical event, or action potential, resulting in a major step toward safer use and expanded therapeutic efficacy of these medications when taken in combination. The team found that the compound, named C28, not only prevents or reverses the negative physiological effects on the action potential, but does not cause any change on the normal action potential when used alone at the same concentrations. The results, found through rational drug design, were published online Friday, May 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The research team was led by Jianmin Cui, professor of biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis; Ira Cohen, MD, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Physiology and Biophysics, professor of medicine, and director of the Institute for Molecular Cardiology at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University; and Xiaoqin Zou, professor of physics, biochemistry, and a member of the Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center and Institute for Data Science and Informatics at the University of Missouri.The drugs in question, as well as several that have been pulled from the market, cause a prolongation of the QT interval of the heartbeat, known as acquired Long QT Syndrome, that predisposes patients to cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. In rare cases, Long QT also can be caused by specific mutations in genes that code for ion channel proteins, which conduct the ionic currents to generate the action potential. Although there are several types of ion channels in the heart, a change in one or more of them may lead to this arrhythmia, which contributes to about 200,000 to 300,000 sudden deaths a year, more than deaths from stroke, lung cancer or breast cancer.The team selected a specific target, IKs, for this work because it is one of the two potassium channels that are activated during the action potential: IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow).""The rapid one plays a major role in the action potential,"" said Cohen, one of the world's top electrophysiologists. ""If you block it, Long QT results, and you get a long action potential. IKs is very slow and contributes much less to the normal action potential duration.""It was this difference in roles that suggested that increasing IKs might not significantly affect normal electrical activity but could shorten a prolonged action potential.Cui, an internationally renowned expert on ion channels, and the team wanted to determine if the prolongation of the QT interval could be prevented by compensating for the change in current and inducing the Long QT Syndrome by enhancing IKs. They identified a site on the voltage-sensing domain of the IKs potassium ion channel that could be accessed by small molecules.Zou, an internationally recognized expert who specializes in developing new and efficient algorithms for predicting protein interactions, and the team used the atomic structure of the KCNQ1 unit of the IKs channel protein to computationally screen a library of a quarter of a million small compounds that targeted this voltage-sensing domain of the KCNQ1 protein unit. To do this, they developed software called MDock to test the interaction of small compounds with a specific protein in silico, or computationally. By identifying the geometric and chemical traits of the small compounds, they can find the one that fits into the protein -- sort of a high-tech, 3D jigsaw puzzle. While it sounds simple, the process is quite complicated as it involves charge interactions, hydrogen bonding and other physicochemical interactions of both the protein and the small compound.""We know the problems, and the way to make great progress is to identify the weaknesses and challenges and fix them,"" Zou said. ""We know the functional and structural details of the protein, so we can use an algorithm to dock each molecule onto the protein at the atomic level.""One by one, Zou and her lab docked the potential compounds with the protein KCNQ1 and compared the binding energy of each one. They selected about 50 candidates with very negative, or tight, binding energies.Cui and his lab then identified C28 using experiments out of the 50 candidates identified in silico by Zou's lab. They validated the docking results by measuring the shift of voltage-dependent activation of the IKs channel at various concentrations of C28 to confirm that C28 indeed enhances the IKs channel function. They also studied a series of genetically modified IKs channels to reveal the binding of C28 to the site for the in silico screening.Cohen and his lab tested the C28 compound in ventricular myocytes from a small mammal model that expresses the same IKs channel as humans. They found that C28 could prevent or reverse the drug-induced prolongation of the electrical signals across the cardiac cell membrane and minimally affected the normal action potentials at the same dosage. They also determined that there were no significant effects on atrial muscle cells, an important control for the drug's potential use.""We are very excited about this,"" Cohen said. ""In many of these medications, there is a concentration of the drug that is acceptable, and at higher doses, it becomes dangerous. If C28 can eliminate the danger of inducing Q-T prolongation, then these drugs can be used at higher concentrations, and in many cases, they can become more therapeutic.""While the compound needs additional verification and testing, the researchers say there is tremendous potential for this compound or others like it and could help to convert second-line drugs into first-line drugs and return others to the market. With assistance from the Washington University Office of Technology Management, they have patented the compound, and Cui has founded a startup company, VivoCor, to continue to work on the compound and others like it as potential drug candidates. The work was accelerated by a Leadership and Entrepreneurial Acceleration Program (LEAP) Inventor Challenge grant Washington University in St. Louis in 2018 funded by the Office of Technology Management, the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences, the Center for Drug Discovery, the Center for Research Innovation in Biotechnology, and the Skandalaris Center for Interdisciplinary Innovation and Entrepreneurship.""This work was done by an effective drug design approach: identifying a critical site in the ion channel based on understanding of structure-function relation, using in silico docking to identify compounds that interact with the critical site in the ion channel, validating functional modulation of the ion channel by the compound, and demonstrating therapeutic potential in cardiac myocytes,"" Zou said.

The finding suggests that physicians could consider treating male patients with stomach inflammation differently than female patients with the same condition. The study was published in Gastroenterology.Researchers at NIH's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) made the discovery after removing adrenal glands from mice of both sexes. Adrenal glands produce glucocorticoids, hormones that have several functions, one of them being suppressing inflammation. With no glucocorticoids, the female mice soon developed stomach inflammation. The males did not. However, after removing androgens from the males, they exhibited the same stomach inflammation seen in the females""The fact that androgens are regulating inflammation is a novel idea,"" said co-corresponding author John Cidlowski, Ph.D., deputy chief of the NIEHS Laboratory of Signal Transduction and head of the Molecular Endocrinology Group. ""Along with glucocorticoids, androgens offer a new way to control immune function in humans.""While this study provides insight into how inflammation is being regulated in males, Cidlowski said additional research is underway to understand the process in females. The scientist handling this phase of research is co-corresponding author Jonathan Busada, Ph.D., assistant professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine in Morgantown. When Busada started the project several years ago, he was a postdoctoral fellow working in Cidlowski's group.Whether inflammation is inside the stomach or elsewhere in the body, Busada said rates of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases vary depending on sex. He said eight out of 10 individuals with autoimmune disease are women, and his long-term goal is to figure out how glucocorticoids and androgens affect stomach cancer, which is induced by chronic inflammation.The current research focused on stomach glands called pits, which are embedded in the lining of the stomach.Busada said the study showed that glucocorticoids and androgens act like brake pedals on the immune system and are essential for regulating stomach inflammation. In his analogy, glucocorticoids are the primary brakes and androgens are the emergency brakes.""Females only have one layer of protection, so if you remove glucocorticoids, they develop stomach inflammation and a pre-cancerous condition in the stomach called spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM),"" Busada said. ""Males have redundancy built in, so if something cuts the glucocorticoid brake line, it is okay, because the androgens can pick up the slack.""The research also offered a possible mechanism -- or biological process -- behind this phenomenon. In healthy stomach glands, the presence of glucocorticoids and androgens inhibit special immune cells called type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). But in diseased stomach glands, the hormones are missing. As a result, ILC2s may act like a fire alarm, directing other immune cells called macrophages to promote inflammation and damage gastric glands leading to SPEM and ultimately cancer.""ILC2s are the only immune cells that contain androgen receptors and could be a potential therapeutic target,"" Cidlowski said.Reference: Busada JT, Peterson KN, Khadka S, et al.

They first evolved to perform photosynthesis about 2.4 billion years ago, pumping tons of oxygen into the atmosphere   a period known as the Great Oxygenation Event   which enabled the evolution of multicellular life forms.Led by BTI faculty member Fay-Wei Li, researchers have discovered a new species of cyanobacteria, Anthocerotibacter panamensis, which could help illuminate how photosynthesis evolved to create the world as we know it. The work was published in Current Biology on May 13.  We never intended to discover a new species,  said Li.  It was a total accident.  His lab was working on a project to isolate cyanobacteria from hornwort plants, and noticed something weird in a sample from a rainforest in Panama. The researchers sequenced the cyanobacterium s DNA, and found that it belonged to a group called Gloeobacteria, which is extremely rare.  Prior to this discovery, only two species of Gloeobacteria had been isolated,  Li said.  There is also a third group of uncultured species from the Arctic and Antarctic regions, but no one knows how many species are in that group.  Gloeobacteria diverged from the more commonly studied Phycobacteria about 2 billion years ago. The two groups have many differences, and A. panamensis shares some traits with each. Similar to other Gloeobacteria, the new species lacks thylakoids   the membrane-bound compartments that are the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis in Phycobacteria and plants.  Now we can be pretty sure that the thylakoid evolved in Phycobacteria,  Li said. On the other hand, A. panamensis makes carotenoids   a group of compounds that help protect an organism from sun damage   in a fashion similar to Phycobacteria and plants, but different from the other Gloeobacteria.  These results suggest that this particular carotenoid biosynthesis pathway evolved in the ancestor of all cyanobacteria, and then was lost in some Gloeobacteria,  said Li. Li said one of the more interesting findings is that A. panamensis has very few genes that encode the proteins that perform light-dependent reactions. The researchers found that the new species could still perform photosynthesis, but very slowly, which could be of interest to synthetic biologists.  If you want to build a complete set of photosynthetic machinery with the fewest necessary components, then this species could inform how to do that,  said Li.  Anthocerotibacter has a minimal set of photosystem subunits, but it still functions. ReferenceRahmatpour N et al.

How do you do it?For a vaccine to induce an immune response, it has to contain elements that stimulate the cells of the immune system--the famous white blood cells.These elements, called adjuvants, are ingredients in all vaccines. They allow the human body to perceive potential danger and contain the threat by sending its army of immune cells.Our approach consists of using oncolytic viruses to stimulate this immune response and direct it towards the cancer. To succeed, we create a vaccine by mixing viruses with synthetic peptides (antigens) that resemble the targeted cancer.Because it's true that, to be effective, the vaccine has to be personalized for each patient, based on the mutations specific to each cancer cell. Thanks to the identification work done by other research teams, we can predict what peptides to use for each patient through the information obtained from a biopsy.The advantage of our approach is that the oncolytic viruses themselves have the power to kill the cancer. We can thus attack the cancer on two fronts: kill it directly with the virus and induce an immune response, thanks not only to the virus, but to the vaccine as well.On our mice, we were able to show the efficacy of the resulting immunization.What sets your vaccine strategy apart from clinical trials currently being conducted by other teams?The other clinically tested personalized anti-cancer vaccines don't use oncolytic viruses as vaccination adjuvants. Therefore, their adjuvant doesn't have direct anti-cancer effects whereas, in our case, our viruses can destroy the cancer.An anti-cancer vaccine using oncolytic viruses is currently being tested in Canada and the U.S. However, it is not personalized. Instead, it targets certain specific cancers that have an antigen in common. By targeting this antigen, the vaccine induces an immune response.In this case, the oncolytic viruses have to be genetically modified to allow for the insertion of the antigen into the genome of the viruses.This is very different from our approach. We can target all cancers without genetic modification. A little like putting together Lego--it's a matter of mixing synthetic peptides resembling the cancer with the chosen virus. It will be a lot easier to implement in a clinical setting.What challenges need to be addressed before your personalized anti-cancer vaccination approach can be translated to clinical practice?The main challenge is to identify the mutations that we want to vaccinate against. Because a cancer is unique in its tens or hundreds of mutations, but only a few of them, once targeted, will have a therapeutic effect and allow us to eliminate it.The identification of these mutations is the key step that still has to be optimized. Fortunately, many groups are working in this area.Reference: Roy DG, Geoffroy K, Marguerie M. et al. Adjuvant oncolytic virotherapy for personalized anti-cancer vaccination.

Now, a team of scientists from Tokyo University of Science has developed a screening method based on cultured plant cells that makes such testing easier. This may lead to microorganism-based crop protection methods that reduce the need for chemical pesticides.Plants have evolved unique immunity mechanisms that they can activate upon detecting the presence of a pathogen. Interestingly, the presence of some nonpathogenic microorganisms can also prompt a plant to activate its systemic immunity mechanisms, and some studies have shown that pretreating agricultural crops with such ""immunity-activating"" nonpathogenic microorganisms can leave the crops better prepared to fight off infections from pathogenic microorganisms. In effect, this means that immunity-activating nonpathogenic microorganisms can function like vaccines for plants, providing a low-risk stimulus for the plant's immune system that prepares it for dealing with genuine threats. These are exciting findings for crop scientists because they suggest the possibility of using such pretreatment as a form of biological pest control that would reduce the need for agricultural pesticides. However, before pretreatment with nonpathogenic microorganisms can become a standard agricultural technology, scientists need a way to screen microorganisms for the ability to stimulate plant immune systems without harming the plants. There is currently no simple method for evaluating the ability of microorganisms to activate plant immune systems. Conventional methods involve the use of whole plants and microorganisms, and this inevitably makes conventional screening a time-consuming and expensive affair. To address this problem, Associate Professor Toshiki Furuya and Professor Kazuyuki Kuchitsu of Tokyo University of Science and their colleagues decided to develop a screening strategy involving cultured plant cells. A description of their method appears in a paper recently published in Scientific Reports. The first step in this screening strategy involves incubating the candidate microorganism together with BY-2 cells, which are tobacco plant cells known for their rapid and stable growth rates. The next step is to treat the BY-2 cells with cryptogein, which is a protein secreted by fungus-like pathogenic microorganisms that can elicit immune responses from tobacco plants. A key part of the cryptogein-induced immune responses is the production of a class of chemicals called reactive oxygen species (ROS), and scientists can easily measure cryptogein-induced ROS production and use it as a metric for evaluating the effects of the nonpathogenic microorganisms. To put it simply, an effective pretreatment agent will increase the BY-2 cells' ROS production levels (i.e., cause the cells to exhibit stronger immune system activation) in response to cryptogein exposure. To test the practicability of their screening strategy, Dr. Furuya and his colleagues used the strategy on 29 bacterial strains isolated from the interior of the Japanese mustard spinach plant (Brassica rapa var. perviridis), and they found that 8 strains boosted cryptogein-induced ROS production. They then further tested those 8 strains by applying them to the root tips of seedlings from the Arabidopsis genus, which contains species commonly used as model organisms for studies of plant biology. Interestingly, 2 of the 8 tested strains induced whole-plant resistance to bacterial pathogens. Based on the proof-of-concept findings concerning those 2 bacterial strains, Dr. Furuya proudly notes that his team's screening method ""can streamline the acquisition of microorganisms that activate the immune system of plants."" When asked how he envisions the screening method affecting agricultural practices, he explains that he expects his team's screening system ""to be a technology that contributes to the practical application and spread of microbial alternatives to chemical pesticides."" In time, the novel screening method developed by Dr. Furuya and team may make it significantly easier for crop scientists create greener agricultural methods that rely on the defense mechanisms that plants themselves have evolved over millions of years.ReferenceKurokawa M, Nakano M, Kitahata N, Kuchitsu K, Furuya T.

Their findings will be used to make more accurate models of the future movement of the world's second-largest ice sheet, as the effects of climate change continue to accelerate.The research team, led by the University of Cambridge, used a new technique in which laser pulses are transmitted in a fibre-optic cable to obtain highly detailed temperature measurements from the surface of the ice sheet all the way to the base, more than 1000 metres below.In contrast to previous studies, which measured temperature from separate sensors located tens or even hundreds of metres apart, the new approach allows temperature to be measured along the entire length of a fibre-optic cable installed in a deep borehole. The result is a highly detailed profile of temperature, which controls how fast ice deforms and ultimately how fast the ice sheet flows.The temperature of ice sheets was thought to vary as a smooth gradient, with the warmest sections on the surface where the sun hits, and at the base where it's warmed by geothermal energy and friction as the ice sheet grinds across the subglacial landscape toward the ocean.The new study found instead that the temperature distribution is far more heterogenous, with areas of highly localised deformation warming the ice further. This deformation is concentrated at the boundaries between ice of different ages and types. Although the exact cause of this deformation remains unknown, it may be due to dust in the ice from past volcanic eruptions or large fractures which penetrate several hundred metres below the surface of the ice. The results are reported in the journal Science Advances.Mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet has increased sixfold since the 1980s and is now the single largest contributor to global sea-level rise. Around half of this mass loss is from surface meltwater runoff, while the other half is driven by discharge of ice directly into the ocean by fast flowing glaciers that reach the sea.In order to determine how the ice is moving and the thermodynamic processes at work within a glacier, accurate ice temperature measurements are essential. Conditions on the surface can be detected by satellites or field observations in a relatively straightforward way. However, determining what is happening at the base of the kilometre thick ice sheet is far more challenging to observe, and a lack of observations is a major cause of uncertainty in projections of global sea-level rise.The RESPONDER project, funded by the European Research Council, is addressing this problem using hot-water drilling technology to bore through Sermeq Kujalleq (Store Glacier) and directly study the environment at the base of one of Greenland's largest glaciers.""We normally take measurements within the ice sheet by attaching sensors to a cable that we lower into a drilled borehole, but the observations we've made so far weren't giving us a complete picture of what's happening,"" said co-author Dr Poul Christoffersen from the Scott Polar Research Institute who leads the RESPONDER project. ""The more precise data we are able to gather, the clearer we can make that picture, which in turn will help us make more accurate predictions for the future of the ice sheet.""""With typical sensing methods, we can only attach about a dozen sensors onto the cable, so the measurements are very spaced out,"" said first author Robert Law, a PhD candidate at the Scott Polar Research Institute. ""But by using a fibre-optic cable instead, essentially the whole cable becomes a sensor, so we can get precise measurements from the surface all the way to the base.""To install the cable, the scientists had to first drill through the glacier, a process led by Professor Bryn Hubbard and Dr Samuel Doyle from Aberystwyth University. After lowering the cable into the borehole, the team transmitted laser pulses in the cable, and then recorded the distortions in the scattering of light in the cable, which vary depending on the temperature of the surrounding ice. Engineers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and geophysicists at the University of Leeds assisted with data collection and analysis.""This technology is a big advance in our ability to record spatial variations in ice temperature over long distances and at really high resolution. With some further adaptations, the technique can also record other properties, such as deformation, at similarly high resolution,"" said Hubbard.""Overall, our readings paint a picture that's far more varied than what current theory and models predict,"" said Christoffersen. ""We found temperature to be strongly influenced by the deformation of ice in bands and at the boundaries between different types of ice. And this shows there are limitations in many models, including our own.""The researchers found three layers of ice in the glacier. The thickest layer consists of cold and stiff ice which formed over the last 10,000 years. Below, they found older ice from the last ice age, which is softer and more deformable due to dust trapped in the ice. What surprised the researchers the most, however, was a layer of warm ice more than 70 metres thick at the bottom of the glacier. ""We know this type of warm ice from far warmer Alpine environments, but here the glacier is producing the heat by deforming itself,"" said Law.""With these observations, we are starting to better understand why the Greenland Ice Sheet is losing mass so quickly and why discharge of ice is such a prominent mechanism of ice loss,"" said Christoffersen.One of the major limitations in our understanding of climate change is tied to the behaviour of glaciers and ice sheets. The new data will allow the researchers to improve their models of how the Greenland Ice Sheet is currently moving, how it may move in the future, and what that this will mean for global sea-level rise.Reference: Law R, Christoffersen P, Hubbard B, et al.

The researchers believe by inhibiting the receptor, they may be able to eliminate toxic side-effects from the drug that cause the hearing loss.Cisplatin is an incredibly effective chemotherapeutic when it comes to treating solid tumours in children, contributing to an 80 per cent overall survival rate over five years, according to U of A researcher Amit Bhavsar, an assistant professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology. The problem has always been with the side-effects. Nearly 100 per cent of patients who receive higher doses of cisplatin show some degree of permanent hearing loss. The ability to prevent this side-effect would dramatically improve the quality of life of childhood cancer survivors after they recover from the disease.As Bhavsar explains, many researchers look at cisplatin's damaging side-effects from the angle of genetics, trying to determine underlying risk factors for hearing loss or examine how it works as a chemotherapeutic. A fair amount was known about the progression of hearing loss as a side-effect, but it was the initial spark--the instigating factor kicking everything off--that remained a mystery.Bhavsar and his team thought outside the box and took things all the way back to the periodic table with their approach, getting some clues from the chemical composition of cisplatin itself and eventually identifying a particular receptor that was getting turned on.The receptor in question is Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is involved in the body's immune response. TLR4 works by crossing the cell membrane, sticking a portion of itself outside the cell to sample the environment and to look for different signals that indicate damage or danger of some sort.""It's a receptor that your body normally uses to detect when there's some sort of issue, like an infection. This receptor will turn on, and it'll start producing these signals that tell the cell it's under stress. Unfortunately in the case of cisplatin, those signals ultimately lead to the death of the cells responsible for hearing.""The cells affected by TLR4's signals are located within the cochlea of the ear, where they play a crucial role in hearing, translating vibrations in the ear into electrical impulses. Cisplatin also accumulates in the kidneys, but the difference is that it can be flushed out and diluted in that area of the body; in a closed system such as the ear, it accumulates and damages the cells.""These cells don't renew. You really only get one shot and if they're gone, you're in trouble. The hearing loss is permanent,"" said Bhavsar.The only way to prevent the damage is to stop the signals TLR4 produces that lead to the accumulation of cisplatin. To confirm the efficacy of inhibiting the TLR4 receptor, Bhavsar and his team looked at zebrafish models, with the help of Ted Allison, an associate professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and member of the U of A's Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute. They examined neuromasts, which are sensory cells within zebrafish that behave similarly to the human hair cells typically damaged by cisplatin. Bhavsar was able to prove that inhibiting TLR4 led to an inhibition of the damage on the sensory cells.Bhavsar, a member of the Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta (CRINA), the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology and the Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI), is collaborating with CRINA member Frederick West and Allison to refine an inhibitor that can disrupt this sampling process, removing the function that causes the toxic side-effect while still keeping the immune sensor function intact so patients don't become immunocompromised.""It really does open the door for potential therapeutics,"" said Bhavsar.Reference: Babolmorad G, Latif A, Domingo IK, et al.

Currently, 95% of all human cell lines used in research are of European descent. The authors provide actionable steps that researchers and the biomedical community can take to promote more inclusivity in preclinical and basic science research.The commentary, ""Ancestry Matters: Building inclusivity into preclinical study design,"" is co-authored by Sophie Zaaijer, PhD, who co-founded FIND Genomics (findgen.bio), a company that aims to improve reproducible cell-based science through its genetic cell tracking software ""FIND Cell"", and is affiliated with Cornell Tech, New York, and by Amanda Capes-Davis, PhD, from Children's Medical Research Institute (CMRI) in Sydney, Australia. The authors emphasize that lack of action now could have a far-reaching negative impact on the future of precision medicine for people of non-European ancestry.Human cell lines play a vital role in medical research. About a thousand cell lines are commonly used and kept in storage, such as at CellBank Australia, which was founded by Dr Capes-Davis. The authors of this publication point out that most of the commonly used cell lines were sourced in the 1960s and 1970s and predominantly come from people of European descent.""As the Black Lives Matter movement was unfolding before our eyes, we saw this as an opportunity to highlight the same issue in the cells we look at every day under the microscope - the timing just seemed right,"" Dr Capes-Davis says.""We explain in our report how the lack of diversity had slipped into biomedical research unconsciously yet systematically, "" says Dr. Zaaijer. "" Now the time has come to correct this inequity.""Dr. Zaaijer adds, ""Let's take drug discovery as an example; a process that heavily relies on human cell lines for initial drug screening. If most of the cell lines used to discover new drug treatments are from people of European descent, do those drugs work equally well in non-European individuals? More and more evidence has come to light showing that, unfortunately, this is not always the case.""Some diseases are more common in particular communities, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish community, which has a high rate of genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and breast and ovarian cancer. The African American community has a relatively high rate of prostate cancer in men - yet only one in ten prostate cell lines regularly used in research is of African descent. Lack of diversity in prostate cancer cell lines means that initial anticancer drug screening may miss compounds that are particularly effective for African American men.Why is there a lack of diverse cell lines available to science?Lack of trust in medical research is an important reason why some communities have hesitated to donate cells for scientific discovery - and with reason. Past breaches of trust, such as the historical use of tissue samples without consent, affected community perceptions of research. Recently, however, impressive efforts have been made to form respectful partnerships between community groups and researchers to improve trust and inclusivity.""A successful model of collaboration between under-represented communities and the scientific community is the M ori in New Zealand, who have worked closely with researchers to develop guidelines for cell and tissue donation using culturally safe practices,"" Dr Capes-Davis says. ""This kind of initiative should be replicated and scaled up worldwide.""Conscious inclusion of diverse cell lines is important for personalised medicineThe biomedical landscape is slowly changing, partially driven by new funding models. In a new research initiative being spearheaded by the New York Genome Center, leaders of the New York City cancer research community have joined together to advance cancer genomics and its practice in clinical care by leveraging the City's large and diverse population. This innovative collaborative project, Polyethnic-1000, is designed to deepen understanding of the contributions ethnicities make to the incidence and behavior of cancers, thereby improving outcomes for many patients, especially those who currently lack access to the most recent advances in medical science. In September, 2020, Polyethnic-1000 awarded grants to fund seven projects that address the role of ethnicity in several major cancer types, taking advantage of the diversity of patients being treated at health care institutions throughout the New York City area.Considering the genetic variation within the human population is critical for providing personalized care"", says Nicolas Robine PhD, Director of Computational Biology at the New York Genome Center. ""However, after finding population specific variants associated with higher incidences of disease, you need hands-on experiments in the laboratory to find a cure. Using representative cell lines during this phase is key for progress"".""When you or your loved ones donate cells for science -- wouldn't you want your cells to be actually used for developing effective treatments in the lab?"" Dr Zaaijer asks. ""It is time for more conscious and strategic consideration of cell line inclusivity in preclinical and fundamental research by laboratory scientists, out of respect for cell and tissue donors and to better serve the needs of all communities.""Change is not a simple process particularly for cell-based research projects, which can take many years to complete. Improving diversity means changing habits, and means managing more cell lines to ensure that many ancestral backgrounds are included. These efforts in particular may form a serious burden for scientists working with cell lines each day.""We saw an urgent need for tools to make organising, collaborating and tracking cell lines easy,"" Dr Zaaijer says. To address that need, FIND Genomics developed a cutting-edge software platform specially designed for digitizing cell culture called FIND Cell that integrates daily cell tracking and management with genetic verifications. ""FIND Cell can help to scale up inclusive biomedical experimental design"" Dr Zaaijer adds.In their report in Cell, the authors propose further actions to improve cell diversity for researchers, biobanks, publishers, funding agencies, and community representatives to consider. ""We hope we can contribute to finding cures for all people in the long run, but it all starts with becoming aware of the problem and working together on solutions,"" says Dr Capes-Davis.Reference: Zaaijer S, Capes-Davis A.

Breast tissue changes dramatically throughout a woman's life, so finding markers for sudden changes that can lead to cancer is especially difficult. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Associate Professor Camila dos Santos and her team identified and cataloged thousands of normal human and mouse breast cell types. The new catalog redefines healthy breast tissue so that when something goes awry, scientists can pinpoint its origin.Any breast cell could become cancerous. Dos Santos says:""To understand breast cancer risk, you have to understand normal breast cells first, so when we think about preventive and even targeting therapies, you would be preventing the right cell types from developing to cancer cells.""A traditional way to catalog cells is by tracking a few signature genes related to the cell's function. To classify cells more extensively, dos Santos' team turned to a technique known as single-cell RNA sequencing. They tracked the activity of several genes in over 15,000 cells in mouse and human breast tissue. Samantha Henry, a Stony Brook University graduate student-in-residence in dos Santos' lab, says:""We really created a whole catalog of many genes for each cell population to better define them. And when I say there were a lot of genes, there were a lot of genes and it took a long time to get through.""One cell group included estrogen receptor-positive cells, which are generally amenable to treatment. But dos Santos' team found that this group could be split into several subpopulations, where each one might have different responses to therapies.The team, in collaboration with computational biologist CSHL Professor Adam Siepel and his team, learned that mice and human breast cells had similar genetic profiles, demonstrating why studies in mice are likely to be relevant to humans. Marygrace Trousdell, a computational science developer in the dos Santos lab, says:""We're always finding ourselves struggling with definitive classifications of certain cell types. Sometimes I think I've seen every gene out there, and then something else will pop up.""Currently, the lab is trying to distinguish normal genetic shifts from those associated with cancer. Dos Santos hopes that her catalog of breast cell types will point to which kinds of cells to monitor and point researchers toward treatment options in the future.Reference: Henry S, Trousdell MC, Cyrill SL, et al.

The bioactive scaffolds are made in the lab via electrospinning, a high-throughput process that can produce single micron-scale fibers.The research could ease the burden of performing an estimated 4.5 million reconstructive surgeries per year to repair injuries suffered by civilians and military personnel.Current methods of electrospinning decellularized muscle require a copolymer to aid in scaffold fabrication. The Rice process does not.""The major innovation is the ability to prepare scaffolds that are 100% extracellular matrix,"" said Rice bioengineer and principal investigator Antonios Mikos. ""That's very important because the matrix includes all the signaling motifs that are important for the formation of the particular tissue.""The scaffolds leverage bioactive cues from decellularized muscle with the tunable material properties afforded through electrospinning to create a material rich with biochemical signals and highly specific topography. The material is designed to degrade as it is replaced by new muscle within the body.Experiments revealed that cells proliferate best when the scaffolds are not saturated with a crosslinking agent, allowing them access to the biochemical cues within the scaffold matrix.Electrospinning allowed the researchers to modulate crosslink density. They found that intermediate crosslinking led to better retention of fiber alignment during cell culture.Most decellularized matrix for muscle regeneration comes from such thin membranes as skin or small intestine tissue. ""But for muscle, because it's thick and more complex, you have to cut it smaller than clinically relevant sizes and the original material properties are lost,"" said Rice graduate student and lead author Mollie Smoak. ""It doesn't resemble the original material by the time you're done.""In our case, electrospinning was the key to make this material very tunable and have it resemble what it once was,"" she said.""It can generate fibers that are highly aligned, very similar to the architecture that one finds in skeletal muscle, and with all the biochemical cues needed to facilitate the creation of viable muscle tissue,"" Mikos said.Mikos said using natural materials rather than synthetic is important for another reason. ""The presence of a synthetic material, and especially the degradation products, may have an adverse effect on the quality of tissue that is eventually formed,"" he said.""For eventual clinical application, we may use a skeletal muscle or matrix from an appropriate source because we're able to very efficiently remove the DNA that may elicit an immune response. We believe that may make it suitable to translate the technology for humans.""Smoak said the electrospinning process can produce muscle scaffolds in any size, limited only by the machinery.""We're fortunate to collaborate with a number of surgeons, and they see promise in this material being used for craniofacial muscle applications in addition to sports- or trauma-induced injuries to large muscles,"" she said.

It suggests that ancient cell types in the pallium - the outer regions of the brain that include cortex - most likely retained features over millions of years that are the building blocks for advanced cognition in birds and mammals.""We as neuroscientists are catching on that birds can do sophisticated things and they have sophisticated circuits to do those things,"" says behavioral neuroscientist Luke Remage-Healey, associate professor of psychological and brain sciences and senior author of the paper.For the first time, the team of neuroscientists, including lead author Jeremy Spool, who worked as a National Institutes of Health (NIH) postdoctoral fellow in Remage-Healey's lab, used viral optogenetics to define the molecular identities of excitatory and inhibitory cell types in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and match them to their physiological properties.""In the songbird community, we've had a hunch for a long time that when we record the electrical signatures of these two cell types, we say - 'that's a putative excitatory neuron, that's a putative inhibitory neuron.' Now we know that these features are grounded in molecular truth,"" Remage-Healey says. ""Without being able to pinpoint the cell types with these viruses, we wouldn't be able to learn how the cell and network features bear resemblance to those in mammals, because the brain architectures are so different.""The research team used viruses from a collection curated by co-author Yoko Yazaki-Sugiyama at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan to conduct viral optogenetic experiments in the brain. With optogenetics, the team used flashes of light to manipulate one cell type independent of the other. The team targeted excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons (using CaMKII  and GAD1 promoters, respectively) in the zebra finch auditory pallium to test predictions based on the mammalian pallium.""There's so much work out there on the physiology of these different cell types in the mammalian cortex that we were able to line up a series of predictions about what features birds may or may not have,"" Spool says.The CaMKII  and GAD1 populations in the songbird were distinct ""in exactly the proportions you would expect from the mammalian brain,"" Spool says. With the cell type populations isolated, the researchers then examined systematically whether each population would correspond to the physiology of their mammalian counterparts.""As we kept moving forward, again and again these cell populations were acting as if they were essentially from the mammalian cortex in a lot of physiological ways,"" Spool says.Remage-Healey adds, ""The correspondence between the cortex in mammals and what we're pulling out with molecularly identified cell types in birds is pretty striking.""In both birds and mammals, these neurons are thought to support advanced cognitive functions, such as memory, individual recognition and associative learning, Spool says.Remage-Healey says the research, supported by NIH grants, helps delineate ""the basic nuts and bolts of how the brain operates."" Knowing the nuts and bolts builds foundations necessary to develop breakthroughs that could lead to neurological interventions for brain disorders.""This can help us figure out what brain diversity is out there by unpacking these circuits and the ways they can go awry,"" Remage-Healey says.Reference: Spool JA, Macedo-Lima M, Scarpa G, et al.

However, researchers from the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience have now discovered a new brain circuit underlying curiosity and novelty seeking behavior. The results have been published in the scientific journal Science.Curiosity, hunger and appetitive aggression drive three different goal-directed behaviors: novelty seeking, food eating and hunting. In animals these behaviors are composed of similar actions.

A group of 39 researchers from 14 countries, including two from the University of Colorado Boulder, say that needs to change to reduce disease transmission and prevent the next pandemic.In a Perspectives piece published in Science May 14, they call for a ""paradigm shift"" in combating airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, demanding universal recognition that respiratory infections can be prevented by improving indoor ventilation systems.""Air can contain viruses just as water and surfaces do,"" said co-author Shelly Miller, professor of mechanical and environmental engineering. ""We need to understand that it's a problem and that we need to have, in our toolkit, approaches to mitigating risk and reducing the possible exposures that could happen from build-up of viruses in indoor air.""The paper comes less than two weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its website to acknowledge that SARS-CoV-2 is spread predominantly through the air, and 10 months after the WHO acknowledged the potential for aerosol transmission and 239 scientists (including Miller and Jose-Luis Jimenez) signed an open letter to medical communities and governing bodies about the potential risk of airborne transmission. The researchers now call on the WHO and other governing bodies in this new article to extend its indoor air quality guidelines to include airborne pathogens and to recognize the need to control hazards of airborne transmission of respiratory infections.Such a shift in ventilation standards should be similar in scale to the 19th century transformation that took place when cities started organizing clean water supplies and centralized sewage systems. But it would also correct a major scientific misperception that arose around the same time.When people in London were dying of cholera in the 1850s, scientists assumed the disease was airborne. But British physician John Snow discovered that microorganisms in contaminated water were the reason. Similarly, Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis showed that handwashing before delivering a baby greatly reduced postpartum infections. While these discoveries encountered great resistance in their time, scientists eventually agreed that in these cases, water and hands--not air--were the vector for disease.Then in the early 20th century, American public health expert Charles Chapin erroneously attributed respiratory infections caught in close proximity to other people to large droplets produced by an infected person, which fall quickly to the ground. As a result, he stated that airborne transmission was almost impossible.Yet in 1945, scientist William Wells published a paper in the predecessor to Science, lamenting that while we were investing in disinfecting water and keeping our food clean, we had done nothing for our indoor air, given the denial of airborne transmission. His research on measles and tuberculosis--caused by airborne pathogens--challenged this notion in the 20th century, but didn't break it.Now that the research on SARS-CoV-2 finally has brought to light that many respiratory diseases can be transmitted through the air, researchers argue that we must take action.""Let's now not waste time until the next pandemic,"" said said co-author Jose-Luis Jimenez, fellow in the Cooperative Institute of Research Sciences (CIRES) and professor of chemistry at CU Boulder. ""We need a societal effort. When we design a building, we shouldn't just put in the minimum amount of ventilation that's possible, but instead we should keep ongoing respiratory diseases, such as the flu, and future pandemics in mind.""The long-standing misunderstanding of the importance of airborne transmission of pathogens has left a large gap of information in how to best construct and manage building ventilation systems to mitigate the spread of disease--with the exception of some manufacturing, research and medical facilities. Instead, buildings have focused on temperature, odor control, energy use and perceived air quality. So while there are safety guidelines for chemicals such as carbon monoxide, there are currently no guidelines, globally or in the U.S., that regulate or provide standards for mitigating bacteria or viruses in indoor air resulting from human activities.""Air in buildings is shared air--it's not a private good, it's a public good. And we need to start treating it like that,"" said Miller.Lidia Morawska, lead author on the article and director of Queensland University of Technology's International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health, said there needs to be a shift away from the perception that we cannot afford the cost of control. She notes that the global monthly cost from COVID-19 had been conservatively estimated as $1 trillion and the cost of influenza in the U.S. alone exceeded $11.2 billion annually.While detailed economic analysis has yet to be done, estimates suggest necessary investments in building systems may be less than 1% of the construction cost of a typical building.Ventilation systems should also be demand-controlled to adjust for different room occupancies, and differing activities and breathing rates, such as exercising in a gym versus sitting in a movie theatre, according to Morawska. For spaces that cannot improve ventilation to an appropriate level for the use of the space, she said air filtration and disinfection will be needed.Because buildings consume over one-third of energy globally, much from heating or cooling outdoor air as it is brought indoors, it would be useful to design a ""pandemic mode,"" that would allow for buildings to only use more energy when necessary, said Jimenez.The researchers also call for national comprehensive indoor air quality (IAQ) standards to be developed and enforced by all countries, and for this information to be available to the public.For this to happen, however, many more than scientists will need to understand its importance.""I think there is a certain amount of demand that needs to start coming from the consumer and from the person who works in these indoor spaces in order to push change,"" said Miller.Reference: Morawska L, Allen J, Bahnfleth W, et al.

If these conditions apply, the researchers say the strategy could prevent between 47 and 26 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively.Both the Pfizer and Moderna covid-19 vaccines in a standard two dose schedule are highly effective at preventing symptomatic infections and death. But immunity worldwide remains low, partly owing to low vaccination rates.The longer it takes to effectively vaccinate the global population, the greater the likely risk of vaccine resistant strains developing. This has led to calls to prioritise single dose vaccination for as many people as possible, even if this means delaying a second dose beyond the studied time frame.The justification for this relies on the assumption that meaningful protection against covid-19 can be achieved after a single dose of vaccine, but this is the subject of intense debate.To explore this further, a team of US researchers set out to measure the impact of delayed second dose vaccine policies on infections, hospital admissions, and deaths compared with the current on-schedule two dose regimen.Using a simulation model based on a ""real-world"" sample population of 100,000 US adults, they ran a series of scenarios to forecast potentially infectious interactions under different conditions over a six-month period.These included varying levels of vaccine efficacy and administration rates, and varying assumptions as to whether the vaccine prevents transmission and serious symptoms or only prevents serious symptoms, including death.They also examined the impact of delaying second doses for those younger than 65, but not before fully vaccinating older people.The results suggest that under specific conditions a decrease in cumulative mortality, infections, and hospital admissions can be achieved when the second vaccine dose is delayed.The study replicated the simulations several times and used that data to estimate different population-level outcomes. For example, for a first dose efficacy of 80% and a daily vaccine administration rate of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1% of the population, the estimated total mortality per 100,000 for the delayed versus standard second-dose administration were 402 versus 442, 204 versus 241, and 86 versus 50, respectively.These results suggest that a delayed second dose strategy is optimal for vaccination rates at or lower than 0.3% population per day if the vaccine efficacy from one dose is 80% or greater.What's more, the delayed second dose strategy for people under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions up to an estimated 48 per 100,000.These two conditions seem reasonable on the basis of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate of first dose vaccine efficacy being 80% and only a couple countries such as the US and UK reaching a vaccination rate close to 1%, explain the researchers.They acknowledge some study limitations based on assumptions used in the model, but they aimed to capture the relevant complex human interaction that are critical in covid-19 transmission, across a timeframe that is useful to decision makers. As such, they say these results may be broadly informative for covid-19 vaccine strategy.""Decision makers will need to consider their local vaccination rates and weigh the benefits of increasing these rates by delaying a second dose versus the risks associated with the remaining uncertainty in this strategy,"" they write. ""These decisions should continue to be re-evaluated as new data become available,"" they add.Reference: Romero-Brufau S, Chopra A, Ryu AJ, et al.

They suggest state-of-the-art, controlled-environment systems, producing novel foods, should be integrated into the food system to reduce vulnerability to environmental changes, pests and diseases. Their report is published today in the journal Nature Food.The researchers say that global malnutrition could be eradicated by farming foods including spirulina, chlorella, larvae of insects such as the house fly, mycoprotein (protein derived from fungi), and macro-algae such as sugar kelp. These foods have already attracted interest as nutritious and more sustainable alternatives to traditional plant and animal-based foods. The production of these  future foods  could change the way food systems operate. They can be grown at scale in modular, compact systems suitable for urban settings as well as isolated communities such as those on remote islands. In an approach the researchers call  polycentric food networks , food could be produced locally and consistently by communities - reducing reliance on global supply chains.To reach their conclusions, the researchers analysed around 500 published scientific papers on different future food production systems. The most promising, including microalgae photo-bioreactors (devices that use a light source to grow microorganisms) and insect breeding greenhouses, reduce exposure to the hazards of the natural environment by farming in closed, controlled environments.  Foods like sugar kelp, flies, mealworm and single-celled algae such as chlorella, have the potential to provide healthy, risk-resilient diets that can address malnutrition around the world,  said Dr Asaf Tzachor, a researcher at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) at the University of Cambridge and first author of the report.He added:  Our current food system is vulnerable. It s exposed to a litany of risks - floods and frosts, droughts and dry spells, pathogens and parasites - which marginal improvements in productivity won t change. To future-proof our food supply we need to integrate completely new ways of farming into the current system.  The report argues it is dangerous to rely on food produced through conventional farming and supply systems, which are at risk of serious disruption from a variety of factors beyond human control. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this vulnerability: government-imposed restrictions on travel disrupted food production and supply chains across the world.In parallel, recent environmental challenges to food systems include wildfires and droughts in North America, outbreaks of African swine fever affecting pigs in Asia and Europe, and swarms of desert locust in East Africa. Climate change is anticipated to worsen these threats. Advances in technology open up many possibilities for alternative food supply systems that are more risk-resilient, and can efficiently supply sustainable nutrition to billions of people,  said Catherine Richards, a doctoral researcher at Cambridge s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and Department of Engineering.She added:  The coronavirus pandemic is just one example of increasing threats to our globalised food system. Diversifying our diet with these future foods will be important in achieving food security for all. The burden of malnutrition is arguably the most persistent humanitarian crisis: two billion people experience food insecurity, including over 690 million people undernourished and 340 million children suffering micro-nutrient deficiencies.The researchers say that reservations about eating novel foods like insects could be overcome by using them as ingredients rather than eating them whole: pasta, burgers and energy bars, for example, can all contain ground insect larvae and processed micro- and macro- algae.Reference: Tzachor A, Richards CE, Holt L.

This is how we work out ""where we are"". How does the brain accomplish this feat? A new study from Dartmouth College reveals that three regions of the brain in the posterior cerebral cortex, which the researchers call ""place-memory areas,"" form a link between the brain's perceptual and memory systems. The findings are published in Nature Communications.""As we navigate our surroundings, information enters the visual cortex and somehow ends up as knowledge of where we are - the question is where this transformation into spatial knowledge occurs. We think that the place-memory areas might be where this happens,"" explains lead author Adam Steel, a Neukom Fellow with the department of psychology and brain sciences in the Robertson Lab at Dartmouth. ""When you look at the location of the brain areas that process visual scenes and those that process spatial memories, these place-memory areas literally form a bridge between the two systems. Each of the brain areas involved in visual processing are paired with a place-memory counterpart.""For the study, an innovative methodology was employed. Participants were asked to perceive and recall places that they had been to in the real world during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which produced high-resolution, subject specific maps of brain activity. Past studies on scene perception and memory have often used stimuli that participants knew of but had never visited, like famous landmarks, and have pooled data across many subjects. By mapping the brain activity of individual participants using real-world places that they had been to, researchers were able to untangle the brain's fine-grained organization.In one experiment, 14 participants provided a list of people that they knew personally and places that they have visited in real-life (e.g., their father or their childhood home). Then, while in the fMRI scanner, the participants imagined that they were seeing those people or visiting those places. Comparing the brain activity between people and places revealed the place-memory areas. Importantly, when the researchers compared these newly identified regions to the brain areas that process visual scenes, the new regions were overlapping but distinct.""We were surprised,"" says Steel, ""because the classic understanding is that the brain areas that perceive should be the same areas that are engaged during memory recall.""In another experiment, the team investigated whether the place-memory areas were involved in recognition of familiar places. During fMRI scanning, participants were presented with panning images of familiar and unfamiliar real-world locations downloaded from Google Street View. When the researchers looked at the neural activity, they found that the place-memory areas were more active when images of familiar places were shown. The scene-perception areas did not show the same enhancement when viewing familiar places. This suggests that the place-memory areas play an important role in recognizing familiar locations.""Our findings help explain how a generic image of a clock tower becomes one that we recognize, such as Baker-Berry Library's tower here on Dartmouth's campus,"" says Steel.""It's thrilling to discover a new set of brain areas,"" says senior author Caroline Robertson, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth. ""Learning how the mind is organized is at the heart of the quest of understanding what makes us human.""""The place-memory network provides a new framework for understanding the neural processes that drive memory-guided visual behaviors, including navigation,"" explains Robertson.The research team is currently using virtual reality technology to explore how representations in the place-memory areas evolve as people become more familiar with new environments.Reference: Steel A, Billings MM, Silson EH, Robertson CE.

Some anoles are stream specialists, and these semi-aquatic species frequently dive underwater to avoid predators, where they can remain submerged for as long as 18 minutes.""We found that semi-aquatic anoles exhale air into a bubble that clings to their skin,"" says Chris Boccia, a recent Master of Science graduate from the Faculty of Arts & Science's Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (EEB). Boccia is lead author of a paper describing the finding published this week in Current Biology.""The lizards then re-inhale the air,"" says Boccia, ""a maneuver we've termed 'rebreathing' after the scuba-diving technology.""The researchers measured the oxygen (O2) content of the air in the bubbles and found that it decreased over time, confirming that rebreathed air is involved in respiration.Rebreathing likely evolved because the ability to stay submerged longer increases the lizard's chances of eluding predators.The authors studied six species of semi-aquatic anoles and found that all possessed the rebreathing trait, despite most species being distantly related. While rebreathing has been studied extensively in aquatic arthropods like water beetles, it was not expected in lizards because of physiological differences between arthropods and vertebrates.""Rebreathing had never been considered as a potential natural mechanism for underwater respiration in vertebrates,"" says Luke Mahler, an assistant professor in EEB and Boccia's thesis supervisor. ""But our work shows that this is possible and that anoles have deployed this strategy repeatedly in species that use aquatic habitats.""Mahler and co-author Richard Glor, from the University of Kansas, first observed anoles rebreathing in Haiti in 2009 but were unable to carry out further observations or experiments. Another co-author, Lindsey Swierk, from Binghamton University, State University of New York, described the same behaviour in a Costa Rican species in 2019. These early observations suggested that rebreathing was an adaptation for diving, but this idea had not been tested until now.Boccia became interested in aquatic anoles after encountering one in Panama. He began his rebreathing investigations in Costa Rica in 2017 and continued the research in Colombia and Mexico.As the authors point out, the rebreathing trait may have developed because anoles' skin is hydrophobic -- it repels water -- a characteristic that likely evolved in anoles because it protects them from rain and parasites. Underwater, air bubbles cling to hydrophobic skin and the ability to exploit these bubbles for breathing developed as a result.While further work is required to understand how the process works in detail, Boccia, Mahler and their co-authors suggest different ways in which rebreathing may function.In its simplest form, the air bubble on a lizard's snout likely acts like a scuba tank, providing a submerged animal with a supply of air in addition to the air in its lungs. This is what aquatic arthropods like water beetles do to extend the time they can remain submerged.The researchers also suggest that the rebreathing process may facilitate using air found in a lizard's nasal passages, mouth and windpipe that would otherwise not be used by the lizard in breathing.The bubble may also help rid waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from exhaled air through a process other researchers have already observed in aquatic arthropods. Those studies concluded that because CO2 is highly soluble in water and because the level of CO2 in the bubbles is higher than in the surrounding water, exhaled CO2 dissolves into the surrounding water rather than being rebreathed.Finally, the authors speculate that the bubble may act as a gill and absorb oxygen from the water -- again, something already observed in arthropods. Boccia and Mahler are planning further research to confirm if these rebreathing processes are occurring with anoles.According to Mahler, ""This work enriches our understanding of the creative and unexpected ways that organisms meet the challenges posed by their environments. That is valuable in its own right, but discoveries like this can also be valuable to humans as we seek solutions to our own challenging problems.""""It's too early to tell if lizard rebreathing will lead to any particular human innovations,"" says Boccia, ""But biomimicry of rebreathing may be an interesting proposition for several fields -- including scuba-diving rebreathing technology, which motivated our naming of this phenomenon.""Reference: Boccia CK, Swierk L, Ayala-Varela FP, et al.

But often, researchers do not know what rules the machines make for themselves. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Assistant Professor Peter Koo developed a new method that quizzes a machine-learning program to figure out what rules it learned on its own and if they are the right ones.Computer scientists ""train"" an AI machine to make predictions by presenting it with a set of data. The machine extracts a series of rules and operations--a model--based on information it encountered during its training. Koo says:""If you learn general rules about the math instead of memorizing the equations, you know how to solve those equations. So rather than just memorizing those equations, we hope that these models are learning to solve it and now we can give it any equation and it will solve it.""Koo developed a type of AI called a deep neural network (DNN) to look for patterns in RNA strands that increase the ability of a protein to bind to them. Koo trained his DNN, called Residual Bind (RB), with thousands of RNA sequences matched to protein binding scores, and RB became good at predicting scores for new RNA sequences. But Koo did not know whether the machine was focusing on a short sequence of RNA letters--a motif--that humans might expect, or some other secondary characteristic of the RNA strands that they might not.Koo and his team developed a new method, called Global Importance Analysis, to test what rules RB generated to make its predictions. He presented the trained network with a carefully designed set of synthetic RNA sequences containing different combinations of motifs and features that the scientists thought might influence RB's assessments.They discovered the network considered more than just the spelling of a short motif. It factored in how the RNA strand might fold over and bind to itself, how close one motif is to another, and other features.Koo hopes to test some key results in a laboratory. But rather than test every prediction in that lab, Koo's new method acts like a virtual lab. Researchers can design and test millions of different variables computationally, far more than humans could test in a real-world lab.""Biology is super anecdotal. You can find a sequence, you can find a pattern but you don't know 'Is that pattern really important?' You have to do these interventional experiments.

The research from Washington University in St. Louis suggests that these other tissues could potentially be targeted to help treat cancer.""Tumors rely on a constant supply of nutrients to grow. Instead of competing with tumors for nutrients, other tissues can reprogram their metabolism to be complementary. In some instances, this may even allow healthy tissues to feed the tumor,"" said Gary Patti, the Michael and Tana Powell Professor of Chemistry in Arts & Sciences at Washington University and a professor of chemistry and medicine at the School of Medicine.Patti is the corresponding author of the study published May 13 in Cell Metabolism.Cancer consumes tremendous amounts of glucose, a key source of energy for cells in the body. Glucose, or blood sugar, is derived from food and transported around the body through the bloodstream after eating. Tumors actively soak up glucose as a fuel to support their rapid growth.This trait is so well known that physicians regularly use it as a diagnostic test for cancer, where patients are administered a specific form of glucose that can be monitored with a PET scan. What is less clear is how a tumor's penchant for glucose affects other tissues.""Glucose levels are tightly regulated,"" Patti said. ""When glucose levels get too low, it's dangerous. We wanted to know whether a tumor with a high avidity for glucose might influence glucose levels in the blood.""Even when healthy people go a long period of time without eating, blood glucose levels are kept relatively constant. That is because glucose can be made by the liver when it cannot be obtained directly from food.""As it turns out, the liver counters the impact of the tumor by synthesizing glucose,"" Patti said. ""It's very similar to what occurs during a fast.""Working with zebrafish, Patti and co-authors including other researchers at the School of Medicine developed a new approach to study melanoma's impact on different tissues in the body that uses a technology called metabolomics.The scientists fed the zebrafish special versions of nutrients tagged with isotope labels. These labels allowed the scientists to track where nutrients go and into what molecules they get broken down. They found that a molecule being spit out by the tumor was being taken up by the liver to make glucose.By applying metabolomics to individual zebrafish, the scientists observed that melanoma tissues in the body consume about 15 times more glucose than the other tissues they measured. Despite this burden, the zebrafish were able to maintain circulating glucose levels, apparently by making glucose in the liver through a process that is ordinarily triggered when we go without eating.But it was clear that otherwise healthy tissues were affected in many ways by the presence of melanoma.The scientists examined tissues in the liver, intestine, fin, muscle, brain, blood, and eye of the zebrafish. They observed metabolic dysregulation across most of the tissues -- indicating that melanoma broadly impacts whole-body metabolism.""There is clear metabolic crosstalk between melanoma and other tissues,"" Patti said. ""The metabolic relationship between melanoma and liver is partly characterized by a gene called BCAT1 in the cancer cells. BCAT1 goes from essentially being turned off in healthy skin cells to being highly expressed in zebrafish melanoma. By looking at melanoma from human patients, we were able to confirm that the same pattern holds in people.""Much of the previous research on cancer has focused on the metabolism of the tumor itself.""Our work shows that a lot of interesting metabolic changes are also occurring beyond the tumor,"" Patti said. ""We have demonstrated that, at least in some cases, these metabolic changes in non-malignant tissues occur to support the tumor. This is exciting because it means that we might be able to target the metabolism of healthy tissues as a potential treatment for cancer.""Reference: Naser FJ, Jackstadt MM, Fowle-Grider R, et al.

By collaborating with imaging scientists at the MBL, researchers from Japan have developed a new probe which they call POLArIS, allowing real-time imaging of molecular orientations in live cells. A fluorophore emits polarized light as it glows. The orientation of polarized fluorescence is closely related to the orientation of the fluorophore. If a molecule of interest is rigidly connected with a fluorescent tag such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), the polarized fluorescence from the fluorophore reports the orientation of the molecule. In previous approaches for monitoring the orientation of the protein of interest, researchers needed to develop effective constrained GFP tagging methods which might be different for each protein of interest,  says one of the lead authors of the study, Ayana Sugizaki.  POLArIS uses an antibody-like binder that is rigidly connected with GFP, allowing both specific and versatile constrained labeling,  adds another lead author Keisuke Sato. The team used a commercially available Adhiron molecule (now rebranded as  Affimer ) as the binder molecule to link GFP to a target protein, and developed POLArIS by connecting Adhiron and GFP in a rotationally constrained manner (Figure 1). Because an Adhiron molecule that specifically binds to a molecule of interest can be easily selected from a library of molecules through phage display screening, POLArIS can be designed for any biological molecules of interest. POLArIS can be expressed in specific cell types and organelles, and will be useful for studying architectural dynamics of molecular assemblies in broad range of cell cultures, tissues and whole organisms.  From the point of view of fluorescence polarization imaging, POLArIS has significant advantages because of its genetically encoded nature,  says Tomomi Tani, a Senior Researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan, who has joined this project since he was an Associate Scientist at the MBL. By using the probe for actin, the team uncovered transient emergence and dissolution of highly ordered F-actin architecture that they named FLARE structure, in dividing cells of starfish embryo.  We found that the structure extends up to the cell cortex in association with the astral microtubules,  says corresponding author, Sumio Terada, who had frequently visited the MBL from Tokyo, together with his colleagues in TMDU.  The astral microtubules are responsible for connecting the spindle to the cell cortex and orientating it correctly, controlling the plane of cell divisions.  The mechanisms that determine the cell division plane is the key for controlling many aspects of development, and yet a crucial mystery. The discovery of radially aligned actin architectures will shed light on the most fundamental unanswered questions of cell biology. Reference: Sugizaki A, Sato K, Chiba K, et al.

These results led to the launch of a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the combination of cord blood-derived NK cells (cbNK cells) with AFM13 as an experimental cell-based immunotherapy in patients with CD30+ lymphoma.""Developing novel NK cell therapies has been a priority for my team at MD Anderson to address unmet needs for the treatment of both hematologic cancers and solid tumors,"" said senior author Katy Rezvani, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. ""This preclinical work provided proof of principle for NK cells precomplexed with AFM13, suggesting that they can effectively eliminate lymphoma cells expressing CD30 and warrant further clinical testing.""Natural killer cells are part of the innate immune system and work naturally to eliminate cancer cells in the body. However, they have limited persistence on their own, and tumors can develop mechanisms to evade NK cells, Rezvani explained. Therefore, her research team has worked to develop approaches to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of NK cells.Affimed's AFM13 is a proprietary bispecific antibody designed to bind to CD16a on NK cells and CD30 on lymphoma cells. Initial studies on NK cells isolated from the blood of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma found that AFM13 formed a stable complex with NK cells and could induce NK cell-mediated killing of CD30+ cells. However, the activity of these cells was modest, leading the researchers to evaluate alternative NK cell sources.Further experiments suggested that cbNK cells, isolated from umbilical cord blood donations made to the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank, displayed consistent and improved activity against lymphoma with AFM13 relative to other NK cell sources. The researchers were able to further stimulate the anti-tumor immune activity of cbNK cells by pre-activation with a combination of the cytokines IL-12/15/18.In animal models, pre-activated and expanded cbNK cells complexed with AFM13 resulted in improved tumor control and survival relative to controls, with minimal side effects observed.""These findings suggest that, in animal models, ex vivo pre-activated and expanded cord blood-derived NK cells complexed with AFM13 were able to safely eliminate CD30+ lymphoma cells,"" Rezvani said.

This advance in basic biology may also lead to new strategies for improving crop yields, the researchers say. Our finding that PIEZO proteins work as transducers of mechanical forces in plants, as well as animals, suggests the broad importance of these proteins for living organisms on Earth,  says lead author Seyed Ali Reza Mousavi, PhD, a postdoctoral research associate in the Scripps Research laboratory of Ardem Patapoutian, PhD.

The discovery led to a host of additional findings that have shed light on how to a range of medical conditions, from heart failure to chronic pain.

The paper demonstrated that stressed students still exhibited these cognitive skills improvements up to six weeks after completion of the four-week-long program. It s a really powerful finding,  said Patricia Pendry, associate professor in WSU s Department of Human Development.  Universities are doing a lot of great work trying to help students succeed academically, especially those who may be at risk due to a history of mental health issues or academic and learning issues. This study shows that traditional stress management approaches aren t as effective for this population compared with programs that focus on providing opportunities to interact with therapy dogs. The researchers measured executive functioning in the 309 students involved in the study. Executive function is a term for the skills one needs to plan, organize, motivate, concentrate, memorize:  all the big cognitive skills that are needed to succeed in college,  Pendry said.Pendry conducted this study as a follow up to previous work, which found that petting animals for just 10 minutes had physiological impacts, reducing students  stress in the short-term.In the three-year study, students were randomly assigned to one of three academic stress-management programs featuring varying combinations of human-animal interaction and evidenced-based academic stress management. The dogs and volunteer handlers were provided through Palouse Paws, a local affiliate of Pet Partners, a national organization with over 10,000 therapy teams. The results were very strong,  Pendry said.  We saw that students who were most at risk ended up having most improvements in executive functioning in the human-animal interaction condition. These results remained when we followed up six weeks later. Many universities, including WSU, have provided academic stress management programs and workshops for many years. These are traditionally very similar to college classes, where students listen to an expert, watch slideshows and take notes. They re often evidence-based courses that talk about ways to get more sleep, set goals, or manage stress or anxiety. These are really important topics, and these workshops are helping typical students succeed by teaching them how to manage stress,  Pendry said.  Interestingly though, our findings suggest that these types of educational workshops are less effective for students that are struggling. It seems that students may experience these programs as another lecture, which is exactly what causes the students to feel stressed. Human-animal interaction programs help by letting struggling students relax as they talk and think about their stressors. Through petting animals, they are more likely to relax and cope with these stressors rather than become overwhelmed. This enhances students  ability to think, set goals, get motivated, concentrate and remember what they are learning, Pendry said. If you re stressed, you can t think or take up information; learning about stress is stressful!  she said.Animal sessions aren t just about changing behavior; they help students engage in positive thoughts and actions. You can t learn math just by being chill,  Pendry said.  But when you are looking at the ability to study, engage, concentrate and take a test, then having the animal aspect is very powerful. Being calm is helpful for learning especially for those who struggle with stress and learning. Reference:   Pendry P, Carr AM, Vandagriff JL, Gee NR.

The new method, functional interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy, or fiDWS, promises to be cheaper than existing technology and could be used for assessing brain injuries, or in neuroscience research. The work is published May 12 in Science Advances.""Now we can assess how well the brain regulates blood flow, and even detect brain activation noninvasively in adult humans, using principles similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but at a fraction of the cost,"" said Vivek Srinivasan, adjunct associate professor of biomedical engineering at UC Davis and senior author on the study.The human brain makes up 2% of our body weight but takes 15% to 20% of blood flow from the heart. Measuring cerebral blood flow is important for diagnosing strokes, and for predicting secondary damage in subarachnoid hemorrhages or traumatic brain injuries. Doctors who provide neurological intensive care, would also like to monitor a patient's recovery by imaging brain blood flow and oxygenation.Existing technology is expensive and cannot be applied continuously or at the bedside. For example, current techniques to image cerebral blood flow require expensive MRI or computed tomography scanners. There are light-based technologies, such as near-infrared spectroscopy, but these also have drawbacks in accuracy.The new method takes advantage of the fact that near-infrared light can penetrate through body tissues. If you shine a near-infrared laser on someone's forehead, the light will be scattered many times by tissue, including blood cells. By picking up the fluctuation signal of the light that finds its way back out of the skull and scalp, you can get information about blood flow inside the brain.Naturally, that signal is extremely weak. Srinivasan and postdoctoral researcher Wenjun Zhou overcame that problem by making use of interferometry: the ability of light waves to superimpose, reinforcing or canceling one another. In particular, through interferometry, a strong light wave can boost a weak light wave by increasing its detected energy.","Published: May 13, 2021"

Worryingly, it has now developed resistance to many existing antimalarial drugs, meaning new treatments that work in different ways are urgently needed.In their research, published in PNAS, the scientists developed a set of compounds designed to stop the parasite being able to burst out of red blood cells, a process vital to its replication and life cycle. They found one compound in particular was highly effective in human cell tests.""Malaria parasites invade red blood cells where they replicate many times, before bursting out into the bloodstream to repeat the process. It's this cycle and build-up of infected red blood cells which causes the symptoms and sometimes fatal effects of the disease,"" says Mike Blackman, lead author and group leader of the Malaria Biochemistry Laboratory at the Crick.""If we can effectively trap malaria in the cell by blocking the parasite's exit route, we could stop the disease in its tracks and halt its devastating cycle of invading cells.""The compound works by blocking an enzyme called SUB1, which is critical for malaria to burst out of red blood cells. Existing antimalarials work by killing the parasite within the cell, so the researchers hope this alternative drug action will overcome the resistance the parasite has acquired.Importantly the compound is also able to pass through the membranes of the red blood cell and of the compartment within the cell where the parasites reside.The team is continuing to optimise the compound, making it smaller and more potent. If successful, it will need to be tested in further experiments and in animal and human trials to show it is safe and effective, before being made available to people.Chrislaine Withers-Martinez, author and researcher in the Malaria Biochemistry Laboratory, says: ""Many existing antimalarial drugs are plant derived and while they're incredibly effective, we don't know the precise mechanisms behind how they work. Our decades of research have helped us identify and understand pathways crucial to the malaria life cycle allowing us to rationally design new drug compounds based on the structure and mechanism of critical enzymes like SUB1.""This approach, which has already been highly successful at finding new treatments for diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C, could be key to sustained and effective malaria control for many years to come.""Reference: Lidumniece E, Withers-Martinez C, Hackett F, et al.

But for patients and volunteers enrolled in clinical trials, a better knowledge of how the disease progresses is much-needed.  A new study by investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital published in Nature Genetics uncovers the genetic architecture of progression and prognosis, identifying five genetic locations (loci) associated with progression. The team also developed the first risk score for predicting progression of PD over time to dementia (PDD), a major determinant of quality of life.""The patients who come to see me in the clinic are concerned about their future, rather than their past risk factors,"" said corresponding author Clemens Scherzer, MD, the director of the Center for Advanced Parkinson Research at the Brigham and director of the Brigham Precision Neurology Program. ""They want to know how they will be doing in the future and need medications designed to stop the disease from rapidly progressing. This is the central question in our study: Which genes determine whether a patient will have an aggressive or benign course, and which variants influence who will develop dementia?""As part of an international initiative, Scherzer and colleagues performed a genome-wide survival study (GWSS) of 11.2 million genetic variants in 3,821 PD patients over 31,578 longitudinal study visits conducted over the course of 12 years.The team found five progression loci points in the genome where genetic variants were associated with time from the onset of PD to progression to dementia. These included three novel loci: RIMS2, a gene involved in synaptic vesicle docking; TMEM108; and WWOX. The researchers also confirmed the importance of GBA and APOE4 as progression loci for PD. RIMS2 variants had a more than 2.5-times stronger effect on cognitive prognosis than GBA and APOE4.The authors note that analyses of larger populations studied over time will be needed to detect other variants with small effect sizes and to further understand the overlap and differences in genetic contributors to susceptibility, progression and dementias. Surprisingly, the GWSS progression loci diverge from previously identified susceptibility loci, suggesting that the genetic triggers responsible for starting the disease and the genetic drivers progressively advancing the disease might be largely different.""This is a different way to think about the disease and drug development,"" said Scherzer.

Each signaling codon consists of several successive actions of a DNA binding protein that, when combined, elicit the proper gene activation, in much the same way that successive electrical signals through a telephone wire combine to produce the words of a conversation.The researchers focused on words used by macrophages, specialized immune cells that rid the body of potentially harmful particles, bacteria and dead cells. Using advanced microscopy techniques, they ""listened"" to macrophages in healthy mice and identified six specific codon-words that correlated to immune threats. They then did the same with macrophages from mice that contained a mutation akin to Sj gren's syndrome in humans to determine whether this disease results from the defective use of these words.""Indeed, we found defects in the use of two of these words,"" Hoffmann said. ""It's as if instead of saying, 'Respond to attacker down the street,' the cells are incorrectly saying, 'Respond to attacker in the house.'""The findings, the researchers say, suggest that Sj gren's doesn't result from chronic inflammation, as long thought, but from a codon-word confusion that leads to inappropriate gene activation, causing the body to attack itself. The next step will be to find ways of correcting the confused word choices.Many diseases are related to miscommunication in cells, but this study, the scientists say, is the first to recognize that immune cells employ a language, to identify words in that language and to demonstrate what can happen when word choice goes awry. Hoffman hopes the team's discovery will serve as a guide to the discovery of words related to other diseases.","Published: May 13, 2021"

This translates into one baby born every 4   minutes   or 120,000 per year. Mothers often feel that they are responsible for these defects. But it s not their fault,  said senior author Dr. Harvey Kliman, a research scientist in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Services at the Yale School of Medicine.  This new research points to the genetics of these children as being the most important cause. For the study, Kliman s team examined placental data for nearly 50 sets of identical and non-identical twins. The researchers found that abnormal cell growths called trophoblast inclusions (TIs) which are markers for many developmental abnormalities, occurred with similar frequency in identical twins, while non-identical twins showed a markedly different TI count.Identical twins share the same DNA sequence; non-identical twins share half of their DNA sequence. The researchers found that identical twins often had the same number of TIs or were within one of having the same TI count. Non-identical twins had TI counts that were, on average, different by four or five. This work suggests that developmental abnormalities are much more likely to be due to the genetics of the child, and not the mother s fault,  Kliman said.Lead author Julia Katz, a former Yale undergraduate who is now a medical student at Hofstra University, provided the inspiration for the study.Katz and her brother, Jesse, who was born underweight and with several congenital abnormalities, are non-identical twins.  I had a lot of guilt, growing up, about why my twin had certain conditions that I didn t,  Katz said.  I think mothers also tend to blame themselves. Katz approached Kliman after a Yale lecture and asked him what causes babies to be born undersized. The conversation led to a discussion about developmental abnormalities and Katz s desire to seek out information about her and her twin s genetics   including looking at her own placental slides from birth.It also led Kliman, Katz, and co-author Parker Holzer, a graduate student in the Yale Department of Statistics and Data Science, to conduct the new study. Julia s need to resolve this burden is what propelled our study,  Kliman said.  Hopefully, this finding will help many other people, as well. Katz added:  This experience has shown me that if you have a question, ask it. And if you don t get an answer, try to answer it yourself. Reference: Katz J, Holzer PH, Kliman HJ.

But the drug also can significantly impact memory and other cognitive functions. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Journal of Medicinal Chemistry have developed a peptide that, in mice, allowed  9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main component of Cannabis sativa, to fight pain without the side effects.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 20% of adults in the U.S. experienced chronic pain in 2019. Opioids, the mainstay for severe pain management, are effective, but patients can easily become addicted to them. In some studies, medical marijuana has been helpful in relieving pain from migraines, neuropathy, cancer and other conditions, but the side effects present hurdles for widespread therapeutic use. Previously, researchers identified two peptides that disrupt an interaction between a receptor that s the target of THC and another receptor that binds serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates learning, memory and other cognitive functions. When the researchers injected the peptides into the brains of mice, the mice had fewer memory problems caused by THC. Now, this team, led by Rafael Maldonado, David Andreu and colleagues, wanted to improve these peptides to make them smaller, more stable, orally active and able to cross the blood-brain barrier.Based on data from molecular dynamic simulations, the researchers designed two peptides that were less than half the length of the original ones but preserved their receptor binding and other functions. They also optimized the peptide sequences for improved cell entry, stability and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Then, the researchers gave the most promising peptide to mice orally, along with a THC injection, and tested the mice s pain threshold and memory. Mice treated with both THC and the optimized peptide reaped the pain-relieving benefits of THC and also showed improved memory compared with mice treated with THC alone. Importantly, multiple treatments with the peptide did not evoke an immune response. These findings suggest that the optimized peptide is an ideal drug candidate for reducing cognitive side effects from cannabis-based pain management, the researchers say.Reference: Gallo M, Moreno E, Defaus S, et al.

While snags did not release as much as the soils, they did increase GHG emissions of the overall ecosystem by about 25 percent. Researchers say the findings show snags are important for understanding the total environmental impact of the spread of dead trees in coastal wetlands, known as ghost forests, on GHG emissions.""Even though these standing dead trees are not emitting as much as the soils, they're still emitting something, and they definitely need to be accounted for,"" said the study's lead author Melinda Martinez, a graduate student in forestry and environmental resources at NC State. ""Even the smallest fart counts.""In the study, researchers measured emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from dead pine and bald cypress snags in five ghost forests on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula in North Carolina, where researchers have been tracking the spread of ghost forests due to sea-level rise.""The transition from forest to marsh from these disturbances is happening quickly, and it's leaving behind many dead trees,"" Martinez said. ""We expect these ghost forests will continue to expand as the climate changes.""Using portable gas analyzers, researchers measured gases emitted by snags and from soils in each forest in 2018 and 2019. Overall average emissions from soils were approximately four times higher than average emissions from snags in both years. And while snags did not contribute as much as soils, researchers said they do contribute significantly to emissions.In addition to finding that soils emit more GHGs than snags, the work lays the foundation for the researchers' ongoing work to understand the role snags are playing in emissions - whether they prevent emissions, like corks, or release them like straws. That is an area of future research they're currently continuing to explore.""We started off this research wondering: Are these snags straws or corks?"" said study co-author Marcelo Ard n, associate professor of forestry and environmental sciences at NC State.

The resulting structure resembles the spherical appearance of common RNA viruses that infect humans and is starkly different from the snake-like shape of the Ebola virus.The scientists say the design is intended to stimulate a better protective immune response than standard vaccine approaches, which often expose the immune system to individual glycoproteins rather than realistic-looking virus particles.In designing the vaccine, the researchers also modified the outer spike protein to be more stable than the normal,  wild-type  version found in actual Ebola virus. In tests in mice and rabbits, they showed that this stabilized version elicited virus-neutralizing antibodies more strongly than the wild-type glycoprotein used in prior Ebola vaccine approaches. Here, we did a step-by-step investigation of glycoprotein stability and how that affects the vaccine s ability to elicit antibodies,  says Jiang Zhu, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at Scripps Research and inventor of the vaccine.

She is part of an international team, led by the Harvard Medical School-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center, that used human ""paleofeces"" to discover that ancient people had far different microorganisms living in their guts than we do in modern times.Snow said studying the gut microbes found in the ancient fecal material may offer clues to combat diseases like diabetes that afflict people living in today's industrialized societies.""We need to have some specific microorganisms in the right ratios for our bodies to operate effectively,"" Snow said. ""It's a symbiotic relationship. But when we study people today - anywhere on the planet - we know that their gut microbiomes have been influenced by our modern world, either through diet, chemicals, antibiotics or a host of other things. So understanding what the gut microbiome looked like before industrialization happened helps us understand what's different in today's guts.""This new research was published May 12 in the prestigious journal Nature. The article is titled ""Reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes from the human gut."" Snow and UM graduate student Tre Blohm are among the 28 authors of the piece, who hail from institutions around the globe.Snow said the feces they studied came from dry caves in Utah and northern Mexico. So what does the 1,000-year-old human excrement look like?""The caves these paleofeces came from are known for their amazing preservation,"" she said. ""Things that would normally degrade over time look almost brand new. So the paleofeces looked like, well, feces that are very dried out.""Snow and Blohm worked hands-on with the precious specimens, suiting up in a clean-room laboratory at UM to avoid contamination from the environment or any other microorganisms - not an easy task when the tiny creatures are literally in and on everything. They would carefully collect a small portion that allowed them to separate out the DNA from the rest of the material. Blohm then used the sequenced DNA to confirm the paleofeces came from ancient people.The senior author of the Nature paper is Aleksandar Kostic of the Joslin Diabetes Center. In previous studies of children living in Finland and Russia, he and his partners revealed that kids living in industrialized areas - who are much more likely to develop Type 1 diabetes than those in non-industrialized areas - have very different gut microbiomes.""We were able to identify specific microbes and microbial products that we believe hampered a proper immune education in early life,"" Kostic said. ""And this leads later on to higher incidents of not just Type 1 diabetes, but other autoimmune and allergic diseases.""Kostic wanted to find a healthy human microbiome without the effects of modern industrialization, but he became convinced that couldn't happen with any modern living people, pointing out that even tribes in the remote Amazon are contracting COVID-19.So that's when the researchers turned to samples collected from arid environments in the North American Southwest. The DNA from eight well-preserved ancient gut samples were compared with the DNA of 789 modern samples. Half the modern samples came from people eating diets where most food comes from grocery stores, and the remainder came from people consuming non-industrialized foods mostly grown in their own communities.The differences between microbiome populations were striking. For instance, a bacterium known as Treponema succinifaciens wasn't in a single ""industrialized"" population's microbiome the team analyzed, but it was in every single one of the eight ancient microbiomes. But researchers found the ancient microbiomes did match up more closely with modern non-industrialized population's microbiomes.The scientists found that almost 40% of the ancient microbial species had never been seen before. Kostic speculated on what caused the high genetic variability:""In ancient cultures, the foods you're eating are very diverse and can support a more eclectic collection of microbes,"" Kostic said. ""But as you move toward industrialization and more of a grocery-store diet, you lose a lot of nutrients that help to support a more diverse microbiome.""Moreover, the ancient microbial populations incorporated fewer genes related to antibiotic resistance. The ancient samples also featured lower numbers of genes that produce proteins that degrade the intestinal mucus layer, which then can produce inflammation that is linked with various diseases.Snow and several coauthors and museum collection managers also led a project to ensure the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in the research.""This was a really vital part of the work that had to accompany this kind of research,"" she said. ""Initially, we sent out multiple letters and emails and called the tribal historic preservation officers of the all the recognized tribes in the Southwest region. Then we met with anyone who was interested, doing short presentations and answering questions and following up with interested parties.""The feedback we received was noteworthy, in that we needed to keep in mind that these paleofeces have to ties their ancestors, and we needed to be - and hopefully have been - as respectful as possible about them,"" she said.""There is a long history of misuse of genetic data from Indigenous communities, and we strove to be mindful of this by meeting and speaking with as many people as possible to obtain their insights and perspectives. We hope that this will set a precedent for us as scientists and others working with genetic material from Indigenous communities past and present.""Snow said the research overall revealed some fascinating things.""The biggest finding is that the gut microbiome in the past was far more diverse than today - and this loss of diversity is something we are seeing in humans around the world,"" she said. ""It's really important that we learn more about these little microorganisms and what they do for us in our symbiotic relationships.""In the end, it could make us all healthier.""Reference: Wibowo MC, Yang Z, Borry M, et al.

Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology have dug up another possible role: reducing the number and relative abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in soils from diverse ecosystems. These results imply that earthworms could be a natural, sustainable solution to addressing the global issue of antibiotic resistance, the researchers say.The overuse of antibiotics in humans and animals has caused ARGs to accumulate in soils, which could contribute to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections. Earthworms consume tons of soil per year worldwide, and their guts have a unique combination of low-oxygen conditions, neutral pH and native microbial inhabitants that could have an effect on ARGs. However, the role of earthworms in the spread of antibiotic resistance has been controversial. Some studies in controlled settings suggest that their guts are hot spots for ARGs, which they can spread through soil with their movements, while other studies indicate that the earthworms  guts can reduce ARG abundance by destroying host bacteria and mobile genetic elements. To better understand the issue, Yong-Guan Zhu and colleagues wanted to compare the microbiomes and ARGs of earthworm guts with those of soils from diverse ecosystems across China.The researchers collected earthworms and surrounding soil samples from 28 provinces in China. Then, they analyzed the composition of microbial communities in the worms  guts and the surrounding soil, finding that they differed between guts and soil and also among sites. In addition, the team found a lower number and relative abundance of ARGs in the earthworm guts than in the corresponding soil across all sampling sites. The earthworm guts also had lower levels of bacterial species that commonly host ARGs. These bacteria and their ARGs could be destroyed during digestion, or bacteria that live in the gut could out-compete them, the researchers say. In other experiments, they used controlled environments to show that the number and relative abundance of ARGs were higher in earthworm guts than in their feces, and that the addition of earthworms reduced ARGs in soil samples. These findings suggest that earthworms have the potential to mitigate these genes in soils as a form of natural bioremediation, the researchers say.Reference: Zhu D, Delgado-Baquerizo M, Su J-Q, et al.

The study, named ""Comparing COVID-19 Vaccine Schedule Combinations"", or ""Com-COV"", is being run by the University of Oxford's Vaccine Group. Com-COV received ""Urgent Public Health Study"" classification by the National Institutes for Health and Research (NIHR).The rationale behind the research is that if different vaccines can be safely and efficaciously combined it would offer greater flexibility and resilience for the vaccine rollout program should there be any issues with supply.  If we do show that these vaccines can be used interchangeably in the same schedule this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery, and could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new virus strains,"" Matthew Snape, associate professor in pediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford and chief investigator of the trial, said in a press release.The research study was divided into eight arms, each exploring the following vaccine combinations: In a peer-reviewed Research Letter published today in the Lancet, the study leaders share preliminary findings that suggest combining the different vaccines increases the reactogenicity (side effect profile) associated with vaccination.Side effects are common after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, with more than one in ten individuals reporting tenderness, pain, warmth, itching or bruising at the injection site, and tiredness, chills, joint pain and nausea.When administered at a four-week interval, the ""mixed"" schedules (Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Oxford-AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer-BioNTech) were found to result in more frequent mild-moderate systemic reactions   such as headaches, chills and fatigue   one week after the second dose when compared to non-mixed schedules. It is important to note that these adverse side effects were temporary and there were no additional safety concerns.The symptom data was collected via self-report diaries completed by the participants. ""It is worth emphasizing that [the trial] is a single blind study, so the participants do not know which vaccine they have received,"" Snape said in a briefing. Thus far, the data has not been broken down into categories that distinguish between co-morbidities and gender, Snape clarified.The study investigators emphasized that this finding is a secondary part of what the study aims to explore. However, they felt it was pertinent to share the data at this time due to some European countries looking to adopt heterologous COVID-19 vaccination methods. Snape said, ""The results from this study suggest that mixed dose schedules could result in an increase in work absences the day after immunization, and this is important to consider when planning immunization of health care workers,"" Snape commented.  It is important to note that the participants of the Com-COV study are all aged 50-years-old and above. ""We have [in general] seen higher rate of reactions in younger age groups, and I think this could be relevant here. Reactions might be higher still in younger age groups,"" Snape said.

Some even directly sampled information from the brain itself, either using non-invasive EEG devices or by inserting electrodes into users  heads that allowed them to control a cursor s movement, like using a smart TV s remote control to press on-screen keys. All these devices have achieved some levels of success but face two huge hurdles: they are slow and they often occupy a user s eyes, reducing their adaptability.The study, published in Nature, doubled the writing speed achieved by other invasive and non-invasive brain communication techniques, hitting 90 characters per minute.When an accident or spinal cord injury removes a person s ability to move their body, the brain activity that accompanies those movements is unaffected. State-of-the-art neuroprosthetics use this principle to allow amputees to control mechanical hands with their thoughts. But whether fine motor skills, such as handwriting, would be equally well-preserved was unclear.To test this, the team worked with an anonymous participant, named T5 in the study, who was 65-years-old and paralyzed from the neck down after a spinal cord injury over a decade previously.

The group s findings are published in Nature Nanotechnology.Getting enough anticancer drugs into a tumor is often difficult, and a potential strategy to overcome this challenge involves binding the medications to albumin, the most abundant protein in blood. The strategy relies on tumors  large appetite for protein nutrients that fuel malignant growth. When consuming available albumin, the tumors will inadvertently take in the attached drugs.A popular albumin-bound drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX), and it has been successfully used to treat late-stage lung and pancreatic cancers.  Not all patients respond to nab-PTX, though, and the effectiveness of its delivery to tumors has been mixed, owing to an incomplete understanding of how albumin impacts drug delivery and actions,  says senior author Miles Miller, PhD, a principal investigator in the MGH Center for Systems Biology and assistant professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School.To provide insights, Miller and his colleagues assessed the delivery of nab-PTX to tumors at a single-cell resolution in mouse models of cancer. Using 3D microscopy and what s called tissue clearing technology, the team found that cancer cells can take up a significant amount of nab-PTX, and that the consumption of these drugs is controlled by signaling pathways that are involved in the cells  uptake of nutrients such as albumin. This discovery suggested that if we could manipulate these pathways, we might be able to trick cancer cells into a nutrient-starved state, thereby enhancing their consumption of nab-PTX,  explains Ran Li, PhD, first author on the study and an instructor in the MGH Department of Radiology and the Center for Systems Biology. Indeed, treating tumors with an inhibitor of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, an important component of one of the signaling pathways, improved the accumulation of nab-PTX in tumors and boosted its effectiveness. These results offer new possibilities to improve delivery of albumin-bound drugs in patients with diverse types of cancer,  says Miller.Reference: Li R, Ng TSC, Wang SJ, et al.

Leopards.These majestic animals are the only great cat species (Genus Panthera) to roam about both Africa and Asia today. Leopards are considered as highly vulnerable, classified by the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Because of their elusive nature, and their adaptation to multiple landscapes (rain forest, savannah, deserts and mountain sides) an accurate estimation of their global census has not been possible.In a major scientific step to reconstruct the evolutionary history plus their conservation status, the whole genome DNA sequence of 23 individual leopards sampled from eight geographically separated subspecies locales were interpreted using the latest technologies of population ecology and molecular evolution. Ancient DNA sequences for 18 archival specimens along with 5 living leopards were combined to refine our understanding of the leopard's movements, population reductions, divergence and isolation, and over the past half million years.An international team involving scientists from Nova Southeastern University (NSU), Nottingham Trent University, the University of Cambridge, University of Leicester in U.K. and the University of Potsdam in Germany carried out genetic analysis of modern and historical specimens stored in natural history museums as part of the study.""This study changes everything about genetic contributions to conservation management of the world's leopards, particularly the highly threatened Amur leopard,"" said Stephen J. O'Brien, Ph.D., a professor and research scientist in NSU's Halmos College of Arts and Sciences, who is a collaborating author and also led the genetic analyses the Florida panther restoration two decades ago.O'Brien, is also the Chief Scientific Officer at the Theodosius Dobzhansky Center for Genome Bioinformatics, St. Petersburg State University, Russia, and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.Genetic distinctiveness of nine previously suggested subspecies was re-affirmed with increased precision. Different African populations were genetically interrelated suggesting abundant gene flow across Africa such that all African populations should be considered together as a single subspecies. By contrast Asian leopard populations were geographically distinct along ten prior recognized subspecies boundaries.There appeared a striking genomic distance between leopards living in Asia vs. leopards in Africa. Asian leopards are more genetically separated from African leopards than brown bear species are from polar bear species, the researchers found. The two leopard groups actually diverged around the same time as Neanderthals split apart from modern humans. The genetic differences between African and Asian leopards have been maintained since 500,000 to 600,000 years ago. Asian leopards retain markedly less overall genetic variation than is seen in African leopards.""While they both have spots, the African and Asian leopards are quite different when looking at their DNA, said Johanna Paijmans, Ph.D., lead author, Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge and Honorary Fellow at the University of Leicester. ""Given their mobility, it is surprising that they have remained so distinct and do not carry more shared genetic material with one another. Our study demonstrates that many more exciting genetic discoveries could be hidden among the shelves of natural history museums around the world.""The simplest explanation for both low Asian diversity and this large genetic difference may involve an origin for all leopards in Africa, with a single founding ""out of Africa"" migration to Asia occurring 500,000 - 600,000 years ago. Evidence of subsequent additional northern migrations were not detected, perhaps because the Asian habitats were protected by behavioural reinforcement, a term used to describe the blocking of immigrants across a narrow migration corridor. For example, a similar pattern had occurred with puma/cougar population migrations to North America from South American isthmus 1-12,000 years ago.The depletion of genetic diversity observed in Asian leopard subspecies extends to the extreme in the critically endangered Amur leopard ( Panthera pardi orientalis ). Amur leopards comprise a tiny relict subspecies living on the edge of extinction in the Primorsky Krai region of the Russian Far East-RFE, along the North Chinese border. The Amur leopard population has dropped below 60 individuals and is now showing congenital traits that derive from close inbreeding. Conservation organizations in the RFE are proposing a genetic restoration of re-introduction of Amur leopards to Ussurijsky and Lazovsky Nature Reserves in the RFE (similar to what was successful for the Florida Panther restoration 15 years ago to augment the struggling wild population). The new Amur leopard genomic diversity data shall form a baseline for monitor of Amur leopard re-introduction consequences.""Despite the fact that they the most widely distributed big cats, the evolutionary development and population history of leopards across Africa and Asia has not been studied with genomic tools before now,"" said Axel Barlow, Ph.D., an expert in palaeogenomics and molecular bioscience in Nottingham Trent University's School of Science and Technology. ""Our results have highlighted marked genetic differences between African and Asian leopards, that Asian leopards originated from a single out-of-Africa dispersal event, and that the distinctiveness of leopards on the two continents has been maintained.""Reference: Paijmans JLA, Barlow A, Becker MS, et al.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/this-is-how-our-brains-sync-hearing-with-vision-348711,This Is How Our Brains Sync Hearing With Vision Researchers have proposed a new model for understanding temporal recalibration  the synchronization of sound and vision by the alteration of our sense of time by the brain  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Every high-school physics student learns that sound and light travel at very different speeds. If the brain did not account for this difference, it would be much harder for us to tell where sounds came from, and how they are related to what we see.Instead, the brain allows us to make better sense of our world by playing tricks, so that a visual and a sound created at the same time are perceived as synchronous, even though they reach the brain and are processed by neural circuits at different speeds.One of the brain's tricks is temporal recalibration: altering our sense of time to synchronize our joint perception of sound and vision. A new study finds that recalibration depends on brain signals constantly adapting to our environment to sample, order and associate competing sensory inputs together.Scientists at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) of McGill university recruited volunteers to view short flashes of light paired with sounds with a variety of delays and asked them to report whether they thought both happened at the same time. The participants performed this task inside a magnetoencephalography (MEG) machine, which recorded and imaged their brain waves with millisecond precision. The audio-visual pairs of stimuli changed each time, with sounds and visual objects presented closer or farther apart in time, and with random orders of presentation.The researchers found that the volunteers' perception of simultaneity between the audio and visual stimuli in a pair was strongly affected by the perceived simultaneity of the stimulus pair before it. For example, if presented with a sound followed by a visual milliseconds apart and perceived as asynchronous, one is much more likely to report the next audio-visual stimulus pair as synchronous, even when it's not. This form of active temporal recalibration is one of the tools used by the brain to avoid a distorted or disconnected perception of reality, and help establish causal relations between the images and sounds we perceive, despite different physical velocities and neural processing speeds.The MEG signals revealed that this brain feat was enabled by a unique interaction between fast and slow brain waves in auditory and visual brain regions. Slower brain rhythms pace the temporal fluctuations of excitability in brain circuits. The higher the excitability, the easier an external input is registered and processed by receiving neural networks.Based on this, the researchers propose a new model for understanding recalibration, whereby faster oscillations riding on top of slower fluctuations create discrete and ordered time slots to register the order of sensory inputs. For example, when an audio signal reaches the first available time slot in the auditory cortex and so does a visual input, the pair is perceived as simultaneous. For this to happen, the brain needs to position the visual time slots a bit later than the auditory ones to account for the slower physiological transduction of visual signals. The researchers found that this relative delay between neural auditory and visual time slots is a dynamic process that constantly adapts to each participant's recent exposure to audiovisual perception.Their data confirmed the new dynamic integration model by showing how these subtle tens-of-millisecond delays of fast brain oscillations can be measured in every individual and explain their respective judgments of perceived simultaneity.In autism and speech disorders, the processing of the senses, especially hearing, is altered. In schizophrenia as well, patients can be affected by perceived distortions of sensory inputs. The neurophysiological mechanisms of temporal recalibration described in this study may be altered in these disorders, and their discovery may reveal new research goals to improve these deficits.""Overall, this study emphasizes that our brains constantly absorb and adapt to the bombardment of sensory information from diverse sources,"" says Sylvain Baillet, a researcher at The Neuro and the study's senior author. ""To make sense of our complex environments, including social interactions, brain circuits actively make adjustments of subtle physiological mechanisms to better anticipate and predict the nature and timing of external stimulations. That helps us build a resilient and adaptive mental map of their representation.""Reference: Lennert T, Samiee S, Baillet S.

Now, an international team of researchers led by Elena Goun at the University of Missouri is working to harness the power of bioluminescence in a low-cost, noninvasive portable medical imaging device that could one day be applied to many uses in biomedical research, translational medicine and clinical diagnoses.Potential uses include developing better treatments for cancer, diabetes and infectious diseases, along with monitoring various metabolic functions, such as gut health, in both animals and humans, said Goun, an associate professor of chemistry in the College of Arts and Science and corresponding author on the study published in Nature Communications.""This is the first example of a low-cost, portable bioluminescence imaging tool that can be used in large non-transgenic animals such as dogs,"" Goun said. ""The mobility and cost-effectiveness of this technology also makes it a powerful tool for use in many areas of preclinical research, clinical research and diagnostics.""Once the imaging probe is inserted into the body and reaches a targeted internal organ, such as the liver, the level of biological activity, such as liver toxicity, determines the amount of luciferin that is released into the bloodstream. Eventually, it reaches the area of the device, setting off a biochemical reaction that creates light. A portable light detector -- about 10 millimeters, smaller than the diameter of a penny -- is then placed on the surface of the body near the inserted device and measures the intensity of the light. The level of detected light correlates with the amount of luciferin present, which scientists can then use when determining the health of the targeted organ.Jeffrey Bryan, a professor of veterinary oncology in the College of Veterinary Medicine and a co-author on the study, said this technology will be helpful in a clinical setting -- both in animal and human medicine -- where medical professionals can determine if a treatment is working inside a patient.""This is a way we can monitor, in a minimally invasive way, a patient's physiological response to whatever treatment is administered to him or her,"" said Bryan, who is also an associate director of comparative oncology at MU's Ellis Fischel Cancer Center. ""Right now, most of the time we are looking for responses to treatment by asking the patient how they feel and then doing big, invasive, expensive tests to see if the treatment is working. Sometimes, that requires multiple procedures. But, if we can monitor for the desired effect in a minimally invasive manner and continue monitoring the progress over a long time period with this technology, that would probably reduce the need for more invasive testing.""In addition to the diagnostic testing benefits of this technology, Goun said their approach could have the potential to significantly reduce the number of dogs, cats and non-human primates being used for experimental testing purposes by commercial drug development companies.Reference: Yevtodiyenko A, Bazhin A, Khodakivskyi P, et al.

Conventional germline cells divide twice to produce all four sex cells - or gametes - simultaneously. In humans four sperms are produced from a single germline cell. So, these strange parasite cells are doing their own thing rather than sticking to the biology rulebook.Trypanosome cell biology has already revealed several curious features. They have two unique intracellular structures - the kinetoplast, a network of circular DNA and the glycosome, a membrane-enclosed organelle that contains the glycolytic enzymes. They don't follow the central dogma that DNA is faithfully transcribed into RNA, but will go back and edit some of the RNA transcripts after they've been made.Professor Wendy Gibson of the University of Bristol's School of Biological Sciences led the study. She said ""We've got used to trypanosomes doing things their own way, but of course what we think of as normal cell biology is based on very few so-called model organisms like yeast and mice. There's a whole world of weird and wonderful single-celled organisms - protozoa - out there that we don't know much about! Trypanosomes have got more attention because they're such important pathogens - both of humans and their livestock.""Biologists think that sexual reproduction evolved very early on, after the first complex cells appeared a couple of billion years ago. The sex cells are produced by a special form of cell division called meiosis that reduces the number of chromosomes by half, so that gametes have only one complete set of chromosomes instead of two. The chromosome sets from two gametes combine during sexual reproduction, producing new combinations of genes in the offspring. In the case of disease-causing microbes like the trypanosome, sex can potentially lead to a lot of harmful genes being combined in one strain. Thus, research on sexual reproduction helps scientists understand how new strains of disease-causing microbes arise and how characteristics such as drug resistance get spread between different strains.Reference: Peacock L, Kay C, Farren C, et al.

The study, published in the May 2021 issue of Neurobiology of Stress, indicates gray matter in the frontal network could represent a core region for brain involvement in Covid-19, even beyond damage related to clinical manifestations of the disease, such as stroke.The researchers, who are affiliated with the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS), analyzed computed tomography scans in 120 neurological patients, including 58 with acute Covid-19 and 62 without Covid-19, matched for age, gender and disease. They used source-based morphometry analysis, which boosts the statistical power for studies with a moderate sample size.""Science has shown that the brain's structure affects its function, and abnormal brain imaging has emerged as a major feature of Covid?19,"" said Kuaikuai Duan, the study's first author, a graduate research assistant at TReNDS and Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. ""Previous studies have examined how the brain is affected by Covid-19 using a univariate approach, but ours is the first to use a multivariate, data-driven approach to link these changes to specific Covid-19 characteristics (for example fever and lack of oxygen) and outcome (disability level).""The analysis showed patients with higher levels of disability had lower gray matter volume in the superior, medial and middle frontal gyri at discharge and six months later, even when controlling for cerebrovascular diseases. Gray matter volume in this region was also significantly reduced in patients receiving oxygen therapy compared to patients not receiving oxygen therapy. Patients with fever had a significant reduction in gray matter volume in the inferior and middle temporal gyri and the fusiform gyrus compared to patients without fever. The results suggest Covid-19 may affect the frontal-temporal network through fever or lack of oxygen.Reduced gray matter in the superior, medial and middle frontal gyri was also present in patients with agitation compared to patients without agitation. This implies that gray matter changes in the frontal region of the brain may underlie the mood disturbances commonly exhibited by Covid-19 patients.""Neurological complications are increasingly documented for patients with Covid-19,"" said Vince Calhoun, senior author of the study and director of TReNDS. Calhoun is Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at Georgia State and holds appointments in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and in neurology and psychiatry at Emory University. ""A reduction of gray matter has also been shown to be present in other mood disorders such as schizophrenia and is likely related to the way that gray matter influences neuron function.""The study's findings demonstrate changes to the frontal-temporal network could be used as a biomarker to determine the likely prognosis of Covid-19 or evaluate treatment options for the disease. Next, the researchers hope to replicate the study on a larger sample size that includes many types of brain scans and different populations of Covid-19 patients.Reference: Duan K, Premi E, Pilotto A, et al.

Hookworm and tuberculosis already threaten their small and diminishing population, which has fallen by more than 60 percent over four decades.The new research - part of a long-term health study of seals and sea lions in Australia - identified the chemicals in animals at multiple colonies in Victoria and South Australia from 2017 to 2020.As well as in pups, the chemicals (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances - 'PFAS') were detected in juvenile animals and in an adult male. There was also evidence of transfer of the chemicals from mothers to newborns.PFAS have been reported to cause cancer, reproductive and developmental defects, endocrine disruption and can compromise immune systems. Exposure can occur through many sources including through contaminated air, soil and water, and common household products containing PFAS. In addition to being used in firefighting foam, they are frequently found in stain repellents, polishes, paints and coatings.The researchers believe the seals and sea lions ingested the chemicals through their fish, crustacean, octopus and squid diets.Despite South Australia banning the use of PFAS-containing firefighting foams in 2018, these chemicals persist and don't easily degrade in the environment.

""In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of heart and other metabolically active tissues using a mouse model of heart attack and used systems biology approaches to get a systematic picture of the metabolic changes that occur.""Systems biology has aided the discovery of new treatment approaches in multiple diseases. Rather than take systems apart and analyse the components, it involves taking measurements from different cells and tissues and using them to reproduce the system being studied. In this research, the team used a systems biology approach called co-expression networks (CNs) to reveal how the functions of genes in different tissues were linked together.First, they measured the activity of all the genes in four tissue types: heart, fat, skeletal muscle and the liver in mice that had a heart attack. They compared these with the gene activity in mice that did not have a heart attack to generate sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) unique to each tissue. Next, in the co-expression network analysis, they looked at the top 5% of genes that were most strongly connected within the four different tissues. They then used the DEG results to see how those top 5% of genes were altered 24 hours after a heart attack.They found key clusters of genes that were altered in different tissues after a heart attack. In the heart and muscle, the gene changes tended to be linked to energy production and muscle contraction. In the liver, the gene changes were related to fat transport and metabolism, and the metabolism of cell-protecting substances such as glutathione.The team then used this information to build a multi-tissue model of the metabolic response to a heart attack and compared their results with other studies of heart tissue. They found that four genes were consistently altered across all studies. These genes are known to play roles in energy production, muscle contraction and protein production, and at least one of them is being explored as a drug target for cardiovascular disease.Taken together, the results reveal a downregulation of heart-specific functions and upregulation of fat metabolism and inflammation in the heart, muscle and fat tissue after a heart attack. By contrast, the team saw a different response in the liver where inflammation was reduced.""Our integrative analysis highlights both common and tissue-specific biological responses to a heart attack across a range of metabolically active tissues,"" concludes senior author Adil Mardinoglu, Professor of Systems Biology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and King's College London, UK.

The placenta is like the black box in an airplane. If something goes wrong with a pregnancy, we usually see changes in the placenta that can help us figure out what happened,  said corresponding author Dr. Jeffery Goldstein, assistant professor of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine pathologist. From what we can tell, the COVID vaccine does not damage the placenta. The study was published May 11 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. To the authors  knowledge, it is the first study to examine the impact of the COVID vaccines on the placenta.  We have reached a stage in vaccine distribution where we are seeing vaccine hesitancy, and this hesitancy is pronounced for pregnant people,  said study co-author Dr. Emily Miller, Northwestern Medicine maternal fetal medicine physician and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Feinberg. Our team hopes these data, albeit preliminary, can reduce concerns about the risk of the vaccine to the pregnancy. The study authors collected placentas from 84 vaccinated patients and 116 unvaccinated patients who delivered at Prentice Women s Hospital in Chicago and pathologically examined the placentas whole and microscopically following birth. Most patients received vaccines   either Moderna or Pfizer   during their third trimester.Last May, Goldstein, Miller and collaborators from Northwestern and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children s Hospital of Chicago published a study that found placentas of women who tested positive for the COVID-19 virus while pregnant showed evidence of injury (abnormal blood flow between mother and baby in utero). Pregnant patients who want to get vaccinated to avoid contracting the disease should feel safe doing so, Miller said.  We are beginning to move to a framework of protecting fetuses through vaccination, rather than from vaccination,  Miller said. In April, the scientists published a study showing pregnant women make COVID antibodies after vaccination and successfully transfer them to their fetuses.  Until infants can get vaccinated, the only way for them to get COVID antibodies is from their mother,  Goldstein said. The placenta s role in the immune systemThe placenta is the first organ that forms during pregnancy. It performs duties for most of the fetus  organs while they re still forming, such as providing oxygen while the lungs develop and nutrition while the gut is forming. Additionally, the placenta manages hormones and the immune system, and tells the mother s body to welcome and nurture the fetus rather than reject it as a foreign intruder.  The Internet has amplified a concern that the vaccine might trigger an immunological response that causes the mother to reject the fetus,  Goldstein said.  But these findings lead us to believe that doesn t happen. The scientists also looked for abnormal blood flow between the mother and fetus and problems with fetal blood flow   both of which have been reported in pregnant patients who have tested positive for COVID.  The rate of these injuries was the same in the vaccinated patients as for control patients, Goldstein said. The scientists also examined the placentas for chronic histiocytic intervillositis, a complication that can happen if the placenta is infected, in this case, by SARS-CoV-2. Although this study did not find any cases in vaccinated patients, it's a very rare condition that requires a larger sample size (1,000 patients) to differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.Reference: Shanes ED, Otero S, Mithal LB, Mupanomunda CA, Miller ES, Goldstein JA.

They also identified the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a new molecular target for development of cancer therapeutics.""Our research identified a therapeutic lead that acts through a new molecular target for treatment of certain cancers,"" Kolluri said.O'Donnell added: ""This is an exciting development which lays a foundation for a new class of anti-cancer therapeutics acting through the AhR.""The researchers employed two molecular screening techniques to discover potential SMAhRTs and identified a molecule - known as CGS-15943 - that activates AhR signaling and kills liver and breast cancer cells.Specifically, they studied cells from human hepatocellular carcinoma, a common type of liver cancer, and cells from triple negative breast cancer, which account for about 15% of breast cancers with the worst prognosis.""We focused on these two types of cancers because they are difficult to treat and have limited treatment options,"" said Kolluri, a professor in the Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology in the College of Agricultural Sciences. ""We were encouraged by the results because they are unrelated cancers and targeting the AhR was effective in inducing death of both of these distinct cancers.""The researchers also identified the AhR-mediated pathways that contribute to the anti-cancer actions of CGS-15943. Developing cancer treatments requires a detailed understanding of how they act to induce anti-cancer effects. The researchers determined that CGS-15943 increases the expression of a protein called Fas Ligand through the AhR and causes cancer cell death.These results provide exciting new leads for drug development, but human therapies based on these results would not be available to patients for years, the researchers said.Reference: O Donnell EF, Jang HS, Liefwalker DF, Kerkvliet NI, Kolluri SK.

While many of its genes were already known at that point, the full complement of protein-coding genes was unresolved.Now, after performing an extensive comparative genomics study, MIT researchers have generated what they describe as the most accurate and complete gene annotation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In their study, which appears today in Nature Communications, they confirmed several protein-coding genes and found that a few others that had been suggested as genes do not code for any proteins. We were able to use this powerful comparative genomics approach for evolutionary signatures to discover the true functional protein-coding content of this enormously important genome,  says Manolis Kellis, who is the senior author of the study and a professor of computer science in MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) as well as a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.The research team also analyzed nearly 2,000 mutations that have arisen in different SARS-CoV-2 isolates since it began infecting humans, allowing them to rate how important those mutations may be in changing the virus  ability to evade the immune system or become more infectious.","Published: May 12, 2021"

Although such tests are available, we have very little understanding on how different antibodies interact with virus antigens. Scientists from Fujita Health University set out to assess various antigen-specific antibodies and determined which of them had the strongest neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2.The COVID-19 pandemic has now claimed over 2 million deaths worldwide, and this number is only increasing. In response, health agencies have rolled out tests to diagnose and understand the disease. Besides the now widely known PCR test, there is interest in serological (blood) tests that detect ""antibodies"" against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These blood tests have considerable applications, from identifying blood donors with high levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whose blood can be used for convalescent plasma therapy, to measuring vaccine effectiveness.So, what are antibodies? These are proteins produced by the body's immune system to combat foreign proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Antibodies function by binding to a specific part of the virus that the immune system recognizes, called ""antigens."" SARS-CoV-2 is composed of four major proteins, with two being highly immunogenic (capable of producing an immune response). These immunogenic proteins are called spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Presence of antibodies specific to the S protein means there is a higher amount of virus-neutralizing activity while antibodies specific to N protein indicate the presence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.Despite this general awareness, we actually have only a vague understanding of how different antibodies (or antibody ""isotypes"") interact with the various antigens produced by SARS-CoV-2. Hence, a team of scientists led by Senior Assistant Professor Hidetsugu Fujigaki and Professor Yohei Doi from Fujita Health University, in collaboration with National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, and FUJIFILM Corporation undertook the first detailed investigation of these interactions. ""Our goal was to quantify the neutralizing activity of these different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"" Dr. Fujigaki explains, ""We looked at antibodies specific to different parts of the S protein and the N protein to determine which of them was the best predictor of stopping the virus.""They did this through an analysis of blood samples from 41 COVID-19 patients at the Fujita Health University Hospital. The team developed assays using three common antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA), each of them split into isotypes that bind specifically to five antigens (three parts of the S protein, including the receptor binding domain [RBD], the full S protein, and the full N protein).The results of their experiments showed that all antibody isotypes that bind to the S protein (full and parts) were highly specific, but antibody isotypes binding to the N protein were less so. With minor variations, all antibodies are detectable in patients at approximately 2 weeks after symptoms appear, and detection sensitivity was higher than 90% (except in the case of IgM binding to N protein). Importantly, the researchers showed that IgG specific to the RBD of S protein had the highest correlation with virus neutralizing activity and disease severity. In other words, measuring RBD-specific IgG levels could tell us a lot about the immune response of COVID-19 patients, and could be the foundation for improving COVID-19 blood tests.""We are also very excited by our findings because of their implications for convalescent serum/plasma therapy, a type of treatment where you transfuse blood from people who recovered from COVID and have high levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"" Dr. Fujigaki adds, ""Being able to show that the IgG antibody against RBD is highly correlated with neutralizing activity means we can identify appropriate blood donors for this treatment.""The world is hopefully moving into the final stages of the pandemic, and this information could be the tools needed to carve out the final few steps to a safe post-pandemic world.Reference: Fujigaki H, Inaba M, Osawa M, et al.

Understanding this process may open new ways of treating age-related chronic diseases with immunotherapy.In a healthy state, these immune cells   known as invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells   function as a surveillance system, eliminating cells the body senses as foreign, including senescent cells, which have irreparable DNA damage. But the iNKT cells become less active with age and other factors like obesity that contribute to chronic disease. Finding ways to stimulate this natural surveillance system offers an alternative to senolytic therapies, which to date have been the primary approach to removing senescent cells. It could be a boon to a field that has struggled with how to systemically administer these senolytics without serious side effects.The iNKT cells have two attributes that make them an especially appealing drug target. First, they all have the same receptor, which does not appear on any other cell in the body, so they can be primed without also activating other types of immune cells. Second, they operate within a natural negative feedback loop that returns them to a dormant state after a period of activity. Using iNKT-targeted therapy can piggyback on their exquisite, built-in specificity,  said Anil Bhushan, PhD, a professor of medicine at UCSF in the Diabetes Center and senior author of the paper, which appears May 10, 2021, in Med.  The scientific team found they could remove senescent cells by using lipid antigens to activate iNKT cells. When they treated mice with diet-induced obesity, their blood glucose levels improved, while mice with lung fibrosis had fewer damaged cells, and they also lived longer.Mallar Bhattacharya, MD, associate professor of medicine at UCSF who treats patients with lung disease and is an author of the paper, said the results presented for iNKT cells in a mouse model of lung fibrosis offer hope for a potentially fatal disease that often leads to lung transplants. I think this is a potential immune therapy for senescence and fibrosis,  Bhattacharya said.  It s a fairly well tolerated therapy, and we just have to get around dosing and trials. A diabetes researcher, Bhushan first started paying attention to iNKT cells when a previous study identified a link between iNKT cells and senescent pancreatic beta cells. Because senescent cells tend to accumulate in many tissues and correlate with disease, he surmised that activating iNKT cells could be used to treat a wide variety of diseases.A biotech company that Bhushan helped start, Deciduous Therapeutics Inc., is planning to translate this early discovery to the clinic in the next few years.

This ultrasensitive technique could eventually be developed as a molecular diagnostic tool for point-of-care use. The researchers reported their findings in a paper published May 4 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.""This is a chip-based biosensor capable of detecting individual proteins one at a time, and we show how it can be used to detect and identify the antigens for multiple diseases at the same time,"" said senior author Holger Schmidt, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz.""It's a whole new way of looking for molecular biomarkers, not only for infectious diseases, but for any protein biomarkers used in medical testing,"" added Schmidt, who holds the Kapany Chair in Optoelectronics and directs the W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.The current gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections uses PCR technology to amplify small amounts of the virus's genomic material, and samples are analyzed in centralized laboratories such as UCSC's Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory. Antigen tests, which detect viral proteins, are faster and easier to use and have been approved for testing at the point of care (e.g., doctor's offices) and even for at-home use, but these tests are not considered accurate enough for clinical decision-making, and their results may require confirmation with a more reliable technique.The new chip-based antigen test is not only highly sensitive, but also enables simultaneous testing for multiple viruses from one sample. This is important for diseases such as COVID-19 and flu which have similar symptoms. Measures implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the incidence of flu dramatically, but in the future doctors may need a rapid test that can tell them which respiratory virus a patient is infected with.Schmidt's lab, in collaboration with coauthor Aaron Hawkins' group at Brigham Young University, has pioneered ""optofluidic chip"" technology for biomedical diagnostics, combining microfluidics (tiny channels for handling liquid samples on a chip) with integrated optics for optical analysis of single molecules.To develop the new antigen test, Schmidt's team designed a fluorescent probe bright enough that individual markers can be detected optically on the chip. ""The ability to detect individual markers means there is no need for an amplification step, which removes some of the complexity of the processing,"" he explained.Schmidt's lab had been developing tests for other infectious diseases when COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic last year. At first, research ground to a halt as a statewide shutdown kept everyone at home. But it was clear to Schmidt that the diagnostic technology his lab was developing for Zika virus and other infectious diseases could be adapted for COVID-19.""Once we were allowed to come back to the lab for essential research, my students started coming in to work in the lab by themselves on a coronavirus test,"" Schmidt said. ""It was a heroic effort by my students to develop these tests from scratch. First we were shut down by the pandemic, and then the wildfires hit and we had to evacuate our samples to Stanford and shut down again. But they kept going.""Graduate student Alexandra Stambaugh led the effort and is first author of the paper. The team worked with the campus diagnostic lab to obtain nasal swab samples for testing. They only used samples that had tested negative for the coronavirus, adding viral antigens to the samples at clinically relevant concentrations to validate the tests.The test uses an ""antibody sandwich"" approach commonly used for immunoassays. In this case, antibodies specific for the target antigen are attached to magnetic microbeads, so that any target antigen present in the sample sticks to the beads. After washing, a second antibody with the fluorescent marker attached is added, and it binds to any target antigen present on the beads. The fluorescent markers are attached to the antibodies by a spacer that can be cleaved by ultraviolet light, which releases the markers to flow through the detection chip where they are detected one by one. The researchers attached a green marker to the coronavirus antibody and a red marker to the influenza antibody to distinguish between the two viruses.Reference: Stambaugh A, Parks JW, Stott MA, Meena GG, Hawkins AR, Schmidt H.

The researchers found that 48 of 50 children who received the gene therapy retained their replenished immune system function two to three years later and did not require additional treatments for their condition, known as severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA-SCID. The findings were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.ADA-SCID, which is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 200,000 to 1,000,000 newborns worldwide, is caused by mutations in the ADA gene that impair the activity of the adenosine deaminase enzyme needed for healthy immune system function. This impairment leaves children with the condition highly susceptible to severe infections. If untreated, the disease is fatal, usually within the first two years of life. These findings suggest that this experimental gene therapy could serve as a potential treatment option for infants and older children with ADA-SCID,  said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  Importantly, gene therapy is a one-time procedure that offers patients the hope of developing a completely functional immune system and the chance to live a full, healthy life. People with ADA-SCID can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy, but this treatment does not fully reconstitute immune function and must be taken for life, usually once or twice weekly. Transplants of blood-forming stem cells, ideally from a genetically matched sibling donor, can provide a more lasting solution. However, most people lack such a donor. Additionally, stem cell transplants carry risks such as graft-versus-host disease and side effects from chemotherapy medications given to help the donor stem cells establish themselves in the patient s bone marrow.  The new research evaluated an experimental lentiviral gene therapy designed to be safer and more effective than previously tested gene-therapy strategies for ADA-SCID. This gene therapy involves inserting a normal copy of the ADA gene into the patient s own blood-forming stem cells. First, stem cells are collected from the patient s bone marrow or peripheral blood. Next, a harmless virus is used as a  vector,  or carrier, to deliver the normal ADA gene to these cells in the laboratory. The genetically corrected stem cells then are infused back into the patient, who has received a low dose of the chemotherapy medication busulfan to help the cells establish themselves in the bone marrow and begin producing new immune cells. The experimental gene therapy, developed by researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London, uses a modified lentivirus to deliver the ADA gene to cells. Previous gene-therapy approaches for ADA-SCID have relied on a different type of virus called a gamma retrovirus. Some people who have received gamma retroviral gene therapies have later developed leukemia, which scientists suspect is due to the vector causing activation of genes that control cell growth. The lentiviral vector is designed to avoid this outcome and to enhance the effectiveness of gene delivery into cells.The results come from three separate Phase 1/2 clinical trials, two conducted in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. The U.S. trials, led by principal investigator Donald Kohn, M.D., of UCLA, enrolled 30 participants with ADA-SCID ranging in age from 4 months to 4 years at UCLA Mattel Children s Hospital and the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The U.K. study, conducted at GOSH and led by principal investigator Claire Booth, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., enrolled 20 participants ranging in age from 4 months to 16 years. Most participants acquired and retained robust immune function following gene therapy   96.7% after two years in the U.S. studies and 95% after three years in the U.K. study   and were able to stop enzyme replacement therapy and other medications. Of the two participants for whom gene therapy did not restore lasting immune function, one restarted enzyme replacement therapy and later received a successful stem cell transplant from a donor, and the other restarted enzyme replacement therapy.  The lentiviral gene therapy appeared safe overall, although all participants experienced some side effects. Most of these were mild or moderate and attributable to the chemotherapy that the participants received.Researchers observed similar outcomes in all three trials, although there were some differences between the studies. Stem cells were collected from bone marrow in the U.S. trials and from peripheral blood in the U.K. trial. In one of the U.S. trials, 10 children were treated with genetically corrected stem cells that had been frozen and later thawed. The two other trials used fresh stem cell preparations. In the future, the freezing procedure   known as cryopreservation   may allow stem cells to be more easily transported and processed at a manufacturing facility far from the patient s home and shipped back to a local hospital, reducing the need for patients to travel long distances to specialized medical centers to receive gene therapy. A trial of the cryopreserved treatment is now underway at the Zayed Centre for Research into Rare Diseases in Children in London, in partnership with GOSH.For more information about the trials described in the New England Journal of Medicine paper, visit ClinicalTrials.gov under identifiers NCT01852071, NCT02999984 and NCT01380990.

Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, with colleagues elsewhere, have used a mouse model to demonstrate the pivotal role of cholesterol in CIPN, and proposed a novel therapeutic approach to reverse it.The findings are published in the May 10, 2021, online issue of the Journal of Experimental Medicine.The study was a collaboration between the laboratories of senior study author Yury Miller, MD, PhD, professor of medicine, and Tony Yaksh, PhD, professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology, both at UC San Diego School of Medicine. Miller studies cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular and neuro inflammation. Yaksh specializes in neuropathic pain.""It was truly gratifying to work at the intersection of two disciplines and identify the role cholesterol plays in activation of microglia -- immune cells of the spinal cord -- and regulation of chronic pain,"" said first author Juliana Navia-Pelaez, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Miller's lab.""The metabolism of cellular cholesterol was already linked to neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, but we were first to show its role and underlying mechanisms in chronic pain.""Cholesterol is essential for brain function, both during development and in adult life. It is a major component of cell membranes, a precursor to some hormones and serves as a cellular messenger. However, excess of cholesterol is detrimental to human health; buildup of cholesterol plaques in large arteries often causes heart attacks and stroke.The UC San Diego team found that changes in cholesterol metabolism contributed to reprogramming of microglia in a way that perpetuated chronic inflammation in the spinal cord. Genetically modified mice lacking cholesterol transporters in microglia were unable to remove excessive amounts of cholesterol, and thus experienced pain -- even without chemotherapeutic intervention.The outer membrane of these cells, which is normally fluid, became rigid with accumulated cholesterol in the form of floating solid platforms called lipid rafts. The lipid raft environment, said the authors, favors assembly and activation of cellular proteins that mediate inflammatory response, such as Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4).""We were surprised to find that in CIPN, enlarged lipid rafts and TLR4 assemblies persisted for days and weeks,"" said Miller. ""We even started calling them 'inflammarafts' to stress the importance of these membrane domains in neuroinflammation and pain states.""To reverse the harmful effects of excessive cholesterol in microglia, researchers used a modified version of the apoA-I binding protein (AIBP), which hastens cholesterol removal and disrupts inflammarafts, but does not damage physiological lipid rafts. A single injection of AIBP in the spinal canal of mice reversed CIPN pain, and the therapeutic effect lasted for several weeks, without adverse effects.""The long-lasting effect we observed with the delivery of AIBP points to a reprogramming of these immune cells that implies cholesterol plays a fundamental role in gene expression,"" said Navia-Pelaez. ""It might even act as a driver of epigenetic alterations in microglia and ultimately pain behavior.""The authors said the results are part of a promising series of investigations, conducted by UC San Diego and Raft Pharmaceuticals.""Considerable work remains to be done in terms of safety and kinetics to move this new biologic ahead for clinical trials,"" said Yaksh, ""but the present results are exceedingly promising as they provide a hitherto unappreciated target -- inflammarafts in immune cells -- for drug development in the management of chronic neuropathic pain.""Reference: Navia-Pelaez JM, Choi S-H, dos Santos Aggum Capettini L, et al.

Our findings could shed light on the regions of the brain that specifically evolved in the humans.""""We knew that seeing images of tools activates a different region of the brain to when we see other kinds of objects, for example a chair.""Until now it was assumed that the brain segregates visual information in this way to optimise processing of actions associated with tools. But how the human brain controls our hands to correctly grasp 3D objects such as tools was not well understood.""We wanted to test whether the human brain automatically processes 3D objects in terms of how we grasp them for use. And we particularly wanted to find out whether we could use signals from specific parts of the brain to distinguish whether people were handling tools correctly - for example grasping a knife by the handle rather than the blade.""The team used an MRI scanner to collect brain imaging data while participants interacted with 3D objects.Dr Rossit said: ""This was really challenging because the space inside the scanner is really small and the participants need to stay really still.""So we used a one-of-a-kind 'real action' set-up for presenting 3D tools and other objects.""Our participants lay in the dark, on a custom-built bed with a revolving table mounted above their waist, so that we could show them 3D objects and they could grasp them.""We designed and 3D-printed everyday kitchen tools from non-magnetic materials so that they would be safe in the MRI such as a plastic knife, pizza cutter and a spoon as well as another group of 3D-printed bars to represent items that were not tools, which we used as control objects.""Dr Ethan Knights, who was a PhD student with Dr Rossit, coordinated the data collection and scanned the brains of 20 volunteers at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. In the first session, participants were asked to grasp the 3D tool and 3D bars correctly or incorrectly using the bespoke 'real action' set-up.The same participants returned to the scanner for a second session in which they simply looked at pictures of tools and hands.Dr Fraser Smith, also from UEA's School of Psychology, said: ""We studied brain activity when participants viewed pictures of tools and hands to identify which parts of the brain where the brain hand picture is represented.""We then used state of the art machine learning to see if we could predict whether people actually grasped a tool by its handle or not. This is really important because knowing not to grasp an object, like a knife, by its blade, is critical to successful tool-use.Dr Rossit said: ""In contrast to what most scientists thought, we were able to predict whether a tool was grasped correctly from the signals of brain areas that respond to the sight of pictures of hands and not from visual areas that respond to the sight of pictures of tools.""Importantly the signals from the visual hand areas could only be used to predict hand actions with tools but could not predict matched actions with the control 3D bar objects.""This suggests that the visual hand areas are specially tuned for actions with tools.""Our discovery changes our fundamental understanding of how the brain controls our hands and could have important implications for health and society.""For example, it could help develop better devices or rehabilitation for people who have lost function in their limbs due to brain injury. And it could even allow people without limbs to control prosthetics with their minds.""The potential for brain-driven interfaces and prosthetics is very exciting,"" she added.Reference: Knights E, Mansfield C, Tonin D, et al.

But current approaches to designing a fully implantable and biocompatible device able to make such interventions have major limitations: their resolution isn't high enough and most require large, bulky components that make implantation difficult with risk of complications.A Columbia Engineering team led by Dion Khodagholy, assistant professor of electrical engineering, has come up with a new approach that shows great promise to improve such devices. Building on their earlier work to develop smaller, more efficient conformable bioelectronic transistors and materials, the researchers orchestrated their devices to create high performance implantable circuits that enable allow reading and manipulation of brain circuits. Their multiplex-then-amplify (MTA) system requires only one amplifier per multiplexer, in contrast to current approaches that need an equal number of amplifiers as number of channels.""It is critical to be able to detect and intervene to treat brain-disorder-related symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, in real time,"" said Khodagholy, a leader in bio- and neuroelectronics design. ""Not only is our system much smaller and more flexible than current devices, but it also enables simultaneous stimulation of arbitrary waveforms on multiple independent channels, so it is much more versatile.Khodagholy collaborated on the study, published today by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), with Jennifer N. Gelinas, Department of Neurology and the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Gelinas is a neuroscientist and specialist in pediatric epilepsy whose research focuses on understanding how neural networks become abnormal in epilepsy and designing methods to correct this dysfunction.In order to record, detect, and localize epileptic discharges, scientists must log brain activity in multiple locations with high temporal resolution. This requires a high-sampling-rate multi-channel acquisition and stimulation device and circuit. Conventional circuits need an equal number of amplifying circuits as number of channels before they can combine these signals into a stream of data using multiplexing. This increases the size of the circuits linearly with the number of channels.Khodagholy knew from working with neurologists like Gelinas that there was a great need for an all-in-one, fully implantable system that can record, process, and stimulate brain activity--such a system would enable researchers to design personalized therapies. To record brain activity, he needed multi-channel amplifiers but the available options were too big and unwieldy. As the team continued to make their electrodes more effective, lowering impedance by using a conducting polymer, they suddenly wondered what would happen if they took advantage of their electrode improvements in circuit design and placed the multiplexer in front of, rather than after, the amplifier.With this new idea in mind, the team built the MTA device and then confirmed its functionality by developing a fully implantable, responsive embedded system that can acquire--in real time--individual neural action potentials using conformable conducting polymer-based electrodes. It can accomplish this with low-latency arbitrary waveform stimulation and local data storage--all within a miniaturized (approximately the size of a quarter) physical footprint.""The key challenge was to create an electric-charge drainage path during the multiplexing operation to eliminate any unwanted charge accumulation,"" said Zifang Zhao, postdoctoral fellow in the department of electrical engineering and the first author of the study.The MTA device, which was fabricated at the Columbia Nano-Initiative, enabled the team to then develop a novel closed-loop protocol to suppress pathological coupling between the hippocampus and cortex in real-time within an epileptic network. This type of approach could help address memory problems that often accompany epilepsy.""These devices will allow application of targeted high-spatiotemporal resolution responsive neurostimulation approaches to a variety of brain functions, greatly broadening our ability to chronically modify neural networks and treat neuropsychiatric disease,"" Gelinas said.The team is now integrating their system with various experimental platforms with the goal of improving neural network function and cognitive skills.Reference: Zhao Z, Cea C, Gelinas JN, Khodagholy D.

The first Phase 3 trial of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD replicated and expanded on Phase 2 results indicating MDMA-assisted therapy may be an effective and cost-saving treatment for PTSD resulting from any cause. Nature Medicine is expected to publish the peer-reviewed paper detailing the results of the study sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and conducted by MAPS Public Benefit Corporation (MAPS PBC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MAPS. In this first Phase 3 trial of any psychedelic-assisted therapy, participants who received MDMA-assisted therapy reported a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms compared to those who received placebo with therapy (p<0.0001), successfully achieving the prespecified primary endpoint for the trial. In fact, 67% of the group who received MDMA, compared to 32% of the group who received placebo, no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis after three treatment sessions. In addition, participants treated with MDMA-assisted therapy had statistically significant reductions for the key secondary endpoint of functional impairment relative to placebo with therapy (p=0.0116).Jennifer Mitchell, Ph.D., lead author of the paper, calls attention to the results for those with the dissociative subtype of PTSD, with depression, or who reported a history of alcohol or substance use.  People with the most difficult-to-treat diagnoses, often considered intractable, respond just as well to this novel treatment as other study participants. In fact, participants diagnosed with the dissociative subtype of PTSD experienced a greater reduction in symptoms than those without the dissociative subtype. Mitchell added that MDMA serves as a catalyst to therapy:  MDMA is an experiential therapeutic and therefore necessitates the appropriate set and setting to truly guide change and recovery. While many forms of PTSD therapy involve recalling previous trauma, the unique ability of MDMA to raise compassion and understanding while tamping down fear is likely what enables it to be so effective. The randomized, blinded, Phase 3 trial, designed under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA, treated 90 patients with severe, chronic PTSD. Participants were randomized to receive three sessions of either MDMA or placebo with identical talk therapy. Forty-six participants received MDMA therapy and forty-four participants received therapy with placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was based on the change from baseline in an independently assessed clinical interview of PTSD severity after 18 weeks. The assessors also measured average change in functional impairment in work/school, social, and family life. Among the participants in the MDMA-assisted therapy group, 67% no longer qualified for PTSD diagnosis after three MDMA-assisted therapy sessions and 88% of participants experienced a clinically significant reduction in symptoms, while in the placebo group, 32% no longer qualified for PTSD diagnosis at the two-month follow-up and 60% experienced a clinically significant reduction in symptoms.In the Phase 3 trial, the investigators observed no serious safety or tolerability issues in the MDMA group. MDMA did not increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors and did not increase cardiovascular risk or abuse potential relative to therapy with placebo. As expected from previous clinical trials, temporary increases in blood pressure and pulse were observed during MDMA sessions; adverse events such as muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, sweating, and feeling cold were transient. PTSD is a profoundly challenging condition with unmet medical need. Bessel van der Kolk, M.D., a leading PTSD researcher and author of the foundational book on PTSD, The Body Keeps the Score, served as Principal Investigator for the Boston study site. He explains,  The experience of having been traumatized profoundly alters perceptions; self-experience; and capacity to plan, imagine and anticipate. For 88% of people who receive this treatment, we can expect to see a treatment response. This can lead to fundamental shifts in our subjects' perspective on self-capacity, affect regulation, and attitude towards those around them. It takes a great deal of courage to address one s PTSD, particularly when other treatments have failed. These results open the door to a potentially powerful new pathway to healing -- once MDMA-assisted therapy has been approved as a treatment for PTSD.  Listed as a Schedule I drug, MDMA presently is defined as having  no medical benefit  and, therefore, is not currently accessible as a potential treatment for PTSD or other conditions except as administered in clinical trials.  As a result of this study and through the persistent and consistent application of scientific rigor, we have demonstrated that MDMA-assisted therapy is likely to provide relief for people diagnosed with PTSD,  noted MAPS Executive Director Rick Doblin, Ph.D.  Far from having no medical benefit, MDMA, when combined with talk therapy in this protocol, has the potential to catalyze the therapeutic process and generate positive mental health outcomes.  Michael Mithoefer, M.D., who serves as Senior Medical Director for Medical Affairs, Training, and Supervision, led the team that developed the therapy manual and trained the 70 therapists who provided the treatment in the Phase 3 study. He celebrated their efforts, stating,  The therapists and expert research team who have brought us here are at the vanguard of what may be a revolution in mental health care. The success of this pivotal study is a major step toward regulatory approval, and we hope these results will attract many more researchers and clinicians to join the effort to further explore and deliver MDMA-assisted therapy so we can together address our national   and global   mental health crisis.  MAPS PBC develops and delivers therapy training programs and is responsible for the development of MDMA as a medicine. MAPS PBC CEO Amy Emerson describes its mandate:  MAPS Public Benefit Corporation is establishing a new paradigm in drug research, development, and commercialization in which we center our efforts wholly on the beneficiaries of our healing modality rather than shareholders. This approach commits us to open science and open books as we research best practices for psychedelic-assisted therapy. Ultimately, any proceeds from our work will be reinvested to generate more research, more training, and more affordable options for treatment.  A second Phase 3 clinical trial is currently enrolling participants. Prior to the hopeful approval in 2023 of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, the FDA has granted permission for an expanded access program in which 50 patients can receive the treatment prior to FDA approval. MAPS plans to conduct additional studies to explore the potential of the treatment for other mental health conditions and with other treatment protocols such as group therapy and cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy for couples. Additionally, MAPS is funding a formal commitment to health equity: a holistic plan to create more pathways to access MDMA-assisted therapy for those historically marginalized by the mental health field and society at large.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-mechanism-of-lung-tissue-regeneration-revealed-348646,New Mechanism of Lung Tissue Regeneration Revealed New murine research shows how the infant lung regenerates cells after injury differently than the adult lung ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. New research performed in mice models at Penn Medicine shows, mechanistically, how the infant lung regenerates cells after injury differently than the adult lung, with alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells reprograming into alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (two very different lung alveolar epithelial cells), promoting cell regeneration, rather than AT2 cells differentiating into AT1 cells, which is the most widely accepted mechanism in the adult lung. These study findings, published today in Cell Stem Cell, show that the long-held assumption that AT1 and AT2 cells behave the same way in children and in adults is untrue.The lung alveolus is where gas is exchanged between the environment and blood. While scientists have known about two very different lung alveolar epithelial cells since the 1940s, there had not been much insight into them on a molecular level before now. Furthermore, these findings reveal the molecular pathway that allows for this transformation. The Penn researchers also showed that by turning off this pathway, they could reprogram adult AT1 cells into AT2 cells. This unveils a previously unappreciated level of age-dependent cell plasticity, which could explain, in part, why pediatric lungs are not as heavily impacted by COVID-19 as adult lungs, and is a major step forward in understanding lung regeneration as a form of lung therapy.""COVID-19 has led to millions of people contracting a terrible and damaging respiratory infection, which causes severe lung injury. Some of these patients are likely to have long-term chronic lung issues, with some severe enough to need a lung transplant. We are hopeful that our research on how these alveolar cells respond to acute injury will provide new targets that could be leveraged for the development of future therapies to treat acute lung injury, and that one day we will know how to manipulate these cell pathways so that lung tissue can regenerate and heal itself, without the need for organ transplant,"" said the study's senior author, Edward Morrisey, PhD, the Robinette Foundation Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine and the Director of the Penn-CHOP Lung Biology Institute (LBI) in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.The researchers analyzed changes in gene expression and the epigenome in mouse AT1 and AT2 cells across the lifespan. They compared these changes to those observed after acute lung injury and found that the current paradigm of how adult lungs repair themselves did not hold true for immature or mature mouse lungs.""Scientists have long assumed that the one-way process of cell differentiation that has been well documented in the adult lung would also hold true in the infant lung, but those assumptions were overturned. We discovered that in pediatric lungs the direction of differentiation is in reverse after injury, whereas in the adult it's much more of a two-way street. In all of these contexts, it is controlled by a pathway called Hippo signaling,"" said the study's first author, Ian J. Penkala, a University of Pennsylvania VMD/PhD student who works in the Morrisey Lab.In the adult lung, regeneration of the lung cells is driven by the AT2 cell population expanding and differentiating into AT1 cells. The researchers also showed that after some acute lung injuries, adult AT1 cells can robustly reprogram into AT2 cells. However, in infant mice, AT2 cells do not efficiently regenerate AT1 cells after acute lung injury. Rather, AT1 cells reprogram into AT2 cells after injury, and it is these reprogrammed AT2 cells that can ultimately proliferate after injury.Mouse lungs are somewhat similar to human lungs in that they both have AT1 and AT2 cells, increasing the likelihood that the conclusions in this study also hold true for human lungs. Research is expanding the mechanisms that can develop future therapies for acute lung injury. Normally lungs have the ability to repair and regenerate as they are constantly exposed to pollution and microbes from the external environment. The next phase in this research would be to determine whether harnessing the Hippo pathway can help promote the lung's natural ability to regenerate after injury.""What this discovery provides is insight into a cell pathway that we can manipulate, possibly in the future with pharmaceutical therapies. This helps us build a map of how lung cells respond, and could have major implications down the line on how we care for patients with chronic lung disease,"" Morrisey said.Reference: Penkala IJ, Liberti DC, Pankin J, et al.

Sorting of proteins at ER exit sites and transport to the Golgi apparatus is orchestrated by the so-called COPII protein coat complexes, but not as previously thought. Researchers at Tel Aviv University (TAU), Israel, and the Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute (FLI) in Jena, Germany, have now found that the COPII complexes do not leave the ER for transport. They remain as gatekeepers at ER exit sites from where they control the protein recruitment, sorting and exit to the Golgi. The new findings could lead to a paradigm shift in cell biology.Just as countless letters or packages containing goods are sent in daily life, there are similar transport processes in every cell of our body. Every day, newly synthesized proteins, the ""cargo,"" must be conveyed to their final destination with a high degree of reliability. Behind the scenes, this transport requires extensive logistics, because it is the only way that proteins can be selectively passed from station to station to be transported from their site of synthesis to other locations within the cell or out of the cell to several locations in the body.One-third of all newly synthesized proteins in cells are routed via the so-called secretory pathway. This pathway is comprised of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the  factory , and the Golgi apparatus, the main  logistics center  for further distribution of the goods in the cell. But how do the goods get from the factory to the logistics center, i.e. from the ER to the Golgi apparatus?In cell biology, the prevalent view how cargo is transported from the ER to the Golgi is that small membrane-vesicles are loaded with the proteins to be transported and bud off the ER. They fuse to larger transport containers which are then transported along  railroad tracks , the microtubules, to the Golgi. At the Golgi they fuse with membrane and release their cargo for further distribution. Important to this process is a special protein coat, the COPII complex, that helps in concentrating the cargo at the ER and budding off the small vesicles that are consequently called COPII-coated vesicles (transport vesicles; coat protein complex II). But this knowledge now needs to be revised.","Published: May 11, 2021"

Rather, our relationship with our gut bacteria emerges after birth and during infancy,"" said Kennedy, first author of the study and a PhD student, whose findings are published in Nature Microbiology.Recent studies have sparked controversy by claiming that we are colonized by gut bacteria before birth.

No previous studies have tested the effects of alcohol consumption on social distance, the researchers say. They report the new findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.To test how social familiarity influences drinking behavior, the researchers asked study subjects to each bring a friend who would also participate in the study. The 212 young, healthy social drinkers were assigned to different experimental conditions.""In half of the cases, participants drank with a friend,"" said Catharine Fairbairn, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the research. ""In the other half, they drank with the friend of another participant - a stranger.""The pairs were assigned to consume either alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverages.The team gave those in the experimental condition enough alcohol to bring their blood-alcohol to levels associated with intoxication.

""We used a bit of geometry to turn the pixel coordinates of people detected in the video into real-world distances based on objects of known size visible in the video.""Friends tended to draw close to one another whether or not they consumed alcohol, Fairbairn said.""But participants interacting with a stranger only moved closer to that individual if they were intoxicated.

""This finding is particularly important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because it suggests that alcohol might facilitate virus transmission and impede the following of social distancing guidelines.""Fairbairn said that participants' ability to move closer to one another was somewhat constrained as they sat across from one another at a table, and the study was conducted in a quiet, spacious laboratory and not a bar.""Folks would likely draw even closer to one another in a crowded bar with loud music when compared with our laboratory environment,"" she said.

However, compared to initial symptoms reported by participants, women and those with a heavy caregiving burden were more likely to be experiencing more intense symptoms a month later.The results also showed that family members of patients with dementia, for which there is no long-term treatment or cure, were significantly more likely than family members of cancer patients to have severe pre-loss grief - but that some people anticipating losing a loved one to cancer also had unexpectedly high levels of pre-loss grief.Participants reported similar symptoms no matter how long they had been living with the knowledge that their loved one had a life-limiting illness - another surprising finding for Jonathan Singer, lead author of the study and a clinical psychology intern in psychiatry and behavioral health at The Ohio State University.""People in this study had pre-loss grief at a very high rate after many years. That was shocking, because one might think over time it would get easier. But with Alzheimer's disease, it can get harder, and with cancer there could be a similar trajectory, starting with hope at the beginning but feeling worse over time,"" Singer said.""What's happening with these family members still struggling - is it the caregiver burden, is it that they've lost their identity, is it that they're not engaging in pleasurable activities anymore? That's what we want to hit on next.""The study was published recently in the Journal of Health Psychology.Though pre-loss grief is not a clinical diagnosis, prolonged grief disorder in people mourning the death of a loved one has been added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) released this year. Clinical criteria for a diagnosis include preoccupation with thoughts or memories of the lost family member combined with a number of symptoms such as intense emotional pain, a sense of disbelief and difficulty moving on with life.Adding prolonged grief disorder to the DSM-5 represents progress, Singer said - but the relatively new area of research on pre-loss grief demonstrates a need to consider therapies that can ease symptoms of people who are grieving for an ill loved one who is still alive.""There's a lot of research on anticipatory grief, which involves worry about the future. But pre-loss grief in that moment is pretty ignored,"" said Singer, who treats patients at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center.""With medical advances, people are going to be living longer with life-limiting illnesses, so there will be a bigger and bigger issue with grief before the person passes away. Symptoms of pre-loss grief can predict long-term negative outcomes after a loved one's death, so this is a good intervention target that we should figure out now.""Though it's too soon to tell what types of therapies might work best, Singer noted two approaches that hold promise: behavioral activation that encourages people to engage in pleasurable activities, and meaning-centered psychotherapy designed to enhance spiritual well-being and quality of life.For this study, the researchers recruited family members of patients with advanced cancer (100) and dementia (38) who completed questionnaires assessing their symptoms of grief, depression, post-traumatic stress and caregiving burden. Of those, 33 family members of cancer patients and 28 family members of dementia patients completed a follow-up assessment one month later.The initial assessment showed that participants were experiencing substantial pre-loss grief. Women and participants with a higher caregiver burden were the most likely to be experiencing more intense grief one month later.Overall, 69% of participants reported decreases in symptoms a month after the first assessment - a phenomenon that Singer plans to explore in follow-up studies.There were no differences in pre-loss grief at baseline or one month later based on the nature of the life-limiting illness. But in a secondary analysis of the severity of reported symptoms, the researchers found that 10.5% of family members of dementia patients and 2% of family members of cancer patients met the criteria for a diagnosis of prolonged-grief disorder.""We expected to see this severity in family members of patients with dementia,"" Singer said. ""But there is a lot of hope in the cancer community, so it was a big surprise to see so much pre-loss grief in family members of cancer patients.""Singer led a recent study designed to help pave the way to a better understanding of how preparing for the death of a family member may prevent mental health problems for their survivors. He is currently involved in a study of a longer-term trajectory of pre-loss grief and is interested in investigating its biological effects.Reference: Singer J, Shrout MR, Papa A.

The rapid accumulation of viral genome sequences presents new opportunities for tracing global and local transmission dynamics, but analyzing so much genomic data is challenging. There are now more than a million genome sequences for SARS-CoV-2. No one had anticipated that number when we started sequencing this virus,  said Russ Corbett-Detig, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.The sheer number of coronavirus genome sequences and their rapid accumulation makes it hard to place new sequences on a  family tree  showing how they are all related. But Corbett-Detig s group at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute has developed a new method that does this with unprecedented speed. Called Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing Trees (UShER), this powerful tool is described in a paper published May 10 in Nature Genetics.UShER identifies the relationships between a user s newly sequenced viral genomes and all known SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes by adding them to an existing phylogenetic tree, a branching diagram like a family tree that shows how the virus has evolved in different lineages as it accumulates mutations. We are able to maintain a comprehensive phylogenetic tree of more than 1.2 million coronavirus sequences and update it with new sequences in real time. No other tool can handle trees of this size with a comparable efficiency,  said first author Yatish Turakhia, a postdoctoral scholar at the Genomics Institute.  This helps us keep track of all variants in circulation, including new variants that are emerging. Genomic contact tracingThis kind of sequence analysis can be used to discover new strains of the virus as they emerge and track their evolution and transmission dynamics. It can also be used to identify links between individual cases of coronavirus infection and to trace chains of transmission, an approach known as genomic contact tracing. The challenge is to get results soon enough to make meaningful predictions that public health agencies can use to try to control an outbreak,  said Corbett-Detig, a corresponding author of the paper.  Our method is orders of magnitude faster than anything else out there, placing new samples in tenths of a second. UShER and related data visualization tools are available to the research community through the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser, which also provides access to a wide range of data and results from ongoing scientific research on the virus, including new variants that are especially concerning. Our browser is the most comprehensive information resource for mutations appearing in the virus and what they mean for our battle against it,  said coauthor David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Genomics Institute.  Thanks to Russ s team, it includes the world s most comprehensive phylogenetic tree of the different lineages of the virus, and that tree continues to grow every week, as fast as new data appear. Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 acquires mutations as it replicates and spreads. Most of these random variations in the genome sequence have no effect on the behavior of the virus, but researchers can still use them to identify different variants or strains of the virus, see how they are related, and determine if two samples are part of the same transmission chain.Variants of concernScientists have identified several important mutations that appear to make the virus more infectious. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 with these mutations are spreading more rapidly than other variants. Coauthor Angie Hinrichs, a UCSC Genome Browser engineer, used UShER to determine that one of these variants, known as B.1.1.7, entered the United States through several independent introductions. It is now the dominant strain in the United States.Turakhia said he has begun using UShER to study a new variant that has emerged in India and appears to be spreading rapidly there. Known as B.1.617, this lineage of the virus has two mutations of potential concern to scientists.  We don t know yet how concerning it is, but it is important to track it,  he said.Viral genomics can reveal transmission chains not found through conventional contact tracing, Corbett-Detig said. This approach can help identify superspreader events, where one person transmitted the virus to many others, and it can also show that two cases from the same location are actually unrelated infections, not part of the same transmission chain, because the viral sequences differ too much. It s an approach that is likely to be valuable moving forward, so we re building the tools to enable people to do this in real time,  he said.  If you want to know who transmitted the virus to whom, or where in the world a new sample may have come from, you need to take the samples from your community and project them onto the known phylogenetic tree of all the other SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and conventional phylogenetic methods just can t do this in a reasonable amount of time. That s because conventional methods have to recalculate the entire tree every time new sequences are added, which is much too time-consuming when there are hundreds of thousands of sequences. UShER places samples onto an existing global phylogeny almost instantly, and it provides a local subtree of the added samples and their nearest neighbors so that their relationships can be visualized and examined in detail.The researchers showed that UShER finds the right placement in 97% of cases. In the other 3%, incorrect placements are very close to the true site and still useful for contact tracing. UShER can also be used for quality control to quickly identify and remove low-quality sequences that may contain sequencing errors. The UShER results can be visualized and explored on the Nextstrain platform for interactive visualization of phylogenetic trees and maps of how the virus is spreading.Reference: Turakhia Y, Thornlow B, Hinrichs AS, et al.

Multiple things go wrong at different levels, and this complexity is partly what makes cancer so difficult to research and treat.So it stands to reason that cancer researchers focus their attention where all cancers begin: the genome. If we can understand what happens at the level of DNA, then we can perhaps one day not just treat but even prevent cancers altogether.This drive has led a team of researchers from EPFL and the University of Lausanne (UNIL) to make a breakthrough discovery concerning a critical genetic aberration that occurs in cancer. Working together, the groups of Elisa Oricchio (EPFL) and Giovanni Ciriello (UNIL) have used a novel algorithm-based method to study how cancer cells re-organize the 3D structure of their DNA in order to ramp up the activity of cancer-promoting genes called ""oncogenes."" The work is published in two journals, Nature Genetics and Nature Communications.The research focuses on chromosomes, where our DNA is packaged, and how the chromosomes are organized in the tight space of the cell nucleus. Given that every single one of the billions of cells in our body contains about two meters of DNA, it's understandable that we evolved mechanisms to store it properly. That mechanism involves winding DNA around specialized proteins called histones, like a string spooling around a yoyo.The resulting super-packed and well-protected DNA-protein complex is called chromatin. Multiple units of chromatin make up the structures we know as chromosomes. Normally, each cell carries 23 chromosomes and two copies for each chromosome, but in cancer cells, their structure and organization change. For example, a piece of a copy of chromosome 8 can be attached to a copy of chromosome 14. Moreover, a chromosome can take on a more relaxed or compact structure, which depends on chemical modifications called ""epigenetic marks"".The researchers investigated how changes in specific epigenetic marks modify chromosome structures and the expression of genes that promote tumor growth, known as oncogenes.Giovanni Ciriello's team at UNIL developed a novel algorithmic approach called Calder (after the American sculptor Alexander Calder) to track how genomic regions are positioned with respect to each other in the nucleus. ""We used Calder to compare the spatial organization of the genome in more than a hundred samples,"" says Ciriello. ""But this organization is not static and, just like Alexander Calder's mobile sculptures, it can rearrange its pieces."" The researchers used Calder to track regions of chromatin that ""moved"" from one area of the nucleus to another as a result of changing epigenetic marks.Meanwhile, Oricchio's team at EPFL used Calder to track changes of the chromatin 3D structure in normal and B-cell lymphoma cells. They discovered that in the lymphoma cells, specific epigenetic changes cause chromatin regions to be repositioned in different areas of the nucleus, which lead to novel local interactions that over-activate the expression of oncogenes.The also found that, when two fragments from different chromosomes are broken off and swapped, they assume a 3D structure that is distinguishable from the normal copies. Importantly, these changes of 3D structure correspond to different epigenetic marks, and induce high expression of genes that support tumor cell expansion.""Most of the time we think of our DNA as a long, linear molecule, and it's only recently that we started to understand how its 3D organization is altered in cancer cells,"" says Oricchio. ""Considering the spatial organization of DNA in the nucleus provides a new lens to understand how tumor cells originate, and how therapeutic modulation of epigenetic marks can block tumor progression.""Reference: Sungalee S, Liu Y, Lambuta RA, et al.

A new theory developed by researchers at Simon Fraser University suggests a previously overlooked hormone   testosterone   has a critical role in its development. The research could have direct impacts on diagnosis and treatment of the disease, signaling hope for women with endometriosis worldwide. The disease is caused by endometrial tissue growing outside of the uterus, usually in the pelvic area, where it contributes to pain, inflammation, and infertility. But why some women get it, and others do not, has remained unclear.The new research is based on recent findings that women with endometriosis developed, as fetuses in their mother's womb, under conditions of relatively low testosterone, compared to women without endometriosis. According to the researchers  theory, this low testosterone 'programs' the developing reproductive system of women to exhibit the unique suite of traits that is linked with endometriosis, including early menarche, short menstrual cycles, high pain sensitivity, high inflammation, and altered levels of the hormones that control ovulation and the menstrual cycle. The researchers found their theory to be supported by a remarkable range of data in the literature, from genetics and development to endocrinology, morphology, life history, and evolutionary biology, thus providing the first comprehensive explanation for the traits associated with endometriosis.The theory can explain almost all symptoms of endometriosis as downstream effects of low early-life testosterone. The findings are presented in two recent papers published in Evolution, Medicine and Public Health, and Evolutionary Applications. ""Low testosterone in early development is the strongest known correlate of endometriosis, and its effects can explain the majority of endometriosis symptoms,"" says SFU biological sciences professor Bernard Crespi, a Canada Research Chair and co-author of the work with graduate student Natalie Dinsdale. ""What's more, the new theory has direct implications for endometriosis diagnosis and treatment. Crespi notes that testosterone has apparently been overlooked in studies of endometriosis because it is usually regarded as a 'male' hormone, even though it is known to have key effects in females as well. This work establishes endometriosis as a developmental endocrine disorder, with roots in early life,  says Crespi.  It also clarifies the relationship of endometriosis with polycystic ovary syndrome, a disorder driven by too high, rather than too low, levels of prenatal testosterone. We show that polycystic ovary syndrome is essentially opposite to endometriosis in its causes, correlates, and major symptoms. As such, this work should help to transform our understanding of both disorders. Reference: Dinsdale N, Nepomnaschy P, Crespi B. The evolutionary biology of endometriosis.

The nanoparticle is composed of the coronavirus part that allows it to bind to the body's cell receptors and is formulated with a chemical booster called an adjuvant. Success in primates is highly relevant to humans.The findings appear Monday, May 10, in the journal Nature.""We began this work last spring with the understanding that, like all viruses, mutations would occur in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19,"" said senior author Barton F. Haynes, M.D., director of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI). ""The mRNA vaccines were already under development, so we were looking for ways to sustain their efficacy once those variants appeared.""This approach not only provided protection against SARS-CoV-2, but the antibodies induced by the vaccine also neutralized variants of concern that originated in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil,"" Haynes said. ""And the induced antibodies reacted with quite a large panel of coronaviruses.""Haynes and colleagues, including lead author Kevin Saunders, Ph.D., director of research at DHVI, built on earlier studies involving SARS, the respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-1. They found a person who had been infected with SARS developed antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple coronaviruses, suggesting that a pan-coronavirus might be possible.The Achilles heel for the coronaviruses is their receptor-binding domain, located on the spike that links the viruses to receptors in human cells. While this binding site enables it to enter the body and cause infection, it can also be targeted by antibodies.The research team identified one particular receptor-binding domain site that is present on SARS-CoV-2, its circulating variants and SARS-related bat viruses that makes them highly vulnerable to cross-neutralizing antibodies.The team then designed a nanoparticle displaying this vulnerable spot. The nanoparticle is combined with a small molecule adjuvant -- specifically, the toll-like receptor 7 and 8 agonist called 3M-052, formulated with Alum, which was developed by 3M and the Infectious Disease Research Institute. The adjuvant boosts the body's immune response.In tests of its effect on monkeys, the nanoparticle vaccine blocked COVID-19 infection by 100%. The new vaccine also elicited significantly higher neutralizing levels in the animals than current vaccine platforms or natural infection in humans.""Basically what we've done is take multiple copies of a small part of the coronavirus to make the body's immune system respond to it in a heightened way,"" Saunders said. ""We found that not only did that increase the body's ability to inhibit the virus from causing infection, but it also targets this cross-reactive site of vulnerability on the spike protein more frequently. We think that's why this vaccine is effective against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and at least four of its common variants, plus additional animal coronaviruses.""""There have been three coronavirus epidemics in the past 20 years, so there is a need to develop effective vaccines that can target these pathogens prior to the next pandemic,"" Haynes said.

Many embryos fail to progress beyond early development. Cell biologists at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Biophysical Chemistry in G ttingen (Germany), together with researchers at the Institute of Farm Animal Genetics in Mariensee and other international colleagues, have now developed a new model system for studying early embryonic development. With the help of this system, they discovered that errors often occur when the genetic material from each parent combines immediately after fertilization. This is due to a remarkably inefficient process.Human somatic cells typically have 46 chromosomes, which together carry the genetic information. These chromosomes are first brought together at fertilization, 23 from the father's sperm, and 23 from the mother's egg. After fertilization, the parental chromosomes initially exist in two separate compartments, known as pronuclei. These pronuclei slowly move towards each other until they come into contact. The pronuclear envelopes then dissolve, and the parental chromosomes unite.The majority of human embryos, however, end up with an incorrect number of chromosomes. These embryos are often not viable, making erroneous genome unification a leading cause of miscarriage and infertility.""About 10 to 20 percent of embryos that have an incorrect number of chromosomes result from the egg already containing too few or too many chromosomes prior to fertilization. This we already knew,"" explains Melina Schuh, director at the MPI for Biophysical Chemistry. ""But how does this problem arise in so many more embryos? The time immediately after the sperm and egg unite - the so-called zygote stage - seemed to be an extremely critical phase for the embryo's development.

Now a team led by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian and the New York Genome Center (NYGC) has developed a machine learning technique for detecting other modifications to DNA that have a similar effect.The study, published May 10 in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, focuses on a type of chemical modification to DNA, called methylation, that typically silences nearby genes. The new technique can analyze the thousands of DNA methylation changes detected in tumor cells and infer which ones are likely driving tumor growth.Methylation is an ""epigenetic"" process that normally regulates gene activity across the genome by altering the structure of DNA without changing the information contained in the genes. Occasionally, though, excessive methylation, called hypermethylation, occurs near a tumor suppressor gene, silencing the gene and helping to trigger or drive the runaway cell division of cancer.""If we can profile a large number of tumors with techniques like this, we can map the epigenetic changes that are contributing to tumor growth in certain cancers,"" said senior author Dr. Dan Landau, an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine. ""Then we can use that information to improve our understanding of cancer origins, as well as to optimize treatments for individual patients.""The challenge addressed by the new technique is similar to the one cancer researchers have faced regarding DNA mutations--how to distinguish ""driver"" mutations from more abundant ""passenger"" mutations that have no effect on cancer. Though there are now sophisticated methods for making the distinction among genetic mutations, techniques for distinguishing driver methylation changes from passenger methylation changes have not been nearly as sophisticated, said Dr. Landau, who is also a core member of the NYGC and an oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.The new algorithm developed by Dr. Landau's team is called MethSig. It uses available information, such as the background rate of methylation in a particular area of the genome, to estimate when a given methylation change is likely to be a cancer driver.The researchers applied the algorithm to DNA methylation maps from different tumor types and found that it inferred a small number of cancer-driver events--a median of a dozen or so, in each tumor--compared to thousands of passenger methylation changes. The patterns of inferred driver methylation were consistent across patients and tumor types, as well as other statistical features suggesting the algorithm's non-incremental increase in performance compared to existing methods.The team further validated several of the most strongly inferred DNA methylation cancer drivers by knocking out the affected gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and showing that the gene's absence enhanced cell growth when the cells were untreated, and also in the presence of some standard CLL treatments. Overall, the researchers concluded that their algorithm detects likely cancer-driving methylation changes much more sensitively and selectively than current methods.In a demonstration of the algorithm's potential for improving cancer prognosis and treatment, the researchers applied MethSig to another set of CLL samples and used its inferences to predict the aggressiveness of individual patients' cancers.""The classifier we developed using MethSig produced estimated risks for each patient, and we found that patients with higher estimated risks were more likely to have had worse outcomes,"" said first author Dr. Heng Pan, a senior research associate in the HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz AlSaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, who performed most of the experiments in the study.The researchers plan to continue using and improving the MethSig algorithm with more cancer datasets and more comprehensive genomic information.""Ultimately we envision being able to map the entire landscape of cancer-driving DNA methylation changes, for different tumor types and in the contexts of different treatments, so that we can expand the scope of precision medicine beyond genetics to include also the critical dimension of epigenetic changes in cancer "" Dr. Landau said.Reference: Pan H, Renaud L, Chaligne R, et al.

It is the first organ to show changes stemming from organ or physiological activity. It is especially common for diabetic patients to suffer from skin diseases or infections. Recently, a POSTECH research team has succeeded in creating a 3D artificial skin that enables observation of skin diseases of diabetic patients.A research team led by Professor Dong-Woo Cho and Minjun Ahn of POSTECH's Department of Mechanical Engineering and Professor Byoung Soo Kim of School of Biomedical Convergence Engineering at Pusan National University has successfully produced an in vitro diseased skin model that displays the pathophysiological hallmarks of type 2 diabetes based on 3D cell printing system. These research findings were recently published in Biomaterials, a world-renowned international journal in biomaterials.Despite continuous research to produce artificial skin with 3D cell printing technology, artificial skin displaying the pathological process present in the native skin has not been reported yet.Inspired by the interaction between the epidermis and skin cells found in real skin, the research team hypothesized that when normal keratinocytes interact with the dermal layer made of diabetic fibroblasts, they will differentiate into diabetic epidermis. To prove this, diabetic artificial skin with skin wounds based on 3D printing technique was fabricated using each cell.In this diabetic artificial skin, slow re-epithelialization, a typical feature of diabetic skin, was observed. In addition, when the diabetic fat tissue layer containing blood vessels was added, insulin resistance, adipocyte hypertrophy, pro-inflammatory response, and vascular dysfunction, which are commonly observed in diabetes, were confirmed.""Through 3D cell printing, we can now observe skin diseases in vitro, without actually experiencing it,"" remarked the researchers.

The virus also suppresses host cell defence mechanisms. The virus protein nsP3 plays a central role in this. Using structural analyses, researchers at Goethe University in cooperation with the Swiss Paul Scherrer Institute have now discovered that a decomposition product of the virostatic agent remdesivir binds to nsP3. This points to a further, previously unknown effective mechanism of remdesivir which may be important for the development of new drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses.The virostatic agent remdesivir was developed to disrupt an important step in the propagation of RNA viruses, to which SARS-CoV-2 also belongs: the reproduction of the virus's own genetic material. This is present as RNA matrices with which the host cell directly produces virus proteins. To accelerate the production of its own proteins, however, RNA viruses cause the RNA matrices to be copied. To do so, they use a specific protein of their own (an RNA polymerase), which is blocked by remdesivir. Strictly speaking, remdesivir does not do this itself, but rather a substance that is synthesized from remdesivir in five steps when remdesivir penetrates a cell.In the second of these five steps, an intermediate is formed from remdesivir, a substance with the somewhat unwieldy name GS-441524 (in scientific terms: a remdesivir metabolite). GS-441524 is a virostatic agent as well. As the scientists in the group headed by Professor Stefan Knapp from the Institute for Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Goethe University Frankfurt have discovered, GS-441524 targets a SARS-CoV-2 protein called nsP3. nsP3 is a multifunctional protein, whose tasks include suppressing the host cell's defence response. The host cell is not helpless in the face of a virus attack, but activates inflammatory mechanisms, among other things, to summon the aid of the cell's endogenous immune system. nsP3 helps the viruses suppress the cell's calls for help.Professor Stefan Knapp explains: ""GS-441525 inhibits the activities of an nsP3 domain which is important for the reproduction of viruses, and which communicates with human cellular defence systems. Our structural analysis shows how this inhibition functions, allowing us to lay an important foundation for the development of new and more potent antiviral drugs - effective not only against SARS-CoV-2. The target structure of GS-441524 is very similar in other coronaviruses, for example SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well in a series of alphaviruses, such as the chikungunya virus. For this reason, the development of such medicines could also help prepare for future virus pandemics.""Reference: Ni X, Schr der M, Olieric V, et al.

These tests are widespread in the form of the classic pregnancy test and the COVID-19 self-tests. With the new printing technique, advanced diagnostic tests can be produced that are quick, cheap, and easy to use.The COVID-19 pandemic has made everyone aware of the importance of rapid diagnosis. The sale of self-tests in pharmacies has been permitted in Belgium since the end of March. This self-test is a so-called lateral flow test. Using a wiper, a sample is taken through the nose. Next, it is dissolved in a solvent, and applied to the test kit. Absorbent material in the kit moves the sample downstream and brings it in contact with an antibody. If virus is present, a coloured line appears. The advantage of these tests is that they are cheap and do not require any specialised appliances.Lateral flow tests are useful for simple tests that result in a yes-no answer, but not for tests that require a multi-step protocol. That is why bioengineers at KU Leuven set out to develop a new type of lateral flow test with more capabilities.Precise printsUsing a 3D printer, the researchers fabricated a 3D version of a lateral flow test. The basis is a small block of porous polymer, in which 'inks' with specific properties are printed at precise locations. In this way, a network of channels and small 'locks' is printed that let the flow through or block it where and when necessary, without the need for moving parts. During the test, the sample is automatically guided through the different test steps. That way, even complex protocols can be followed.The researchers evaluated their technique reproducing an ELISA test (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), which is used to detect immunoglobulin E (IgE). Ig E is measured to diagnose allergies. In the lab, this test requires several steps, with different rinses and a change in acidity. The research team was able to run this entire protocol using a printed test kit the size of a thick credit card.Complexity is not a cost""The great thing about 3D printing is that you can quickly adapt a test's design to accommodate another protocol, for example, to detect a cancer biomarker. For the 3D printer it does not matter how complex the network of channels is"", says Dr. Cesar Parra. The 3D printing technique is also affordable and scalable. ""In our lab, producing the Ig E prototype test costs about $ 1.50, but if we can scale it up, it would be less than $ 1,"" says Dr. Parra. The technique not only offers opportunities for cheaper and faster diagnosis in developed countries, but also in countries where the medical infrastructure is less accessible and where there is a strong need for affordable diagnostic tests.The research group is currently designing its own 3D printer, which will be more flexible than the commercial model used in the current study. ""An optimised printer is kind of like a mobile mini factory which can quickly produce diagnostics. You could then create different types of tests by simply loading a different design file and ink. We want to continue our research on diagnostic challenges and applications with the help of partners"", concludes innovation manager Bart van Duffel.Reference: Achille C, Parra Cabrera C, Dochy R, et al. 3D printing of monolithic capillarity driven microfluidic devices for diagnostics.

This docking process allows the virus access to the host s cells, which leads to infection.Cho was the lead author of a study recently published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Frontiers in Immunology detailing the ability of a vaccine to induce antibodies in mice that target the virus s receptor binding domain. The patent-pending vaccine approach is available for licensing from the Iowa State University Research Foundation. Cho will deliver a virtual presentation on the potential of the approach to BioConnect Iowa s vaccine and immunotherapeutics meeting on Wednesday.The antibodies produced by the experimental vaccine attack the receptor binding domain, or RBD, of the virus. The RBD is the portion of the viral spike protein that binds to host cells to initiate infection. Cho likens the spike protein to a key, and the RBD is the part of the key that actually enters the lock. The spike glycoprotein is the key that opens the lock, and the region of the key with all the peaks and valleys and grooves is the RBD,  Cho said.  If antibodies attack the RBD, then the key won t work and the door will stay locked, preventing infection. We don t really need to make antibodies against the entire spike protein, which is more difficult to make. We can just focus on the RBD portion. This approach differs from the three vaccines currently available in the United States to ward off COVID-19. The mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna work by delivering a set of instructions that teach the immune system how to make the entire spike protein that triggers an immune response. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is known as a viral vector vaccine that uses a modified version of a different virus.Cho and his colleagues conducted trials of the RBD subunit protein vaccine on mice and were able to induce a potent antibody response in the rodents over the course of three injections. The study showed that one or two injections are sufficient, depending on the adjuvant used. Cho said he would like to test the approach in human trials.Easy to produce, scale upThe RBD-targeting vaccine has some advantages over the vaccines currently licensed for use in the United States. Cho said the experimental vaccine is relatively easy to produce and scale up because it requires only a small portion of the virus s spike protein to manufacture. The RBD vaccine also can be delivered multiple times, which could be necessary to develop immunity against multiple virus variants that will inevitably emerge.Cho said the process of reaching herd immunity to COVID-19 through vaccines will take time, allowing for new variants of the virus to spread. This is particularly true for populations in developing countries that have had only limited access to the currently available vaccines so far. And as more variants emerge, the likelihood grows that additional vaccines will become necessary, he said. Just because we have vaccines now, that doesn t mean we won t need more in three or five years, maybe even longer,  he said.  I don t think our vaccine is too late to play a role.Reference: Niu L, Wittrock KN, Clabaugh GC, Srivastava V, Cho MW.

This rapidly expanding class of therapeutics are cost-effective, fairly easy to manufacture, and able to go where no drug has gone before, reaching previously undruggable pathways.Mostly.So far, these promising drugs haven't been very useful in getting through to the well-protected brain to treat tumors or other maladies.Now a multi-institutional team of researchers, led by Costas Arvanitis at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, has figured out a way: using ultrasound and RNA-loaded nanoparticles to get through the protective blood-brain barrier and deliver potent medicine to brain tumors.""We're able to make this drug more available to the brain and we're seeing a substantial increase in tumor cell death, which is huge,"" said Arvanitis, assistant professor in the Wallace H, Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) and Georgia Tech's George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering (ME).Arvanitis, whose collaborators include researchers and clinicians from Emory's School of Medicine and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, is the corresponding author of a new paper published in the journal Science Advances that describes the team's development of a next-generation, tunable delivery system for RNA-based therapy in brain tumors.""Our results were very positive, but if you think I'm excited, you haven't talked to oncologists - they're 10 times as excited,"" Arvanitis said.The roots of this project go back to when he and the paper's lead author, ME grad student Yutong Guo, arrived at Georgia Tech in August 2016.""From the start, I was very interested in the application of ultrasonics in treating brain disease,"" said Arvanitis, who linked up with Emory physician Tobey MacDonald, director of the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Program at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, and one of the paper's co-authors. ""Our main question was, can we use ultrasound to deliver drugs to tumors? Because that is a major challenge.""RNA drugs have two major weaknesses: limited circulation time and limited uptake by cells. To overcome these challenges, the drugs are packaged in robust nanocarriers, typically 100 nm in size, to improve their bioavailability. Still, these nanocarriers have typically been too large to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, the tightly-connected and selective endothelial cells surrounding blood vessels in the brain, until now a locked door to RNA drugs.But now, Arvanitis and his colleagues have discovered a safe way to get the drug safely across.Using mouse models, the team deployed a modified version of ultrasound, the diagnostic imaging technique that uses sound waves to create images of internal body structures, such as tendons, blood vessels, organs and, in the case of pregnant women, babies in utero. The researchers combined this technology with microbubbles -- tiny gas pockets in the bloodstream, designed as vascular contrast agents for imaging -- which vibrate in response to ultrasound waves, changing the permeability of blood vessels.""Focusing multiple beams of ultrasound energy onto a cancerous spot caused the microbubbles' vibrations to actually stretch, pull, or shear the tight junctions of endothelial tissue that make up the blood-brain barrier, creating an opening for drugs to get through,"" Guo said.It's a technique that biomedical ultrasound researchers have been refining for more than a decade, and recent clinical trials have demonstrated its safety. But there hasn't been much evidence for selective and effective delivery of nanoparticles and their payloads directly into brain tumor cells. But even when blood borne drugs succeed in penetrating the blood-brain barrier, if they are not taken up by the cancer cell, the job isn't complete.Arvanitis and his team packaged siRNA, a drug that can block the expression of genes that drive tumor growth, in lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, and combined that with the focused ultrasound technique in pediatric and adult preclinical brain cancer models. Using single-cell image analysis, they demonstrated a more than 10-fold improvement in delivery of the drug, reducing harmful protein production and increasing tumor cell death in preclinical models of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children.""This is completely tunable,"" Arvanitis said. ""We can fine tune the ultrasound pressure to attain a desired level of vibration and by extension drug delivery. It's non-invasive, because we are applying sound from outside the brain, and it's very localized, because we can focus the ultrasound to a very small region of the brain.""Current standard treatments for brain tumors come with potentially awful side effects, Arvanitis said, ""however, this technology can provide treatment with minimal side effects, which is very exciting. Now we are moving forward to try and identify what components are missing to translate this technology to the clinic.""Reference: Guo Y, Lee H, Fang Z, et al.

The study also helps to uncover the evolution of genes involved in nitrogen fixation--a key trait likely important in the evolutionary spread and diversification of legumes and vital for their use as ""green manure"" in agriculture. To reconstruct the family tree, researchers compared the DNA sequence of more than 1500 genes from 463 different legume species, including 391 newly sequenced species, that span the diversity of this large plant family.A paper describing the study, led by Penn State Professor of Biology Hong Ma, appears in the May 2021 issue of the journal Molecular Plant.""Legumes make up the third largest family of flowering plants and are incredibly diverse--ranging from tiny herbs to giant trees,"" said Ma, who is the Huck Distinguished Research Professor of Plant Molecular Biology at Penn State. ""They are essential food crops for both humans and livestock, can be used as lumber, and have many other uses. Maybe most importantly, they can 'fix' nitrogen--extracting the vital nutrient from the atmosphere and storing it in nodules on their roots in a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria--making them important as green manure to improve soil health.""There are over 19,000 species in the legume family divided into six subfamilies and then further divided into narrower and narrower groupings based on their evolutionary relationships. There are 765 genera--the grouping one level above species--of which the team sampled members of 333. To build the family tree, the team analyzed gene sequences from the transcriptomes--the portion of the genome that is expressed as genes--of most of the 463 species and a small number of shallowly sequenced whole genomes from across legume diversity.""This is the largest study of this kind for a single plant family,"" said Ma. ""We went to great lengths to sample as many species as we could to get a broad representation of the legume family, but it is often difficult to get well-preserved specimens that we can extract DNA or RNA from, especially for species found in remote locations. Having this broad representation of species allowed us to build the most detailed nuclear-gene family tree for legumes to date.""In addition to helping researchers understand the evolution and diversification of legumes, the new legume family tree helps to clarify the relationship between crop plants and their wild relatives. Although the close relatives of important agricultural crops are often known, studying more distant wild cousins could reveal traits that could be exploited to help plants thrive in changing environments and resist diseases or insect pests.Across the legume family tree, the research team identified strong evidence for 28 separate whole-genome duplication events. Whole-genome duplications, evolutionary events that result in complete duplication of the entire genome, are fairly common among flowering plants and are thought to allow for functional innovation and evolutionary diversification. One of the duplication events that the team identified appears to have occurred in the ancestor of all members of the legume family.""Because for most of the species in our study we used transcriptomes and do not have entire genome sequences, we consider these as 'proposed' genome duplication events,"" said Ma. ""These kinds of studies are kind of like solving a mystery. If you only have one or a few witnesses it might be difficult to convince a jury of your evidence, but if you have a hundred witnesses who have different perspectives and they all point to the same thing it becomes difficult to dismiss that evidence. In our case, the different species are like our witnesses. The size of our study allowed us to identify events that we might otherwise have dismissed.""The two largest subfamilies account for over 17,000 legume species and include all of the species with the ability to fix nitrogen. Nitrogen is an important plant nutrient--most commercial fertilizers contain a mix of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium--so the symbiotic relationship between some legumes and the microorganisms that allow them to assimilate nitrogen from the atmosphere using root nodules has spurred their success by allowing them to colonize areas with less fertile soil. The research team also identified clues to the evolution of the genes responsible for this important trait.""Our data support the idea that nodulation and nitrogen fixation originated a single time early in the history of legumes and other related nitrogen-fixing plants and the whole-genome duplication event at the origin of legumes might have been crucial for the evolution of this process,"" said Ma. ""In addition to this duplication event, we are also able to see gene loss in plants that do not have the ability to nodulate, and evolutionary changes in genes that contributed to their role in nodulation.""Reference: Zhao Y, Zhang R, Jiang K-W, et al.

The findings may help neurologists better predict the long-term effects of strokes and other forms of traumatic brain injury. The most unexpected aspect of our findings was that damage to gray matter hubs of the brain that are really interconnected with other regions didn't really tell us much about how poorly people would do on cognitive tests after brain damage. On the other hand, people with damage to the densest white matter connections did much worse on those tests,  explains Justin Reber, PhD, a UI postdoctoral research fellow in psychology and first author on the study.  This is important because both scientists and clinicians often focus almost exclusively on the role of gray matter. This study is a reminder that connections between brain regions might matter just as much as those regions themselves, if not more so. The new study, published in PNAS, analyzes brain scans and cognitive function tests from over 500 people with localized areas of brain damage caused by strokes or other forms of brain injury. Looking at the location of the brain damage, also known as lesions, the UI team led by Reber and Aaron Boes, MD, PhD, correlated the level of connectedness of the damaged areas with the level of cognitive disability the patient experienced. The findings suggest that damage to highly connected regions of white matter is more predictive of cognitive impairment than damage to highly connected gray matter hubs. Reber notes that the study also illustrates the value of working with clinical patients as well as healthy individuals in terms of understanding relationships between brain structure and function. There is a lot of really excellent research using functional brain imaging with healthy participants or computer simulations that tell us that these gray matter hubs are critical to how the brain works, and that you can use them to predict how well healthy people will perform on cognitive tests. But when we look at how strokes and other brain damage actually affect people, it turns out that you can predict much more from damage to white matter,  he says.  Research with people who have survived strokes or other brain damage is messy, complicated, and absolutely essential, because it builds a bridge between basic scientific theory and clinical practice, and it can improve both.I cannot stress enough how grateful we are that these patients have volunteered their time to help us; without them, a lot of important research would be impossible,  he adds.Reference: Reber J, Hwang K, Bowren M, et al.

These must be read before the information can be used. Cells identify the start of each section using  signposts , which scientists first identified in the 1960s.It has always been assumed that these signposts enable genetic sequences to be read in a single direction. The new study, published in Nature Microbiology, however, shows that single-celled organisms have symmetrical DNA signposts. This means that the DNA code can be read in either direction.Lead author, Professor David Grainger, explains:  Most of the studies on gene signalling overlook the symmetry, but we think this is incredibly significant and represents a whole new level of regulating genes that has not yet been investigated. The precise reasons for the two-directional reading are not yet clear and will require further investigation. One theory the team is considering is that it helps to avoid reading  collisions  with other sequences.Although the current study focuses mainly on bacteria, the team speculate that the signpost symmetry is likely to be found in humans, animals and other organisms too. The next step for the research will be to investigate the phenomenon in yeast cells which more closely resemble human cells.Professor Grainger adds:  Understanding how genes are read is fundamental to many branches of biotechnology. Lots of medicines, for example, are dependent on being able to control how genes are read, so it s important to fully understand how these signals work, and how we can use that knowledge to improve healthcare.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/researchers-take-a-step-towards-salmonella-vaccine-development-348602,Researchers Take a Step Towards Salmonella Vaccine Development Researchers are laying the groundwork for an effective vaccine for salmonella and other hard to treat bacterial infections  In their study  the scientists demonstrate a novel approach to triggering immunity against salmonella  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. With the COVID-19 vaccines on many people's minds, some may be surprised to learn that we do not yet have vaccines for many common infectious diseases.Take salmonella, for example, which can infect people through contaminated food, water and animals. According to the World Health Organization, non-typhoidal salmonella infection affects more than 95 million people globally each year, leading to an estimated 2 million deaths annually. There is no approved vaccine for salmonella in humans, and some strains are antibiotic-resistant.But just as scientists spent decades doing the basic research that made the eventual development of the COVID-19 vaccines possible, University of Florida researchers led by Mariola Edelmann in the department of microbiology and cell science, UF/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, are laying the groundwork for an effective vaccine for salmonella and other hard-to-treat bacterial infections. In their study supported by the National Institutes of Health and published in PLOS Pathogens, the UF/IFAS scientists demonstrate a novel approach to triggering immunity against salmonella.This approach takes advantage of how cells communicate with each other, said Winnie Hui, first author of the study, which was conducted while she was a doctoral candidate in microbiology and cell science.""Cells communicate with each other through particles called extracellular vesicles or EVs. Think of these like molecular telephones that let cells talk to each other. We wanted to know if some of those messages included information related to immune response,"" said Hui, who graduated from the UF/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences in 2019 and is now a postdoctoral researcher in the UF College of Medicine, division of rheumatology and clinical immunology.""Host EVs have not been previously studied in the context of fighting enteric bacterial infections, so that is part of what makes our approach new and adds to the field,"" said Edelmann, senior author on the study, Hui's dissertation director and an assistant professor of microbiology and cell science.Edelmann hypothesized that a specific type of EVs called exosomes were part of the immune response against salmonella and may one day hold the key to developing a vaccine.To test their idea, the research team took exosomes from white blood cells infected with salmonella. Inside those exosomes, which measure just a few dozen nanometers across, they found salmonella antigens, which are bits of salmonella protein known to trigger an immune response.Next, the researchers wanted to know if these exosomes might function as a vaccine, helping the body build up its defenses against salmonella, said Lisa Emerson, one of the study's co-authors and a doctoral student in Edelmann's laboratory.""We put the exosomes in 'nanobubbles' that the mice inhaled. Later, we ran tests to see how their immune systems responded,"" said Emerson, who is in the UF/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.The researchers found that after they introduced the exosomes containing salmonella antigens, the exosomes localized to tissues that produce mucous, activating specific cells at these sites. Weeks later, mice developed antibodies against salmonella and specific cellular immune responses, which typically target this bacterium for elimination. For the researchers, this is a promising result.""There are two types of immune responses generated when our bodies encounter a pathogen. The first one is called innate immunity, which is an immediate response to an infection, but it is also less specific. The other response is called adaptive immunity, and this protective response is specifically tailored to a given pathogen, but it also takes longer to develop. Exosomes generated by infected white blood cells stimulated both of these responses in animals,"" said Hui.While these results show promise, more research will be needed before we have a salmonella vaccine that works in humans, Hui said.""Our study has identified a novel role of exosomes in the protective responses against salmonella, but we also think that exosomes can find broader applications for other intestinal infections and beyond,"" Edelmann said.""Exosomes have this unique capability to encapsulate precious cargo while enabling its targeted delivery to tissue of interest. For many conditions and infections, this precise delivery of therapeutic payload is what makes a difference, and we are currently also evaluating exosomes in delivering cargo to other tissues of choice,"" said Edelmannn whose work is supported by several federal funds focused on the roles of extracellular vesicles in bacterial infections and disease and host-directed therapies against intestinal infections.Reference: Hui WW, Emerson LE, Clapp B, et al.

Moreover, 36% to 46% of patients who undergo surgery with curative intent develop a recurrence of pancreatic cancer, despite adjuvant chemotherapy.Research results are published on May 7, 2021 in Science Advances, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.It's been known for decades that cancer cells acquire key changes in their metabolism to support their continuous need for building blocks from nutrients to divide and grow faster, explains Dr. Koritzinsky, who is the senior author of the study, and an Associate Professor in the Departments of Radiation Oncology, Medical Biophysics and the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto.This latest research reveals that the same metabolic deregulation that fuels cell growth, can create novel vulnerabilities in cancer.It was previously known that pancreatic cancer cells increased levels of a key metabolite known as NADPH which acts to fuel uncontrolled levels of cell growth. Dr. Koritzinsky discovered that high levels of NADPH in the pancreatic cancer cells created a novel form of oxidative stress and a corresponding requirement for PRDX4 to survive.Essentially, cancer cells need PRDX4, an antioxidant protein, to destroy the toxic byproducts resulting from the uncontrolled metabolism.Dr. Koritzinsky showed that targeting PRDX4 in patient-derived cancer cells lines led to toxic accumulation of oxidative stress, resulting in DNA damage, and cell death, and impaired tumour growth in preclinical models. Equally important, loss of PRDX4 had no measurable effect on normal cells.Taken together, this body of work reveals the potential of targeted therapies to exploit unique metabolic features of cancer cells that are far more specific than, for example, chemotherapy which affects both cancer and normal cells.""It's not hard to kill cancer cells,"" says Dr. Koritzinsky, ""It's hard to kill cancer cells without harming the cancer patient.""She goes on to explain that targeting a specific protein that is needed by a cancer cell, but not a normal one, opens up a wider therapeutic window, with potentially less toxicity to normal tissue.For this research, Dr. Koritzinsky teamed up with Dr. Jason Moffat, Professor, Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto and PM Senior Scientist/Staff Physician Dr. David Hedley to mine large functional genomics data sets and validate findings in patient-derived tumour cells, including recent samples from Princess Margaret patients.Through this data set mining, they were able to assess about 20,000 different proteins for a comprehensive picture of which ones are important in helping cancer cells survive. PRDX4 turned out to be key.Based on these discoveries, Dr. Koritzinsky would like to develop new drugs against PRDX4 that could be tested in preclinical models, and eventually translated to the clinic.She adds that there may be other ways to take advantage of these new biological insights, including combining this targeted approach with other DNA damaging treatments such as radiotherapy, and establishing biomarkers that can identify the patients who will benefit from PRDX4 targeting.Reference: Jain P, Dvorkin-Gheva A, Mollen E, et al.

But it s not clear why.In the US, adults born around 1990 run twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer of adults born around 1950.Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soft drinks, fruit flavoured drinks, sports and energy drinks, make up the leading (39%) source of added sugar in US diets, and 12% of the population drinks more than three servings (8 fl oz each) every day. Heavy consumption has been linked to a heightened risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although these drinks have steadily risen in popularity, particularly among teens and young adults, it s not known if this intake might also be associated with a heightened risk of bowel cancer in mid-life.To explore this further, the researchers drew on information provided by 95,464 participants in the Nurses  Health Study II, an ongoing monitoring study of 116,429 US female registered nurses aged between 25 and 42 at enrolment in 1989.The women reported what they ate and drank, using validated food frequency questionnaires every 4 years, starting in 1991. And 41,272 of them reported on what, and how much, they drank during their teenage years (13 18) in 1998. Information was also supplied on potentially influential factors, including family history of bowel cancer, lifestyle, regular use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin supplements.In 1989, participants were additionally asked to recall their health status, weight (BMI) and lifestyle in their teenage years. During 24 years of monitoring, 109 women developed bowel cancer before the age of 50. Higher intake of sugar-sweetened drinks in adulthood was associated with a higher risk of the disease after accounting for potentially influential risk factors. Compared with those who drank less than one serving a week, women who drank 2 or more every day were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with bowel cancer, with each daily serving associated with a 16% higher risk.Among the 41,272 who reported on their teen patterns of consumption, each daily serving was associated with a 32% higher risk of subsequently developing the disease before the age of 50.Substituting sugar-sweetened drinks with artificially sweetened beverages, coffee, or semi-skimmed or whole milk was associated with a 17% to 36% lower risk of a bowel cancer diagnosis before the age of 50.This is an observational study, and as such, can t establish cause, only correlation. And given that most participants were white women, the findings may not be applicable to men or other racial/ethnic groups, acknowledge the researchers.Nevertheless, they point out that there are some biologically plausible explanations for their findings: sugar-sweetened drinks suppress feelings of satiety, so risking excess energy intake and associated weight gain.These drinks also prompt a rapid rise in blood glucose and insulin secretion, which, over the long term, can induce insulin resistance, inflammation, obesity and type 2 diabetes, they add.Emerging evidence also suggests that fructose can impair gut barrier function and increase gut permeability, which could promote the development of cancer, suggest the researchers. [Sugar-sweetened beverage] consumption may contribute to the rising incidence of [early onset bowel cancer],  they suggest.  Reducing intake and/or [substitution] with other healthier beverages among adolescents and young adults may serve as a potential actionable strategy to alleviate the growing burden of bowel cancer before the age of 50],  they conclude.Reference: Hur J, Otegbeye E, Joh H, et al.

However, the specific molecular mechanisms behind these health-promoting effects are not always clear. One such compound is 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate, or ACA, which comes from the tropical ginger Alpinia plant. Now, researchers from Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) have identified how ACA can help in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.In a report published in International Immunology, they found that ACA attenuates mitochondrial damage through decreasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), blocking activation of a crucial protein complex known as the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Many inflammatory diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease, display improper and chronic activation of this complex.Previous work has suggested that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a significant role in promoting inflammation by secreting a molecule called IL-1 . This acts as a messenger that recruits various immune cells to the site of injury or infection. Additional studies described how production of ROS can help trigger activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Because other groups showed that ACA can reduce ROS production in certain immune cells, the NAIST researchers became curious how this compound would impact the NLRP3 inflammasome and its functions.""Many disease pathogeneses involve dysregulation of the inflammasome,"" says Daisuke Ori, co-lead author on the study. ""Blood cells from people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorders frequently have increased levels of inflammasome-derived IL-1 . Therefore, targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome with a compound like ACA may be a promising therapeutic strategy.""The researchers grew immune cells in culture that were obtained from mouse bone marrow, and also used a mouse model of colitis. ACA was added to the growing cells and the live mice were given the compound in their food. The researchers then examined the effects on ROS production, secretion of IL-1 , and other markers of inflammation.""Cells treated with ACA had significantly reduced IL-1  production, as well as lower levels of ROS,"" explains Taro Kawai, senior author. ""ACA could also inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the colitis mouse model."" These in vivo results are promising, as they suggest ACA has the potential to treat or prevent the development of inflammatory diseases. ""Interestingly, we did not observe high levels of immune cell death when using ACA, which means that it may be relatively safe,"" continues Ori.This work provides novel evidence for a specific molecular mechanism governing the previously observed anti-inflammatory properties of ACA. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of ACA for therapeutic use in diseases mediated by IL-1  molecules, or associated with cytokine storm occurrence, as seen in patients suffering from severe COVID-19.Reference: Sok SPM, Ori D, Wada A, et al. 1 -acetoxychavicol acetate inhibits NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation via mitochondrial ROS suppression.

Because many modern cancer therapeutics target primary tumors, the prognosis for a cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is poor, with a median overall survival of 2.7-to-16 months. In order to receive a more specific diagnosis, patients often must undergo extensive diagnostic workups that can include additional laboratory tests, biopsies and endoscopy procedures, which delay treatment. To improve diagnosis for patients with complex metastatic cancers, especially those in low-resource settings, researchers from the Mahmood Lab at the Brigham and Women s Hospital developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses routinely acquired histology slides to accurately find the origins of metastatic tumors while generating a  differential diagnosis,  for CUP patients. Research findings are described in Nature. Almost every patient that has a cancer diagnosis has a histology slide, which has been the diagnostic standard for over a hundred years. Our work provides a way to leverage universally acquired data and the power of artificial intelligence to improve diagnosis for these complicated cases that typically require extensive diagnostic work-ups,  said corresponding author Faisal Mahmood, PhD, of the Division of Computational Pathology at the Brigham and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.The deep-learning-based algorithm developed by the researchers, called Tumor Origin Assessment via Deep Learning (TOAD), simultaneously identifies the tumor as primary or metastatic and predicts its site of origin. The researchers trained their model with gigapixel pathology whole-slide images of tumors from over 22,000 cancer cases, and then tested TOAD in about 6,500 cases with known primaries and analyzed increasingly complicated metastatic cancers to establish utility of the AI model on CUPs. For tumors with known primary origins, the model correctly identified the cancer 83 percent of the time and listed the diagnosis among its top three predictions 96 percent of the time. The researchers then tested the model on 317 CUP cases for which a differential diagnosis was assigned, finding that TOAD s diagnosis agreed with pathologists  reports 61 percent of the time and top-three agreement in 82 percent of cases.TOAD s performance was largely comparable to the performance reported by several recent studies that used genomic data to predict tumor origins. While genomic-based AI offers an alternative option for aiding diagnoses, genomic testing is not always performed for patients, especially in low-resource settings. The researchers hope to continue training their histology-based model with more cases and engage in clinical trials to determine whether it improves diagnostic capabilities and patients  prognoses. The top predictions from the model can accelerate diagnosis and subsequent treatment by reducing the number of ancillary tests that need to be ordered, reducing additional tissue sampling, and the overall time required to diagnose patients, which can be long and stressful,  Mahmood said.  Top-three predictions can be used to guide pathologists next steps, and in low-resource settings where pathology expertise may not be available the top prediction could potentially be used to assign a differential diagnosis. This is only the first step in using whole-slide images for AI-assisted cancer origin prediction, and it s a very exciting area with the potential to standardize and improve the diagnotic process.

The huge Raman scattering enables the observation of selectively surface phonons of the single-crystal silicon and to resolve the atomic-scale structures. Atomic point contact Raman scattering paves the way for ultrasensitive atomic-scale vibrational spectroscopy to investigate surface structures.Nanofabrication of electronic devices has reached a single nanometer scale (10-9 m). The rapid advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology now requires atomic-scale optical spectroscopy in order to characterize atomistic structures that will affect the properties and functions of the electronic devices.The international team headed by Takashi Kumagai at Institute for Molecular Science discovered a huge enhancement of Raman scattering mediated by a formation of an atomic point contact between a plasmonic silver tip and a Si(111)-7 7 reconstructed surface. This was achieved by means of state-of-the-art low-temperature tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy which allows the team to conduct atomic-scale vibrational spectroscopy.The discovered enhancement mechanism of Raman scattering will open the possibility of atomic-scale ultrasensitive vibrational spectroscopy to investigate surface structures of semiconductors. In addition, the developed atomic-scale optical microscopy will pave the way for exploring atomic-scale light matter interactions, leading to a new discipline in light science and technology.Super integration of electronic devices has entered a single nanometer scale, calling for analytical methods that can investigate atomic-scale structures and defects in detail. The advancement of scanning near-field optical microscopy has allowed nanoscale imaging and chemical analyses at the nanoscale. More recently, the spatial resolution of this technique was demonstrated to reach the atomic scale. In particular, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy has drawn increasing attention as ultrasensitive chemical microscopy. However, in order to obtain a Raman signal from semiconductor surfaces, it was necessary to further enhance the sensitivity.The research team applied state-of-the-art low-temperature tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, developed in collaboration with Fritz-Haber Institute, to obtain the vibration spectra from a silicon surface. Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy employs a strong light matter interaction between a material and nanoscale light (localized surface plasmon resonance) generated at an atomically sharp metallic tip. The research team discovered that an atomic point contact formation of a silver tip and a reconstructed Si(111)-7 7 surface leads to a huge enhancement of Raman scattering. Figure 1a illustrates the experiment. A sharp silver tip fabricated by focused ion beam (figure 1b, top) is moved toward the silicon surface (figure 1b, bottom), while monitoring the Raman spectra from the junction. Figure 1c displays the waterfall plot of the obtained Raman spectra, where the horizontal axis the Raman shift, and the color scale the Raman intensity. When the tip is in the tunneling regime, only the optical phonon mode of the bulk silicon is observed at 520 cm-1. However, when the atomic point contact between the tip and the surface, the strong Raman scattering from the surface phonon modes suddenly appears. These modes disappear again when the tip is moved away from the surface and the atomic point contact is broken. Figure 3 Atomic point contact Raman spectra obtained at a partially oxidized area over the Si(111)-7 7 surface (indicated by the arrow in the STM image).It was previously thought that a plasmonic nanogap is necessary to obtain the ultrahigh sensitivity in tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, which typically requires a metal substrate. This imposed a severe limitation on measurable samples. The discovery of the huge Raman enhancement upon the atomic point contact formation will expand the potential of atomic-scale vibration spectroscopy, which is applicable to non-plasmonic samples and the exceptional chemical sensitivity will be obtained for many other materials. In addition, our results also suggest that atomic-scale structures play an indispensable role in metal-semiconductor hybrid nanosystems to affect their optoelectronic properties.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Their recently announced findings were published in Cell Chemical Biology.For years, medical professionals have struggled with bacterial infections becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. These molecular tweezers may be the key to battling one of greatest public health issues of the 21st century.""Our discovery prevents infection without building up antibiotic resistance, and it might even be preferable to develop treatments based on molecular tweezers rather than antibiotics,"" said BGU Department of Chemistry Prof. Raz Jelinek.The research team, led by Prof. Jelinek and his Ph.D. student Ravit Malishev, tested their molecular tweezers on the Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) bacteria. In the U.S. staph infections have an estimated mortality rate of over 25%, and 40% for drug-resistant strains.The tweezers target biofilm, a thin layer of fibers that protects the bacteria. By gripping the fibers and destroying the protective layer, the tweezers impair the bacteria without directly attacking it, which prevents resistance from occurring.Prof. Jelinek, who is also BGUs vice president of Research & Development and a member of the Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology explained, ""The tweezers are just like your home tweezers but a million times smaller, and instead of plucking hairs they attack fibers of the bacteria's biofilm."" By doing that they break the biofilm, making it more vulnerable to human immune defenses and external substances that are used against bacteria like antibiotics.""""The success of the study indicates an innovative direction of antibiotic treatments against pathogenic bacteria. We found that binding the tweezers to the biofilm disrupts its protective capabilities. Consequently, the bacterial pathogens become, less virulent to the human body, and, more vulnerable to elimination by the immune system. This breakthrough may open up new ways to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria."" Prof. Jelinex hopes that following further testing, a pill containing millions of ""swallowable tweezers"" could identify biofilms in the body and break them apart.Reference: Malishev R, Salinas N, Gibson J, et al.

Compared to outdoor air quality, indoor air quality is more relevant to people's health. Therefore, understanding the levels, sources and evolution of particulate matter (PM) indoors is important for the accurate evaluation of people's health risks to aerosol exposure.A research team led by Prof. Yele Sun from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences deployed a time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM) to measure time series and mass spectra of non-refractory species in a typical academic office in IAP. The study was published in Indoor Air.The researchers measured the concentration and chemical composition of indoor PM2.5 for one month along with simultaneous measurements outdoors. They also performed the open-close window and the dampness experiments in order to figure out the mechanism of indoor/outdoor air exchange, and the influence of increased humidity on the indoor PM2.5.They found that the indoor aerosol species were primarily from outdoor air exchange. ""The indoor and outdoor variation trends are similar for most of aerosol species,"" said Prof. Sun, ""However, the chemical compositions of PM2.5 are different. The concentration of organic aerosol from fossil fuel combustion and ammonium nitrate decreases because they evaporate or turn from particle to gas upon indoor transport when the indoor temperature is much higher than the outside in winter.""It is often believed that opening windows to ventilate can improve indoor air quality. However, according to this newly published study, the PM mass concentration outdoors is significantly higher than that in the office. Elevated natural ventilation will increase PM exposure indoors instead, and this increased exposure might be prolonged when outdoor PM got cleared up. ""So it's not a good idea to open windows when the air quality is not good outdoors."" Said Prof. Sun.The team also investigated the effect of air humidifiers, which are widely used to increase indoor humidity. Prof. Sun said, ""The increase of indoor relative humidity could lead to a significant increase in PM2.5 mass concentration, especially for organic aerosol. The increase is likely due to the partitioning of hygroscopic organic species from gas phase to particle phase in indoor air.""""Better understanding of the links between indoor and outdoor air quality will be needed in the future, as well as a more quantitative assessment of human exposure risks indoors,"" said Sun.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The work has now been published in the international journal Microbiome.Images of bare, naked white coral reefs have been increasingly circulating around the world. The typically colourful reefs of tropical oceans, which are home to many species of the marine ecosystem, are suffering from rising water temperatures due to global warming. There is no heat relieve for the corals in sight. Scientists are desperately seeking out ways to make the temperature-sensitive organisms more resistant to heat stress. A group of scientists led by GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel are developing a promising approach, which is based on a therapeutic treatment known from human medicine. The study was published in the international journal Microbiome.""The idea is that probiotic bacteria with beneficial functions could help a coral to better withstand heat stress,"" explains Dr Anna Roik from GEOMAR, lead author of the study, which was funded as part of a Future Ocean Network project at Kiel University. ""In the current study, we tested the approach of a 'microbiome transplantation', inspired by microbiome-based applications we know for example from clinical treatments"", Roik continues.The research group conducted coral microbiome transplantation experiments with the reef-building corals Pocillopora and Porites in the Andaman Sea in Thailand. They investigated whether this technique can improve the heat resistance of corals by modifying the bacterial microbiome. The scientists first looked for more heat-tolerant ""donor"" corals. ""We then used material from the coral tissue of the donor corals to inoculate conspecific, heat-sensitive recipients and then documented their bleaching responses and microbiome changes using a genetic analysis method called 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding"", explains Dr Roik.The recipient corals of both species bleached more mildly compared to the control group during a short-term heat stress test (34  C).

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/possible-cellular-origin-of-neuroblastoma-discovered-348584,Possible Cellular Origin of Neuroblastoma Discovered Researchers have discovered a previously unknown cell type that might potentially be the origin of neuroblastoma tumour cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer, most commonly affecting children aged between 2 -3 and can be fatal. Since the tumour cells resemble certain cells in the adrenal glands, a joint research group from MedUni Vienna's Center for Brain Research and the Swedish Karolinska Institute investigated the cellular origin of these cells and sympathetic neurons during the embryonic development of human adrenal glands. During the course of their investigations, they discovered a previously unknown cell type that might potentially be the origin of the tumour cells.Treatments for this disease are extremely aggressive and challenging and relapses are not uncommon. So far, little is known about the origins of this cancer or the causes of relapse. However, it is assumed that neuroblastomas are due to abnormalities in the neural crest cells, which form the peripheral nervous system during embryogenesis.The cells of neuroblastoma resemble sympathetic neurons. Although these neurons occur in sympathetic ganglia and are therefore found in many different sites in the human body, neuroblastomas often occur in the adrenal medulla. The reason for this is not yet clear. However, recent studies found that the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, which have long been thought to be related to sympathetic neurons and to derive from neural crest cells, are derived from a completely new cell type, namely from nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors. Based on these observations, the researchers led by Igor Adameyko from MedUni Vienna's Center for Brain Research and the Swedish Karolinska Institute looked for another new cell type in the human adrenal glands that might play a major role in the development of neuroblastoma.Cells develop in different directionsIn order to investigate the cellular origin of chromaffin cells and sympathetic neurons during embryonic development of the human adrenal glands, they analysed the RNA expression profiles of individual cells and found a population of intra-medullary sympathoblasts that derive from Schwann cell precursors. These cells divide and, in humans, organise themselves into large ganglia-like structures in the medulla of the developing adrenals. Such structures are primarily found during embryogenesis. After birth, only isolated cells or small groups of sympathetic nerves are observed. Based on these bioinformatic investigations, the researchers are now able to predict that these intra-adrenal sympathoblasts can develop into chromaffin cells under certain conditions.Further investigations will now be conducted to find out what happens if the cells are unable to turn into chromaffin cells. It is assumed that the nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors, which continue to divide for a long time and can differentiate to form various cell types, lead to the formation of neuroblastoma. The researchers therefore want to conduct a detailed study into the role of these cells in the development of neuroblastoma, in the hope that this will provide a basis for effective treatments.Important findings about adrenal gland developmentDuring the course of the investigations conducted so far, an atlas has been produced of the transcription profiles of individual cells in early stages of human adrenal development and this is a valuable and freely available resource for the scientific community and might be of particular interest to developmental biologists and endocrinologists studying congenital diseases of the adrenal glands.Reference: Kameneva P, Artemov AV, Kastriti ME, et al.

But the images are often lacking in quality, and it takes hours or days for massive amounts of data to be converted into 3D volumes and movies.Now, EMBL scientists have combined artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with two cutting-edge microscopy techniques - an advance that shortens the time for image processing from days to mere seconds, while ensuring that the resulting images are crisp and accurate. The findings are published in Nature Methods.""Ultimately, we were able to take 'the best of both worlds' in this approach,"" says Nils Wagner, one of the paper's two lead authors and now a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich. ""AI enabled us to combine different microscopy techniques, so that we could image as fast as light-field microscopy allows and get close to the image resolution of light-sheet microscopy.""Although light-sheet microscopy and light-field microscopy sound similar, these techniques have different advantages and challenges. Light-field microscopy captures large 3D images that allow researchers to track and measure remarkably fine movements, such as a fish larva's beating heart, at very high speeds. But this technique produces massive amounts of data, which can take days to process, and the final images usually lack resolution.Light-sheet microscopy homes in on a single 2D plane of a given sample at one time, so researchers can image samples at higher resolution. Compared with light-field microscopy, light-sheet microscopy produces images that are quicker to process, but the data are not as comprehensive, since they only capture information from a single 2D plane at a time.To take advantage of the benefits of each technique, EMBL researchers developed an approach that uses light-field microscopy to image large 3D samples and light-sheet microscopy to train the AI algorithms, which then create an accurate 3D picture of the sample.""If you build algorithms that produce an image, you need to check that these algorithms are constructing the right image,"" explains Anna Kreshuk, the EMBL group leader whose team brought machine learning expertise to the project. In the new study, the researchers used light-sheet microscopy to make sure the AI algorithms were working, Anna says. ""This makes our research stand out from what has been done in the past.""Robert Prevedel, the EMBL group leader whose group contributed the novel hybrid microscopy platform, notes that the real bottleneck in building better microscopes often isn't optics technology, but computation. That's why, back in 2018, he and Anna decided to join forces. ""Our method will be really key for people who want to study how brains compute. Our method can image an entire brain of a fish larva, in real time,"" Robert says.He and Anna say this approach could potentially be modified to work with different types of microscopes too, eventually allowing biologists to look at dozens of different specimens and see much more, much faster. For example, it could help to find genes that are involved in heart development, or could measure the activity of thousands of neurons at the same time.Next, the researchers plan to explore whether the method can be applied to larger species, including mammals.Reference: Wagner N, Beuttenmueller F, Norlin N, et al.

The cells that line the surfaces of organs or specific tissues, called epithelial cells, appear to speak two different languages - one for either side of the cell, according to a new study by researchers based in Japan.The discovery, published on March 16 in EMBO Reports, could have implications for understanding how cancer spreads and, potentially, for advanced treatments, the team says.The team, led by Mitsunori Fukuda, professor in the Laboratory of Membrane Trafficking Mechanisms, Department of Integrative Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences at Tohoku University, examined epithelial cells from a kidney model. The cells release particles called exosomes that carry bits of the cells themselves or information about the cells. The proteins and other genetic information in the exosomes can then influence how other cells behave or function. In health, such an information exchange could help the immune system mount a more tailored approach to an invading pathogen. Some diseased cells, such as cancer, can release exosomes that make healthy cells less resistant to invasion.""Single cells are known to release various kinds of exosomes, but very little is known about the mechanisms by which they are produced and released,"" Fukuda said. ""In this paper, we found that epithelial cells asymmetrically release two distinct types of exosomes with distinct protein compositions.""The researchers developed a purification method to separate out exosomes based on their protein makeup.""In this paper, we found that epithelial cells asymmetrically release two distinct types of exosomes - apical and basolateral - with distinct protein compositions,"" said first author Takahide Matsui, assistant professor, Laboratory of Membrane Trafficking Mechanisms, Department of Integrative Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences at Tohoku University.They found that exosomes released from the apical side of the cell, which faces an external space or lumen, were modulated by ALIX, a protein related to the particle formation inside the cells. Exosomes released from the basolateral side of the cell closest to other tissues and neighboring cells were triggered by ceramide, a fatty molecule. They also found that depleting ALIX and ceramide reduced the number of apical exosomes and basolateral exosomes released, respectively.Fukuda said that the results could help elucidate the cell-to-cell communication that allows cancer to migrate - and put a stop to it.""It will be interesting to investigate how cancer cells use two distinct mechanisms of exosome production during cancer progression,"" Fukuda said. ""Since exosomes from cancer cells are involved in their progression, our findings could lead to the discovery of new drugs for treatments for cancers in the future.""Matsui agreed, noting that their research could expand to other realms in health and in disease.""Our discovery provides an important clue to understanding the generation of different exosomes in many cell types in addition to epithelial cells,"" Matsui said.Reference: Matsui T, Osaki F, Hiragi S, Sakamaki Y, Fukuda M.

But placed one-on-one with a goalkeeper tasked with kicking a ball into the goal from just 12 yards away, Messi has missed 22% of all the penalty kicks he has ever taken. Penalties should, from a technical standpoint, be straightforward for professionals, but they are, of course, some of the most high-pressure moments in team sports.Whilst the phenomenon of world-class soccer players missing penalty kicks, known succinctly as choking, has been well-documented by sports psychologists and creators of mocking YouTube clips, what links pressure environments to these high-profile performance flubs has been less clear. Now, new research from the University of Twente in the Netherlands has added to a body of evidence suggesting that the activation of brain regions related to long-term thinking may be behind missed kicks.""Obviously, huge psychological pressure plays a role, but why does this pressure cause a missed penalty? We tried to answer this by measuring the brain activity of football players during the physical execution of a penalty kick,  says Max Slutter, a MSc student at the University of Twente and the study s lead author. To open a window into the penalty-taking brain, the authors of the study, published in Frontiers in Computer Science, had to overcome the long-standing challenge of examining brain activity in the brain during movement. The signals from delicately mapped brain regions become fuzzy and distorted when recorded during movement using classical brain imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Slutter and his co-authors, including Twente postdoc Nattapong Thammasan, opted to use an indirect imaging technique called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  Normally we would measure brain activity directly. This method instead measures oxygen levels in your brain. When the oxygen levels are higher, we can assume that the brain area is more activated. This measure is more resistant and more consistent regarding movement. The authors conducted an array of tests on a set of 22 volunteers, half of whom were experienced soccer players. The other half were chosen as complete football na fs, having barely ever kicked a ball, says Slutter.These volunteers were tasked with taking three kicks   one into an open net, one with a goalkeeper present who merely attempted to save the ball, and one with a goalkeeper who used mind games to get into the taker s head. Further ramping up the pressure in this final condition was a cash reward for success and a requirement to take the long walk from the center of the pitch to the penalty spot.The kickers were all fitted with fNIRS headsets that recorded their brain activity just before they took the penalty.""We found that players who were able to perform under pressure activated task-relevant areas of the brain,"" commented Thammasan in a AAAS press release. ""For example, increased activation of the motor cortex was related to performing under pressure. This seems logical, as movement is one of the most important elements when taking a penalty.""However, when players reported anxiety about the kick and missed penalties, another brain area lit up   the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This activation of this site of higher thinking in the brain, say the authors, may indicate focus moving off the kick and onto the long-term consequences of a miss.Interestingly, experienced kickers showed lower activation than rookie kickers in their left temporal cortex. This chimes in with the neural efficiency theory, says Slutter   the concept that experienced athletes, who have to an extent  automated  certain motor actions, need less brain activity to perform those activities. When the experienced players  temporal cortex activity spiked, they were more likely to then miss the penalty. By comparison, higher activity in rookies was associated with scoring. This is likely because experienced players are overthinking the kick, shifting them out of their automated skillsets, whereas the increased focus benefits kickers who are still learning the basics.Could these findings lead to better kick strategies? Slutter raises the prospect that one day, footballers could study their brain activity to train their brain to focus better on the kick, although he emphasizes that this is some way off.Whilst the fNIRS technique allowed an examination of brain activity that wouldn t have been possible with other techniques, it wasn t foolproof: residual noise meant that several of the study s significant findings disappeared after correcting for multiple comparisons between the study s many variables. Finally, it s unlikely that, even with a trash-talking goalkeeper, the conditions in the study replicated the immense pressure of a penalty kick watched from the stands and screens around the world.  It might be a while yet before Manchester United penalty taker Bruno Fernandes is seen walking up to the spot at Old Trafford with a brain imaging device strapped to his head.Reference: Slutter MWJ, Thammasan N, Poel M.

Largely responsible for the death of neurons are certain protein deposits in the brains of affected individuals: So-called beta-amyloid proteins, which form clumps (plaques) between neurons, and tau proteins, which stick together the inside of neurons. The causes of these deposits are as yet unclear. In addition, a rapidly progressive atrophy, i.e. a shrinking of the brain volume, can be observed in affected persons. Alzheimer's symptoms such as memory loss, disorientation, agitation and challenging behavior are the consequences.Scientists at the DZNE led by Prof. Michael Wagner, head of a research group at the DZNE and senior psychologist at the memory clinic of the University Hospital Bonn, have now found in a study that a regular Mediterranean-like dietary pattern with relatively more intake of vegetables, legumes, fruit, cereals, fish and monounsaturated fatty acids, such as from olive oil, may protect against protein deposits in the brain and brain atrophy. This diet has a low intake of dairy products, red meat and saturated fatty acids.","Published: May 7, 2021"

The findings, published in Nature today (Wednesday), alter the current view on how odours are detected and processed in the mammalian brain.Odour plumes, like the steam off a hot cup of coffee, are complex and often turbulent structures, and can convey meaningful information about an animal's surroundings, like the movements of a predator or the location of food sources. But it has previously been assumed that mammalian brains can't fully process these temporal changes in smell because they happen so rapidly, much faster than an animal can sniff.Using behavioural experiments where mice were exposed to incredibly short bursts of odour, neural imaging, electrophysiology and computer models, the scientists found that mice can, in fact, detect very rapid fluctuations within odour plumes, at rates previously not thought possible. They also showed that mice can use this information to distinguish whether odours are coming from the same or different sources, even if they are very close to each other.This suggests that the mammalian olfactory system, responsible for the sense of smell, is also key in processing the awareness of physical space and surroundings, guiding decisions important to survival.Andreas Schaefer, senior author and group leader of the Sensory Circuits and Neurotechnology Laboratory at the Crick and Professor of Neuroscience at UCL says: ""From an evolutionary point of view our findings make sense as they help to explain why there is a lot of computational power within the olfactory bulb, the part of the brain where the nose sends signals to. It isn't just processing chemicals from odours but can also calculate information about physical distance and source. It would have been odd for evolution to create such processing power in this part of the brain if it were not being used to help the species survive.""In one key experiment, the scientists trained mice to detect whether two odours were coming from the same source or separate sources. The mice were able to correctly distinguish this difference even when the odours were released in short blips, lasting only a 40th of a second each (40 Hz).Tobias Ackels, postdoc in the Sensory Circuits and Neurotechnology Laboratory at the Crick says: ""Previous research into the sense of smell was done on the assumption that mice couldn't distinguish the fine, fluctuating information in odour plumes.""We've shown that mice can access and process this information - this opens up a new dimension for studying the brain; we can run experiments that more effectively trigger neurons in a natural way and challenge the olfactory bulb. This will allow us to find out more about how this part of the brain works and how information about the world is extracted by neural circuits.""As part of the study, the scientists designed new technologies including a high speed odour delivery device and equipment that can measure several odours simultaneously with extremely high precision.These innovations will enable more sophisticated work on the olfactory bulb, increasing our knowledge of how this brain region processes information about the environment and influences behaviour. Ultimately, the team aim to build understanding of how sensory circuits link the external world with internal thought and action.Reference: Ackels T, Erskine A, Dasgupta D, et al.

The article, ""Social Cognition in Multiple Sclerosis: A 3-Year Follow-Up MRI and Behavioral Study"" was published on March 9, 2021, in Diagnostics.The authors are Helen M. Genova, PhD, of Kessler Foundation's Center for Neuropsychology and Neuroscience Research, and Stefano Ziccardi, PhD, Marco Pitteri, PhD, and Massimiliano Calabrese, MD, of the University of Verona. Dr. Genova also has an academic appointment at Rutgers University.Some recent MS research, including work led by Dr. Genova, has shown that social cognition deficits may affect people with MS who otherwise have no other cognitive impairments. Social cognition, which is required to understand and process the emotions of others, is an extremely important skill set for forming successful relationships with others, and deficits in this area can significantly affect a person's quality of life.Previous studies investigating the prevalence of social cognition impairment among people with MS suggested that impairment tracked with symptoms such as cognitive fatigue. More research was needed to clarify these results and determine whether changes to the area of the brain called the amygdala--known to be associated with emotions--correlated with social cognition. Moreover, no study had investigated the social cognition performance in people with MS with a longitudinal perspective, meaning that no data existed on the evolution of social cognition deficits over time.In this three-year follow-up study, MS researchers conducted a longitudinal investigation of the evolution of social cognition deficits and amygdala damage in a group of 26 cognitively-normal people with relapsing-remitting MS. They analyzed the association between social cognition and several domains related to psychological well-being. Concurrently, they investigated the evolution of amygdala lesion burden and atrophy and their association with social cognition performance.To gather data, the team used a battery of neuropsychological tests; social cognition tasks to assess theory of mind, facial emotion recognition, and empathy; and 3T-MRI to analyze structural amygdala damage. They then compared these findings to baseline data collected from participants three years prior.The results confirmed that, despite being classified as cognitively normal, people with relapsing-remitting MS showed a significantly lower performance in several social cognition domains as compared to a matched group of healthy controls. These domains include facial emotion recognition, in particular fear and anger, as well as empathy. Longitudinal changes in the social cognition domain were also found to be associated with psychological outcomes of daily living, such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, and social functioning quality of life.""We confirmed the longitudinal stability of social cognition deficits in cognitively-normal people with relapsing-remitting MS, mirroring the amygdala structural damage and psychological well-being,"" said Dr. Genova. ""These results confirm that social cognition exerts a key role in MS, affecting individuals' everyday lives.

All bacteria are related and derive from a common ancestral bacterial cell. Until now, the shape of the bacterial tree of life and the placement of its root has been contested, but is necessary to shed light on the early evolution of life on our planet.Just as in plants and animals, the genomes of bacteria are home to many different genes. However, bacterial genes are not only inherited vertically from mother to daughter, but are also frequently exchanged horizontally between potentially distant family members. Amongst its many functions, horizontal gene sharing drives the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance amongst pathogenic Bacteria. The combination of vertical and horizontal ancestry complicates how we think about evolutionary relationships among bacteria, with the former best represented as a tree and the latter as a network. The team used phylogenetic methods that simultaneously consider the vertical and horizontal transmission of genes and found that, on average, genes travel vertically two-thirds of the time, suggesting that a tree provides a meaningful framework for interpreting bacterial evolution.Co-author Phil Hugenholtz, at the University of Queensland, Australia, noted: ""For years, vertical and horizontal evolution have been seen as adversaries with researchers often falling into the tree or network camp. Here we show that they can be investigated together to address some of the most vexing questions in early evolution. Overlaying the horizontal movement of genes onto the vertical  species  tree allowed us to identify the most likely root of the tree and the gene content of the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA).  explains co-author Gergely Sz ll si, at E tv s Lor nd University, Hungary.The analysis predicts a root between two major clades, the Terrabacteria (mostly bacteria with single-membranes such as Bacillus) and the Gracilicutes (mostly Bacteria with a double-membrane such as E. coli). This contrasts with recent proposals placing the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) at the base of the tree. CPR are unusual ultrasmall bacteria reliant on other host cells for survival. Our analyses suggested that the CPR are members of the Terrabacteria and sister to the free-living Chloroflexota meaning that the host dependency of CPR bacteria is a derived rather than ancestral characteristic  said co-author Anja Spang, at The Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) in the Netherlands.The authors predict that LBCA was more complex than previously thought, having a double-membraned cell that was able to swim, sense its environment, and defend itself against viruses.Dr Williams explained:  Bacteria can have one or two cell membranes, and one of the big questions in early evolution is how these two kinds of cells are related to each other. Our analysis suggests that the common ancestor of all living bacteria already had two membranes, so the question now is how apparently simpler single-membrane cells evolved from double-membraned cells, and how many times this has occurred during evolution. We believe that our approach to integrating vertical and horizontal gene transmission holds promise for answering this and many other open questions in evolutionary biology.

However, not all neurons are impacted equally. Some types of neurons in certain brain regions are more susceptible, and even among those subtypes mysteriously some perish and some do not.Researchers at Gladstone Institutes have uncovered molecular clues that help explain what makes some neurons more susceptible than others in Alzheimer s disease. In a study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, the scientists present evidence that neurons with high levels of the protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) are more sensitive to degeneration, and that this susceptibility is linked to apoE s regulation of immune-response molecules within neurons. This is the first time such a link has been established, which is quite exciting and could open new paths to developing treatments for Alzheimer s disease,  says Gladstone Senior Investigator Yadong Huang, MD, PhD, senior author of the study.","Published: May 7, 2021"

However, given the vast diversity of microbes found in the human body, identifying which bacteria may be associated with neurodegeneration is like finding a needle in a haystack.Seeking that proverbial needle, scientists at the University of Florida are looking in an unexpected place: the digestive tract of a tiny, translucent worm called Caenorhabditis elegans.New research published in PLOS Pathogens establishes, for the first time, a link between specific bacteria species and physical manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases. The study's lead author is Alyssa Walker, a microbiology and cell science doctoral candidate in the UF/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.""Looking at the microbiome is a relatively new approach to investigating what causes neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we were able to show that specific species of bacteria play a role in the development of these conditions,"" said Daniel Czyz, Walker's dissertation advisor.Czyz is the senior author of the study and an assistant professor in the UF/IFAS department of microbiology and cell science.""We also showed that some other bacteria produce compounds that counteract these 'bad' bacteria. Recent studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease are deficient in these 'good' bacteria, so our findings may help explain that connection and open up an area of future study,"" he added.All neurodegenerative diseases can be traced to problems with the way proteins are handled in the body. If proteins are misfolded, they build up and accumulate in tissues. These protein aggregates, as scientists call them, interfere with cell functioning and lead to neurodegenerative disorders.Czyz and his co-authors wanted to know if introducing certain bacteria into the C. elegans worms would be followed by protein aggregation in the worms' tissues.""That is, in fact, what we observed. We have a way of marking the aggregates so they glow green under the microscope. We saw that worms colonized by certain bacteria species were lit up with aggregates that were toxic to tissues, while those colonized by the control bacteria were not,"" Czyz said. ""This occurred not just in the intestinal tissues, where the bacteria are, but all over the worms' bodies, in their muscles, nerves and even reproductive organs.""Surprisingly, the offspring of affected worms also showed increased protein aggregation even though these offspring never encountered the bacteria originally associated with the condition.The worms colonized by pathogenic bacteria have more protein aggregates linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Credit: University of Florida""This is very interesting because it suggests that these bacteria generate some sort of a signal that can be passed along to the next generation,"" Czyz said.Worms colonized by the ""bad"" bacteria also lost mobility, a common symptom of neurodegenerative diseases.""A healthy worm moves around by rolling and thrashing. When you pick up a healthy worm, it will roll off the pick, a simple device that we use to handle these tiny animals. But worms with the bad bacteria couldn't do that because of the appearance of toxic protein aggregates,"" explained Walker, who developed this assessment method.""You could compare the pick to an obstacle course: just as a person with a neurodegenerative disease will have trouble getting across, the same is true with these worms, just at a much smaller scale,"" Czyz added.""The worms are very delicate, so you need a tool that won't damage them. They are also transparent and have a simple body plan. Studies like ours are possible because these worms normally feed on bacteria,"" Czyz said.""The worms are only one millimeter long, and they each have exactly 959 cells,"" Czyz said. ""But in many ways, they are a lot like us humans they have intestines and muscles and nerves, but instead of being composed of billions of cells, each organ is just a handful of cells. They are like living test tubes. Their small size allows us to do experiments in a much more controlled way and answer important questions we can apply in future experiments with higher organisms and, eventually, people.""Currently the Czyz lab is testing hundreds of strains of bacteria found in the human gut to see how they affect protein aggregation in C. elegans. The group is also investigating how bacteria associated with neurodegeneration cause protein misfolding at the molecular level.Czyz is also interested in possible connections between antibiotic-resistant bacteria and protein misfolding.""Almost all of the bacteria we found associated with protein misfolding are also associated with antibiotic-resistant infections in people. However, it will take many more years of research before we can understand what, if any, connection there is between antibiotic resistance and neurodegenerative diseases,"" Czyz said.Reference: Walker AC, Bhargava R, Vaziriyan-Sani AS, et al.

Fossil apes are often at the center of the debate, with some scientists dismissing their importance to the origins of the human lineage (the ""hominins""), and others conferring them starring evolutionary roles. A new review out on May 7 in the journal Science looks at the major discoveries in hominin origins since Darwin's works and argues that fossil apes can inform us about essential aspects of ape and human evolution, including the nature of our last common ancestor.Humans diverged from apes--specifically, the chimpanzee lineage--at some point between about 9.3 million and 6.5 million years ago, towards the end of the Miocene epoch. To understand hominin origins, paleoanthropologists aim to reconstruct the physical characteristics, behavior, and environment of the last common ancestor of humans and chimps.""When you look at the narrative for hominin origins, it's just a big mess--there's no consensus whatsoever,"" said Sergio Alm cija, a senior research scientist in the American Museum of Natural History's Division of Anthropology and the lead author of the review. ""People are working under completely different paradigms, and that's something that I don't see happening in other fields of science.""There are two major approaches to resolving the human origins problem: ""Top-down,"" which relies on analysis of living apes, especially chimpanzees; and ""bottom-up,"" which puts importance on the larger tree of mostly extinct apes. For example, some scientists assume that hominins originated from a chimp-like knuckle-walking ancestor. Others argue that the human lineage originated from an ancestor more closely resembling, in some features, some of the strange Miocene apes.In reviewing the studies surrounding these diverging approaches, Alm cija and colleagues with expertise ranging from paleontology to functional morphology and phylogenetics discuss the limitations of relying exclusively on one of these opposing approaches to the hominin origins problem. ""Top-down"" studies sometimes ignore the reality that living apes (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and hylobatids) are just the survivors of a much larger, and now mostly extinct, group. On the other hand, studies based on the ""bottom-up""approach are prone to giving individual fossil apes an important evolutionary role that fits a preexisting narrative.""In The Descent of Man in 1871, Darwin speculated that humans originated in Africa from an ancestor different from any living species. However, he remained cautious given the scarcity of fossils at the time,"" Alm cija said. ""One hundred fifty years later, possible hominins--approaching the time of the human-chimpanzee divergence--have been found in eastern and central Africa, and some claim even in Europe. In addition, more than 50 fossil ape genera are now documented across Africa and Eurasia. However, many of these fossils show mosaic combinations of features that do not match expectations for ancient representatives of the modern ape and human lineages. As a consequence, there is no scientific consensus on the evolutionary role played by these fossil apes.""Overall, the researchers found that most stories of human origins are not compatible with the fossils that we have today.""Living ape species are specialized species, relicts of a much larger group of now extinct apes. When we consider all evidence--that is, both living and fossil apes and hominins--it is clear that a human evolutionary story based on the few ape species currently alive is missing much of the bigger picture,"" said study co-author Ashley Hammond, an assistant curator in the Museum's Division of Anthropology.Kelsey Pugh, a Museum postdoctoral fellow and study co-author adds, ""The unique and sometimes unexpected features and combinations of features observed among fossil apes, which often differ from those of living apes, are necessary to untangle which features hominins inherited from our ape ancestors and which are unique to our lineage.""Living apes alone, the authors conclude, offer insufficient evidence. ""Current disparate theories regarding ape and human evolution would be much more informed if, together with early hominins and living apes, Miocene apes were also included in the equation,"" says Alm cija. ""In other words, fossil apes are essential to reconstruct the 'starting point' from which humans and chimpanzees evolved.""Reference: Alm cija S, Hammond AS, Thompson NE, et al.

In a study published May 3 in Nature Biotechnology, UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences researchers implanted novel neurostimulation devices that monitor brain activity for many months, with and without deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy. Pairing the brain recordings with wearable monitors of movement, they identified patterns of brain activity corresponding to specific movement abnormalities associated with Parkinson s. Their research provides the first evidence, during normal activities of daily living, for a long-held hypothesis that Parkinson s symptoms are related to erratic brain wave patterns, and demonstrate how DBS restores order to patient brain waves.   We can record hundreds of hours of brain wave activity wirelessly as patients go about normal activities,  said Philip Starr, MD, PhD, the Dolores Cakebread Professor of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and senior author of the study.  It allows us, really for the first time, to understand the brain activity behind specific neurological problems as they occur in the real world.  Parkinson s disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that causes slow movement (bradykinesia), trouble walking, and tremors, as well as symptoms unrelated to movement. According to the Parkinson s Foundation, some 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson s disease every year. The exact cause of Parkinson s is not known, but all patients show decreased levels of dopamine   a neurotransmitter that regulates motivation in the brain.  It s long been suspected that erratic brain wave patterns also play a role in triggering Parkinson s symptoms. Previous research in monitoring brain wave activity of Parkinson s patients has been limited to short periods in clinical settings. This greatly limits the amount of data available for analysis   providing a limited glimpse of patient brain activity which cycles and changes throughout the day. Starr and study lead author Ro ee Gilron, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Neurological Surgery, sought to get a more complete picture. They implanted small sensors that measure electrical activity into the subthalamus and motor cortex brain areas of five patients with Parkinson s disease. These sensors were connected to pulse generators enabled to sense brain activity. This allowed for continuous recording of brain activity while patients went about their daily routine. Months of recordings produced a massive amount of data. To sort through it all, the researchers developed an algorithm to compare brain wave activity with data recorded from movement-sensing devices that patients wore on their wrists. They discovered that periods of dyskinesia (excessive movement induced by medications) and bradykinesia corresponded with exaggerated brain waves in specific frequency bands, both in the subthalamus and in motor cortex. After months of recording and analysis, the researchers went further and measured the effect of DBS on the patients. DBS delivers electrical impulses into the brain and has long been used to ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson s disease, though why it worked was not previously understood. This study demonstrated that deep brain stimulation appears to improve Parkinson s symptoms by regulating patients  erratic brain wave patterns, partly by suppressing lower frequency waves that inhibit movement, and regulating higher frequency waves that promote movement. Previous studies using implanted recording systems could not record the effects of active stimulation on brain wave activity because the electrical signals created by stimulation caused recording interference. In the new study, Gilron and colleagues developed a workaround using the same principal used in noise cancelling headphones. By offsetting the electrical waves created by stimulation, the researchers could make the signals cancel each other out, allowing for accurate recording of brain waves by the recording lead.   This is the first time we ve been able to measure the effect of continuous stimulation on brain waves,  said Gilron.  We ve done deep brain stimulation in hundreds of thousands of patients before without any way to monitor the immediate effect. It was like trying to treat blood pressure without measuring it.  These broad findings help clarify some underlying factors in Parkinson s Disease, but every Parkinson s patient will likely have their own unique brain wave fluctuations. The researchers say that this is exactly why continuous neural recording is so crucial to successful treatment. The massive dataset accumulated from patient recordings helps to reveal the most minute brain wave patterns that correlate with Parkinson s symptoms. With proper analysis, onset of Parkinson s symptoms could be anticipated, and brain wave patterns corrected when symptoms manifest.  It s like the Hubble Space Telescope,  said Gilron.  We could view the night sky before it, but Hubble allowed us to see much greater detail and volume and it led to unique discoveries. I hope that this technique will as well.  The next step for the researchers is a randomized clinical trial including 10 patients. The researchers believe that this will greatly accelerate individualized treatments for Parkinson s disease because new algorithms to identify symptom patterns can be tested immediately, as opposed to the years and sometimes decades involved in developing new medications. The findings also have potential beyond Parkinson s disease, the researchers say. Numerous neurological disorders related to erratic brain wave activity like epilepsy, chronic depression and chronic pain could likely be treated in the same way  through real-time monitoring of brain activity and personalized neuromodulation.  We re looking at the Parkinson s population as a way to develop this platform,  said Starr.  Hopefully this will be utilized in disorders where we currently don t have any effective stimulation therapies. Reference: Gilron R, Little S, Perrone R, et al.

Yet at this stage a mass of cells known as the bipotential gonad that ultimately develops into either ovaries or testes has yet to commit to its final destiny.While researchers had studied the steps that go into the later stages of this process, little has been known about the precursors of the bipotential gonad. In a new study published in Cell Reports and co-led by Kotaro Sasaki of Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine, an international team lays out the detailed development of this key facet of sexual determination in two mammalian models.""Using single-cell transcriptome data, we can get a lot of information about gene expression at each developmental stage,"" says Sasaki. ""We can define what the default process is and how it might go awry in some cases. This has never been done in traditional developmental biology. Now we can understand development in molecular terms.""Disorders of sex development (DSD) occur when internal and external reproductive structures develop differently from what would be expected based on an individuals' genetics. For example someone with XY chromosomes might develop ovaries. These conditions often affect fertility and are associated with an increased risk of germ cell tumors.""These disorders oftentimes create psychological and physical distress for patients,"" Sasaki says. ""That's why understanding gonadal development is important.""To understand atypical development, Sasaki and colleagues in the current study sought to layout the steps of typical development, working with a mouse model and a monkey model.The researchers began by examining mouse embryos throughout embryonic development, using molecular markers to track the location of different proteins suspected to be involved in the formation of reproductive structures. They noticed that by day nine of a mouse's embryonic development, a structure called the posterior intermediate mesoderm (PIM) lit up brightly with the marker for a gene critical to the development of gonads, kidneys, and the hormone-producing adrenal glands, which are located adjacent to the kidneys.Zeroing in on the PIM and its progeny cells, the team found that, by day 10.5, these also expressed a marker known to be associated with the bipotential gonad.""People have previously studied the origin of the urogenital organs and the kidney and based on that believed that their origins were very close,"" Sasaki says. ""So our hypothesis was that the PIM was the origin of the gonads as well as the kidneys.""To identify the origin of the gonad, they performed lineage tracing, in which scientists label cells in order to track their descendents, which indeed supported the connection between the PIM and the gonads.To further confirm that the PIM played a similar role in an organism closer to humans in reproductive biology, the researchers made similar observations in embryos from cynomolgus monkeys. Though the developmental timing was different from the mouse, as was expected, the PIM again appeared to give rise to the bipotential gonad.Digging even deeper into the molecular mechanism of the transition between the PIM and bipotential gonad, the researchers used a cutting-edge technique: single-cell sequencing analysis, whereby they can identify which genes are being turned on during each developmental stage.Not only were they able to identify genes that were turned on--many of which had never before been associated with reproductive development--but they observed a transition state between the PIM and bipotential gonad, called the coelomic epithelium. Comparing the mice and monkey embryos, the researchers came up with a group of genes that were conserved, or shared between the species. ""Some of these genes are already known to be important for the development of mouse and human ovaries and testes,"" Sasaki says, ""and some have been implicated in the development of DSDs.""He notes that in roughly half of patients with DSDs, however, the genetic cause is unknown. ""So this database we're assembling may now be used to predict some additional genes that are important in DSD and could be used for screening and diagnosis of DSDs, or even treatment and prevention.""The study also illuminated the relationship between the origin of the kidneys, adrenal glands, and gonads. ""They all originate from the PIM, but the timing and positioning is different,"" Sasaki says.The adrenal glands, he says, develop from the anterior portion of the PIM, or that section closer to the head and arise early, while the kidney arises later from the posterior portion of the PIM. The gonadal glands span the PIM, with some regions developing earlier and others later.In future studies, Sasaki and colleagues would like to continue teasing out the details and stages of gonadal development. Sasaki's ultimate goal is to coax a patient's own stem cells to grow into reproductive organs in the lab.""Some patients with DSDs don't have ovaries and testes, and some cancer patients undergo chemotherapy and completely lose their ovary function,"" Sasaki says. ""If you could induce a stem cell to grow into an ovary in the lab, you could provide a replacement therapy for these patients, allowing them to regain normal hormone levels and even fertility. With a precise molecular map to the developing gonad in hand, we are now one step closer to the this goal.""Reference: Sasaki K, Oguchi A, Cheng K, et al.

But the findings could contribute to ongoing efforts to develop a cumulative risk score for psychosis that would allow for earlier detection and treatment, as well as targeted therapies. The discovery was made with the largest-ever pooling of brain scans in children and young adults determined by psychiatric assessment to be at high risk of developing psychosis.""These results were, in a sense, sobering,"" said Maria Jalbrzikowski, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry at Pitt. ""On the one hand, our data set includes 600% more high-risk youth who developed psychosis than any existing study, allowing us to see statistically significant results in brain structure. But the variance between whether or not a high-risk youth develops psychosis is so small that it would be impossible to see a difference at the individual level. More work is needed for our findings to be translated into clinical care.""Psychosis is an umbrella term for a constellation of severe mental disorders that cause people to have difficulty determining what is real and what is not. Most often, individuals have hallucinations where they see or hear things that others do not. They also may have strongly held beliefs, or delusions, even when most people do not believe them. Schizophrenia is only one disorder associated with psychosis, and psychotic symptoms can occur in other psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, depression, body dysmorphic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. In people who receive a diagnosis of psychosis, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in outcomes over time.Diagnosis usually happens in later adolescence and early adulthood, but most often symptoms begin to manifest in the teen years, when clinicians can use psychological assessments to determine a person's risk of developing full-blown psychosis.Jalbrzikowsi and Dennis Hernaus, Ph.D., assistant professor in the School of Mental Health and Neuroscience at Maastricht University, are co-chairs of the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group. This group pooled structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 3,169 volunteer participants at an average age of 21 who were recruited at 31 different institutions. About half--1,792 of the participants--had been determined to be at ""clinical high risk for developing psychosis."" Of those high-risk participants, 253 went on to develop psychosis within two years. The co-chairs emphasized that this study would not be possible without the collaborative efforts of the 100-plus researchers involved.When looking at all the scans together, the team found that those at high risk for psychosis had widespread lower cortical thickness, a measure of the thickness of the brain's gray matter. In high-risk youth who later developed psychosis, a thinner cortex was most pronounced in several temporal and frontal regions.Everyone goes through a cortical thinning process as they develop into an adult, but the team found that in younger participants between 12 and 16 years old who developed psychosis the thinning was already present. These high-risk youth who developed psychosis also progressed at a slower rate than in the control group.""We don't yet know exactly what this means, but adolescence is a critical time in a child's life--it's a time of opportunity to take risks and explore, but also a period of vulnerability,"" Jalbrzikowski said. ""We could be seeing the result of something that happened even earlier in brain development but only begins to influence behavior during this developmental stage.""Hernaus stressed that these findings underscore the importance of early detection and intervention in people who show risk factors for developing psychosis, which include hearing whispers from voices that aren't there and a family history of psychosis.""Until now, researchers have primarily studied how the brains of people with clinical high risk for psychosis differ at a given point in time,"" Hernaus said. ""An important next step is to better understand brain changes over time, which could provide new clues on underlying mechanisms relevant to psychosis.""Reference: ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group.

A new drug is usually first tested on adults, and results from these trials are used to select doses for pediatric trials. The underlying assumption is typically that children are like adults, just smaller, which often holds true, but may also overlook differences that arise from the fact that children's organs are still developing.Compounding the problem, pediatric trials don't always shed light on other differences that can affect recommendations for drug doses. There are many factors that limit children's participation in drug trials - for instance, some diseases simply are rarer in children - and consequently, the generated datasets tend to be very sparse.To make drugs and their development safer for children, researchers at Aalto University and the pharmaceutical company Novartis have developed a method that makes better use of available data.'This is a method that could help determine safe drug doses more quickly and with less observations than before,' says co-author Aki Vehtari, an associate professor of computer science at Aalto University and the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence FCAI.In their study, the research team created a model that improves our understanding of how organs develop.'The size of an organ is not necessarily the only thing that affects its performance. Kids' organs are simply not as efficient as those of adults. In drug modeling, if we assume that size is the only thing that matters, we might end up giving too large of doses,' explains Eero Siivola, first author of the study and doctoral student at Aalto University.Whereas the standard approach of assessing pediatric data relies on subjective evaluations of model diagnostics, the new approach, based on Gaussian process regression, is more data-driven and consequently less prone to bias. It is also better at handling small sample sizes as uncertainties are accounted for.The research comes out of FCAI's research programme on Agile and probabilistic AI, offering a great example of a method that makes the best out of even very scarce datasets.In the study, the researchers demonstrate their approach by re-analyzing a pediatric trial investigating Everolimus, a drug used to prevent the rejection of organ transplants. But the possible benefits of their method are far reaching.'It works for any drug whose concentration we want to examine,' Vehtari says, like allergy and pain medication.The approach could be particularly useful for situations where a new drug is tested on a completely new group -- of children or adults -- which is small in size, potentially making the trial phase much more efficient than it currently is. Another promising application relates to extending use of an existing drug to other symptoms or diseases; the method could support this process more effectively than current practices.Reference: Siivola E, Weber S, Vehtari A.

Their countless applications can help develop and implement tailored therapies for each patient. The revolutionary development of organoids started in Utrecht with a group of curious scientists. But when organoid research starting booming, confusion arose. What exactly is an organoid? Are there different types, and if so, what should they be called? A group of experts from around the world now publishes the first consensus on what is - and what is not - an organoid.Bart Spee, Associate Professor at Utrecht University's faculty of Veterinary Medicine, is one of the initiators of the publication in Cell Stem Cell on May 6th. ""Now that research into organoids is increasing, it is very important to have a clear definition and a coherent system to describe these cell structures. In the past, easy-to-grow cell lines have been put together in 3D and the resulting cell cluster was named an organoid. But according to our definition, it is not. Because such a cell line is not representative of all the differences between individuals that you also see in nature.""According to the new definition, an organoid must consist of primary cells which have been isolated from diseased or healthy tissues, for example, cancer cells from tumours. This provides a good representation of all the natural differences between individuals, and allows researchers to investigate whether certain therapies work for specific patient groups. That is simply not possible with standard cell lines. These are perfectly suitable for fundamental studies, but clinical applications ask for representative cell lines based on primary cells.In the new system, different types of organoids are classified into one of three categories depending on defining characteristics. Spee explains: ""Now you might hear things like 'a liver organoid', but the liver consists of several important cell types such as hepatocytes and bile duct cells (cholangiocytes). Therefore, it is important that researchers are specific when describing the organoid system they are culturing.""Future-proof""Because new types of organoids will follow in the future, we have made our system future proof"", says Luc van der Laan, Professor of Liver Regenerative Medicine at Erasmus MC. ""And now that the first clinical application trials using organoids for organ repair are making their entrance, it is important to define precisely which organoid types are being used. Therefore, we developed a number of criteria to characterise future organoids. Our definition is based on organoids of cells of the liver, pancreas and bile ducts, but it is applicable to all tissues, so also organoids of cells of for example the gut, brain, or skin.""How do you reach consensus on a definition in such a dynamic field? The team sent the vast majority of scientists who ever published on organoids a list of open questions about the definition, on basis of which they could further refine it. ""The 85% response rate shows that the hundred scientists involved also recognised the urgency of a good definition"", says Spee. ""We then spent hundreds of hours on video calls with scientists from all over the world. This methods worked very well and can also be used in other scientific fields where consensus must be reached on certain terminology, for example in pathology.""Reference: Marsee A, Roos FJM, Verstegen MMA, et al.

A single archaeal enzyme can produce a spectacular range of natural and non-natural cardiolipins, as well as other phospholipids. The results, which show potential for biotechnological applications, were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.The phospholipids that are most abundant in cell membranes contain a hydrophilic head to which two hydrophobic tails are connected. Cardiolipins - so-called because they were first identified in heart cells - are slightly different since they are made up of a single head group that is attached to four lipid tails.

The results matched a DNA sample obtained from a direct descendant of Gregory.The remains of the officer were found on King William Island, Nunavut.

In April 1848, 105 survivors abandoned their ice-trapped ships in a desperate escape attempt. None would survive. Since the mid-19th century, skeletal remains of dozens of crew members have been found on King William Island, but none had been positively identified.To date, the DNA of 26 other members of the Franklin expedition have been extracted from remains found in nine archaeological sites situated along the line of the 1848 retreat.

We were interested in asking whether we could identify mechanisms that might be contributing to death in COVID-19,  says MGH infectious disease expert Marcia Goldberg, who studies interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts, and is senior author of the study.  In other words, why do some patients die from this disease, while others   who appear to be just as ill   survive? In March 2020, when the first patients with symptoms of COVID-19 began arriving at MGH s emergency department (ED), Goldberg was contacted by her colleague, Michael Filbin, an attending physician and director of Clinical Research at MGH s ED, and lead author of the study. Filbin and Goldberg had earlier begun collaborating with MGH immunologist Nir Hacohen to develop methods for studying human immune responses to infections, which they had applied to the condition known as bacterial sepsis. The three agreed to tackle this new problem with the goal of understanding how the human immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2, the novel pathogen that causes COVID-19.To undertake this study, the MGH team used proteomics, which is the analysis of the entire protein composition (or proteome) of a cell, tissue, or organism. In this case, proteomic analysis was used to study blood specimens taken from patients arriving at the hospital s ED with respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Collecting these specimens required a large team of collaborators from many departments, which worked overtime for five weeks to amass blood samples from 306 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, as well as from 78 patients with similar symptoms who tested negative for the coronavirus.Next, Arnav Mehta, a postdoctoral researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, was brought on board to oversee interpretation of the complex data produced by the proteomic analysis. Mehta also works in Hacohen s lab, and the two had long been interested in using proteomic analysis of blood as an alternative to biopsies (which are invasive and painful).  We have been asking, what can we learn about what s happening in the body just by looking at protein signatures in the blood?  says Mehta.The study found that most patients with COVID-19 have a consistent protein signature, regardless of disease severity; as would be expected, their bodies mount an immune response by producing proteins that attack the virus.  But we also found a small subset of patients with the disease who did not demonstrate the pro-inflammatory response that is typical of other COVID-19 patients,  says Filbin, yet these patients were just as likely as others to have severe disease. Filbin notes that patients in this subset tended to be older people with chronic diseases, who likely had weakened immune systems.The next step was to compare the protein signatures of patients with severe disease (defined as those who required intubation or who died within 28 days of hospital admission) with patients with less-severe cases of COVID-19. The comparison allowed the researchers to identify more than 250  severity associated  proteins. Importantly, notes Mehta, blood was drawn from patients three times (on enrollment, then three and seven days later).  That allowed us to look at the trajectory of the disease,  says Mehta. Among other revelations, this showed that the most prevalent severity-associated protein, a pro-inflammatory protein called interleukin-6, or IL-6, rose steadily in patients who died, while it rose and then dropped in those with severe disease who survived. Early attempts by other groups to treat COVID-19 patients experiencing acute respiratory distress with drugs that block IL-6 were disappointing, though more recent studies show promise in combining these medications with the steroid dexamethasone.However, Hacohen notes that many of the other severity-associated proteins the analysis identified are likely important for understanding why only a portion of COVID-19 develop severe cases. Learning how the disease affects the lungs, heart and other organs is essential, he says, and proteomic analysis of the blood is a relatively easy method for getting that information.  You can ask which of the many thousands of proteins that are circulating in your blood are associated with the actual outcome,  says Hacohen,  and whether there is a set of proteins that tell us something. Goldberg believes that the proteomic signatures identified in this study will do just that.  They are highly likely to be useful in figuring out some of the underlying mechanisms that lead to severe disease and death in COVID-19,  says Goldberg, noting her gratitude to the patients involved in the study. Their samples are already being used to study other aspects of COVID-19, such as identifying the qualities of antibodies that patients form against the virus.Reference: Filbin MR, Mehta A, Schneider AM, et al.

The study, conducted by the research groups of Associate Professor Minna Kaikkonen-M tt  and Academy Professor Seppo Yl -Herttuala, provides a better understanding of the complex interplay of ncRNAs with gene regulation, which might open up novel therapeutic approaches in the future. The results were published in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Journal.Over the past years, the development of next generation sequencing techniques has revealed that around 97% of the human transcriptome is transcribed as non-coding RNAs, and although the role of the vast majority remains uncharacterized, many functions such as gene regulation have been proven.On the other hand, endothelial growth factors VEGF-A and VEGF-C are the main regulator of angiogenesis, i.e., new blood vessel formation. Due to their important role in vasculature development, they constitute a potential target for the treatment of several diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Therapeutic angiogenesis has been developed as a promising strategy to rescue ischemic tissues by induction of new blood vessels sprouting from existing vasculature but so far, very few results with clinical significance have been achieved.  Therefore, a deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the expression of these key angiogenic factors is needed for the future therapeutic avenues.In this study, researchers performed in-depth characterization of the genomic loci around the VEGFA and VEGFC genes and identified novel non-coding RNAs, in particular enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). While the enhancers clearly upregulated gene expression, lncRNAs demonstrated various functions. Interestingly, lncRNAs were also regulating other targets including factors related to endothelial functions, such as angiogenesis and cell proliferation.Reference: Mushimiyimana I, Tomas Bosch V, Niskanen H, et al.

Transmitted by the African fruit bat and by direct human-to-human contact, Marburg virus disease currently has no approved vaccine or antivirals to prevent or treat it.A team of researchers is working to change that. In a new paper in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, investigators from Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine, working together with scientists from the Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center and the Texas Biomedical Research Institute, report encouraging results from tests of an experimental antiviral targeting Marburg virus. The compound blocks the virus from departing infected cells, thus putting the brakes on the spread of infection. Their findings are the first to show that this novel class of inhibitors can be effective against the infection in an animal model.In addition, due to possible similarities in virus-host interactions between Marburg and SARS-CoV-2, the team has conducted experiments on the culprit behind the coronavirus pandemic. While preliminary and thus-far-unpublished, their initial tests show signs of promise.""It really is exciting,"" says Ronald Harty, a co-corresponding author of the research and a professor at Penn Vet. ""These viruses are quite different but may be interacting with the same host proteins to control efficient egress and spread, so our inhibitors may be able to block them both.""While many antivirals target the virus itself, the drug candidates that Harty and colleagues have been developing for years are known as ""host-oriented."" They prevent virus-host interactions by blocking the proteins in host cells that viruses hijack during late stages of infection.Not only does this approach help avoid the likelihood that a virus would evolve to resist such a therapy, but it also increases the chance that a drug could be used against multiple viruses, as many rely on the same host cell machinery to reproduce and spread.The Marburg and Ebola viruses use the VP40 protein to interact with a host protein called Nedd4 to complete the process of ""budding"" off a host cell. This stage of infection, which is key to viral spread, is the one the research team has targeted.In previous studies, they had tested a variety of small molecule inhibitors of this process using laboratory tests that relied on non-infectious and more-benign viral models. Those assays helped them land on a leading candidate, FC-10696, for further study.In the current work, they zeroed in on this candidate with rigorous evaluations. First, they tested the inhibitor to ensure it would be safe and retained long enough in the body to have an effect. Next, because the live Marburg virus is too dangerous to study safely in anything but a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory, they used an assay to look at what are known as virus-like particles, or VLPs, which can bud off of a host cell like the live virus but are not infectious.Using the Biosafety Level 2 laboratory at Penn, ""it's a very quick way we can test these inhibitors,"" Harty says.After seeing a dose-dependent response to FC-10696 on VLP budding in cells in a cell-culture dish, the researchers tested the compound using the real Marburg virus. These studies were done in a BSL-4 lab at Texas Biomedical Research Institute and found the compound inhibited the budding and spread of live Marburg virus in two human cell types, including in macrophages, an immune cell type commonly infected by the virus.Finally, they evaluated the compound in mice that had been exposed to Marburg virus. Those mice treated with FC-10696 took longer to display disease symptoms and had a reduced viral load.""These are the first promising in vivo data for our compounds,"" Harty says. ""Whereas the control group all became sick very quickly and died, with the treated animals there was one survivor and others showed delayed onset of clinical symptoms. It's showing that our inhibitors are having an effect.""A portion of the VP40 protein in Marburg and Ebola viruses that enables budding is known as a PPxY motif. SARS-CoV-2 also happens to have this motif on its Spike (S) protein, which it uses to infect human cells. In a follow-up experiment that is not yet published, the researchers found evidence that FC-10696 was able to inhibit budding of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in human lung epithelial cells.""The SARS-CoV-2 studies are ongoing, and they're very exciting,"" Harty says.Reference: Han Z, Ye H, Liang J, et al.

This was the conclusion of a recent study published in PLOS Computational Biology. A team of UK-based researchers found that prioritizing the distribution of the vaccine to at-risk groups, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, had the greatest impact in terms of minimizing the number of lives lost to the disease. They also noted that vaccinating older individuals could help to curb the pandemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.The UK, along with many countries worldwide, has relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (e.g., social distancing) to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, with several COVID-19 vaccines now being produced at scale and administered globally, focus is shifting towards re-establishing a  new normal . The paper s first author, Dr Sam Moore from The Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology & Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research, University of Warwick, elaborates:  While non-pharmaceutical social measures have proved effective in reducing the healthcare burden compared to an uncontrolled outbreak, this is achieved to the detriment of the economy, education and many other societal factors. The development of vaccines gives us a second option which may to a large extent be effective in replacing social measures.  They then explored various scenarios, taking into consideration NPIs as well as vaccine effectiveness and scale and targeting of vaccine deployment. They then added another  layer  of analysis, by  considering different orders of prioritization in terms of age group and health conditions . The team set out to identify a vaccine strategy that achieves the greatest reduction in impact of COVID-19 considering the number of vaccine doses delivered.Moore discusses what impact previous SARS-CoV-2 infection provides in terms of protection against the disease and whether this should be considered when rolling out vaccines:  Concentrating initial vaccination on just those that have not been previously infected would likely be an effective strategy. However, this is impractical in reality as establishing infection status is not always obvious. Due to many cases being asymptomatic and difficult to detect, according to Moore, there would likely be  many cases of misjudgment . He continues,  Symptoms of flu or other illness are frequently mistaken for COVID-19. Vaccinating someone who has been previously infected is also not a wasted dose since there is strong evidence that vaccination provides longer-lasting and stronger protection than natural immunity alone. For these reasons, this strategy is not considered. Studying the effects of three different vaccination mechanisms. The  best  vaccine scenario would involve the rollout of a vaccine candidate that sufficiently contains the pandemic without the requirement for additional interventions (e.g., social distancing) (R   2.3). The team found that from the above vaccines (Table 1) modeled in the study, the only one that could potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 resurgence was a type one vaccine, with an efficacy > 80% and it would require 70% of the entire population to have been administered the vaccine.In addition, the authors we able to identify from the simulations five key factors that can affect the success of a vaccination program:1.  Characteristics of the vaccine. 2.  Vaccine efficacy. 3.  Reproduction number once the vaccine program is completed. 4.  Proportion vaccinated. 5.  Who is vaccinated. Moore and colleagues have previously explored the balance between NPIs and vaccination. In the study, published in The Lancet Infectious Disease, they found that  vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak . It is essential that we do not relax NPI measures too quickly so as to risk another major wave of infection before the vaccination program has progressed sufficiently to mitigate disease effects. We have been successful up to now in protecting many of the most vulnerable members of society by the use of NPIs and it would be a tragedy if these efforts were thrown away now that we re so close to having an effective exit strategy,  concludes Moore.Reference: Moore S, Hill EM, Dyson L, Tildesley MJ, Keeling MJ.

This figure shows how the experiment assessed the ability of bonnethead sharks to use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate. Credit: Keller et al./ Current Biology In Keller s lab, the coils were tuned to mimic the electromagnetic field of three specific coordinates: the home estuary   Turkey Point Shoal off the coast of Florida   in which the young sharks were caught, a location 500 kilometers south in the Gulf of Mexico and one 500 kilometers north, which was a point on land, near Athens, TN.The authors hypothesized that if the sharks used magnetic fields to locate themselves in relation to their capture site, the varied settings of the Merritt coils would prompt them to face in different directions in the tank   pointing south when the field suggested the sharks were at a Northern location, and pointing north at the southern location, with no directional bias predicted at the location corresponding to their home waters.Their predictions were not entirely borne out. An initial reading showed that when the sharks were exposed to a field that resembled their capture site, they oriented themselves at random around the tank.  When the Merritt coils were modulated to produce a southern magnetic field, the sharks turned to face north, the direction of their capture site. Interestingly,  the land-based coil setting, to the magnetic north of the capture site did not make the sharks turn in any particular direction. While this was not what the team had predicted, the finding did not faze Keller and his colleagues:  The sharks we tested could never experience the magnetic fields that occur at this location, given that it occurs on land. Our finding is possibly due to the fact the sharks had no experience with such a magnetic field. Further research will be required to work out whether the bonnetheads have an innate magnetic map, like loggerhead sea turtles, or whether their geomagnetic location is learned. One proposed experiment to address this would be to conduct similar tests on sharks hailing from the Bay of Campeche, near Mexico City. These sharks would never experience magnetic fields more southernly than their birthing location. If the results found in Keller s current paper were reversed in the Campeche sharks, this would cement the idea that sharks can only rely on magnetic signals that they would naturally experience.This image shows an overhead shot of bonnetheads in the holding tank. Credit: Bryan KellerFor the moment, Keller wants to examine how man-made magnetic fields might disrupt sharks  migration   and whether sharks used magnetic signals for general, or very targeted navigation.  We would also like to study how sharks may use Earth s magnetic field for fine-scale navigation. Research from Jayne Gardiner and Andy Nosal has shown sharks use olfactory cues when in close proximity to target locations, but we would like to explore how these animals may use the magnetic field for fine-scale navigation. Ultimately, Keller s new paper adds a significant piece to the still-incomplete puzzle of shark biology. Keller is keen to emphasize that his team s achievement has built on many years of work:  We would not have been able to carry out our work without the groundwork laid by other researchers throughout the last five decades. This work was truly a collaborative effort, inclusive of those who are not co-authors. Specifically, James Anderson, Kyle Newton and Pete Klimley were all largely influential in assisting in the development of this work, through their own research efforts and direct discussions with me,  he concluded.

Israel opted to conform to the clinical trial schedule and administered the second dose of the vaccine 21 days after the initial dose. ""The start of the study period corresponded to 14 days after the first individuals received their second BNT162b2 dose,"" the authors write.During the study period, there were 232,268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7,694 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 4,481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalizations and 1,113 COVID-19 deaths in individuals aged 16 years and over. Analysis of this data suggests that two doses of the mRNA-based vaccine prove 95% effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization and death resulting from infection.In contrast, one dose of the vaccine provided 58% protection against infection, 76% against hospitalization and 77% against death. ""The results show that people need to receive the second dose for full effectiveness,"" Dr Gillies O Bryan-Tear, from the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine said.O'Bryan-Tear added, ""These results mirror the clinical trial data (although the trial did not analyse asymptomatic infection) and were seen across all age groups above 16 years and demonstrate the outstanding effectiveness of this mRNA vaccine in a real-world vaccination campaign."" The authors acknowledge that the observational nature of the research incurs several limitations: ""In the absence of randomization, there could have been unmeasured differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons (e.g., different test-seeking behaviors or levels of adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions) which might have confounded our vaccine effectiveness estimates,"" they write. Discussing these potential limitations, Dr Peter English, retired consultant in communicable disease control, stated,  The authors address these clearly in their discussion; in short, while cofounders are not completely eliminated, the quality of Israel s data collection systems and the large numbers mean that they are unlikely to have contributed significantly to the results, and the results are thus robust.""""This population study provides something for everyone: for those who have been critical of the UK stance of providing first doses to as many as possible and delaying the second dose, the results show that people need to receive the second dose for full effectiveness (duration of effect is not addressed in this study since follow up was insufficient),"" added O'Bryan-Tear.

In 2017 alone, some 18 million Americans misused prescription pain relievers over the course of the previous year. In many of these instances, patients suffering from chronic pain became addicted to prescription opioids.In addition to being highly addictive, many studies suggest that prescription opioids do not effectively control pain over the long term, and hence researchers have been exploring various alternatives, including cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is a non-psychoactive substance derived from the Cannabis plant.Studies have shown that while CBD reduces pain sensation in animals, its ability to do so in humans is limited by low bioavailability, the extent to which the drug successfully reaches its site of action. Now, new work by scientists at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University suggests this obstacle may be overcome by a novel CBD analog known as KLS-13019.""In a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), we've been able to show for the first time that KLS-13019 works as well as, if not better than, CBD in preventing the development of neuropathy and reversing pain sensitivity after pain has been established,"" said Sara Jane Ward, PhD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacology at the Katz School of Medicine and senior investigator on the new study. The findings were published online April 6 in the British Journal of Pharmacology.KLS-13019, developed by the Pennsylvania-based bio-pharmaceutical and phyto-medical company Neuropathix, Inc., is among the most promising neuroprotective CBD analogs currently under investigation. In previous work in cell models, it was found to be more potent than CBD, and studies in animals suggested it had improved bioavailability.Encouraged by those initial studies, Dr. Ward and colleagues set out to better understand the pain-relieving capabilities of KLS-13019, relative to CBD, in animals with CIPN. CIPN is a common side effect of certain cancer treatments that damage peripheral nerves, which carry sensory information to the arms, legs, and brain. The severe pain, or peripheral neuropathy, caused by CIPN manifests in different ways in human patients but frequently involves tingling or burning sensations and numbness, weakness, or discomfort in the limbs.In a series of experiments designed to gauge animals' pain responses, the researchers found that pain sensitivity was greatly reduced in animals with CIPN that were treated with KLS-13019 or CBD. KLS-13019 further reversed sensitivity to painful stimuli in animals in which peripheral neuropathy was already established, an effect that was not observed in CBD-treated animals.Earlier studies have also hinted at the possibility that CBD is able to reduce opioid craving in patients with opioid use disorder.""Many patients who use opioids for pain management enter a cycle of reinforcement, where each use of opioids triggers reward pathways and perceived pain relief, leading to addiction,"" Dr. Ward explained.While Dr. Ward and colleagues did not find evidence supporting a role for CBD in reducing opioid craving, they did observe significantly reduced opioid-seeking behavior in KLS-13019-treated animals.""This tells us that KLS-13019 has benefits beyond its ability to alleviate pain,"" Dr. Ward said.The researchers suspect that while likely sharing a mechanism with CBD for pain relief, KLS-13019 may have an additional mechanism of action, one that breaks up the pathways reinforcing opioid use.In future work, Dr. Ward and her team plan to explore the mechanisms by which KLS-13019 exerts its effects, particularly those underlying the drug's ability to disrupt opioid-seeking behavior. They also plan to test the ability of KLS-13019 to alleviate other types of pain, beyond CIPN.Reference: Foss JD, Farkas DJ, Huynh LM, Kinney WA, Brenneman DE, Ward SJ.

They demonstrated that the mutation was damaging to the gene, and that female, but not male, mice lacking a working copy of the gene also showed ASD-associated symptoms. Better understanding the interplay between genetics and sex in ASD could set the stage for developing sex-specific treatments for autism.The MUSC team was led by Christopher Cowan, Ph.D., the William E. Murray SmartState Endowed Chair in Neuroscience and chair of the Department of Neuroscience, and Ahlem Assali, Ph.D., research assistant professor in the same department. Their findings are published in Nature Neuropsychopharmacology.One in 54 children is diagnosed with an ASD. Of the children with ASD, four boys are diagnosed for every girl. Individuals with ASD typically have deficits in communication and social interaction and exhibit restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, activities, or interests. Many people with ASD also present with associated symptoms, such as hyperactivity, attention deficits, epilepsy and intellectual abilities that can range from severely disabled to gifted.Cowan and Assali investigated the effect of a mutation in the gene, EPHB2, detected in a female patient with autism. EPHB2 is important for forming connections, or synapses, in the brain. The patient had a version of EPHB2 that caused the protein to be cut short. ""It's as if a sentence had a period in the middle instead of the end,"" said Cowan. The shortened protein can no longer serve its function, leaving this ASD individual with less functional protein than neurotypical people.To confirm that this gene can cause autism, Cowan and Assali created mice that had only one of two working copies of EPHB2. They found that these animals showed repetitive behaviors, hyperactivity and learning and memory problems as well as changes in brain cell function.Cowan and Assali went a step further and divided the animals based on sex. They did this because the child with ASD and the EPHB2 mutation was a female. They found that the female mice showed much stronger behavior symptoms and brain cell dysfunction than the male mice. Understanding the interplay between genetics and biological sex could be important for understanding autism risk and eventually for developing therapeutics.""We know that 80% to 90% of autism risk is genetic, but this is a very clear-cut case where the gene and the sex of the animal are interacting to alter neurotypical development,"" said Cowan.Historically, ASD has been diagnosed mostly in boys, so research on ASD has often been biased toward male subjects. The work of Cowan and Assali highlights the importance of sex-specific differences in ASD and the need to examine those differences in research studies that include both sexes. This could set the stage for developing sex-specific treatments for ASD.""That's the only way we're going to start to change research inequalities that have happened in the past,"" said Assali.In future studies, Cowan and Assali hope to explore more deeply the mechanisms of EPHB2 actions in the developing brain. They want to understand why this gene causes symptoms predominantly in female subjects and how hormones might affect autism risk. Their aim is to improve the understanding of the interplay between genetics and biological sex in autism, with a view to informing future personalized, sex-specific treatments for ASD.Reference: Assali A, Cho JY, Tsvetkov E, Gupta AR, Cowan CW.

They split into different species about 1.7 million years ago. Some of the distinctions between chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (Pan paniscus) lineages have been made clearer by a recent achievement in hominid genomics.A new bonobo genome assembly has been constructed with a multiplatform approach and without relying on reference genomes. According to the researchers on this project, more than 98% of the genes are now completely annotated and 99% of the gaps are closed.The high quality of this assembly is allowing scientists to more accurately compare the bonobo genome to that of other great apes   the gorilla, orangutan, chimpanzee   as well as to the modern human. All these species, as well as extinct, ancient, human-like beings, are referred to as hominids.Because chimpanzee and bonobo are also the closest living species to modern humans, comparing higher-quality genomes could help uncover genetic changes that set the human species apart.In a May 5 Nature paper, researchers explain how they developed and analyzed the new bonobo assembly, and what juxtaposing it to other great ape genomes is revealing.The multi-institutional project was led by Yafei Mao, of the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, and Claudia R. Catacchio, of the Department of Biology at the University of Bari, Italy. The senior scientists were Evan Eichler, professor of genome sciences at the UW School of Medicine, and Mario Ventura of the University of Bari. Eichler is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.In comparing the bonobo genome to that of other great apes, the researchers found more than 5,571 structural variants that distinguished the bonobo and chimpanzee lineages.The researchers explained in the paper,  We focused on genes that have been lost, changed in structure, or expanded in the last few million years of bonobo evolution. The great ape genome comparisons are also enabling researchers to gain new insights on what happened to the various ape genomes during and after the divergence or splitting apart into different species from a common ancestor.They were particularly interested in what is called incomplete lineage sorting. This is the less-than-perfect passing along of alleles into the separating populations as species diverge, as well as the loss of alleles or their genetic drift. Analyses of incomplete lineage sorting can help clarify gene evolution and the genetic relationships among present-day hominids.The higher-quality bonobo genome assembly enabled the researchers to generate a higher resolution map comparing incomplete lineage sorting in hominids. They identified regions that are inconsistent with the species tree. In addition, they estimate that 2.52% of the human genome is more closely related to the bonobo genome than the chimpanzee genome, and 2.55% of the human genome is more closely related to the chimpanzee genome than the bonobo genome. The total proportion based on incomplete lineage sorting analysis (5.07%) is almost double earlier estimates (3.1%). We predict a greater fraction of the human genome is genetically closer to chimpanzees and bonobos compared to previous studies,  the researchers note.The researchers took their incomplete lineage sorting analysis back 15 million years to include genome data from orangutan and gorilla. This increased the incomplete lineage sorting estimates for the hominid genomes to more than 36.5%, which is only slightly more than earlier predictions.Surprisingly, more than a quarter of these regions are distributed non-randomly, have elevated rates of amino acid replacement, and are enriched for particular genes with related functions such as immunity. This suggests that incomplete lineage sorting might work to increase diversity for specific regions.The new bonobo genome assembly is named for the female whose DNA was sequenced, Mhudiblu, a current resident of the Wuppertal Zoo in Germany.

Their latest research has demonstrated that noninvasive neuromodulation via low-intensity ultrasound can have cell-type selectivity in manipulating neurons.Parkinson's Disease, epilepsy and insomnia are just a few of the neurological disorders that use neuromodulation treatment techniques today. Neuromodulation delivers controlled physical energy to the nervous system to treat and improve patients' quality of life. Current neuromodulation approaches, while effective, bring both drawbacks and limitations.""Deep brain stimulation, which is highly successful, but an invasive form of electric stimulation through implanted electrodes, is one example of how neuromodulation is being used in a clinical setting today,"" explained Bin He, professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. ""Medical professionals have also used noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial current stimulation, both of which lack the ability to specifically focus on the neuro-circuit level. My group is interested in helping to develop a more effective and completely noninvasive alternative.""Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound, or tFUS, is an emerging and fully reversable neuromodulation technology. It is noninvasive, precise, and it does not require surgery. During tFUS neuromodulation, pulsed mechanical energy is transmitted through the skull, with high spatial resolution and selectivity, at highly-targeted brain regions, which can be steered to elicit activation or inhibition through parameter tuning.In work recently published in Nature Communications, He's group demonstrated, for the first time, that specific cell types can be targeted through tFUS neuromodulation. Their study found that excitatory neurons showed high sensitivity to ultrasound pulse repetition frequency, while inhibitory neurons did not.This finding is significant, because it demonstrates the first capability for a noninvasive neuromodulation technique to modulate a selected cell subpopulation, using a technique that can be directly translated for human use. With the demonstrated capability of tFUS to activate excitatory or inhibitory neurons, future applications may lead to precise targeting of brain circuits using focused ultrasound energy, and activate or inhibit selected sub-populations of neurons by tuning ultrasound parameters.""As a result of our research, we obtained direct evidence that different neuron populations unequally respond to ultrasound stimulation in the brain,"" said Kai Yu, co-first author of the paper and a research scientist in He's lab at Carnegie Mellon University. ""We identified a critical stimulation parameter that is able to tune the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activities, and we conducted thorough control experiments to support these valuable neuroscience findings.""The application of this research has broad implications; it's not just limited to one disease. For many people suffering from pain, depression and addition, He believes non-invasive tFUS neuromodulation could be used to facilitate treatment.""If we can localize and target areas of the brain using acoustic, ultrasound energy, I believe we can potentially treat a myriad of neurological and psychiatric diseases and conditions,"" said He. ""This type of treatment option has great potential to shift what doctors study in medical school and go on to practice. Of course, a noninvasive, precise, reversive treatment option also presents endless benefits for patients. My dream would be to make everything noninvasive.""He's next goal is to further develop the tFUS neuromodulation technology with increased spatial resolution and focality, and directly test the applicability of tFUS to treat brain conditions in humans.Reference: Yu K, Niu X, Krook-Magnuson E, He B.

That is according to a large observational study by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, published in the journal Neurology. The findings stress the significance of screening and monitoring for dementia in persons with kidney disease, the researchers say.""Our study underscores the importance of low kidney function as a possible under-recognized risk factor for dementia,"" says co-author Juan Jesus Carrero, professor at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Karolinska Institutet. ""It also shows that the dementia risk likely attributed to kidney disease is similar or larger than that observed for other well-established risk factors for dementia, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.""Dementia is the progressive decline of cognition and functioning beyond that of the normal aging process. It occurs mostly in old age, with a global prevalence estimate of 5-7 percent in those over 60 years old. Dementia is associated with bad health in general and increased risk of death, yet there are limited treatment strategies. Currently, identifying potentially modifiable risk factors is one of few viable strategies to prevent dementia.Chronic kidney disease, a persistent reduction in kidney function, is also very common among older adults, with a global population prevalence of 25-40 percent depending on age. Even a mild reduction in kidney function is associated with an increased risk of other diseases. Previous smaller studies have examined the link between kidney disease and dementia but found conflicting results.In this Swedish study of more than 325,000 individuals 65 years of age or older, the researchers found a clear link between poor kidney function and the probability of receiving a dementia diagnosis during the follow-up. In total, nearly 19,000 cases of dementia (5.8 percent) were detected over a median follow up of five years. The lower the function of the kidneys, the higher were the incidence rates of dementia. A more rapid decline in kidney function within one year was also linked to a subsequent higher risk of dementia.""This is, to our knowledge, the largest study to date on kidney function and dementia, exceeding by several fold the sample size of all previous studies combined and evaluating the whole spectrum of kidney function,"" Juan Jesus Carrero says.The researchers used data from the Stockholm CREAtinine Measurements (SCREAM) project, a healthcare-utilization cohort that includes all Stockholm residents who underwent creatinine testing during 2006-2011. Creatinine is a waste product from muscles that is removed from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine. It is used combined with other factors such as age and sex to calculate the so-called estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which is commonly used to determine kidney function. An eGFR of 90ml/min or higher is considered normal in most healthy people. This data was combined with other registries on healthcare utilization, including those on dementia diagnoses and treatments.After adjusting for potential confounders, the researchers concluded that an eGFR score of 30-59 ml/min was associated with a 71 percent increased risk of dementia while an eGFR score of less than 30ml/min was associated with more than twice the risk of dementia, compared with a normal eGFR score.""Even though we cannot determine causality based on these findings, our analysis suggests that as many as 10 percent of dementia cases could potentially be attributed to chronic kidney disease,"" says corresponding author Hong Xu, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society at Karolinska Institutet.

It heats our homes, and even seafloor microbes make a living of it. The microbes use a process called anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), which happens commonly in the seafloor in so-called sulfate-methane transition zones - layers in the seafloor where sulfate from the seawater meets methane from the deeper sediment. Here, specialized microorganisms, the ANaerobically MEthane-oxidizing (ANME) archaea, consume the methane. They live in close association with bacteria, which use electrons released during methane oxidation for sulfate reduction. For this purpose, these organisms form characteristic consortia.This process takes place globally in the seafloor and hence is an important part of the carbon cycle. However, studying the AOM process is challenging because the reaction is very slow. For its investigation, researchers often use a chemical knack: the stable isotope ratios in methane. But unfortunately, these isotopes do not always behave as expected, which led to serious confusion on the role and function of the microbes involved. Now researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology and the MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences in Germany together with colleagues from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have solved this isotope enigma and published their results in the journal Science Advances. This paves the way for a better understanding of the important process of anaerobic methane oxidation.The puzzle and its solution in detail: Isotopes are different ""versions"" of an element with different masses. The isotopes of an element have the same number of protons (positively charged particles) in the nucleus and therefore the same position in the periodic table (iso topos = Greek, same place). However, they differ in the number of neutrons (neutral particles) in the nucleus. For example, carbon has two stable isotopes, the lighter 12C and the heavier 13C. Additionally, there is the familiar radioactive isotope 14C, a very rare carbon species that is used to determine the age of carbon-bearing materials. Although the chemical properties of the two stable isotopes are identical, the difference in mass results in different reaction rates. When chemical compounds react, the ones with the lighter isotopes are usually converted faster, leaving the heavier variant in the initial reactant. This change in isotopic composition is known as isotopic fractionation, and has been used for decades to track chemical reactions. In the case of methane oxidation, this means that 12C-methane is primarily consumed, leading to an enrichment of 13C in the remaining methane. Conversely, a microbial production of methane (methanogenesis) would result in particularly light methane. ""Reality, however, is surprisingly different"", Gunter Wegener reports. ""Contrary to the logic described above, we often find very light methane in sulfate-methane transition zones.""This paradox raises questions, such as: Is methane not consumed there, but rather produced? And who, if not the numerous ANME archaea, should be responsible for this? ""In my lab, we have the world's largest collection of ANME cultures. There we could try to find out if and how the methane oxidizers themselves could be responsible for the formation of light methane,"" Wegener continues. ""The first results were deflating: At the high sulfate concentrations we normally find in seawater, the cultured microorganisms behaved according to the textbook. The remaining methane was enriched in the heavier isotopes."" However, if the same experiments were carried out with little sulfate, methane got enriched in 12C, it became lighter. And this happened even though methane continued to be consumed at the same time - an effect that at first glance had little logic.So how could they explain the unusual behavior of the methane isotopes? Jonathan Gropp and his mentor Itay Halevy from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have spent years studying the isotope effects of microbial metabolisms, including methanogenesis - a reaction that is catalyzed by the same enzymes as the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Thus, they were the ideal partners for the team located in Bremen. ""Both processes are based on a very similar cascade of seven reactions,"" says Gropp. ""Previous studies have shown that all of these reactions are potentially reversible, meaning that they can take place in both directions. Each reaction also has its own isotope effects."" With the help of a model, Gropp was able to show that, depending on how much sulfate is available, the partial reactions can be reversed to varying degrees. This could then lead to the situation that heavy isotopes are not as usual left behind but are stuck in the reaction chain, while light isotopes are channeled back to methane. ""The microbes want to perform the reaction but are limited to do so because of the low sulfate concentrations,"" explains Gropp, adding that ""Our designed model fits the isotope experiments very nicely."" The long hours in the laboratory and in front of the computer paid off for the researchers. With their study, Wegener, Gropp and their colleagues could show how AOM results in 13C-depleted methane. The experiments with little sulfate in particular nicely reflect the conditions in the natural habitat of the microorganisms, the sulfate-methane transition zones in the seafloor. There, the microorganisms often thrive on only little sulfate, as in the low-sulfate experiments. ""Now we know that methane oxidizers can be responsible for the build-up of light isotopes in methane at sulfate-methane transition zones. Methanogenesis is not required for that. As we suspected, the ANME are methane oxidizers,"" concludes Marcus Elvert, last author of the current study. Now the researchers are ready for the next step and want to find if other reactions show similar isotope effects.ReferenceWegener G et al.

Overall, sea ice has been on the rise for about 10,000 years, but with some exceptions to this trend.Dominic Winski, a research assistant professor at the UMaine Climate Change Institute, spearheaded a project that uncovered new information about millennia of sea ice variability, particularly across seasons, in the Southern Hemisphere by examining the chemistry of a 54,000-year-old South Pole ice core.The Southern Ocean experiences the largest seasonal difference in sea ice cover in the world, with Antarctica surrounded by 18.5 million-square-kilometers of sea ice in the winter and only 3.1 million-square-kilometers of it in the summer. According to researchers, this seasonal disparity in sea ice has a significant influence on regional and global climate, yet scientists for years knew relatively little about the extent of sea ice variation in the Southern Hemisphere before 1979.When a team of scientists recently retrieved the deepest and oldest ice core from the South Pole and analyzed it, Winski saw an opportunity to learn more about seasonal and overall changes in sea ice in the Southern Hemisphere throughout the Holocene -- the last 11,400 years. The CCI research assistant professor and his colleagues decided to examine the chemistry of the ice core, particularly its sea salt concentrations, to learn more about sea ice variability in the region.Karl Kreutz, a UMaine professor of Earth and climate sciences, and researchers from Dartmouth College, South Dakota State University, the University of Washington and the University of Colorado Boulder participated in the project. Geophysical Research Letters published the paper detailing their findings.The team capitalized on the massive seasonal variations in Southern Ocean climate in order to create a sea ice record showing distinct summer and winter variability. They combined this information with a state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry model to link the ice core measurements with sea ice variability. The result is a detailed record of Southern Ocean sea ice revealing major fluctuations, especially in wintertime sea ice.Salt levels in the core, which are sensitive to sea ice changes, increased in the past 11,400 years, particularly in the past 8,000-10,000 years, correlating with a growth in ice cover. Winter sea salt concentrations, which originated primarily from salty snow atop sea ice, specifically increased over millennia, demonstrating an overall boost in wintertime sea ice. This pattern is seen elsewhere in Antarctica, which led the research team to hypothesize an Antarctic-wide increase in sea ice during this period.""One of the most important and challenging goals in our field is to produce detailed reconstructions of sea ice variability. "" Winski says. ""The exceptional detail of the South Pole Ice Core combined with results from our modeling team gives us a powerful dataset for understanding Antarctic sea ice.""Winski and Kreutz helped retrieve the 54,000-year-old ice core they used for their recent study during two expeditions between 2014 and 2016.The project, called SPICEcore (South Pole Ice Core), involved scientists from 18 institutions all aiming to create an archive of climate conditions in East Antarctica during the past 54,000 years, including changes in atmospheric chemistry, climate and biogeochemistry.""The South Pole Ice Core (SPICEcore) is the most precisely dated climate record in this region of Antarctica. We put in a tremendous amount of effort to collect individual chemistry samples for every centimeter of ice,"" Winski says. ""In total, we had to analyze the chemistry of over 100,000 vials of melted ice, but the effort paid off since now we have the rare opportunity to investigate seasonal changes in the Antarctic environment for over 10,000 years.""While the Southern Hemisphere experienced an overall increase in ice cover throughout the Holocene, researchers identified an abrupt drop in sea salt concentrations in the ice core that date back to between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago. According to the team, the drop in salt levels indicates a decrease in ice cover specific to the South Atlantic at that time, a finding corroborated by earlier research.Ice cover in the North Atlantic, conversely, was more extensive during that period, which researchers claim indicates ""a linked and opposing sea ice signal in the North and South Atlantic most likely due to changing ocean circulation."" This pattern of opposing North and South Atlantic climate is well-known during abrupt climate change events of colder times deep in the past. The findings of this study may be a hint that the same processes could still be relevant under modern conditions.Accounting for seasonal variation when studying changes in sea ice across tens of thousands of years helps scientists not only to thoroughly describe past Antarctic climate, but also to understand the mechanisms and processes driving climate change.""Huge changes in sea ice can occur very rapidly,"" Winski says, ""leading to ramifications for climate worldwide. We still don't entirely understand the forces influencing sea ice variability, which is why detailed climate information from the past is absolutely critical.""Reference: Winski DA, Osterberg EC, Kreutz KJ, et al.

On a molecular level, this recognition process is still not sufficiently understood.Intriguing observations have now been made by an interdisciplinary Viennese team of immunologists, biochemists and biophysicists. In a joint project funded by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund and the FWF, they investigated which mechanical processes take place when an antigen is recognized: As T cells move their TCRs pull on the antigen with a tiny force - about five pico-newtons (5 x 10-12 or 0.0000000005 newtons). This is not only sufficient to break the bonds between the TCRs and the antigen, it also helps T cells to find out whether they are interacting indeed with the antigen they are looking for. These results have now been published in the scientific journal ""Nature Communications"".""Each T cell recognizes one specific antigen particularly well,"" explains Johannes Huppa, biochemist and immunology professor at MedUni Vienna. ""To do so, it features around 100,000 TCRs of the same kind on its surface."" When viruses attack our body, infected cells present various fragments of viral proteins on their surface. T cells examine such cells for the presence of such antigens. ""This works according to the lock-and-key principle,"" explains Johannes Huppa. ""For each antigen, the body must produce T cells with matching TCRs. Put simply, each T-cell recognizes only one specific antigen to then subsequently trigger an immune response."" That particular antigen, or more precisely, any antigenic protein fragment presented that exactly matches the T cell's TCR, can form a somewhat stable bond. The question that needs to be answered by the T cell is: how stable is the binding between antigen and receptor?""Let's say we wish to find out whether a surface is sticky - we then test how stable the bond is between the surface and our finger,"" says Gerhard Sch tz, Professor of Biophysics at TU Wien. ""We touch the surface and pull the finger away until it comes off. That's a good strategy because this pull-away behavior quickly and easily provides us information about the attractive force between the finger and the surface."" In principle, T-cells do exactly the same. T cells are not static, they deform continuously and their cell membrane is in constant motion. When a TCR binds to an antigen, the cell exerts a steadily increasing pulling force until the binding eventually breaks. This can provide information about whether it is the antigen that the cell is looking for.""This process can actually be measured, even at the level of individual molecules,"" says Dr. Janett G hring, who was active as coordinator and first author of the study at both MedUni Vienna and TU Vienna. ""A special protein was used for this, which behaves almost like a perfect nano-spring, explain the two other first authors Florian Kellner and Dr. Lukas Schrangl from MedUni Vienna and TU Vienna respectively: ""The more traction is exerted on the protein, the longer it becomes. With special fluorescent marker molecules, you can measure how much the length of the protein has changed, and that provides information about the forces that occur"". In this way, the group was able to show that T cells typically exert a force of up to 5 pico-newtons - a tiny force that can nevertheless separate the receptor from the antigen. By comparison, one would have to pull on more than 100 million such springs simultaneously to feel stickiness with a finger. ""Understanding the behavior of T cells at the molecular level would be a huge leap forward for medicine. We are still leagues away from that goal,"" says Johannes Huppa. ""But"", adds Gerhard Sch tz, ""we were able to show that not only chemical but also mechanical effects play a role. They have to be considered together.""ReferenceG hring J, Kellner F, Schrangl L, et al. Temporal analysis of T-cell receptor-imposed forces via quantitative single molecule FRET measurements.

Yet, they can be cracked if their encryption is predictable. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have printed complexly encoded data with normal ink and a carbon nanoparticle-based invisible ink, requiring both UV light and a computer that has been taught the code to reveal the correct messages.Even as electronic records advance, paper is still a common way to preserve data. Invisible ink can hide classified economic, commercial or military information from prying eyes, but many popular inks contain toxic compounds or can be seen with predictable methods, such as light, heat or chemicals. Carbon nanoparticles, which have low toxicity, can be essentially invisible under ambient lighting but can create vibrant images when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light   a modern take on invisible ink. In addition, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models   made by networks of processing algorithms that learn how to handle complex information   can ensure that messages are only decipherable on properly trained computers. So, Weiwei Zhao, Kang Li, Jie Xu and colleagues wanted to train an AI model to identify and decrypt symbols printed in a fluorescent carbon nanoparticle ink, revealing hidden messages when exposed to UV light. The researchers made carbon nanoparticles from citric acid and cysteine, which they diluted with water to create an invisible ink that appeared blue when exposed to UV light. The team loaded the solution into an ink cartridge and printed a series of simple symbols onto paper with an inkjet printer. Then, they taught an AI model, composed of multiple algorithms, to recognize symbols illuminated by UV light and decode them using a special codebook. Finally, they tested the AI model s ability to decode messages printed using a combination of both regular red ink and the UV fluorescent ink. With 100% accuracy, the AI model read the regular ink symbols as  STOP , but when a UV light was shown on the writing, the invisible ink illustrated the desired message  BEGIN . Because these algorithms can notice minute modifications in symbols, this approach has the potential to encrypt messages securely using hundreds of different unpredictable symbols, the researchers say.ReferenceYuan Y et al.

Their study, conducted in mice, also demonstrates that inhibiting this molecule derails cancer progression and helps eliminate these stem cells.Published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, the findings could help pave the way for more effective targeted treatments for this highly invasive type of cancer, which is characterized by frequent resistance to therapies, rapid metastasis and a high mortality rate.Cancer stem cells, also known as tumor-initiating cells, are considered to be the original source of cancerous tissues -- the cells that give rise to all other cancer cells. Their ability to survive and proliferate in the early stages of cancer development, as well as during tumor growth and metastasis, suggests they have an intrinsic ability to evade detection by the body's immune surveillance system. The researchers set out to better understand how and why this happens.When the immune system is functioning properly, the body's natural infection-fighting T cells help to identify and ward off carcinogenic cells, foreign viruses and other invaders. However, it is known that some cancer cells elude this immune response by means of protein molecules on their surface known as ""checkpoints,"" which bind to similar molecules on the T cells, essentially nullifying the immune cells' cancer-killing capabilities.To help rectify this, immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can be administered; these drugs turn off the cancer cells' checkpoint receptors, allowing T cells to perform their normal job. In several types of cancer, including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, this approach has proven effective, decreasing the size of tumors and slowing their spread. Yet results for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas have been mixed, indicating that something else may be occurring that mutes the immune system's response.To begin the study, the researchers tested a common checkpoint inhibitor that uses anti-PD1 antibodies on a well-defined mouse model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The drug, they found, did very little to slow the spread of the cancer.At the same time, they discovered that cancer stem cells in head and neck tumors had a notably elevated expression of the gene CD276, which encodes a protein molecule on the cell surface. They also found that CD276 expression was highest along the outer layers of tumors, suggesting that the CD276 molecule functions as a checkpoint that shields both the stem cells and cells in the interior of the tumor from the body's T cell response to the cancer.Similar to the use of checkpoint inhibitors, the researchers next administered anti-CD276 antibodies to a mouse model of the disease to see if this treatment could turn off the checkpoint and inhibit the growth and spread of the cancer. After a month, they witnessed a significant decrease in the number of cancerous lesions and cancer stem cells.""Not only did we see a reduction in cancer stem cells and tumors in our model when we introduced the CD276 antibodies, but we also noticed that the total number of tumors that metastasized to the lymph nodes was significantly reduced,"" said Dr. Cun-Yu Wang, the study's corresponding author and a professor of oral biology and medicine. ""We were able to show that by blocking the gene CD276, we could effectively stop the growth of tumors derived from cancer stem cells.""Dr. Paul Krebsbach, dean of the UCLA School of Dentistry and a study co-author said, ""These findings suggest that by focusing our attention on the CD276 gene and the immune response process, there is the potential for promising preventive therapeutic approaches against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.""Reference: Wang C, Li Y, Jia L, et al.

Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have returned their gaze to the natural world to develop a camera inspired by the mantis shrimp that can visualize cancer cells during surgery.A new study led by electrical and computer engineering professor Viktor Gruev details how the new camera works with tumor-targeted drugs to see cancer in animal and human patients. The study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.""Engineers spend incredible amounts of time and money developing the image sensors in cellphones,"" said Gruev, who also is affiliated with Carle Illinois College of Medicine. ""When we are out on the town, these devices can capture pictures that are perfect for social media, but when doctors are examining patients, they don't care how nice the shot looks - they care how well the picture captures reality. The driving force in the camera market is simply incompatible with the technology required for medical diagnostics.""Looking for a better way forward, the researchers turned to the compound eye of the mantis shrimp.""The mantis shrimp has these incredible eyes,"" said Steven Blair, an electrical and computer engineering graduate student and the lead author of the study. ""Humans perceive three colors - red, green, and blue - because of a single layer of light-sensitive cone cells that line our retina, but the mantis shrimp perceives upward of 12 colors thanks to the stacks of light-sensitive cells at the tip of its eye. The mantis shrimp can thus see things that humans can't imagine - and it does so in a fraction of the space.""In the hopes of replicating this visual system in a single imaging device, the team integrated advanced semiconductor devices and specialized optical filters. Their technology can capture the three colors of visible light that a doctor would normally see as well as three colors of invisible near-infrared light that the doctor would miss. It can then be paired with multiple tumor-targeted probes that accumulate in cancerous tissue and emit near-infrared light, permitting the doctor to see exactly where the tumors are located in a patient. These probes are just now entering medical markets.""The combination of this bioinspired camera and emerging tumor-targeted drugs will ensure that surgeons leave no cancer cells behind in the patient's body,"" said Goran Kondov, a professor and chief surgeon from North Macedonia who demonstrated this technology in the operating room. ""This additional set of eyes will help prevent recurrence of the disease, providing patients a quicker and easier path to recovery. And the device can potentially be manufactured at low cost since it is so simple, making it accessible to hospitals around the world.""The next step for the team is the integration of their camera with endoscopic systems to satisfy the demands of minimally invasive surgeries in resource-limited hospitals.Reference: Blair S, Garcia M, Davis T, et al.

Does fatigue and compulsive social media scrolling strike a familiar chord?Those brittle feelings offer us a glimpse into what regular life can be like for individuals with sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), a biological trait possessed by roughly a third of the population. In a world of constant information overload and stress, it's a characteristic that can result in a variety of behaviors, from emotional outbursts to withdrawal, overwhelm and procrastination.""Behaviorally, we observe it as being more careful and cautious when approaching new things,"" said Bianca Acevedo, a researcher in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences. ""You might see this behavior anywhere, from fruit flies to humans."" In a new situation, those with the trait are more likely to hang back and see what happens, she explained.""Another broad way of thinking about it, that biologists have been using to understand people's individual differences in responses to different things, is that the person with high sensitivity will be more responsive, both for better and for worse,"" Acevedo continued. So while people with high sensitivity might get more rattled by uncomfortable situations, they might also experience higher levels of creativity, deeper bonds with others and a heightened appreciation of beauty.The mechanism behind these depths and heights, and extra caution, lies in the way the brains of highly sensitive people process information: They do so more deeply, Acevedo said. And in a paper published in the journal Neuropsychobiology, she and her colleagues continue to home in on where in the brain this deeper processing is occurring.""One of the novel advancements of this research was that in most of the previous brain imaging studies of sensitivity, we've tended to look at responses to stimuli,"" Acevedo said. ""This was a study where we just examined what the brain at rest does and how being sensitive affects it.""Taking their volunteer subjects to a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner housed in the basement of UCSB's Psychology Building, the researchers conducted an ""empathy task"" in which the participants were shown descriptions of happy, sad or neutral events, followed by corresponding emotional faces of their partners and of strangers. The volunteers were asked to count backward by seven from a large number ""to wash away the effects of experiencing any kind of emotion,"" between the facial photo displays.""Then they were asked to provide some responses to tell us how they felt when they were shown each face image,"" Acevedo said. After that, the participants were instructed to relax, while their brains were scanned.""What we found was a pattern that suggested that during this rest, after doing something that was emotionally evocative, their brain showed activity that suggested depth of processing,"" she said, ""and this depth of processing is a cardinal feature of high sensitivity.""Among the most robust signals in the participants who scored with higher levels of SPS was a greater connectivity between the precuneus and the hippocampus, a circuit that is implicated in episodic memory consolidation and spontaneous memory retrieval. The consolidation of memory is important, Acevedo said, in order to prepare an individual for future similar situations and how to respond to them.Meanwhile, weaker connections were found between the periaqueductal gray and the amygdala, a region important for the modulation of pain and anxiety, as well as between the insula and the hippocampus, a circuit that is thought to be important for emotion processing and stress regulation. These negative connections could be the reason sensitive people report overstimulation and higher anxiety, Acevedo said. The ""robust negative connectivity"" of the hippocampus and insula in particular suggests ""higher order, deliberative consolidation of memory,"" rather than the habitual, automated responses typically triggered by stressful events.The results of this paper represent a significant advance in the growing understanding of sensory processing sensitivity, a trait that is present among an estimated 1.4 billion of the global population. The results may also have some clinical relevance for those with mood disorders, such as anxiety, said Acevedo, whose book, ""The Highly Sensitive Brain,"" is a finalist for the 2021 Association of American Publishers Professional and Scholarly Excellence (PROSE) Award in Neuroscience. One way to help with that tension and trouble focusing, whether or not you consider yourself highly sensitive?""Take a break,"" Acevedo said. ""For all of us, but especially for the highly sensitive, taking a few minutes' break and not necessarily doing anything but relaxing can be beneficial.

But a more complicated network of genes than previously known appears related to circadian rhythms. More fully understanding this network is key to understanding how the rhythms work and could potentially be changed.The authors detail a statistical model they are using to help identify all the genes involved in this network. With the help of scientists from other disciplines, they hope to fully understand how these genes work together to make one person more productive in the early morning while another thrives in the middle of the night.Doing so could lead to the creation of medicines that would help someone who is naturally a day person but required to work nights, or one who struggles to be productive first thing in the morning.""If we understand the gene for a night owl, we can develop a drug to activate that gene for an early bird who has to live a lifestyle like a night owl,"" said author Rongling Wu, director of the Center for Statistical Genetics at Penn State.There are also possible health benefits. Disrupted circadian rhythms have been linked to health issues including depression, anxiety, weight gain, and cardiovascular disease.And while most people probably think of circadian rhythms in humans, plants and animals have them, too. A breakthrough in understanding the clock-gene network could help increase crop production.For example, wheat, which tends to ""rest"" during the middle of the day, could be modified to grow all day long and be harvested more quickly. Or a crop that does not grow well in northern areas with less daylight and colder temperatures could have genes altered to make it ignore those conditions.""We can increase our production,"" Wu said. ""If we can activate the correct gene, we can use all of that time. But we need to bring together different researchers from other fields to better understand such a complex problem.""Reference: Sun L, Dong A, Griffin C, Wu R.

But we also urgently need more research and regulation on mask production, so we can reduce any risks to the environment and human health"".Outlined in a recent paper, the tests carried out by the research team used a variety of masks - from standard plain face masks to novelty and festive masks for children with many currently being sold in UK retail outlets.The rise in single-use masks, and the associated waste, due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been documented as a new cause of pollution. The study aimed to explore this direct link - with investigations to identify the level of toxic substances present.The findings reveal significant levels of pollutants in all the masks tested - with micro/nano particles and heavy metals released into the water during all tests. Researchers conclude this will have a substantial environmental impact and, in addition, raise the question of the potential damage to public health - warning that repeated exposure could be hazardous as the substances found have known links to cell death, genotoxicity and cancer formation.To combat this, the team advise further research and subsequent regulations be put in place in the manufacturing and testing process.Project lead Dr Sarper Sarp explained:'The production of disposable plastic face masks (DPFs) in China alone has reached approximately 200 million a day, in a global effort to tackle the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, improper and unregulated disposal of these DPFs is a plastic pollution problem we are already facing and will only continue to intensify.''There is a concerning amount of evidence that suggests that DPFs waste can potentially have a substantial environmental impact by releasing pollutants simply by exposing them to water. Many of the toxic pollutants found in our research have bio-accumulative properties when released into the environment and our findings show that DPFs could be one of the main sources of these environmental contaminants during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.It is, therefore, imperative that stricter regulations need to be enforced during manufacturing and disposal/recycling of DPFs to minimise the environmental impact.''There is also a need to understand the impact of such particle leaching on public health. One of the main concerns with these particles is that they were easily detached from face masks and leached into the water with no agitation, which suggests that these particles are mechanically unstable and readily available to be detached.Therefore, a full investigation is necessary to determine the quantities and potential impacts of these particles leaching into the environment, and the levels being inhaled by users during normal breathing. This is a significant concern, especially for health care professionals, key workers, and children who are required to wear masks for large proportions of the working or school day.'Reference: Sullivan GL, Delgado-Gallardo J, Watson TM, Sarp S.

The enhanced measurement technologies enabled by quantum phenomena, and the possibility of scientific progress using new methods, are of particular interest to researchers around the world.Recently two researchers at Tampere University, Assistant Professor Robert Fickler and Doctoral Researcher Markus Hiekkam ki, demonstrated that two-photon interference can be controlled in a near-perfect way using the spatial shape of the photon. Their findings were recently published in the prestigious journal Physical Review Letters. Our report shows how a complex light-shaping method can be used to make two quanta of light interfere with each other in a novel and easily tuneable way , explains Markus Hiekkam ki.Single photons (units of light) can have highly complex shapes that are known to be beneficial for quantum technologies such as quantum cryptography, super-sensitive measurements, or quantum-enhanced computational tasks. To make use of these so-called structured photons, it is crucial to make them interfere with other photons. One crucial task in essentially all quantum technological applications is improving the ability to manipulate quantum states in a more complex and reliable way.  In photonic quantum technologies, this task involves changing the properties of a single photon as well as interfering multiple photons with each other;  says Robert Fickler, who leads the Experimental Quantum Optics group at the university.","Published: May 5, 2021"

But the immune system also has an innate immune response, which uses a set number of techniques to provide a swift, non-specialized response against pathogens or support the adaptive immune response.In the past few years, however, scientists have found that certain parts of the innate immune response can, in some instances, also be trained in response to infectious pathogens, such as HIV. Xu Yu, MD, a Core Member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, and colleagues recently published a study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation which showed that elite controllers, a rare subset of people whose immune system can control HIV without the use of drugs, have myeloid dendritic cells, part of the innate immune response, that display traits of a trained innate immune cell.""Using RNA-sequencing technology, we were able to identify one long-noncoding RNA called MIR4435-2HG that was present at a higher level in elite controllers' myeloid dendritic cells, which have enhanced immune and metabolic states,"" says Yu. ""Our research shows that MIR4435-2HG might be an important driver of this enhanced state, indicating a trained response.""Myeloid dendritic cells' primary job is to support T cells, which are key to the elite controllers' ability to control HIV infection. Since MIR4435-2HG was found in higher levels only in cells from elite controllers, Yu explains, it may be part of a learned immune response to infection with HIV. Myeloid dendritic cells with increased MIR4435-2HG also had higher amounts of a protein called RPTOR, which drives metabolism. This increased metabolism may allow the myeloid dendritic cells to better support the T cells controlling the HIV infection.""We used a novel sequencing technology, called CUT&RUN, to study the DNA of these cells,"" says postdoctoral fellow Ciputra Hartana, MD, PhD, the paper's first author. ""It allowed us to study epigenetic modifications like MIR4435-2HG, which are molecules that bind to the DNA and change how, or if, the DNA is read by the cell's machinery.""The team found that MIR4435-2HG might work by attaching to the DNA near the location of the RPTOR gene. The bound MIR4435-2HG would then encourage the cell's machinery to make more of the RPTOR protein, using the instructions found in the RPTOR gene. This type of epigenetic modification, a trained response to HIV infection, would allow the myeloid dendritic cells to stay in an increased metabolic state and therefore provide long-term support to the T cells fighting the virus.""Myeloid dendritic cells are very rare immune cells, accounting for only 0.1-0.3% of cells found in human blood,"" says Yu. ""We were fortunate and thankful to have access to hundreds of millions of blood cells from the many study participants who have donated their blood to support our HIV research. These donations were key to making this discovery.""Understanding exactly how elite controllers' immune systems can control HIV is a key part of HIV cure research. If scientists can understand how elite controllers suppress this deadly virus, they may be able to develop treatments that allow other people living with HIV to replicate the same immune response, removing the need for daily medication to control the virus and achieving what is known as a functional cure.Reference: Hartana CA, Rassadkina Y, Gao C, et al.

We now know that both a high sodium diet and low NEDD4-2 levels promote renal disease progression, even in the absence of high blood pressure, which normally goes hand in hand with increased sodium,  says Dr Manning.NEDD4-2 regulates the pathway required for sodium reabsorption in the kidneys to ensure correct levels of salt are maintained. If the NEDD4-2 protein is reduced or inhibited, increased salt absorption can result in kidney damage.Even people on a low salt diet can get kidney damage if they have low levels of NEDD4-2 due to genetic variations or mutations in the gene.Prof Kumar says the long-term goal is to develop a drug that can increase NEDD4-2 levels in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We are now testing different strategies to make sure this protein is maintained at a normal level all the time for overall kidney health,  Prof Kumar says. In diabetic nephropathy   a common cause of kidney disease   levels of NEDD4-2 are severely reduced. This is the case even when salt is not a factor. The study also revealed a surprising finding: that the high salt diet induced kidney disease is not always due to high blood pressure. In a lot of cases, kidney disease is exacerbated by hypertension, so we wanted to investigate that link in our study. In fact, we found the complete opposite   that a high salt diet caused excessive water loss and low blood pressure. This is significant because it means that kidney disease can also happen in people who don t have high blood pressure,  Dr Manning says.A 2020 Lancet paper estimated that about 700 million people   or 10 per cent of the world s population   suffer from chronic kidney disease, which represents a 29 per cent increase in the past 30 years.The huge spike in CKD is mainly attributed to a global obesity epidemic in recent decades, leading to diabetes, one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease along with high blood pressure.World Health Organization statistics reveal a 300 per cent increase in diabetes between 1980 and 2014, making it one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and showing the gravity of the problem facing scientists trying to tackle kidney disease. Obesity and lifestyle are two main factors driving chronic kidney disease but there are other things at play as well,  says Dr Manning.  Acute kidney injuries, drugs taken for other conditions, high blood pressure and a genetic predisposition can also cause it.

Davis Center for Regenerative Biology and Aging, has identified the signaling mechanisms underlying podocyte formation, or morphogenesis. The discovery opens the door to the development of therapies to stimulate the regeneration of these cells, which are vital to ridding the body of toxins.""Podocytes play a very important role in kidney function,"" said Hermann Haller, M.D., president of the MDI Biological Laboratory and a nephrologist who leads the department of nephrology and hypertension at Hannover Medical School in Hanover, Germany. ""The discovery of the signaling underlying podocyte morphogenesis by a team led by Iain Drummond is a major stride forward in the treatment of kidney disease.""The study, entitled ""Autonomous Calcium Signaling in Human and Zebrafish Podocytes Controls Kidney Filtration Barrier Morphogenesis,"" was recently published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.In addition to Drummond, authors include Melissa Little, Ph.D., Aude Dorison, Ph.D., Irene Ghobrial and Alejandro Hidalgo-Gonzalez, Ph.D., all of The Royal Children's Hospital, Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia; Heiko Schenk, M.D., and Jan Hegermann of Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany; and Lynne Staggs of Hannover Medical School and the MDI Biological Laboratory.The discovery of the signaling mechanism underlying podocyte formation is relevant to the treatment of a range of kidney conditions that can damage the glomerular filtration barrier, including acute kidney injury, developmental defects, premature birth defects, kidney cancer, polycystic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease (CDK) caused by diabetes or hypertension.","Published: May 5, 2021"

Implants can be used to monitor brain activity or stimulate parts of the brain using electrical pulses. In epilepsy, for example, brain implants can determine where in the brain seizures are happening.Over time, implants trigger a foreign body response, creating inflammation and scar tissue around the implant that reduces their effectiveness.The problem is that traditional implants are much more rigid than brain tissue, which has a softness comparable to pudding. Stress between the implant and the tissue caused by constant movement of the brain with respect to the implant signals the body to treat the implant as a foreign object. This interaction between the implant and the brain is similar to a knife cutting into a piece of pudding. An implant as soft as brain tissue would be ideal, but such soft implants would be difficult to manufacture and implant on the microscale.A team of researchers from The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) and McGill's Department of Biomedical Engineering found a solution using silicone and sugar.By using silicone polymers, widely known for their medical applications, the scientists were able to make the softest brain implant to date with the thickness of a thin sewing thread (~0.2 mm), and the consistency of soft pudding - as soft as the brain itself. They were then able to implant it into the brain using a trick from the cookbook.They adopted classical cooking techniques of sugar melting, caramelizing and molding both for making the implant, as well as for encapsulating it into a needle made of hardened sugar.When surgically inserted into the brain of an anesthetized rat, the sugar needle carried the implant to the right location, and dissolved within seconds, leaving the delicate implant in place. Sugar is non-toxic and is naturally metabolized by the brain. Examining brain tissue three and nine weeks after implantation, the team found higher neuronal density and lower foreign body response compared to traditional implants.While more research is needed to develop electrically active, soft implants, and to prove the safety and effectiveness of the technique in humans, one day it could be used to unlock the potential of brain implants in treating neurological disease and dysfunction.""The implants we created are so soft that the body doesn't see it as a big threat, allowing them to interact with the brain with less interference,"" says Edward Zhang, the study's first author. ""I am excited about the future of brain implant technology and believe our work helps pave the path for a new generation of soft implants that could make brain implants a more viable medical treatment.""""By reducing the brains inflammatory response, our new, very soft implants are a good thing for the brain and a good thing for the long-term function of an implant,"" says Tim Kennedy, a researcher at The Neuro and the study's co-senior author. ""The miniature sugar needle devised by Zhang is a sweet solution to placing the super-soft implant into equally soft brain tissue.""""Biomedical engineering research is about making the impossible, possible,"" says David Juncker, a professor of biomedical engineering at McGill and the study's co-senior author. ""Here we set out to make an implant as soft as the brain and implant it into the brain, which was a major challenge.

Researchers also examined the associations between television viewing and suicidality as well as depression, emotional problems and conduct problems. In addition, the study explored digital device use and suicidality.The study found little evidence for increases in associations between adolescents  technology engagement and mental health. Over the eight associations studied, only three indicated some change over time: Social media use and television viewing had become less strongly associated with depression, but, on the other hand, social media s association with emotional problems had increased. The observed changes over time were, however, small. Consistent changes in technology engagement s associations with conduct problems or suicidality were not detected.The suggestion that technologies we worry the most about now (such as smartphones) are becoming more harmful was not consistently supported in the data analysed by the research team.Crucially, the study highlighted a lack of long enough time frames and high enough resolution and detail in technology engagement data as key factors in hindering scientists  ability to conclusively determine technologies  associations to mental health, or, indeed, potential changes therein. Further, available data on technology engagement, such as used by the Oxford team, relies on self-reporting on things like time spent using screens, which has been found inaccurate. To enable a robust study of life in the digital age, the authors suggested an urgent need for more credible and transparent collaborations between technology companies and independent scientists.Dr Matti Vuorre, a post-doctoral researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute and the lead author of the paper noted:  If we want to understand the relationship between tech and wellbeing today, we need to first go back and look at historic data   as far back as when parents were concerned too much TV would give their kids square eyes   in order to bring the contemporary concerns we have about newer technologies into focus. Professor Andy Przybylski, Director of Research, Oxford Internet Institute and senior author of the study, said:  As more data accumulates on adolescents  use of emerging technologies, our knowledge of them and their effects on mental health will become more precise. So it s too soon to draw firm conclusions about the increasing, or declining, associations between social media and adolescent mental health, and it is certainly way too soon to be making policy or regulation on this basis. We need more transparent and credible collaborations between scientists and technology companies to unlock the answers. The data exists within the tech industry, scientists just need to be able to access it for neutral and independent investigation. Reference: Vuorre M, Orben A, Przybylski AK.

Surprisingly, to date there is no formally accepted diagnosis for the disorder, despite being a highly prevalent, disabling and growing problem that contributes to overconsumption and debt.Professor Kyrios describes the findings as a ""game-changer"" for research in the area of excessive buying, providing a springboard for much-needed treatments and better diagnostic processes in the future.""In over 20 years, since I started investigating excessive buying, there has been an absence of commonly agreed diagnostic criteria which has hampered the perceived seriousness of the problem, as well as research efforts and consequently the development of evidence-based treatments,"" Professor Kyrios says.This will now be possible with the world's leading experts agreeing on diagnostic criteria for the disorder, he says.In the study, 138 international experts (researchers and clinicians) from 35 countries were evaluated to develop a consensus about proposed diagnostic criteria.A key feature of the new diagnostic criteria is ""excessive purchasing of items without utilising them for their intended purposes"", with excessiveness described as ""diminished control over buying/shopping"". Another characteristic of the disorder is that ""buying/shopping is used to regulate internal states, e.g., generating positive emotions or relieving negative mood"".""Clients who show excessive buying behaviour commonly have difficulties in regulating their emotions, so buying or shopping is then used to feel better. Paradoxically, if someone with Compulsive Buying-Shopping Disorder goes on a shopping trip, this will briefly improve their negative feelings, but will soon lead to strong feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment.""The Delphi research method was used to reach consensus from the panel of experts on a very complex psychological disorder.""The Delphi technique is an ideal method to integrate diverse perspectives from international and interdisciplinary experts in the field of Compulsive Buying-Shopping Disorder,"" says co-investigator Dr Dan Fassnacht, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Flinders University.""This helped us to developed diagnostic criteria featuring large agreement among experts in the field, and is an important milestone to better understand and treat this behaviour.""Dr Kathina Ali, Research Fellow at Flinders University and co-investigator of the study adds: ""Previously, it was difficult to compare studies without agreed criteria.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/efficiently-detecting-rare-mutations-in-blood-samples-348435,Efficiently Detecting Rare Mutations in Blood Samples Researchers have developed a new technology to overcome the inefficiencies and high error rates common among next generation sequencing techniques that have previously limited their clinical application  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) technologies  in which millions of DNA molecules are simultaneously but individually analyzed  theoretically provides researchers and clinicians the ability to noninvasively identify mutations in the blood stream. Identifying such mutations enables earlier diagnosis of cancer and can inform treatment decisions. Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center researchers developed a new technology to overcome the inefficiencies and high error rates common among next-generation sequencing techniques that have previously limited their clinical application.To correct for these sequencing errors, the research team from the Ludwig Center and Lustgarten Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center developed SaferSeqS (Safer Sequencing System), a major improvement to widely used technologies based on a previous technology called SafeSeqS (Safe Sequencing System) that Hopkins investigators invented a decade ago. The new SaferSeqS technology detects rare mutations in blood in a highly efficient manner and reduces the error rate of commonly used technologies for evaluating mutations in the blood more than 100-fold.Their findings were reported May 3 in Nature Biotechnology.The presence of a mutation in a clinical sample could be an early indicator that a person has developed cancer, says study lead author and M.D./Ph.D. candidate Joshua Cohen. Cancer is a genetic disease, driven by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. A small portion of cancer cells shed their DNA into the bloodstream, allowing their mutations to be detected via blood sample. Detecting such mutations in blood rather through surgical biopsy of a cancerous tissue is called  a liquid biopsy.  Such blood-based tests have the potential to detect cancer at an earlier stage, when it can be put into remission by surgery and/or chemotherapy. The challenge, Cohen explains, is that the vast majority of DNA present in the blood sample is shed by noncancer cells, and only a tiny fraction of the DNA is derived from the tumor. In patients with relatively early-stage cancers, a 10 mL blood sample will only contain a handful of molecules with a mutation. To detect cancers when they have the best chance of being cured requires a detection method that will pick up cancer signals that are present at extremely low frequencies,  says Cohen.  The technical challenge in detecting these mutations is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. The researchers addressed this challenge, with SaferSeqS, by efficiently tagging both strands of each original molecule present in an individual s blood with a unique barcode. It required new biochemical approaches to do this in an efficient manner with the small number of degraded DNA molecules that are usually present in blood. investigators use the structural redundancy of the double-stranded DNA molecule to distinguish real mutations from errors, an approach called duplex sequencing. If both strands of a DNA molecule contain the identical mutation, it is far more likely that it is a real mutation and not an error. What makes SaferSeqS unique is the efficient tagging of both strands of the majority of DNA molecules circulating in the blood, the low error rate achieved through analysis of both strands of these DNA molecules, and the manner in which the molecules of interest are enriched prior to sequencing. Altogether, these advancements underlie the power of the new technology,  says Cohen. Every molecule is sacred because it has the potential to be the one with the mutation we re looking for,  says Cohen.  Because the absolute number of molecules is low, the technology has to be highly efficient at capturing each molecule to sensitively identify mutations. To test the specificity and sensitivity of SaferSeqS in a clinically relevant setting, the researchers compared the samples to previous results from the CancerSEEK test, a single blood test that screens for eight common cancer types, developed and reported by the same research team (Science, 2018).The researchers revisited 74 blood samples from patients with cancer that had false negative results   undetectable mutations   in the 2018 CancerSEEK study using SafeSeqS. In their newest study describing SaferSeqS, the researchers reassessed these blood samples. Using SaferSeqS, they observed a marked improvement in sensitivity, finding previously undetectable mutations in 68% of the samples tested. The SaferSeqS strategy affords highly reliable technical specificity, which translates to a better way to provide clinically meaningful results for patients with relatively early-stage and small tumors,  says Cohen.Taking these results together, the researchers conclude that SaferSeqS is highly sensitive and specific for detecting extremely rare cancer-related mutations, is potentially efficient and cost effective for clinical use, and reduces the error rate of existing mutation-detection approaches more than 100-fold.The next step, they say, is to validate the results and demonstrate the clinical usefulness of the technology in prospective clinical trials.The researchers say SaferSeqS will be the underlying platform for future CancerSEEK studies.Reference: Cohen JD, Douville C, Dudley JC, et al.

Environmental protection agencies and industry bodies currently monitor the  trophic state  of water   its biological productivity   as an indicator of ecosystem health. Large clusters of microscopic algae, or phytoplankton, is called eutrophication and can turn into HABs, an indicator of pollution and which pose risk to human and animal health. HABs are estimated to cost the Scottish shellfish industry  1.4 million per year, and a single HAB event in Norway killed eight million salmon in 2019, with a direct value of over  74 million.Lead author Mortimer Werther, a PhD Researcher in Biological and Environmental Sciences in Stirling s Faculty of Natural Sciences, said:  Currently, satellite-mounted sensors, such as the Ocean and Land Instrument (OLCI), measure phytoplankton concentrations using an optical pigment called chlorophyll-a. However, retrieving chlorophyll-a across the diverse nature of global waters is methodologically challenging.  We have developed a method that bypasses the chlorophyll-a retrieval and enables us to estimate water health status directly from the signal measured at the remote sensor.  Eutrophication and hypereutrophication is often caused by excessive nutrient input, for example from agricultural practices, waste discharge, or food and energy production. In impacted waters, HABs are common, and cyanobacteria may produce cyanotoxins which affect human and animal health. In many locations, these blooms are of concern to the finfish and shellfish aquaculture industries.Mr Werther said:  To understand the impact of climate change on freshwater aquatic environments such as lakes, many of which serve as drinking water resources, it is essential that we monitor and assess key environmental indicators, such as trophic status, on a global scale with high spatial and temporal frequency.  This research, funded by the European Union s Horizon 2020 programme, is the first demonstration that trophic status of complex inland and nearshore waters can be learnt directly by machine learning algorithms from OLCI reflectance measurements. Our algorithm can produce estimates for all trophic states on imagery acquired by OLCI over global water bodies.  Our method outperforms a comparable state-of-the-art approach by 5-12% on average across the entire spectrum of trophic states, as it also eliminates the need to choose the right algorithm for water observation. It estimates trophic status with over 90% accuracy for highly affected eutrophic and hypereutrophic waters. ReferenceWerther M et al.
