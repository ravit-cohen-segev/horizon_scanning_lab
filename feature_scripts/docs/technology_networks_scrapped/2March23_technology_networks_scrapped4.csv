It is expected to become the dominant variant within a few weeks or months. Initial epidemiological studies show that the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the currently dominant virus (the Delta variant). It is capable of spreading to individuals who have received two vaccine doses and to previously infected individuals. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur and the Vaccine Research Institute, in collaboration with KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium), Orl ans Regional Hospital, H pital Europ en Georges Pompidou (AP-HP), Inserm and the CNRS, studied the sensitivity of the Omicron variant to monoclonal antibodies used in clinical practice to prevent severe forms of the disease in people at risk, as well as to antibodies in the blood of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated. They compared this sensitivity with that of the Delta variant. The scientists demonstrated that Omicron is much less sensitive to neutralizing antibodies than Delta. The scientists then analyzed the blood of people who had received two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine. Five months after vaccination, the antibodies in the blood were no longer capable of neutralizing Omicron. This loss of efficacy was also observed in individuals who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the past 12 months. Administering a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine or a single vaccine dose in previously infected individuals led to a significant increase in antibody levels that was sufficient to neutralize Omicron. Omicron is therefore much less sensitive to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies currently used in clinical practice or obtained after two vaccine doses.Initial epidemiological studies demonstrate that the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant. The Omicron variant's biological characteristics are still relatively unknown. It has more than 32 mutations in the spike protein compared with the first SARS-CoV-2 and was designated as a variant of concern by WHO on November 26, 2021.In South Africa, the Omicron variant replaced the other viruses within a few weeks and led to a sharp increase in the number of cases diagnosed. Analyses in various countries indicate that the doubling time for cases is approximately 2 to 4 days. Omicron has been detected in dozens of countries, including France and became dominant by the end of 2021.In a new study supported by the European Union's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), scientists from the Institut Pasteur and the Vaccine Research Institute, in collaboration with KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium), Orl ans Regional Hospital, H pital Europ en Georges Pompidou (AP-HP) and Inserm, studied the sensitivity of Omicron to antibodies compared with the currently dominant Delta variant. The aim of the study was to characterize the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies, as well as antibodies developed by individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated, in neutralizing this new variant.The scientists from KU Leuven isolated the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasal sample of a 32-year-old woman who developed moderate COVID-19 a few days after returning from Egypt. The isolated virus was immediately sent to scientists at the Institut Pasteur, where therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and serum samples from people who had been vaccinated or previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were used to study the sensitivity of the Omicron variant.The scientists used rapid neutralization assays, developed by the Institut Pasteur's Virus and Immunity Unit, on the isolated sample of the Omicron virus. This collaborative multidisciplinary effort also involved the Institut Pasteur's virologists and specialists in the analysis of viral evolution and protein structure, together with teams from Orl ans Regional Hospital and H pital Europ en Georges Pompidou in Paris.The scientists began by testing nine monoclonal antibodies used in clinical practice or currently in preclinical development. Six antibodies lost all antiviral activity, and the other three were 3 to 80 times less effective against Omicron than against Delta. The antibodies Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (a combination developed by Lilly), Casirivimab/Imdevimab (a combination developed by Roche and known as Ronapreve) and Regdanvimab (developed by Celtrion) no longer had any antiviral effect against Omicron. The Tixagevimab/Cilgavimab combination (developed by AstraZeneca under the name Evusheld) was 80 times less effective against Omicron than against Delta.""We demonstrated that this highly transmissible variant has acquired significant resistance to antibodies. Most of the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies currently available against SARS-CoV-2 are inactive,"" comments Olivier Schwartz, co-last author of the study and Head of the Virus and Immunity Unit at the Institut Pasteur.The scientists observed that the blood of patients previously infected with COVID-19, collected up to 12 months after symptoms, and that of individuals who had received two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine, taken five months after vaccination, barely neutralized the Omicron variant. But the sera of individuals who had received a booster dose of Pfizer, analyzed one month after vaccination, remained effective against Omicron. Five to 31 times more antibodies were nevertheless required to neutralize Omicron, compared with Delta, in cell culture assays. These results help shed light on the continued efficacy of vaccines in protecting against severe forms of disease.""We now need to study the length of protection of the booster dose. The vaccines probably become less effective in offering protection against contracting the virus, but they should continue to protect against severe forms,"" explains Olivier Schwartz.Reference: Planas D, Saunders N, Maes P, et al. 2021.

This has led to questions about the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines in people with inflammatory RMDs. The COVAX registry aims to answer these questions and provide information about the safety of COVID vaccination in people with RMDs. This latest publication reveals data from over 5,000 people across a number of different RMDs and vaccine types. The findings should provide reassurance to health professionals and vaccine recipients, and promote confidence in the safety of COVID vaccination in people with inflammatory RMDs.COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Since it emerged at the end of 2019, the virus has caused a global pandemic. In February 2021, EULAR, the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology, launched COVAX   a physician-reported registry to collect information about COVID vaccination in people with both inflammatory and non-inflammatory RMDs. Rheumatologists in EULAR-affiliated countries were asked to report as many cases as possible of people with RMDs who had received a COVID vaccine, whether or not they had experienced side effects.From February to July 2021, information was collected for 5,121 people with different types of RMD who had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. The most common inflammatory RMDs were rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. The most common non-inflammatory RMDs were osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. Among people with inflammatory RMDs, 54% were taking a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD), 42% were on biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), and 35% were taking immunosuppressant medicines for their RMD (e.g., glucocorticoids, mycophenolate, azathioprine).The results from COVAX show that the majority of people with inflammatory RMDs tolerate their COVID vaccine well   with no difference in safety profile to that seen in the general population or people with non-inflammatory RMDs. The most common side effects were short-lived reactions to the injection. One of the reasons for asking additional safety questions in people with inflammatory RMDs is the concern that the vaccine could cause a disease flare. In this study, only 4.4% of people experienced a flare after having their COVID vaccine, and only 0.6% were classed as severe. The majority of people (over 98%) were able to continue on their normal medication with no changes. The study also found there was a low rate of COVID-19 infections in people with RMDs once they were fully vaccinated.These are valuable findings which will support discussions about the safety and benefit/risk ratio of COVID vaccination for people with RMDs. The information will also be useful for the development of new and updated recommendations.Reference: Machado PM, Lawson-Tovey S, Strangfeld A, et al.

This is absolutely ground-breaking and it will increase the rate of recycling of plastics immensely. The technology has already been tested at pilot scale and it will be implemented at an industrial scale in spring 2022.In contrast to common perceptions, plastic is in no way near one material. Rather, it is a combination of many materials (polymers) with different chemical compounds and additives such as pigments or fibres, depending on its use. It is very difficult to tell the difference between different types of plastics, and this is what makes it difficult to separate and recycle them. In collaboration with Vestforbr nding, Dansk Affaldsminimering Aps, and PLASTIX, researchers from the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University have now developed a new camera technology that can see the difference between 12 different types of plastics (PE, PP, PET, PS, PVC, PVDF, POM, PEEK, ABS, PMMA, PC, and PA12). Together, these constitute the vast majority of household plastic types.  The technology makes it possible to separate plastics based on a purer chemical composition than is possible today, and this opens up for completely new opportunities to recycle plastics. The technology has been tested at pilot scale and is planned to be implemented at PLASTIX and Dansk Affaldsminimering Aps in spring 2022.""With this technology, we can now see the difference between all types of consumer plastics and several high-performance plastics. We can even see the difference between plastics that consist of the same chemical building blocks, but which are structured slightly differently. We use a hyperspectral camera in the infrared area, and machine learning to analyse and categorise the type of plastic directly on the conveyor belt. The plastic can then be separated into different types. It's a breakthrough that will have a huge impact on all plastics separation,"" says Associate Professor Mogens Hinge, who is heading the project at Aarhus University. The study has been published in the scientific journal Vibrational Spectroscopy. Plastics are currently separated using near-infrared technology (NIR) or via density tests (floats/sinks in water). These methods can separate certain plastic fractions (for example PE, PP, and PET), but not with the same accuracy as the new technology, and therefore not with the chemical purity in the composition, and this is vital to be able to increase the recycling rate of waste plastic. ""The technology we ve developed in collaboration with the university is nothing short of a breakthrough for our ability to recycle plastics. We look forward to installing the technology in our processing hall and starting in earnest on the long journey towards 100% utilisation of waste plastic,"" says Hans Axel Kristensen, CEO of PLASTIX. Plastic must be at least 96% pure by polymer type to be recycled in conventional industry. This means that the plastic has to be separated to an almost pure product in terms of chemical composition.  Using the new technology, we are now a big step along the way, says Associate Professor Mogens Hinge, who stresses that the technology is continuously being developed and that data indicates it may be possible to differentiate even further between polymer types and additives before long. The hyper-spectral camera technology has been developed in cross-disciplinary collaboration, including BSc and MSc engineering students and researchers at the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University, as well as experts from the participating companies. The research is part of the Re-Plast project, which is being funded by the Innovation Fund Denmark with DKK 22.7 million.

The sea anemone Nematostella, for instance, burrows into salt marsh sediments and stays there for life. But it has specialized  stinging cells  that hurl toxins into passing prey, immobilizing the morsel so the anemone can snatch it with its tentacles.New research from the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), however, finds that Nematostella s growth, development, and feeding ability are drastically impacted by present levels of common pollutants found in one of its native habitats, the U.S. East Coast. The numbers of Nematostella in the wild have been dramatically decreasing over time,  said senior author Karen Echeverri, associate scientist in the MBL s Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering. This study pinpoints factors that threaten the species, which is already under protection in the United Kingdom.The MBL team focused on phthalates (plasticizers), chemicals that are widely used in plastic packaging and other consumer products that wash into the ocean; and potassium nitrate, which enters marshes through runoff from lawn fertilizers.When Nematostella embryos were exposed to phthalate and nitrate concentrations commonly found in coastal environments (1-20  M), they showed a gross decrease in body size two weeks after exposure. The animals also had fewer tentacles, and the tentacles that did grow were misshapen or uneven in length or number. In addition, the pollutant-exposed animals had a severely reduced number of stinging cells (cnidocytes), which they use as a defense mechanism and to capture food. At a certain point, the animals just die, because they can t defend themselves or feed themselves properly,  said Echeverri.Because Nematostella is sessile (stationary), it must constantly acclimate to environmental changes, such as temperature and salinity.  They have what we call adaptive plasticity; they are resilient to change,  Echeverri said.  But we think there is a limit to that resilience. And as you bring in more pollution, they reach that limit of resilience much faster. The study is unusual in that it integrates assessment of the pollutants  impact on Nematostella s microbiome. Led by MBL scientists Mitchell Sogin and Emil Ruff, the team sequenced the microbiomes of animals after 10 days of pollutant exposure. Certain classes of microbes became much more dominant after exposure,  said Echeverri.  How this affects the physiology of the animal, we don t completely know yet. Shifts in the microbiome can serve as sentinels of change in the health of the host, as shown by prior studies in other animals, including corals and humans. A next step is to link changes in the Nematostella microbiome to changes in the animal s development,  Echeverri said.Other studies of the effects of phthalates on embryonic development in vertebrates, including frogs and zebrafish, identified defects in body growth similar to what was found in Nematostella. These include slower body growth and defects of cells in the ectodermal lineage (such as the cnidocytes). Impacts on the endocrine system and on fertility have also been documented in other species.Reference: Klein S, Frazier V, Readdean T, et al.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/exploring-neural-circuits-and-chemotherapys-side-effects-357314,Exploring Neural Circuits and Chemotherapy s Side Effects A new study has found a novel pathway for understanding why pain  fatigue and cognitive disorders happen for cancer patients after treatment   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Severe and persistent disability often undermines the life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. Pain and fatigue   together with sensory, motor, and cognitive disorders   are chief among the constellation of side effects that occur with the platinum-based agents used widely in chemotherapy treatments worldwide.A new study by Georgia Tech researchers in the lab of Timothy C. Cope has found a novel pathway for understanding why these debilitating conditions happen for cancer patients and why scientists should focus on all of the possible neural processes that deliver sensory or motor problems to a patient s brain   including the central nervous system   and not just the  peripheral degeneration of sensory neurons  that occurs away from the center of the body.The new findings Neural circuit mechanisms of sensorimotor disability in cancer treatment are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and could impact development of effective treatments that are not yet available for restoring a patient s normal abilities to receive and process sensory input as part of post cancer treatment, in particular.Stephen N. (Nick) Housley, a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Biological Sciences, the Integrated Cancer Research Center, and the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech, is the study s lead author. Co-authors include Paul Nardelli, research scientist and Travis Rotterman, postdoctoral fellow (both of the School of Biological Sciences), along with Timothy Cope, who serves as a professor with joint appointments in the School of Biological Sciences at Georgia Tech and in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Emory University and Georgia Tech.  Chemotherapy undoubtedly negatively influences the peripheral nervous system, which is often viewed as the main culprit of neurologic disorders during cancer treatment,  shares Housley. However, he says, for the nervous system to operate normally, both the peripheral and central nervous system must cooperate. This occurs through synaptic communication between neurons. Through an elegant series of studies, we show that those hubs of communication in the central nervous system are also vulnerable to cancer treatment s adverse effects,  Housley shares, adding that the findings force  recognition of the numerous places throughout the nervous system that we have to treat if we ever want to fix the neurological consequences of cancer treatment   because correcting any one may not be enough to improve human function and quality of life. These disabilities remain clinically unmitigated and empirically unexplained as research concentrates on peripheral degeneration of sensory neurons,  the research team explains in the study,  while understating the possible involvement of neural processes within the central nervous system. The present findings demonstrate functional defects in the fundamental properties of information processing localized within the central nervous system,  concluding that  long-lasting sensorimotor and possibly other disabilities induced by cancer treatment result from independent neural defects compounded across both peripheral and central nervous systems.  The research team notes that cancer survivors  rank sensorimotor disability among the most distressing, long-term consequences of chemotherapy. Disorders in gait, balance, and skilled movements are commonly assigned to chemotoxic damage of peripheral sensory neurons without consideration of the deterministic role played by the neural circuits that translate sensory information into movement,  adding that this oversight  precludes sufficient, mechanistic understanding and contributes to the absence of effective treatment for reversing chemotherapy-induced disability. Cope says the team resolved this omission  through the use of a combination of electrophysiology, behavior, and modeling to study the operation of a spinal sensorimotor circuit in vivo  in a rodent model of  chronic, oxaliplatin (chemotherapy) induced neuropathy: cOIN. Key sequential events were studied in the encoding of  propriosensory  information (think kinesthesia: the body's ability to sense its location, movements, and actions) and its circuit translation into the synaptic potentials produced in motoneurons.In the  cOIN  rats, the team noted multiple classes of propriosensory neurons expressed defective firing that reduced accurate sensory representation of muscle mechanical responses to stretch, adding that accuracy  degraded further in the translation of propriosensory signals into synaptic potentials as a result of defective mechanisms residing inside the spinal cord.   These sequential, peripheral, and central defects compounded to drive the sensorimotor circuit into a functional collapse that was consequential in predicting the significant errors in propriosensory-guided movement behaviors demonstrated here in our rat model and reported for people with cOIN,  Cope and Housley report.  We conclude that sensorimotor disability induced by cancer treatment emerges from the joint expression of independent defects occurring in both peripheral and central elements of sensorimotor circuits. These findings have broad impact on the scientific field and on clinical management of neurologic consequences of cancer treatment,  Housley says.  As both a clinician and scientist, I can envision the urgent need to jointly develop quantitative clinical tests that have the capacity to identify which parts of a patient nervous system are impacted by their cancer treatment. Housley also says that having the capacity to monitor neural function across various sites during the course of treatment  will provide a biomarker on which we can optimize treatment   e.g. maximize anti-neoplastic effects while minimizing the adverse effects,  adding that, as we move into the next generation cancer treatments,  clinical tests that can objectively monitor specific aspects of the nervous system will be exceptionally important to test for the presence off-target effect.

Egg white protein   ovalbumin   produced by precision fermentation reduced land use requirements by almost 90 per cent and greenhouse gases by 31 55 per cent compared to the production of its chicken-based counterpart.The research by the Future Sustainable Food Systems research group at the University of Helsinki together with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finlandshows that fungus-produced ovalbumin could have the potential to mitigate part of the environmental burden associated with chicken egg white powder. This is especially true when using low carbon energy sources in the production.  Chicken egg white powder is a commonly used ingredient in the food industry due to the high-quality protein it contains. The yearly consumption of egg proteins in 2020 was around 1.6 million tons and the market is expected to expand further in the coming years. The growing demand is raising questions about both sustainability and ethics. Parts of the egg whitepowder production chain, such as rearing chickens for egg production, generate large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and deforestation. Additionally, intensive chicken farming has resulted in outbreaks of zoonotic diseases by serving as an important reservoir for human pathogens.  Searching for sustainable alternatives to animal-based proteins has been of growing interest within the food industry. Cellular agriculture, also called precision fermentation when used for recombinant ingredient production, offers a biotechnology-based solution to decouple the production of animal proteins from animal farming by using a microbial production system to produce the specific proteins instead.   For example, more than half of the egg white powder protein content is ovalbumin. VTThas succeeded in producing ovalbumin with the help of the filamentous ascomycete fungus Trichoderma reesei. The gene carrying the blueprints for ovalbumin is inserted by modern biotechnological tools into the fungus which then produces and secretes the same protein that chickens produce. The ovalbumin protein is then separated from the cells, concentrated and dried to create a final functional product,  says Dr Emilia Nordlund from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Cell-cultured products generally need more electricity than typical agricultural products, and therefore the type of energy source used affects the level of environmental impact.However, the amount of agricultural inputs needed for ovalbumin production by microbes   such as glucose   is generally substantially lower per kilogramme of protein powder.   According to our research, this means that the fungus-produced ovalbumin reduced land use requirements by almost 90 per cent and greenhouse gases by 31 55 per cent compared to the production of its chicken-based counterpart. In the future, when production is based on low carbon energy, precision fermentation has the potential to reduce the impact even by up to 72 per cent,  says Doctoral Researcher Natasha J rvi  from the University of Helsinki.For the impact of water use on the environment, the results were less conclusive, showing a high degree of dependency on the assumed location of the ovalbumin production site. In general, the study shows the potential of the precision fermentation technology to increase the sustainability of protein production, which can be further increased by the use of low-carbon energy sources.Reference J rvi  N, Parviainen T, Maljanen NL, et al.

They determined that adenomas arise from expansion of stem cells that are driven by activation of WNT signaling, which contributes to the development of cancer, while serrated polyps derive into cancer through a different process called gastric metaplasia. The finding about metaplasia, an abnormal change of cells into cells that are non-native to the tissue, was surprising, the researchers said. Cellular plasticity through metaplasia is now recognized as a key pathway in cancer initiation, and there were pioneering contributions to this area by investigators here at Vanderbilt,  said Ken Lau, PhD, associate professor of Cell and Developmental Biology, one of the study s corresponding authors.  We now have provided evidence of this process and its downstream consequences in one of the largest single-cell transcriptomic studies of human participants from a single center to date. The researchers did an integrative analysis of 128 datasets of tissue samples from 62 tumors. They performed single-cell RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence and multiplex immunohistochemistry on the samples, which were collected from diverse sex, racial and age groups.The cells from serrated polyps did not exhibit WNT pathway activation nor a stem cell signature. Moreover, the researchers observed that these cells had highly expressed genes not normally found in the colon, leading them to hypothesize that metaplasia plays a role in how serrated polyps become cancerous. The researchers observed in the serrated-specific cells highly expressed genes not normally found in the colon but are expressed in the stomach, including MUC5AC, AQP5, TACSTD2 (TROP2), TFF2, MUC17 and MSLN. We propose a new paradigm in which damage to the proximal colon, possibly from microbiota, initiates a metaplastic cascade that may eventually select for survival/proliferative pathways, such as activating mutations in BRAF,  the researchers wrote in the paper.Bob Chen, a Vanderbilt University graduate student, and Cherie  Scurrah, PhD, are the paper s co-first authors.The study provided a number of other findings of clinical significance. For instance, sessile serrated lesions can be challenging to identify, and the study suggest biomarkers that may confirm their diagnosis. The study revealed much about the mechanisms of sessile serrated lesions in regulating the tumor immune landscape. The findings in our atlas lay the foundation for opening novel strategies for interception of cancer progression, including better surveillance protocols, chemoprevention and pre-biotic and pro-biotic therapies  said Martha Shrubsole, PhD, research professor in the Division of Epidemiology, and a corresponding author.The Vanderbilt research was supported by the Human Tumor Atlas Network grant from the Cancer Moonshot initiative of the National Cancer Institute and other funding from the National Cancer Institute, the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program of the U.S. Department of Defense, Cancer UK, Janssen, and the Nicholas Tierney GI Cancer Memorial Fund.

Chemotherapy is the most commonly employed, standard cancer treatment and targeted delivery of these drugs to the tumor site increases their effectiveness. However, excess drugs may still circulate to the rest of the body and cause multiple side effects, including anemia, chronic infections, hair loss, jaundice and fever.A number of proposed methods have been attempted to remove unwanted chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly the widely used drug doxorubicin (DOX), from the blood. But these methods have resulted in insufficiently low levels of DOX removal. Additional strategies which use electrically charged nanoparticles for binding DOX lose effectiveness with exposure to the charged molecules and proteins found in blood, despite the addition of materials intended to protect binding capacity.A collaborative team, which included scientists from The Pennsylvania State University and the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation (TIBI), has devised a method to address these challenges.The method, described in Materials Today Chemistry, is based on hairy cellulose nanocrystals   nanoparticles developed from the main component of plant cell walls and engineered to have immense numbers of polymer chain  hairs  extending from each end. These hairs increase the potential drug capture capacity of the nanocrystals significantly beyond that of conventional nanoparticles and other materials.To produce the hairy cellulose nanocrystals capable of capturing chemotherapy drugs, the researchers chemically treated cellulose fibers found in softwood pulp and imparted a negative charge on the hairs, making them stable against the charged molecules found in blood. This corrects the problems found with conventional nanoparticles, whose charge can be rendered inert or reduced when exposed to blood, limiting the number of positively charged drug molecules it can bind to in insignificant numbers.The nanocrystals  binding efficacy was tested in human serum, the protein-rich liquid portion of blood. For every gram of hairy cellulose nanocrystals, more than 6,000 milligrams of DOX were effectively removed from the serum. This represents an increase in DOX capture of two to three orders of magnitude compared to other methods currently available.Furthermore, DOX capture occurred immediately after addition of the nanocrystals and the nanocrystals had no toxic or harmful effects on red blood cells in whole blood or on cell growth of human umbilical cells.Such a powerful means of drug capture within the body can have a great impact on cancer treatment regimens, as doses can be elevated to more effective levels without the worry of detrimental side effects.Principal investigator, Amir Sheikhi, assistant professor of chemical engineering and biomedical engineering at Penn State, offered an example of such an application.  For some organs, like the liver, chemotherapy can be locally administered through catheters. If we could place a device based on the nanocrystals to capture the excess drugs exiting the liver s inferior vena cava, a major blood vessel, clinicians could potentially administer higher doses of chemotherapy to kill the cancer more quickly without worry about damaging healthy cells. Once the treatment is finished, the device could be removed. In addition to removing excess chemotherapeutic drugs from the body, the hairy cellulose nanocrystals could also target other undesirable substances such as toxins and addictive drugs for removal from the body, and experiments have also demonstrated the nanocrystals  effectiveness in other separation applications, such as in the retrieval of valuable elements from electronic waste. What began as a relatively simple concept has evolved into a highly effective means of materials separation,  said Ali Khademhosseini, Director and CEO at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation.  This creates the potential for wide-ranging and impactful biomedical and materials science applications. Reference: Young SAE, Muthami J, Pitcher M, et al.

These experiences were communicated via formal channels, such as the UK s Yellow Card Scheme, as well as social media. The potential impact of various authorized vaccines on menstrual cycles was not tested during initial clinical trials.Subsequently, with an increasing number of vaccines being administered and more reports surfacing, calls for this phenomenon to be further explored increased. The scientific community responded, and in August 2021 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) declared $1.67 million worth of funding dedicated to this research space.A handful of studies emerged in the second half of 2021, however they were associated with some limitations. Dr. Victoria Male, lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London explains,  Although there have already been a handful of studies on how COVID-19 vaccination may affect the menstrual cycle, all the ones we have so far have been retrospective. A prospective study observes the occurrence of specific outcomes (for example, a disease) while a study is ongoing. In contrast, a retrospective study collects data by looking backwards in time when a specific outcome (such as disease) has already been established at the start of a study.This method of collecting data can be limited in validity.  Participants might recall their experiences wrongly, and people who noticed a change to their periods might have been more motivated to participate   enriching for those who noticed a change,  says Male.A new, prospective studyA new study led by Dr. Alison Edelman at Oregon Health & Science University, published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, has adopted a prospective approach.The research was conducted in the US, where the interval between dose one and dose two of the COVID-19 vaccine is between three-to-four weeks. This timeframe varies in different countries; for example, the UK dosage interval is approximately eight weeks.Edelman and colleagues collected data on 3,959 individuals from a US Food and Drug Administration approved birth control application,  Natural Cycles , where users can log and track their menstrual cycles. Study participants authorized their data to be de-identified and analyzed to compare cycles between those that had been vaccinated (2,403 individuals) and those that had not (1,556 individuals). Of the different COVID-19 vaccines available, 55% of the participants received Pfizer BioNTech s mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, 35% received Moderna s mRNA-1273 and seven percent received Johnson & Johnson/ Janssen s JNJ-78436735.COVID-19 vaccines may temporarily alter menstrual cycleThe study findings show that, on average, individuals experienced a delay to their menstrual cycle of less than one day following vaccination. Participants that received both doses of a vaccine within the same menstrual cycle   due to the three-to-four-week interval dose   experienced a two-day delay to their period.  However, their periods returned to normal within two cycles [ ] These results are reassuring, showing that most people do not experience a significant change to their cycle after COVID-19 vaccination and in those that do (people who receive both doses in a single cycle), their cycle returns to normal quickly,  says Male.The timing of periods varies for an individual and between individuals. Any changes that are less than eight days are not of clinical concern.  There s no evidence from this study of any clinically concerning change. And the small changes that were observed went back to normal very quickly. We also know from other studies that there s no effect of COVID-19 vaccination on female fertility,  Male emphasizes.Male notes that differences in dosing schedules across countries may explain why such changes have not been detected in research studies conducted thus far.  In countries like the UK, where we leave eight weeks between doses, it s not possible to have both doses in a single cycle, so we expect not to see this happening here [the UK],  she says. In 2021, Male led a UK-based study that recruited a cohort of 1273 female participants to retrospectively analyze changes in menstrual cycle following COVID-19 vaccination. The study was not able to identify any strong links.  To be really sure of this [finding from the US-based study], we need to do a similar analysis using UK cycle tracking data   this is underway,  she adds.What is causing the changes?While the change to menstrual cycles identified in this study is not cause for concern, it s important that research continues to explore the biological mechanisms as to why this may be happening. A firm conclusion is yet to be made, but there are several hypotheses. The immune system and the reproductive system are interlinked, and thus there may be signaling mechanisms that occur following vaccination that subsequently impact the menstrual cycle timing. The author s note that, in addition to the reassuring data obtained from the study, the work is a success because it was prompted by the  public s interest in menstrual health . Pontsho Pilane, head of communications at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute and co-author of the book Flow, says that this is a positive sign that scientists are listening to populations  concerns:  As a menstruating woman and a menstrual health and justice advocate, I m particularly happy to see this data analysis as it gives some light to questions people who menstruate have been grappling with on and off-line as vaccination programs roll out across the globe. Science has a particularly thorny history when it comes to looking at issues that affect people with uteruses,  she adds.  We cannot deny the racist and unethical origins of gynecology as we know it today [ ] The politics of gender and scientific research remain contentious until this day. While a lot has changed since then, it s great to see menstruators leading the research, as it is a step in the right direction of community-led research.

The uppermost layer of the ocean provides a home for a multitude of microscopic organisms known as phytoplankton. These single-celled microalgae are often invisible to the naked eye unless a  bloom  occurs and they accumulate in large numbers.  Just like trees and plants found on land, phytoplankton possess chlorophyl and photosynthesize, consuming carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Many different species of phytoplankton exist and play varying roles in the aquatic ecosystem. Massive congregations of greenish phytoplankton swirl in the dark water around Gotland, a Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. Credit: USGS on Unsplash. Coccolithophores are one example of phytoplankton.  Coccolithophores are single-celled algae that produce limestone plates one-by-one inside of their cells in special compartments, and these are then pushed through the cell wall to form an exoskeleton of imbricated plates,  says Dr. Clara Bolton, researcher at the European Centre for Research and Teaching in Environmental Geoscience (CEREGE).These limestone plates are called coccoliths. At one time, a single coccolithophore may be surrounded by 30 coccoliths, which are  dumped  into the water when the organism dies or reproduces asexually. Coccolithophores   found across different parts of the world   are estimated to be responsible for dumping 1.5 million tons of calcite into the ocean every year.Consequently, they play a fundamental part in regulating the ocean s chemistry and carbon cycle. Bolton explains,  Coccolithophores play a dual role in the ocean carbon cycle, because (like all plants) they take up carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to make organic matter, but they also use bicarbonate ions from seawater to produce coccoliths, a process which produces carbon dioxide. The fine balance between this organic carbon production and coccolith production ultimately determines whether a population of coccolithophores act as a source or sink of carbon dioxide. When coccoliths (made of calcium carbonate that contains carbon) sink to the seafloor and are buried in sediments, carbon is removed from the ocean-atmosphere reservoir, which can impact climate,  adds Bolton.The burying of coccoliths in sediment allows for their preservation. Their fossils can provide scientists with insights on the evolution of coccolithophores over time, and the different factors that might have influenced such evolution. In a new study published in Nature, Dr. Bolton and colleagues analyzed over 7 million coccolith fossils that span a time period of 2.8 million years, obtained from several locations in the tropical ocean.The research project aimed to explore how variations in the Earth s orbit could drive evolution. The inspiration, Bolton explains, was the  intriguing observation  that the size of coccolithophores was regularly varying over time.  These cycles were not necessarily connected to what we know about past climates,  she says.The fossil samples were obtained from international and French scientific coring expeditions that members of the study team participated in.  Our samples are all from the tropical Indo-Pacific but cover many different environments in terms of ocean chemistry and biology. They come from the seafloor, between about 1000 m and 3000 m water depth,  says Bolton.The coccolith samples were mounted on microscopic slides before automatic microscope techniques were utilized to capture images. As the study progressed, novel and higher-throughput methods were developed that could produce higher-resolution records from across the sites. Artificial intelligence methods that have been under development in the  lab for over 15 years were then used to identify the different forms of coccoliths and measure them. Bolton says that the study  represents an enormous amount of laboratory preparation, microscope and computing time . Bolton and colleagues found that, irrespective of where the coccolith samples were obtained from, there were long-term changes in size that were common to all sites. Coccolithophores are sensitive to even the slightest change in climate. Could this be driving the varying cycles of coccolith shapes and sizes? We thought about what the common driver of size changes could be and collaborated with our climate modeling colleagues to test mechanisms,  Bolton says.Ultimately, the researchers were led to the hypothesis that changes in the Earth s orbit could be behind the varying cycles of coccolith size and shape.The Earth does not orbit around the sun in a circular fashion. It has an elliptical orbit, resembling an  oval  shape, rather than a circle. The amount by which the Earth s orbit deviates away from being a circle is known as its eccentricity; the more circular the orbit, the lower the eccentricity, and vice versa. The characteristics of this orbit, Bolton explains, are not stable due to the complexity of the solar system. Because of its interaction with other celestial bodies, the shape of the Earth s orbit becomes more or less elliptical (higher or lower eccentricity) following cycles of ~100,000 and ~400,000 years,  Bolton says.When analyzing the data from their coccolith samples, the researchers found that the changes in the rhythm of the Earth s orbit were mirrored in the size and shape of the coccoliths. They therefore hypothesize a link between the two; and this may influence the Earth s climate.When the Earth s orbit is lower in eccentricity   which is the case today   the equatorial regions show little seasonal variation.  As eccentricity increases and more pronounced seasons appear near the equator, coccolithophores diversify into many specialized species, but collectively produce less limestone,  says Bolton. These changes in the production of limestone alter the ocean chemistry and carbon burial, which feeds back on the Earth s climate. The researchers emphasize that this hypothesis remains to be proven, which would require the study of older specimens from periods where the Earth was without polar ice caps.  We could quantify the amount of carbonate produced by coccolithophores and compare it to climatic parameters,  Bolton explains.Next, the team will conduct analyses on samples from the Pliocene and Miocene period (10-15 million years ago).  We will increase our corpus of data by measuring the carbon isotopes of the coccoliths to reveal deeper carbon mysteries  Bolton concludes.While coccolithophores are integral oceanic calcite producers, they are merely one type of phytoplankton. It s unclear, at this stage, whether other groups of organisms may demonstrate evolutionary changes that align with changes in eccentricity too.Dr. Clara Bolton was speaking to Molly Campbell, Senior Science Writer for Technology Networks.Reference: Beaufort L, Bolton CT, Sarr AC, et al.

The plasma particles, following magnetic field lines in toroidal chambers known as tokamaks, must be confined long enough for fusion devices to produce significant gains in net energy, a challenge when the hot edge of the plasma (over 1 million degrees Celsius) is just centimeters away from the much cooler solid walls of the vessel.Abhilash Mathews, a PhD candidate in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering working at MIT s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC), believes this plasma edge to be a particularly rich source of unanswered questions. A turbulent boundary, it is central to understanding plasma confinement, fueling, and the potentially damaging heat fluxes that can strike material surfaces   factors that impact fusion reactor designs.To better understand edge conditions, scientists focus on modeling turbulence at this boundary using numerical simulations that will help predict the plasma's behavior. However,  first principles  simulations of this region are among the most challenging and time-consuming computations in fusion research. Progress could be accelerated if researchers could develop  reduced  computer models that run much faster, but with quantified levels of accuracy.For decades, tokamak physicists have regularly used a reduced  two-fluid theory  rather than higher-fidelity models to simulate boundary plasmas in experiment, despite uncertainty about accuracy. In a pair of recent publications, Mathews begins directly testing the accuracy of this reduced plasma turbulence model in a new way: he combines physics with machine learning. A successful theory is supposed to predict what you're going to observe,  explains Mathews,  for example, the temperature, the density, the electric potential, the flows. And it s the relationships between these variables that fundamentally define a turbulence theory. What our work essentially examines is the dynamic relationship between two of these variables: the turbulent electric field and the electron pressure. In the first paper, published in Physical Review E, Mathews employs a novel deep-learning technique that uses artificial neural networks to build representations of the equations governing the reduced fluid theory. With this framework, he demonstrates a way to compute the turbulent electric field from an electron pressure fluctuation in the plasma consistent with the reduced fluid theory. Models commonly used to relate the electric field to pressure break down when applied to turbulent plasmas, but this one is robust even to noisy pressure measurements.In the second paper, published in Physics of Plasmas, Mathews further investigates this connection, contrasting it against higher-fidelity turbulence simulations. This first-of-its-kind comparison of turbulence across models has previously been difficult   if not impossible   to evaluate precisely. Mathews finds that in plasmas relevant to existing fusion devices, the reduced fluid model's predicted turbulent fields are consistent with high-fidelity calculations. In this sense, the reduced turbulence theory works. But to fully validate it,  one should check every connection between every variable,  says Mathews.Mathews  advisor, Principal Research Scientist Jerry Hughes, notes that plasma turbulence is notoriously difficult to simulate, more so than the familiar turbulence seen in air and water.  This work shows that, under the right set of conditions, physics-informed machine-learning techniques can paint a very full picture of the rapidly fluctuating edge plasma, beginning from a limited set of observations. I m excited to see how we can apply this to new experiments, in which we essentially never observe every quantity we want. These physics-informed deep-learning methods pave new ways in testing old theories and expanding what can be observed from new experiments. David Hatch, a research scientist at the Institute for Fusion Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, believes these applications are the start of a promising new technique. Abhi s work is a major achievement with the potential for broad application,  he says.  For example, given limited diagnostic measurements of a specific plasma quantity, physics-informed machine learning could infer additional plasma quantities in a nearby domain, thereby augmenting the information provided by a given diagnostic. The technique also opens new strategies for model validation. Mathews sees exciting research ahead. Translating these techniques into fusion experiments for real edge plasmas is one goal we have in sight, and work is currently underway,  he says.  But this is just the beginning. References: 1.

Just as the causes of ADHD have a biological basis, the discovery of biomarkers could help with diagnosing and treating this disorder that sometimes has serious consequences for the affected person s safety and their family, professional and social life. Supported by the national research centre Synapsy, neuroscientists from University of Geneva (UNIGE), the Centre for Biomedical Imaging (CIBM) and the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG) focused their attention on a new electroencephalographic approach called microstates to identify ADHD s neurological signatures. The microstates technique is used to look at the combined spatial and temporal aspects of cerebral activity. Using this technique, the research team discovered that a certain cerebral activity state associated with sleep and attention lasted longer among people with ADHD. The results, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,  provide evidence of a more robust ADHD biomarker and thus contribute towards helping psychiatry become a more precise medical discipline.ADHD affects five per cent of adults, making it one of the most common psychological disorders. Current clinical diagnosis is based only on questionnaires that focus mainly on the inattention and impulsivity symptoms. However, neuroscientists speculate that ADHD s causes, while still not well known, have a biological and genetic basis, suggesting that there may exist biomarkers that could help in its diagnosis. This was the scope of this new study supported by Synapsy, a research centre that has combined psychiatry and the neurosciences over the past twelve years to understand the neural basis of different psychological disorders in the hope of creating better means for diagnosing and treating them. The study of the human brain is a difficult endeavour because we cannot directly access the brain to look at its cellular and molecular mechanisms. Hence, non-invasive investigative methods such as brain scans or electroencephalograms (EEG) are used. The latter test uses a network of electrode sensors placed on the subject s scalp to measure the electrical fields generated by large-scale neural networks. Recent studies have revealed abnormal EEG activity among patients affected by ADHD, suggesting that abnormal cerebral development may be the cause of ADHD.Unfortunately, the data vary too much from one study to another, making them unreliable markers for ADHD.  These variations are due either to the wide heterogeneity of ADHD s causes or to the fact that traditional EEG analyses are not a good tool for looking into the matter because they do not take into account the spatio-temporal aspects of cerebral states,  said Tomas Ros, researcher at the Department of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine.   Brainactivity fluctuates successively from one state to another while at rest, manifesting different spatial configurations in the EEG s electrical field. Neuroscientists speak most often of five  micro  states or main configurations, lettered from A to E. These different states remain stable for about one hundred milliseconds and shift from one to the other, hence their name microstates. An EEG can detect them, and their frequency, duration and order of appearance can be extracted from the recordings.Using this approach, researchers found differences between adult patients with and without ADHD. The cerebral microstate A appears to have ashorter duration among patients diagnosed with ADHD.  By comparing this observation with the data from clinical questionnaires, we observed that this state is inversely correlated to symptoms of inattention,  said Victor F rat, researcher at the Functional Brain Mapping Laboratory and first author of the study. Interestingly, the team observed that microstate D had a longer duration in patients with ADHD ,and that this was associated with increased sleep disturbance, a typical symptom of ADHD.    Just as scientific findings must be reproduced in the field, the research team then repeated their analyses with a separate cohort of patients to verify the generalizability of their findings. Through a collaboration with Prof. Martijn Arns, head of the Brainclinics institute in The Netherlands, the first collection of data from sixty-six patients diagnosed with ADHD and sixty-six people in the control group was validated by a separate cohort of twenty-two ADHD patients and twenty-two control subjects, recorded at HUG by the ADHD unit headed by Prof. Nader Perroud, co-author of the study.  In this case, we replicated the results concerning microstate D, but not the those of microstate A , Victor F rat said.Microstate D thus appears to be a replicable brain biomarker for ADHD. Moreover, it seems to be associated with sleep disorder in this population, a key aspect of ADHD. These findings thus reveal a valuable tool for research, diagnosis and even treatment.  This biomarker could be monitored in real-time during brain-training with neurofeedback, for example  Tomas Ros said enthusiastically .Reference: F rat V, Arns M, Deiber MP, et al.

Heart failure is often driven in part by these fibroblast cells, which respond to heart injury and inflammation by chronically overproducing fibrous material that stiffens the heart muscle, impairing heart function a condition called fibrosis. In experiments in mice that model heart failure, the reduction in cardiac fibroblasts caused by the reprogrammed T cells led to a dramatic reversal of fibrosis. Fibrosis underlies many serious disorders, including heart failure, liver disease, and kidney failure, and this technology could turn out to be a scalable and affordable way to address an enormous medical burden,  said senior author Jonathan A. Epstein, MD, chief scientific officer for Penn Medicine and executive vice dean and the William Wikoff Smith Professor of Cardiovascular Research in the Perelman School of Medicine.  But the most notable advancement is the ability to engineer T cells for a specific clinical application without having to take them out of the patient s body. The new technique is based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell technology, which, until now, has required the harvesting of a patient s T cells and their genetic reprogramming in the lab to recognize markers on specific cell types in the body. These specially targeted T cells can then be multiplied using cell culture techniques and re-infused into the patient to attack a specific cell type. The first CAR T cell therapy was developed by researchers from Penn and Children s Hospital of Philadelphia and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for use against certain leukemias   and later approved for lymphoma   that arise from immune cells called B cells.Although CAR T cell technology is currently used primarily for treating cancers, with dramatic results in many otherwise hopeless cases, its developers have long envisioned harnessing the approach for other diseases. Indeed, Epstein and colleagues showed in a 2019 study that the standard CAR T cell approach can be used to attack overactive cardiac fibroblasts and restore heart function in a mouse model of heart failure.However, this standard CAR T cell strategy would be problematic when directed against heart failure or other fibrotic diseases in humans. Fibroblasts have a normal and important function in the body, especially in wound-healing. CAR T cells that are reprogrammed genetically to attack fibroblasts could survive in the body for months or even years, suppressing the fibroblast population and impairing wound-healing for all that time.Therefore, in the new study, Epstein and colleagues devised a technique for a more temporary and controllable, and procedurally much simpler, type of CAR T cell therapy. They designed mRNA that encodes a T-cell receptor targeting activated fibroblasts and encapsulated the mRNA within tiny, bubble-like lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that are themselves covered in molecules that home in on T cells. That technology is also crucial to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines now in use across the globe. Standard CAR T cell technology involves modifying patients  T cells outside the body, which is expensive and difficult to scale for common diseases or for use in less wealthy countries,  said study co-author Drew Weissman, MD, PhD, the Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at Penn.  Making functional CAR T cells inside the body greatly extends the promise of the mRNA/LNP platform. Injected into mice, the encapsulated mRNA molecules are taken up by T cells and act as templates for the production of the fibroblast-targeting receptor, effectively reprogramming the T cells to attack activated fibroblasts. This reprogramming is very temporary, however. The mRNAs are not integrated into T-cell DNA and survive within T cells for only a few days after which the T cells revert to normal and no longer target fibroblasts.The scientists found that, despite this brief duration of activity, injections of the mRNA in mice that model heart failure successfully reprogrammed a large population of mouse T cells, causing a major reduction of heart fibrosis in the animals and a restoration of mostly normal heart size and function with no evidence of continued anti-fibroblast T cell activity one week after treatment.The researchers are continuing to test this mRNA-based, transient CAR T cell technology, with the hope of eventually starting clinical trials.Reference: Rurik JG, Tomb cz I, Yadegari A, et al.

Unfortunately, most teens aren't getting enough sleep. Data from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that 73% of high school students are getting less than the recommended eight to ten hours of sleep each night.Prior research has linked lack of sleep to increased risk for poor mental health, poor academic performance, and behavioral problems. But new research from BYU conducted at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center says insufficient sleep also increases the risk of weight gain and other cardiometabolic diseases among teenagers because teens have worse dietary habits when they sleep less.""Shortened sleep increases the risk for teens to eat more carbs and added sugars and drink more sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are getting a healthy amount of sleep,"" said Dr. Kara Duraccio, BYU clinical and developmental psychology professor and lead author of the study.This research, which was recently published in the medical journal SLEEP, analyzed the sleeping and eating patterns of 93 teenagers during two sleep conditions: spending six and a half hours each night in bed for one week (short sleep) and spending nine and a half hours each night in bed for another week (healthy sleep). Researchers measured the caloric intake, macronutrient content, food types, and the glycemic load of foods eaten by teens. The results found that teenagers undergoing short sleep consumed more foods that were likely to spike blood sugar fast   things like foods high in carbs and added sugar, or sugary drinks, compared to when they were in healthy sleep. These changes largely occurred in the late evening (after 9:00 pm). Teens getting short sleep also ate fewer fruits and vegetables across the entire day, compared to healthy sleep. ""What's interesting is that getting less sleep didn't cause teens to eat more than their peers getting healthy sleep; both groups consumed roughly the same amounts of calories of food. But getting less sleep caused teens to eat more junk,"" said Duraccio. ""We suspect that tired teens are looking for quick bursts of energy to keep them going until they can go to bed, so they're seeking out foods that are high in carbs and added sugars."" The research found that teens in short sleep consumed 12 extra grams of sugar each day. With most teenagers not getting sufficient sleep during the 180 nights of a school year, an extra 12 grams of added sugar each day could result in over 4.5 pounds of extra sugar each year. ""We know that pediatric obesity is an epidemic, and we've focused on a lot of interventions to try and address it, but sleep is not one of the things that researchers tend to focus on,"" said Duraccio. ""If we are really trying to discover preventative strategies or interventions to increase optimal weight in teens, getting enough and well-timed sleep should be at the forefront of our efforts."" Duraccio admits that it's difficult for teenagers to maintain a healthy sleeping schedule; teens are busy with rigorous academic schedules and a slew of extracurricular activities. Compound this with early start times for school and the result is short and ill-timed sleeping patterns that become a habit. ""It's human nature to think that when we have a long to-do list, sleep should be the first thing to go or the easiest thing to cut out,"" she said. ""We don't recognize that getting enough sleep helps you accomplish your to-do list better. Sleep health should be incorporated into all prevention and intervention modules for child obesity.""

On this basis, many virologists would question the release of genetically modified viruses that retain the capacity to spread between individual vertebrate hosts. Researchers from Germany, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States now point out in a policy piece that despite these concerns, self-spreading vaccines for animals are being researched in Europe and the US. They are intended to limit the spread of animal diseases or disease spillover to humans.Non-spreading lab-modified viral vaccines are already in use today, for example as vaccines for wild animals against rabies or for humans against polio. However, in all modified virus applications to date, rigorous efforts have been made to eliminate (or, if this is not possible, minimize) the capacity of viruses to spread in the environment between host individuals.The molecular tools necessary to generate viral vaccines that retain their capacity to be self-spreading have existed for some time. In 2000, researchers demonstrated the transmission of a self-spreading rabbit vaccine in a field trial on a Spanish island. However, the European Medicines Agency declined to grant marketing approval for the vaccine. ""No new technologies are needed to produce self-spreading vaccines; they can be developed using methods that already exist today,"" says Filippa Lentzos of King's College London. In Spain scientists are currently vaccinating pigs with self-spreading viruses (that have not been modified in a laboratory) against African swine fever as part of contained experiments. In the U.S., a four-year research project has just ended that sought to mathematically identify strategies for deploying self-spreading vaccines. The U.S. Department of Defense's research agency, DARPA, is also funding experimentation to determine if lab-modified self-spreading animal vaccines can prevent the spillover of pathogens to U.S. military personnel in areas where they operate. If, as is argued, self-spreading vaccines are potentially transformational in a wide array of agricultural, medical and conservation uses, then developers and funders should commit to address needs within their own borders, rather than continue to propose equatorial nations for field testing.  says Guy Reeves of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl n, Germany.  This will maximise the chances of a robust debate among fellow citizens and nations about the wisdom of self-spreading viral approaches in the environment. In this respect the EU funded project to address a serious pig disease within its own territories could be viewed as a step in this direction.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/record-setting-isotope-created-357294,Record Setting Isotope Created The lightest isotope of magnesium to date has been created  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.In collaboration with an international team of researchers, Michigan State University has helped create the world s lightest version, or isotope, of magnesium to date.Forged at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at MSU, or NSCL, this isotope is so unstable, it falls apart before scientists can measure it directly. Yet this isotope that isn t keen on existing can help researchers better understand how the atoms that define our existence are made.Led by researchers from Peking University in China, the team included scientists from Washington University in St. Louis, MSU and other institutions. One of the big questions I m interested in is where do the universe s elements come from,  said Kyle Brown, an assistant professor of chemistry at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, or FRIB. Brown was one of the leaders of the new study, published online Dec. 22 by the journal Physical Review Letters. How are these elements made? How do these processes happen?  asked Brown.The new isotope won t answer those questions by itself, but it can help refine the theories and models scientists develop to account for such mysteries.Earth is full of natural magnesium, forged long ago in the stars, that has since become a key component of our diets and minerals in the planet s crust. But this magnesium is stable. Its atomic core, or nucleus, doesn t fall apart.The new magnesium isotope, however, is far too unstable to be found in nature. But by using particle accelerators to make increasingly exotic isotopes like this one, scientists can push the limits of models that help explain how all nuclei are built and stay together.This, in turn, helps predict what happens in extreme cosmic environments that we may never be able to directly mimic on or measure from Earth. By testing these models and making them better and better, we can extrapolate out to how things work where we can t measure them,  Brown said.  We re measuring the things we can measure to predict the things we can t. NSCL has been helping scientists worldwide further humanity s understanding of the universe since 1982. FRIB will continue that tradition when experiments begin in 2022. FRIB is a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, or DOE-SC, user facility, supporting the mission of the DOE-SC Office of Nuclear Physics. FRIB is going to measure a lot of things we haven t been able to measure in the past,  Brown said.  We actually have an approved experiment set to run at FRIB. And, we should be able to create another nucleus that hasn t been made before. Heading into that future experiment, Brown has been involved with four different projects that have made new isotopes. That includes the newest, which is known as magnesium-18.All magnesium atoms have 12 protons inside their nuclei. Previously, the lightest version of magnesium had 7 neutrons, giving it a total of 19 protons and neutrons   hence its designation as magnesium-19.To make magnesium-18, which is lighter by one neutron, the team started with a stable version of magnesium, magnesium-24. The cyclotron at NSCL accelerated a beam of magnesium-24 nuclei to about half the speed of light and sent that beam barreling into a target, which is a metal foil made from the element beryllium. And that was just the first step. That collision gives you a bunch of different isotopes lighter than magnesium-24,  Brown said.  But from that soup, we can select out the isotope we want. In this case, that isotope is magnesium-20. This version is unstable, meaning it decays, usually within tenths of a second. So the team is on a clock to get that magnesium-20 to collide with another beryllium target about 30 meters, or 100 feet, away. But it s traveling at half the speed of light,  Brown said.  It gets there pretty quickly. It s that next collision that creates magnesium-18, which has a lifetime somewhere in the ballpark of a sextillionth of a second. That s such a short time that magnesium-18 doesn t cloak itself with electrons to become a full-fledged atom before falling apart. It exists only as a naked nucleus.In fact, it s such a short time that magnesium-18 never leaves the beryllium target. The new isotope decays inside the target.This means scientists can t examine the isotope directly, but they can characterize tell-tale signs of its decay. Magnesium-18 first ejects two protons from its nucleus to become neon-16, which then ejects two more protons to become oxygen-14. By analyzing the protons and oxygen that do escape the target, the team can deduce properties of magnesium-18. This was a team effort. Everyone worked really hard on this project,  Brown said.  It s pretty exciting. It s not every day people discover a new isotope. That said, scientists are adding new entries every year to the list of known isotopes, which number in the thousands. We re adding drops to a bucket, but they re important drops,  Brown said.  We can put our names on this one, the whole team can. And I can tell my parents that I helped discover this nucleus that nobody else has seen before. Reference: Jin Y, Niu CY, Brown KW, et al. First observation of the four-proton unbound nucleus 18Mg.

The study, presented January 6 in the journal Cell, could help scientists better understand the association between genes and phenotypical traits in humans. People may wonder why our team is working on fingerprints,  says Sijia Wang, a geneticist at the Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and co-senior author on the paper.  We started the work purely out of curiosity. But later it turns out fingerprint pattern is associated with genes for limb growth, which are critical for fetal development. This provides another classic example of pleiotropy, when multiple phenotypes are interrelated to each other and are affected by the same genes. While fingerprints are unique to individuals, they are generally categorized into three types: arch, loop, and whorl. These furrows and ridges begin to form on a fetus  fingers and toes after the third month of pregnancy. Scientists have suspected that fingerprints have potentially evolved to help grab objects and sense their textures, but exactly how these patterns are formed remains unknown.Wang and colleagues scanned the DNA of more than 23,000 people across ethnic groups and found that at least 43 regions on the genome are associated with fingerprint patterns. One of the most influential regions appeared to be regulating the expression of a gene called EVI1, which is known for its role in embryonic limb development.To test their finding, the team modified the DNA of mice so their expression of EVI1 was turned down. They found that mice with downregulated EVI1 developed abnormal skin patterns on their  digits compared with wild-type mice.Analysis of human data revealed that fingerprint patterns are genetically correlated with finger length. For example, people with whorl-shaped fingerprints on both of their little fingers tend to have longer little fingers than those who do not, and this correlation is strongly linked to genes involved ini limb development. We don t know exactly how the genes shape fingerprint patterns, but it could be determined by the amount of strength from growth that s put on an embryonic tissue called volar pads that plays an important role in the formation of different patterns of fingerprint,  says Jinxi Li, a geneticist at the Human Phenome Institute at Fudan University in Shanghai, and a co-first author on the paper. She explains that as a fetus  hands grow, the palms and fingers would stretch and elongate. These forces could turn a whorl into a loop, for example.  Notably, previous research has suggested that EVI1 is linked to risk of leukemia, and some studies have observed that people with more whorl patterns are more susceptible to the disease,  Wang says. Many congenital genetic disorders are related to different dermatoglyphic patterns, such as fingerprints,  he says. For example, children with Down s syndrome are more likely to have a single crease running across the palm of their hands.  Our study suggests that dermatoglyphic patterns are affected by crucial development genes, which provides a strong theoretical basis for this kind of pleiotropy. The research is part of the International Human Phenome Project led by Fudan University in Shanghai that aims to map how the human phenotypical traits are correlated with each other. Next, the team plans to conduct more research on how dermatoglyphic patterns are related to diseases and the underlying pleiotropic mechanism.Reference: Li J, Glover JD, Zhang H, et al.

Moving toward net-zero carbon emissions means dealing with the intermittent, unpredictable nature of green power sources such as wind and solar and also overcoming supply and demand mismatches, said OSU s Nick AuYeung, who led the study along with Ph.D. student Fuqiong Lei. Those challenges, AuYeung notes, necessitate energy storage through means beyond pumped hydro plants, which feature a turbine between two water reservoirs of different elevations, and huge lithium-ion batteries. The computer modeling study spearheaded by AuYeung, associate professor of chemical engineering, and Lei found that one of those additional energy storage technologies, compressed air, could be improved via chemical reactions. The reversible reactions can absorb energy in the form of heat and subsequently conserve energy that would otherwise be lost. Findings, published in Energy Conversion and Management, are also applicable to a related technology, liquid air energy storage, AuYeung said. As their names suggest, the liquid and compressed air techniques harness energy that can be accessed when needed by allowing stored air   either pressurized or cooled to a liquid form   to expand and pass through electricity-generating turbines. However, both CAES, as compressed air energy storage is typically expressed, and LAES (liquid air) score somewhat poorly in a category known as round-trip efficiency, AuYeung explains. With either, only about half the energy put in can be pulled out   think of it as making a bank deposit of $1,000 but, due to various charges, only about $500 is available for withdrawal.  An advantage of CAES is that it allows energy to be stored at large scales, which is a hurdle for electrochemical battery technologies,  he said.  But a major challenge for traditional CAES is reaching high round-trip efficiency.  In a conventional CAES process, electricity is used to compress air, and the compressed air is stored below ground in a cavern or in a pressure vessel, AuYeung said. When the air is compressed, its temperature rises, but that heat is typically regarded as waste and thus goes unrecovered and unused.  To discharge the air to produce power, it s usually heated with natural gas to increase the turbine feed s enthalpy, the total system energy,  he said.  Factoring in heat lost during storage, the result is that the overall round-trip efficiency   the ratio of turbine output work to work consumed through compression   is only between 40% and 50%.  AuYeung and collaborators at OSU, Mississippi State University and Michigan State University came up with a storage scheme to improve that efficiency   thermochemically recovering lost heat   and developed a mathematical model for its design and operation. An advantage of thermochemical energy storage, or TCES, over other methods is a higher energy density made possible by capturing heat in the form of chemical bonds, he said. Using their model, the researchers analyzed the performance of TCES incorporated into thermal energy storage via  packed beds    vessels filled with some kind of solid packing medium, where energy reaches the solid by means of a heat transfer fluid such as air. The filler material is typically alumina, ceramic or crushed rock. Packed beds are classified as  sensible  storage because energy is harnessed by virtue of the filler material changing temperature.  We looked at TCES with packed beds filled with rocks and barium oxides,  AuYeung said.  Our results showed a similar round-trip efficiency between beds with TCES and beds without because of the relatively low heat capacity and heat of reaction for the barium oxides. We got to 60% round-trip efficiency for both systems with a 20-hour storage time after charge. Other means of thermal storage cannot store the heat for long periods of time since they cool down. Importantly, he noted, with TCES material placed atop the packed beds, there was a more stable turbine air inlet temperature   higher for longer   which is a key to optimal power generation and thus desirable to utilities. In addition, AuYeung said the model shows that with future advanced materials, round-trip efficiency and storage time could improve as well. To better illustrate the potential of the concept, we came up with a hypothetical material with the same heat capacity as rocks but a thermochemical storage capacity three times that of barium oxides, and we looked at that hypothetical material in our model,  he said.  Results showed that a potential round-trip efficiency improvement of more than 5% can be obtained, as well as longer storage durations. Also, 45% less filler volume would be needed to achieve storage capacity similar to rock-filled beds.  AuYeung said the barium chemistry the initial model was based on was the most obvious that came to mind for the researchers  but has a downside because its heat capacity is fairly low.   There are non-oxygen chemistries such as hydrates and carbonates that have the hypothetical properties   high heat capacity, high heat of reaction   we looked at, but right now we haven t identified one for a redox material that operates on oxygen swing,  he said.  A next step perhaps for us, or for others with more materials expertise, would be to try to discover new materials. Reference Lei F, Korba D, Huang W, Randhir K, Li L, AuYeung N.

To address the knowledge gaps, a collaborative team of Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Tohoku University investigated electron transport through a single water molecule in a C60 cage. Their findings are published in Nano Letters.Simple systems are often the best starting point for determining complex information. A single water molecule is one such system. Made up of just three atoms, it provides an excellent model for establishing quantum mechanical information.Introducing a water molecule into a C60 cage a soccer ball-shaped molecule made entirely of carbon atoms gives H2O@C60 and is an excellent way of isolating water for investigation. The researchers achieved this using  molecular surgery , which involves opening the cage, injecting water, and closing the cage again.H2O@C60 was then used as a single molecule transistor (SMT) by mounting one H2O@C60 molecule in the very small gap less than 1 nm between two gold electrodes. Because the electric current then passes through the isolated molecule only, the electron transport can be studied with high specificity.A conductance map, also known as a  Coulomb stability diagram , was generated for the H2O@C60 SMT. It showed multiple tunneling-induced excited states for the water molecule. In contrast, the Coulomb stability diagram of an empty C60 cage SMT showed only two excited states. Because it contains two hydrogen atoms, water has two different nuclear spin states: ortho- and para-water. In ortho-water the hydrogen nuclear spins are in the same direction, while in para-water they are opposite to one another,  explains study lead author Shaoqing Du.  Understanding the transition between these two types of water is an important area of research. The researchers measured tunneling spectra for the H2O@C60 system and, by comparing the findings with theoretical calculations, were able to attribute the measured conductance peaks to rotational and vibrational excitations of the water molecule. They also investigated H2O@C60 using terahertz spectroscopy and the results agreed with the tunneling spectroscopy data.Both techniques showed quantum rotational excitations of ortho- and para-water simultaneously. This demonstrates that the single water molecule transitioned between the two nuclear isomers (ortho- and para-water) within the timeframe of the experiment, which was approximately one minute. Our findings make an important contribution to the understanding of ortho-para fluctuation in water molecules,  says study corresponding author Kazuhiko Hirakawa.  Because water plays such an important role in chemistry and biology, and even in understanding our universe, we expect our findings to have a wide-ranging impact.

The research was based on the dissertation work of the study s first author Prajakta Masurkar. Dementia is a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory, reasoning or other thinking skills. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60% 80% of cases. ChEI drugs, including donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, increase communication between nerve cells to enhance cognition.   The study found that the risk of overactive bladder varies across individual ChEIs, reports Rajender R. Aparasu, Mustafa and Sanober Lokhandwala Endowed Professor of Pharmacy and chair, Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy.  Using a national cohort of older adults with dementia, we also found that donepezil was associated with a 13% increased risk of OAB compared to rivastigmine, whereas there was no differential risk of OAB with galantamine and rivastigmine.  Using Medicare data, the study examined 524,975 adults (aged 65 and older) with dementia who were users of ChEIs (donepezil 80.72%, rivastigmine 16.41%, galantamine 2.87%). The primary outcome of interest was OAB diagnosis or prescription of antimuscarinics, drugs which help correct overactive bladder, within six months of ChEI initiation. While some studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of all ChEIs and antimuscarinic use, few studies have been conducted regarding the effects of individual ChEIs on the risk of OAB. Previous studies have found that the use of ChEIs is associated with an increased risk of receiving an antimuscarinic drug.This study opens a new door.  The findings suggest the need to understand and manage medication-related morbidity in older adults with dementia,  said Aparasu.

The seventh cholera pandemic began in 1961 and is still active. Unlike previous pandemics, it is caused by cholera strains of a slightly different type. How did the modified cholera strains develop and spread, and what might have contributed to their success? Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl n, Germany, and CAU Kiel, in an international team with colleagues from City College New York and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, have now gained new insights into a molecular mechanism that provides insight into the interactions between cholera bacteria and may have played a role in the emergence of the seventh pandemic.In their natural environment, bacteria are subject to competition with other bacteria for space and nutrients. In this process, molecular mechanisms help them to hold their own. One such mechanism is the so-called ""type 6 secretion system"" (T6SS), with which a bacterium transports toxic proteins into a neighboring bacterium and thereby kills it. Thus, cholera bacteria of the seventh pandemic use their T6SS to keep other bacteria in check and presumably more easily cause infection.Researchers now had the special opportunity to study the T6SS of cholera bacteria from previous pandemics. For this purpose, among other things, the T6SS genome sequence of cholera bacteria from the 2nd pandemic was reconstructed from a museum specimen from the 19th century in a complex procedure and recreated in the laboratory. In the process, the scientists were able to show that 2nd and 6th pandemic cholera bacteria lack a functional T6SS. As a result, the bacteria of earlier pandemics not only lack the ability to attack other bacteria, they are themselves killed by bacterial strains of the seventh pandemic. This may have been one of the reasons that older cholera strains were displaced by modified cholera strains of the seventh pandemic and are now hard to find.Daniel Unterweger, one of the study's authors and a group leader at the Max Planck Institute in Pl n, Germany, says: ""With these findings, we support the theory that microbial competition between bacteria is very important for understanding pathogens and bacterial pandemics. Our research on the cholera bacterium was made possible by an S2 laboratory newly established at the institute.

The results of this study, reported in the journal Cell, indicate that traditional dosing regimens of COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States do not produce antibodies capable of recognizing and neutralizing the Omicron variant.In late November, health officials in South Africa reported that a previously unknown variant of SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly spreading throughout the country. The variant, given the name Omicron by the World Health Organization, would soon prove to be far more transmissible than Delta, the variant that previously had caused the majority of COVID-19 infections.  People desperately wanted to know whether current vaccines protect against Omicron,  says the senior author of the Cell paper, Alejandro Balazs, PhD, whose laboratory at the Ragon Institute investigates how to engineer immunity against infectious diseases.To find answers, Balazs collaborated with a team that included the lead author of the Cell paper, Wilfredo F. Garcia-Beltran, MD, a clinical pathology resident at MGH and a clinician-scientist fellow at the Ragon Institute. The first step was to construct a harmless version of Omicron known as a  pseudovirus  that could be used in the laboratory to evaluate the effectiveness of the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States, which include the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna injections and the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The pseudovirus that Balazs and colleagues created mimicked the behavior of Omicron, which has 34 mutations on its  spike  protein that are not found on the original strain of SARS-Cov-2 first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Scientists believe that these mutations may be partially responsible for Omicron s rapid spread throughout the world.Next, Garcia-Beltran worked with colleagues at MGH, including hematology-oncology fellow Vivek Naranbhai, MD, PhD, to acquire blood samples from 239 individuals who had been fully vaccinated with one of the three COVID-19 vaccines. The study subjects included employees within the Massachusetts General Brigham healthcare system and residents of Chelsea, Massachusetts, a community with a high rate of COVID-19 infections.  It was important to us to have a diverse population represented in the study,  says Garcia-Beltran. Included in this group were 70 men and women who had received a third booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, according to recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The blood samples were used to measure how effectively each vaccine induces production of protective immunity in the form of antibodies against the Omicron pseudovirus, as well as the Delta and wild type viruses. The results were striking.  We detected very little neutralization of the Omicron variant pseudovirus when we used samples taken from people who were recently vaccinated with two doses of mRNA vaccine or one dose of Johnson & Johnson,  says Balazs.  But individuals who received three doses of mRNA vaccine had very significant neutralization against the Omicron variant. It s not yet clear why an mRNA booster dramatically improves immune protection against Omicron, but Garcia-Beltran says one possibility is that an additional dose creates antibodies that bind more tightly to the spike protein, increasing their effectiveness. Also, a booster dose may generate antibodies that target regions of the spike protein that are common to all forms of SARS-CoV-2. Both theories may be true, says Garcia-Beltran.Balazs notes that the three-dose mRNA vaccine regimen that is, the traditional two doses and a booster of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines provides somewhat lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron than it does against the COVID-19 wild type strain or Delta variant. But the study s results strongly support the CDC s advice that COVID-19 booster shots are appropriate for anyone 16 and older, and that mRNA vaccines are preferred.Reference: Garcia-Beltran WF, St. Denis KJ, Hoelzemer A, et al. mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine boosters induce neutralizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.

We have two independent papers using completely different methods coming to the exact same conclusions,  says Texas Biomed Professor Tim Anderson, PhD, senior author of one of the papers.  Because the papers are being published back-to-back, I think they will be taken very seriously. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease, caused by tiny flatworms called schistosomes. More than 200 million people across a large part of the globe are infected, and thousands die each year. Praziquantel is the only approved drug to treat schistosomiasis, and more than 250 million doses are distributed each year as part of an international campaign to try to eliminate the disease. However, about 30% of people are still infected after treatment. We have one drug to treat this huge population of parasites, and it works, but it is not perfect,  says Winka Le Clec h, PhD, a staff scientist at Texas Biomed and first author.  We didn t know how it was working, what is the precise mechanism of action. Now, for the first time we have a better idea about the target of praziquantel. The drug binds to a specific type of channel in the cell membrane, called a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel. When the channel is open, there is a massive influx of calcium ions into the cells, which results in worm paralysis and death.Anderson s team has spent the last five years determining that this channel is the main way the drug interacts with the worms. They use a combination of classic parasitology   by maintaining the full, complicated life cycle of schistosomes in their lab   and state-of-the-art molecular tools, genetic analyses, and bioinformatics.Specifically, they identified hundreds of individual worms that showed resistance to the drug, versus those that were susceptible and died. Le Clec h wanted an unbiased way to measure those that were alive after exposure to praziquantel, versus those that were indeed dead, and not just resting when visually observed. She measured lactate production, which indicates active respiration, and separated the worms into their two distinct groups.By taking this approach they were able to more accurately quantify how much more resistant the worms that survived were:  They were over 377 times more resistant than the worms that died,  says Fr d ric Chevalier, PhD, a staff scientist at Texas Biomed and co-first paper author.  For a long time, people believed resistance was only 5-fold more. By sorting out the worms into pure populations, we were able to show resistance is a much more dramatic trait. To find a genetic driver behind this resistance, they ran a genome-wide association study to find if there were any sections of the worm s genetic code that differed wildly between the two groups. The largest difference was in the gene that codes for the TRP channel. It was not just any TRP channel, it was the exact same TRP channel that our collaborator, Jonathan Marchant, identified using a completely different approach,  Le Clec h says.  That was beautiful. Jonathan Marchant, PhD, a Professor at the Medical School of Wisconsin had been investigating schistosome TRP channels in cells. His group s paper, written with scientists from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, the company involved in the discovery of praziquantel, clarifies how the drug physically binds to this particular TRP channel. Our work identified specific mutations in the TRP channel that can result in a loss of sensitivity to praziquantel. Together with the genetic analysis conducted at Texas Biomed we now have a clear idea how this important drug works   and what mutations may cause drug resistance,  Marchant says.The two labs were working independently and only learned of each other s investigations at a molecular parasitology conference in 2017. They quickly teamed up, realizing how their different approaches complimented and reinforced one another.There is still much to learn to fully understand schistosomiasis drug resistance. The Texas Biomed team is working with collaborators in  hot spot  regions with a high rate of transmission and treatment failure, to see if the worms carry genetic variants in this TRP channel that confer resistance, or if there are other factors at play. This really sets the stage for large-scale screens of natural populations of schistosomes to see if we do have a problem with drug resistance,  Anderson says.  Research on TRP channels of mammals won the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 2021. That these channels are also involved in mode of action of a critically important antiparasitic drug is extremely exciting. Reference: Clec h WL, Chevalier FD, Mattos ACA, et al.

Both caused by parasitic worms, this particular drug, AWZ1066S, has been designed to target Wolbachia, a bacterial symbiont which is essential to the worm s survival, rather than the worm itself.Originally developed through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) supported A WOL consortium, the current work is a partnership between LSTM, the Department of Chemistry of the University of Liverpool (UoL) and Eisai Co. Ltd. and funded by a grant from the Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund.AWZ1066S was administered to the first participant enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial being held at the NIHR Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Clinical Research Facility, based at Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust on December 21. This first in human trial comes following the completion of pre-clinical safety tests and will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the drug.LSTM s Deputy Director and project lead, Professor Steve Ward, said:  This has been an extremely exciting and productive partnership and it is gratifying seeing the first drug candidate specifically designed for LF and onchocerciasis getting to this stage following a rigorous pre-clinical evaluation.Professor Mark Taylor, Director of the A WOL consortium, commented  Our approach of killing the parasitic worm by targeting the essential bacteria within the worm is unique and one that offers many advantages over drugs that target worms directly and has the possibility of reducing the timeframe of elimination from decades to years, AWZ1066 has real potential to be a game changer.  The drug candidate, AWZ1066S, also has the potential to be used in the whole population, including children and pregnant women, providing a unique opportunity to make a large contribution to communities affected by these diseases.This novel drug candidate was developed from a screening campaign followed by several rounds of chemistry optimisation at the University s Department of Chemistry. UoL s Professor Paul O Neill said: (link is external)(opens in a new tab) Our multi-parameter chemical optimisation approach has delivered a molecule with high potency and specificity against the target pathogen along with the desired oral exposures and preclinical safety profile. We are all excited to see this novel synthetic molecule enter human trials. With the direct involvement of Eisai Co. Ltd., the partnership has been able to accelerate the speed at which the drug candidate has moved effectively through the development pipeline.  The result of this is that the candidate is now ready to enter a first in human trial.The GHIT Fund facilitates and funds global partnerships for the discovery and development of new health technologies, including drugs, vaccines and diagnostics, for infectious and neglected tropical diseases prevalent in developing countries.In addition to Eisai support and GHIT funding, the development and preclinical evaluation of 1066 also was supported by the UK MRC DPFS Scheme.

James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC   James).For this study, researchers enrolled 90 women diagnosed with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer to determine whether the drug pembrolizumab (marketed as Keytruda) could be used to effectively treat this subset of patients with MMR deficient (dMMR) or MSI-high tumors. The study included patients treated at 38 hospitals in 15 countries.Pembrolizumab is a cancer immunotherapy that works by inhibiting certain cellular receptors that prevents the immune system from recognizing and destroying cancer cells. The FDA has approved the drug for treating several other cancers, including melanoma, lung, head/neck, cervical and stomach cancer.In this study, researchers showed that 48% of advanced endometrial cancer patients experienced a complete or partial response. Two thirds of these patients also had a response that lasted more than three years. Additionally, two thirds of all patients in the study had a clinical response. This trial is the longest follow-up reported to date, with a median follow up of 42.6 months. These findings suggest a long-term benefit to patients. Even the potential for curative intent is now possible in patients with recurrent or metastatic uterine cancer,  said Dr. David O Malley, lead author of the study and a gynecologic oncologist at the OSUCCC   James.Clinical trials to evaluate if pembrolizumab for the treatment of earlier stage disease are currently underway.The international research team reports its findings online first Jan. 6, 2022, in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.Endometrial cancer is the second most common form of cancer in women worldwide, and incidence rates have been increasing. While platinum-based chemotherapy regimens can be effective, many patients experience a recurrence. Effective second-line therapies for recurrent or metastatic disease are limited, resulting in a 17% five-year survival rate for women with advanced or recurrent disease.Previous research suggests that up to 31% of patients with endometrial cancer have DNA structure changes known as microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). In group of patients (approximately 2%) these are inherited mutations (passed down through families, clinically known as Lynch syndrome) in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Dr. O Malley notes that the mutation is usually present in the tumor and not a genetic mutation. By targeting this damaged pathway with this targeted drug, we can reset the cellular mechanisms and allow the immune system to reactivate and attack the cancer cells,  said Dr. O Malley.Prior to the data from this study, there was no accepted standard-of-care second-line therapy for endometrial cancer patients with MSI-H/dMMR-positive tumors; however, researchers note that the overall response rate for this study is very strong when compared to the 10-15% expected response rate resulting from other chemotherapy agents that are most often used as second-line therapy.Reference: O Malley DM, Bariani GM, Cassier PA, et al.

The researchers tested four top-rated anti-fogging sprays and five top-rated anti-fogging cloths sold on Amazon. They found all nine products contained fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and fluorotelomer ethoxylates (FTEOs), two types of PFAS that largely have flown under the scientific radar until now. Exposure to some PFAS, particularly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), is associated with impaired immune function, cancer, thyroid disease, and other health disorders. Mothers and young children may be especially vulnerable to the chemicals, which can affect reproductive and developmental health.  Our tests show the sprays contain up to 20.7 milligrams of PFAS per milliliter of solution, which is a pretty high concentration,  said Nicholas Herkert, a postdoctoral researcher at Duke s Nicholas School of the Environment, who led the study. Because FTOHs and FTEOs have received relatively little study, scientists don t yet know what health risks they might pose, Herkert noted, but research suggests that once FTOHs have been inhaled or absorbed through the skin, they could break down in the body to PFOA or other long-lived PFAS substances that are known to be toxic. Additionally, the FTEOs used in all four spray mixtures that were analyzed in the new study exhibited significant cell-altering cytotoxicity and adipogenic activity in lab tests, he said.  If we were to assume that FTOHs and FTEOs have similar toxicity to PFOA and PFOS, then one spray from these bottles would expose you to PFAS at levels that are several orders of magnitude higher than you d receive from drinking a liter of water that contains PFAS at the current EPA health advisory limit for safe consumption, which is 70 nanograms per liter,  Herkert said.  It s disturbing to think that products people have been using on a daily basis to help keep themselves safe during the COVID pandemic may be exposing them to a different risk,  said Heather Stapleton, the Ronie-Richele Garcia-Jones Distinguished Professor of environmental chemistry and health at Duke, who initiated the study after reviewing the ingredient label on a bottle of anti-fogging spray she purchased for her 9-year-old daughter.  Ironically, it was advertised as safe and nontoxic,  Stapleton said.  It said to spray it on your glasses and use your fingers to rub it around.  None of the other eight products tested even listed their ingredients, she added, making it next to impossible to tell if they contained potentially harmful chemicals until they were analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry in her research laboratory. The researchers published their peer-reviewed study Jan. 5 in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Because their study is only the second ever to focus on FTEOs and had a small sample size, more research will be needed to flesh out these initial findings, they said. Larger studies involving in vivo as well as in vitro testing are the logical next step.  FTOHs and FTEOs could be metabolic disrupters, but the only way to tell is through in vivo testing on whole organisms. We only did in vitro testing,  Herkert explained. Studies with larger sample sizes might also identify other undisclosed chemicals that are being used in the sprays or cloths.  Because of COVID, more people than ever including many medical professionals and other first-responders are using these sprays and cloths to keep their glasses from fogging up when they wear masks or face shields,  Stapleton said.  They deserve to know what s in the products they re using. Reference Herkert NJ et al.

While it almost sounds like a Dr. Seuss book, it was an actual experiment to explore animal behavior.Are animal's innate navigational abilities universal or are they restricted to their home environments? Taking the premise to the extreme, the researchers designed a set of wheels under a goldfish tank with a camera system to record and translate the fish's movements into forward and back and side to side directions to the wheels. By doing so, they discovered that a goldfish's navigational ability supersedes its watery environs.Their findings were published last month in the peer-reviewed journal Behavioural Brain Research.The researchers tested whether the fish was really navigating by placing a clearly visible target on the wall opposite the tank. After a few days of training, the fish navigated to the target. Moreover, they were able to do so even if they were interrupted in the middle by hitting a wall and they were not fooled by false targets placed by the researchers.The study led the researchers to two conclusions.""The study hints that navigational ability is universal rather than specific to the environment.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-brain-networks-enabling-human-conversation-357269,The Brain Networks Enabling Human Conversation A new study has identified a brain circuit that is active while we plan our spoken replies during conversation ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new study has identified a brain circuit that is active while we plan our spoken replies during conversation.Published online January 5 in the journal Nature, the study focused on brain computations that enable such replies, which are planned before the end of a conversation partner s turn and uttered within a fraction of a second.  Led by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Iowa, the study found that distinct brain areas are active during speech planning for split-second verbal exchanges, including regions not previously linked to this function. Our study pinpoints brain networks behind the planning that makes this back and forth possible, which have been elusive until now,  says senior author Michael Long, PhD, the Thomas and Suzanne Murphy Professor of Neuroscience and Physiology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.He adds that  the work promises to guide the design of new therapies for the 7.5 million Americans who have trouble using their voices, including those with apraxia, trouble planning speech movements, and aphasia, difficulty processing language, which can accompany conditions like autism or result from trauma caused by a stroke.  For years, researchers tried to link speech functions to brain circuits using electroencephalograms or EEG, which places electrodes on the scalp. Such devices measure quick swings in electrical signals seen as large groups of nerve cells  fire  to transmit electrical signals. But EEG could not pinpoint the location of nerve circuits with enough resolution, and functional magnetic resonance - another commonly used technology - was not fast enough to capture activity patterns related to the conversational planning of replies, say the study authors. These non-invasive methods leave a critical blind spot in the field s ability to track what the brain does during everyday conversation, say the authors.Another technology, electrocorticography (ECoG), overcomes these barriers by placing electrodes not on the scalp, but directly on surface of the brain. Fast, precise ECoG measurements revealed that the brain achieves natural conversation by combining perception of what is heard, the planning of a reply, and production of the sounds (articulation) that make up words. While other ECoG studies have determined the networks related to perception and production, the current study is the first to capture brain activity during the reply planning phase between them, which has been the hardest to study, say the authors. Researchers can talk to patients and watch the activity of brain circuits as they talk or listen, but planning has no physical correlate,  says Long.  When we combined ECoG measures with a technique that asks patients structured questions, we exposed an underlying planning network. To conduct the study, the research team placed electrodes on the brain surfaces of patients during surgeries that were underway to remove either a tumor or brain tissue causing epileptic seizures. In both cases, surgeons place patients under only local anesthesia initially so they can determine the brain regions that are active as patients talk, thus averting damage to the patient s speech centers.Researchers placed arrays of ECoG electrodes on the language-dominant left brain hemispheres of eight patient volunteers. Next, they measured planning responses using a paradigm developed by another lab called a critical information (CI) task, which was designed to control the timing of planning. In each block of questions, a changing keyword, the CI, determines the when reply planning starts so brain activity can be tracked in that time windowBy changing each question s wording to present earlier or later key information needed to start the planning of an answer   the researchers were able to distinguish brain activity related to planning from perception and production. Importantly, the majority of cortical responses were related to only one of these three speech processes, showing that the networks were largely separate for each function.In addition, the researchers found that 95.5 percent of planning electrodes were clustered in a spatially distinct region of the brain, with most planning electrodes centered in caudal inferior frontal gyrus (cIFG) and the caudal middle frontal gyrus (cMFG). While cIFG, commonly known as  Broca s region,  has long been known to be important for language, a role for cMFG had not been previously been established.Furthermore, the team found that the planning network identified with the CI task is also active when patients are preparing to speak during natural, unscripted conversations. After patients finished answering the structured questions, researchers engaged them in several minutes of casual back-and-forth conversation, during which the same patterns related to perception, planning and speaking appeared in the patient s brain activity. This study provides a first description of the specific brain mechanisms that generate language as we speak in natural, every day contexts,  says Gregg Castellucci, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Long s lab.  Crucially, the brain mapping we found using simple, controlled tasks held up in tests of natural human behavior,  he added.Reference: Castellucci GA, Kovach CK, Howard MA, Greenlee JDW, Long MA.

The connections between nerve cells change when we learn or forget. But our brain s computations change even faster than its structure: in a heartbeat, we shift our focus from what we see to what we hear or smell. The coffee aroma might have been there all the time, but as we attend to it, circuits in our brain shift their activity rhythms and we actively perceive the aroma. A transdisciplinary research team at the G ttingen Campus has now combined experimental and mathematical approaches and found a new perspective on the rhythmic processes in the brain. The results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS). Scientists at the G ttingen Campus Institute for Dynamics of Biological Networks (CIDBN) have investigated the cellular mechanisms behind these processes. Cells that are involved in brain functions such as the processing of sensory information, as well as in the consolidation of memory, exhibit collective rhythmic activity. ""Typically, nerve cells are studied using artificial stimuli, such as brief pulses or oscillations,"" explains Dr Andreas Neef, head of the Laboratory for Neurophysics at the CIDBN. ""But we wanted to study these cells using more natural, irregular stimuli.""Previous research that characterised cells using conventional methods seemed to paint a straightforward picture: some nerve cell types are specialised to participate in fast activity rhythms, while another cell type   the  adapting interneuron    participates mainly in slow rhythms. However, when the G ttingen team analysed the responses of nerve cells to the novel, more natural stimuli, a very different picture emerged. The adapting interneurons did not simply follow the slow rhythms, as was expected, instead they were able to switch between very slow rhythms and very fast rhythms.During certain sleep phases or during inactive daydreaming, the adaptive interneurons can contribute to brain rhythms of up to 200 cycles per second, according to these new findings. This is more than 20 times faster than thought possible for these cells. ""We were surprised at how differently these cells could respond,"" says first author Dr Ricardo Martins Merino. ""But what is even more astonishing to me is the speed of their  re-tuning . One moment they are contributing to the fast oscillations, the next they are not. They can switch back and forth ten times a second!""The scientists assume that this ability to switch quickly is the solution to the long-standing puzzle of how the different rhythms in the brain interact with each other and how we can shift our attention so quickly from one aspect to the next. ""The next goal is to study the role of switching in both the computer and the living brain. The CIDBN offers the ideal space for this because here theoretical and experimental research approaches are combined under one roof,"" says co-author Professor Fred Wolf, founding director of the CIDBN.Reference: Merino RM, Leon-Pinzon C, St hmer W, et al.

Researchers  aim was to understand how blind people move and orient themselves in space, and they did so in an engaging way. The platform maybe used in the future to rehabilitate blind people s orientation skills and make them more independent, like the Braille does for reading and writing.The platform was presented at the 43th annual international conference of the IEEE Engineering and Biology Society (EMBC), and the research results were published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience in November last year. The ability to orient in space is obviously linked to vision, but the mechanisms by which this happens and the strategies used by the human brain to cope with vision loss are still unclear  says Dr. Monica Gori, who coordinates the Unit for Visually Impaired People (UVIP) at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genova (Italy).  Our last research result is a further step forward the understanding of how space and body combine to create the sense of space .Contrarily to common belief, blind people do not have super-hearing. Few years ago, Monica Gori and her group demonstrated that their auditory skills depend very much on the context. For example, they struggle at orienting themselves with respect to the available landmarks around them. Thanks to the new platform, researchers demonstrated that congenital blind people struggle at coordinating head and trunk to reorient towards new targets, yet the main information source they rely on is the body  - via vestibular, proprioceptive and motor cues - rather than the environmental sounds, which are instead preferred by blindfolded sighted people.Davide Esposito, developer of the archery game and member of the UVIP Lab, says:  Scientific purpose of the game aside, giving blind people the chance to try virtual reality was fulfilling. Many of our participants were having lot of fun while doing the experiment, and wanted to keep playing even after the experiment ended .The researchers hope the platform, which so far has been used for assessment only, could be turned into a serious game to rehabilitate blind people s orientation skills and make them more independent, like the Braille does for reading and writing.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Their results show that cancer was correctly detected in 19 out of every 20 patients with cancer using this test. In those with cancer, metastatic disease was identified with an overall accuracy of 94%. These results make this the first technology to be able to determine the metastatic status of a cancer from a simple blood test, without prior knowledge of the primary cancer type.This test shows promise to help clinicians detect cancer and assess cancer stage in the future. Unlike many blood-based tests for cancer, which detect genetic material from tumours, this test uses a technique called NMR metabolomics, which uses high magnetic fields and radio waves to profile levels of natural chemicals (metabolites) in the blood.Healthy individuals, people with localised cancer, and people with metastatic cancer each have different profiles of blood metabolites, which can be detected and then analysed by the researchers  algorithms to distinguish between these states.Dr James Larkin, researcher on the study from the University of Oxford, says: 'Cancer cells have unique metabolomic fingerprints due to their different metabolic processes. We are only now starting to understand how metabolites produced by tumours can be used as biomarkers to accurately detect cancer. We have already demonstrated that this technology can successfully identify if patients with multiple sclerosis are progressing to the later stages of disease, even before trained clinicians could tell. It is very exciting that the same technology is now showing promise in other diseases, like cancer.'Cancers detected earlier are more likely to be treated successfully. This rapid and inexpensive test could help to overcome many barriers to the early detection of cancer, especially in patients that present with non-specific symptoms, which do not direct investigations towards a specific organ. NHS Rapid Diagnostic Centres, similar to Oxfordshire s SCAN pathway, are currently being set up across the NHS to support faster and earlier cancer diagnosis in all patients with symptoms that could indicate cancer.This new test is not specific to a single cancer type and has shown promise in this traditionally challenging clinical context, including the potential to detect some cancers in the community before conventional imaging is performed.Dr Fay Probert, lead researcher of the study from the University of Oxford, says: 'This work describes a new way of identifying cancer. The goal is to produce a test for cancer that any GP can request. We envisage that metabolomic analysis of the blood will allow accurate, timely and cost-effective triaging of patients with suspected cancer, and could allow better prioritisation of patients based on the additional early information this test provides on their disease.'Future studies with larger patient cohorts will further evaluate this technique for the earlier detection of new cancers and potential clinical applications.Reference: Larkin JR, Anthony S, Johanssen VA, et al.

The researchers also showed in a fruit fly model of the condition that a chemical known as ABCA1 agonist can restore certain alterations of the brain protective mechanism.The team reveals evidence supporting reactive oxygen species (ROS), natural byproducts of cellular metabolism linked to inflammation and other processes, as key players in events leading to the disruption of the neuroprotective mechanism. In addition, the researchers found that ROS, together with amyloid-beta, the main component in the plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, accelerated disease development in animal models. Altogether, the findings provide new mechanistic insight into factors involved in Alzheimer s disease development, supporting the idea that multiple alterations at the genetic and other cellular levels combine to induce the disease. The study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Previous work conducted by Dr. Lucy Liu in Dr. Hugo Bellen s lab and colleagues showed that two brain cell types, neurons and glia, work together to protect against neurodegeneration,  said first author Dr. Matthew Moulton, a postdoctoral associate in the Bellen lab.  In the current study, we worked with fruit fly and mammal models to investigate whether known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer s disease were associated with disturbing the protective mechanism, diving deep into the details of how this happened. The neuroprotective mechanism is engaged when neurons face high levels of ROS, which stimulates neurons to produce abundant lipids. ROS levels increase with aging, different forms of stress or because of genetic factors. The combination of ROS and lipids produces peroxidated lipids, which deteriorate cellular health. Neurons try to avoid the damage by secreting these lipids, and apolipoproteins, proteins that transport lipids, carry them to glia cells. Glia store the lipids in lipid droplets, sequestering them from the environment, thus keeping them from damaging neurons.In the previous work, the researchers connected the neuroprotective mechanism to the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease, apolipoprotein APOE4.  We found that APOE4 is practically unable to transfer lipids to glia, while other two forms of APOE, APOE2 and APOE3, carry out the transfer effectively,  said Bellen, Distinguished Service Professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor.  With APOE4, lipid droplet accumulation in glia is drastically reduced and the protective mechanism breaks down. This fundamental difference in the function in APOE4 likely primes an individual to be more susceptible to the damaging effects of ROS, which becomes elevated with age. In the current work, we wanted to identify genes that are critical for lipid droplet formation, specifically genes that are required for lipid export from neurons and lipid import into glia,  Moulton said.  We looked at genes that interact with APOE in neurons to get the lipids out, and also in glia to get the lipids in. One reason we are interested in this comes from human studies that show that genes involved in both import and export of lipids have been implicated in Alzheimer s disease and other related conditions. The team investigated the role of these Alzheimer s risk genes in a fruit fly model, one gene at a time. The model allowed them to visualize, in the presence or absence of ROS, the effect of knocking down a particular gene, either in neurons or in glia, on the formation of lipid droplets, as well as on neurodegeneration. In all cases in which ROS was present and we saw droplet loss, we also saw neurodegeneration, again supporting that perturbations in glia droplet formation can lead to neuronal damage,  Moulton said.With this approach, the team demonstrated that several genes that genome wide sequencing studies had associated with risk of developing Alzheimer s disease disturbed neuroprotective lipid droplet formation, providing a mechanism that can explain the risk associated with these genes.In addition, using the fruit fly model, Moulton and his colleagues tested whether an ABCA1 agonist, which was previously shown to restore APOE4 s ability to transfer lipids, could enable APOE4 to mediate lipid droplet formation in glia in the fruit fly model.  The ABCA1 agonist restored glial lipid droplet formation in an APOE4 fruit fly model, highlighting a potentially therapeutic avenue to prevent ROS-induced neurotoxicity,  said Bellen, Chair in Neurogenetics in the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children s.The researchers also investigated whether ROS could exacerbate the effect amyloid-beta may have on the disease.  We observed that ROS and amyloid-beta together increased neuronal death in fruit flies and resulted in larger and more numerous amyloid-beta-rich plaques in a mouse model, suggesting that, indeed, ROS and amyloid-beta can interact and potentially influence disease progression,  Moulton said. As we age, ROS in the brain increases. If in addition there are mutations that disrupt the droplet pathways, then neurons can become sensitive to the accumulation of lipid droplets and this can pave the way to neurodegeneration,  Bellen said.  Our findings support further investigations into feasible means to reduce the levels of ROS in the brain as a strategy to minimize ROS s key contribution to neurodegeneration.

These insights can identify complications before a woman experiences symptoms.The study, published in Nature, involved researchers from King s and Guy s and St Thomas  NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with Mirvie. The study examines genetic material found in blood samples that can predict pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia.Pre-eclampsia effects up to 1 in 12 pregnancies and is a significant cause of maternal morbidity. It is also a cause of a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Most cases of pre-eclampsia are diagnosed when the mother experiences symptoms in the third trimester. This study could widen the window of detection and lead to quicker intervention.Professor Rachel Tribe, Department of Women and Children s Health, King s College London, said:  I am delighted to be involved in this important collaborative effort to develop a new tool to predict pre-eclampsia. Using a cutting-edge sequencing approach, we were able to detect cell free RNA (cfRNA) in the blood of pregnant women. These provided a molecular signature that can be used to identify women at risk of pre-eclampsia.""She added: ""Excitingly, this requires only a single blood sample and has potential to identify women at risk much earlier in pregnancy so that they can be more closely monitored and treated by the clinicians involved. Researchers took 2500 blood samples from eight prospectively collected cohorts that included multiple ethnicities, nationalities, socioeconomic contexts and geographic locations. They then examined the anonymised cfRNA profiles   signals from the fetus and pregnant mother s tissues   that reflect fetal development and healthy pregnancy progression. This provided a non-invasive window into maternal and fetal health.In this study, researchers show the cfRNA signals which deviate from those of a healthy pregnancy. One single blood sample could reliably identify women at risk of developing preeclampsia months prior to the presentation of the disease. Using machine learning to analyse tens of thousands of RNA messages from the mother, baby and placenta, the Mirvie RNA platform can identify 75% of women who go on to develop preeclampsia. Researchers hope this test can be widened to investigate other pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth.Professor Tribe added:  Because the study drew upon samples for a diverse group of women, including participants recruited across King s Health Partners, the molecular signature is very reliable and has potential to outperform currently available tests.  We are now focused on ongoing clinical research to further validate these results and improve the understanding of other pregnancy complications. As a scientist, it was also extremely interesting to see that the molecular signature tells us something about mechanisms associated with health in pregnancy and complications including preeclampsia; such knowledge will aid development of treatment strategies in the future.

These traits are obviously valuable, but the extra energy required to sustain them is quite significant. So how did we manage to afford them?A group of anthropologists from UC Santa Barbara, the University of Utah and Duke University have teamed up on a research study to understand the strategies humans developed for obtaining that extra energy. Their findings are published in the current issue of Science.Evolutionary success is largely determined by the extent to which an organism is effective at extracting energy (i.e. calories) from the environment and converting that energy into offspring. But energy acquisition is constrained by a number of factors, the primary being how much time and energy one can spend in the pursuit of food. Energy budgets represent the balance between energy intake and expenditure that all organisms must navigate in order to survive and reproduce. Because energy is such a fundamental currency, evolution has produced many astonishing energy-saving adaptations across the Tree of Life,  said Thomas Kraft, the paper s lead author. Currently an assistant professor at the University of Utah, Kraft conducted the research while a postdoctoral student with Michael Gurven, senior author and professor of anthropology at UC Santa Barbara.  But that doesn t mean natural selection always favors reduced energy expenditure. In fact, tremendous variation exists in the  tempo  of energetic strategies. A dramatic example is the difference between endothermic (warm-blooded) and ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals. Warm-blooded animals tend to use a lot more energy each day but are able to successfully channel that energy into activities that ultimately lead to successful reproduction. The researchers began by comparing the amount of energy and time humans and other great apes expend in order to obtain all the foods they typically include in their diets.  We studied contemporary subsistence societies of hunter-gatherers and farmers in order to examine the kinds of energetic strategies that have existed for millennia, including those after the advent of plant domestication,  said Kraft.The team of scientists drew especially upon their long-term collective experience working with the Hadza, an indigenous group of foragers in northwest Tanzania, and the Tsimane, an indigenous group of horticulturalists in the Bolivian Amazon.Compared to chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, human hunter-gatherers are not particularly efficient at acquiring food.  It turns out we spend a surprising amount of energy getting food because we walk very long distances and engage in intense activities such as digging tubers or clearing trees,  explained Kraft.  Other great apes, in contrast, don t need to go very far each day. Most of their food shopping involves leisurely picking fruit and vegetation. However, humans do benefit from earning a lot more food energy per hour. While other great apes don t cook their food and they spend exorbitant amounts of time chewing and digesting, humans  high-intensity subsistence activities yield many calories quickly. This is like saying that despite the intensity of the work, humans earn a much higher energetic  salary  than do other apes,  said Kraft.  This ability to attain a higher return rate is what makes hunter-gatherers so successful.  Add farming to the mix and that rate of return   or  salary    only increases.  Those who mix farming with foraging double or triple what hunter-gatherers earn,  Kraft continued. But high throughput human strategies, which involve expending a lot of energy to get more food faster, can also be quite risky if you fail to get food on a given day.  Yet humans seem uniquely able to overcome this by cooperating and sharing and storing foods to avoid dangerous shortfalls. Such cooperation has other benefits as well. Being able to meet one s daily food requirement in less time would have provided more opportunities for other endeavors.  Developing the rich social and cultural life so common in all human societies may first have required time-efficient strategies for feeding yourself,  said Gurven, who is also director of the UC Santa Barbara s Integrative Anthropological Sciences Unit and co-director of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project.However, he noted, it also can lead us astray, contributing to health problems such as the current obesity epidemic.  Part of what makes us humans so successful is being really good at figuring out how to get the biggest return for the least effort,  Gurven said.  You can see where that leads us today   driving cars or taking a bus to the local Costco to purchase those tasty $4.99 rotisserie chickens. We ve replaced our physical labor in hunting or farming with supply chains. If we evolved to get calories cheaply, then the need to eat less or move more may be a struggle for good reason. On the other hand, he continued, the research findings suggest humans also evolved to be highly physically active, at least to attain food.  This doesn t mean we need to be vigorously active all the time,  he said.  The lesson from subsistence populations is instead to just be less sedentary. One finding from the study that surprised the researchers involved the high energetic costs of human subsistence strategies. Walking in an upright/bipedal form makes humans move more efficiently than the other great apes, and we use sophisticated tools to make tasks easier to accomplish. However, humans (both hunter-gatherers and farmers) actually expend more energy per day on activities related to acquiring food than do chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. This makes our subsistence strategies not very efficient overall.Anthropology has a long tradition of collecting data on energy flows in different kinds of societies   e.g. hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists. The researchers compiled these disparate data into a single database so they could ask whether the detailed data they had from the Hadza and the Tsimane were representative of broader patterns in subsistence energetics across societies. And they were, but other surprises came out of this exercise as well. We didn t expect that our cross-cultural database would reveal minimal difference in the amount of time spent working between hunter-gatherers and farming populations,  he continued. As exemplified by James Suzman s recent book,  Work: A Deep History from the Stone Age to the Age of Robots,  many anthropologists have long argued that hunter-gatherers spend very little time working as compared to other human societies. After compiling an exhaustive list of studies, the researchers found no evidence to support the idea that contemporary subsistence farmers spend more time working on average than hunter-gatherers. We hope that having all this new information in one place will help us understand the fundamental relationship that humans have with energy. How we obtain and expend energy lies at the heart of both what makes us human and many of the health and environmental issues that we face today,  Kraft explained.  It would be wise not to forget our evolutionary legacy as we approach these problems.  Reference: Kraft TS, Venkataraman VV, Wallace IJ, et al.

However, this procedure is invasive and can only detect issues at a late stage. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Analytical Chemistry have developed a CRISPR-based assay that can sensitively and non-invasively detect a biomarker of acute kidney rejection in urine. This could someday help diagnose rejection earlier and without a biopsy.Kidney transplant recipients must take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives to help keep their immune systems from attacking the foreign organ. However, kidney rejection can still occur, particularly in the first few months after transplantation, which is known as acute rejection. Signs include increased serum creatinine levels and symptoms such as kidney pain and fever. Currently, the only way to definitively diagnose it is through biopsy, but this procedure can only detect problems at a relatively late stage. Being able to sensitively and non-invasively diagnose kidney rejection at an early stage would allow doctors to begin anti-rejection medication sooner. Researchers previously found that high levels of a cytokine protein called CXCL9 in the urine of kidney transplant patients was an early warning sign of rejection. But the current method for measuring CXCL9 (an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA) doesn t work very well in urine, limiting its sensitivity. So, Jonathan Dordick and colleagues wanted to develop a more sensitive technique for non-invasively diagnosing acute kidney rejection from urine.The researchers based their detection method on CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing technology. In the presence of the CXCL9 protein, the CRISPR/Cas12a enzyme cuts a probe to produce a fluorescent signal. The researchers boosted the fluorescent signal by attaching a DNA barcode that aggregates a large number of CRISPR/Cas12a molecules, and is subsequently bound to an antibody that recognizes CXCL9. Importantly, unlike other CRISPR-based detection methods, PCR amplification is not required, which makes the method easier to adapt to a device that could be used in a doctor s office or even a patient s home. When tested on urine samples from 11 kidney transplant patients, the new system accurately measured CXCL9 levels, with values very similar to an ELISA. However, because the immuno-CRISPR system is about 7 times more sensitive than an ELISA, it might be able to detect kidney transplant rejection at a very early stage, the researchers say.Reference: Lee I, Kwon SJ, Sorci M, Heeger PS, Dordick JS.

Historically, nanoparticles have a very low delivery rate to the cytosol, the inside compartment of cells, releasing only about 1% 2% of their contents. The new testing tool, engineered specifically to test nanoparticles, could advance the search for next-generation biological medicines. The technology builds upon nanoparticles currently used against cancer and eye disease, and in vaccines for viruses including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The researchers report details of the tool, tested in mouse cells grown in the laboratory and in living mice, in the Jan. 5 issue of Science Advances. Many of the current assessment tools for nanoparticles only test whether a nanoparticle reaches a cell, not if the therapy can successfully escape the degradative environment of the endosome to reach inside the cytosol of the cell, which is where the medicine needs to be located for performance,  says Jordan Green, Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The new tool was created to track location and nanoparticle release, he said.Previous research has estimated that only about 1% 2% of nanoparticles  eaten  by cells are able to escape the cellular compartments that trap them to avoid being digested or  spit back out.  In addition to the properties of its cargo, a nanoparticle s chemical properties determine whether it is accepted by a cell and able to evade its cellular defenses.To surmount such obstacles to final delivery, Green and his team designed a screening tool that assesses hundreds of nanoparticle formulations on their ability to not just reach a cell, but also how efficiently the nanoparticle can escape with its cargo to reach a cell s interior. The test uses mouse cells grown in the laboratory that are genetically engineered to carry a florescent marker called Gal8-mRuby, which shines orange-red when a cellular envelope that engulfs a nanoparticle opens, releasing its cargo into the cell.Images of the process are then analyzed by a computer program that quickly tracks the nanoparticle location using red fluorescent light and quantifies how effective the nanoparticles are at being released into the cell by assessing the amount of orange-red fluorescent light. Using this technique, a laboratory can screen hundreds of unique nanoparticles for delivery in a few hours, with detailed information about the uptake of the nanoparticles and the delivery of their cargo.In experiments in mice, Green and his team administered biodegradable nanoparticles carrying mRNA that encoded a gene called luciferase, which makes cells glow. The researchers then tracked whether the mouse cells accepted the gene and began expressing it   lighting up target cells like a lightning bug.Green s team found that the top-performing nanoparticles in the cellular tests had a high positive correlation to nanoparticle gene delivery performance in living mice, showing the nanoparticle assay is a good predictor of successful cargo delivery.In further mouse studies, the researchers discovered that different chemical group combinations in the polymer-based nanoparticles led the nanoparticles to target different tissue types. By analyzing how the particles behaved in the mouse s body, the researchers found that polymer chemical properties could direct the nanoparticle gene therapy to specific target cells, such as endothelial cells in the lungs or B cells in the spleen. By fine-tuning small chemical changes, we can steer a nanoparticle to specific tissues and even specific cells,  said Green.  This would allow us to develop more precisely delivered therapies, which could improve both efficacy and safety. Nanoparticle delivery of biological drugs is a growing field, particularly for gene therapies and vaccines.Reference: Rui Y, Wilson DR, Tzeng SY, et al.

To prevent the previously unavoidable damage, researchers, led by Penn State, have developed a new class of nanomaterials engineered to capture chemotherapy drugs before they interact with healthy tissue. To reduce the off-target effects of cancer drugs during and after localized chemotherapy, eliminating their systemic circulation is necessary,  said principal investigator Amir Sheikhi, assistant professor of chemical engineering and biomedical engineering at Penn State.  Available and proposed platforms to remove unwanted drugs   primarily the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX)   from blood are exceedingly ineffective, failing to remove enough of the drug to prevent damage. We have developed a highly efficient approach that captures DOX at a capacity more than 3,200% higher than other platforms, such as DNA-based materials. The method, now available online prior to the March issue of Materials Today Chemistry, is based on hairy cellulose nanocrystals   nanoparticles developed from the main component of plant cell walls and engineered to have immense numbers of polymer chain  hairs  extending from each end. These hairs increase the potential drug capture capacity of the nanocrystals significantly beyond that of conventional nanoparticles and ion exchange resins, according to Sheikhi.  To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no nanoparticle-based super-capacity drug capture system,  Sheikhi said, noting that the development of such a system could have significant impact on cancer treatment plans.  For some organs, like the liver, chemotherapy can be locally administered through catheters. If we could place a device based on the nanocrystals to capture the excess drugs exiting the liver s inferior vena cava, a major blood vessel, clinicians could potentially administer higher doses of chemotherapy to kill the cancer more quickly without worry about damaging healthy cells. Once the treatment is finished, the device could be removed. To produce the hairy cellulose nanocrystals capable of capturing chemotherapy drugs, the researchers chemically treated cellulose fibers found in softwood pulp and imparted a negative charge on the hairs, making them stable against the ionic composition of blood. According to Sheikhi, this corrects a fault of conventional nanoparticles, whose charge can be rendered inert or reduced when exposed to blood, limiting the number of positively charged drug molecules it can bind with to insignificant numbers. The nanocrystals  binding efficacy was tested in human serum, the protein-rich portion of blood that does not contain red or white blood cells or platelets. For every gram of hairy cellulose nanocrystals, more than 6,000 milligrams of DOX were effectively removed from the serum.  The hairy nanocrystals allowed us to push the limit by at least two-to-three orders of magnitude compared to some other available platforms,  Sheikhi said. The researchers also found that the nanocrystals had no harmful effect on red blood cells in whole blood or on cell growth in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.  We found that the hairy cellulose nanocrystals bind to positively charged drugs in human serum and capture DOX immediately, and they do so without imposing any cytotoxicity or hemolytic effects,  Sheikhi said.  We envision that this effective, non-toxic nanoparticle could be a building block for the next generation of devices to capture excess drugs and remove unwanted molecules from the body, such as psychedelics and toxins.  According to Sheikhi, the use of hairy cellulose nanocrystals has far-reaching implications beyond the body. His team recently engineered nanocrystals capable of selectively binding to neodymium, a rare earth element, to rescue valuable material from electronic waste.   We re excited to introduce a new material with such a high capacity to separate a variety of elements, which will hopefully open new opportunities for a broad range of applications,  Sheikhi said.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/accelerating-atomic-force-microscopy-357248,Accelerating Atomic Force Microscopy Researchers have designed an ultrafast amplitude detector that will enable the real time recording of fast dynamical processes of biomolecules  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. To improve our understanding of biomolecular processes happening within cells, techniques for visualizing and recording them are of key importance.  High-speed atomic-force microscopy (HS-AFM) has become an important technique for the real-time observation of biological processes on the sub-molecular spatial scale and with sub-second time resolution.  Still, a higher video frame rate is required for recording many important processes, such as ion transport motion or signaling mechanisms within membranes.  Now, Kenichi Umeda, Toshio Ando and Noriyuki Kodera from Kanazawa University and colleagues have designed an amplitude detector with ultrafast operation, the use of which in HS-AFM leads to a significantly improved temporal resolution.The basic idea of AFM is to make a very small tip scan the surface of a sample.  During this horizontal ( xy ) scan, the tip, which is attached to a small cantilever, follows the sample s vertical ( z ) profile, inducing a force on the cantilever that can be measured.  The magnitude of the force at the  xy  position can be related to the  z  value; the  xyz  data generated during a scan then result in a height map providing structural information about the investigated sample.  In HS-AFM, the working principle is slightly more involved: the cantilever is made to oscillate near its resonance frequency.  When the tip is moved around a surface, the variations in the amplitude of the cantilever s oscillation   resulting from the tip s interaction with the sample s surface   are recorded, as these provide a measure for the local  z  value.  Amplitude variation detectors have an intrinsic slowness, called latency, as a finite time interval is normally required to detect a change in amplitude.  Amplitude detector latency is one of the main bottlenecks towards improving the speed of HS-AFM.Umeda and colleagues invented a cleverly designed amplitude detector that has zero intrinsic latency.  The detector is based on the trigonometric calculation, in which the calculation of A2 = A2(sin2 ct + cos2 ct) = (Asin ct)2 + (Acos ct)2 is performed using an incoming sin wave Asin ct.  The key step for the fast detection was to obtain the cosine wave Acos ct by the differential operation. Hence, the electronic circuit invented here was named DB (differential based) amplitude detector.  The scientists built a test circuit with this architecture, and evaluated its speed performance in the range of 300   1500 kHz carrier frequency.  The DB amplitude detector resulted in about 10 times faster characteristics than the schemes typically used until now.The researchers also tested the DB amplitude detector in a real HS-AFM experiment.  They successfully recorded actin filaments, one of the cytoskeletal filaments found in eukaryotic cells, with a scanning velocity of 800 micrometers per second, which is four times faster than with a typical setup.  The higher recording speeds not only results in a higher video frame rate (50 milliseconds per frame) but it also has the advantage of being less invasive   in the standard setup, the filament collapsed after 1 second, whereas with the new detector, the biomolecule was stably observed for 30 seconds.The detector of Umeda and colleagues promises better performance in terms of imaging speed and less-invasiveness compared to conventional detectors.  Quoting the scientists:  By overcoming the obstacle of the amplitude detector bandwidth, we have opened the road to increasing the temporal resolution of HS-AFM.

His quest is to find ways to turn leftover materials from crop production, like canola meal, into biocoal. It is already happening in the forest industry but not in agriculture, he said, despite an ample supply of biomatter.  In 2019, Canada produced over 18 million tonnes of canola and 10 million tonnes came from Saskatchewan. The oil extraction process leaves behind canola meal, which is about 60 per cent of the original crop by weight. Some canola meal is exported and about 40 per cent is fed to livestock. The remainder is what Dalai sees as potential biocoal. The challenge is to produce high-quality pellets suitable for storage and transportation to facilities where it can be burned to produce heat and power, he said.  Dalai and colleagues have been using computed tomography techniques at the Canadian Light Source at USask to examine lab-produced pellets. When he first visited a synchrotron in the U.S. about 25 years ago, Dalai saw things nobody can see with the naked eye.  It ignited a passion in me to apply these techniques to biomaterial,  he said.  We need to know how they look on the inside, what the structure looks like,  he explained.  Tomography allows us to assess the impact of different additives and different amounts of water on the mechanical strength of the pellet and the amount of energy produced when you burn it.  His latest research, published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, demonstrates the optimal amounts of various additives that serve as binders and lubricants to create a canola meal pellet that will not absorb too much moisture or crumble when stored or transported. It is a recipe that is now ready to be tested in the real world.   We ve been working for five or six years on this project. It s time to produce the pellets on a large scale to see the consistency of the product.  The team s pellet-making equipment has arrived and, working with industry partners, they will conduct an economic analysis of the canola meal pellets.  Are we ready to formulate and produce on a large scale for export? No, but our dream will come true one day,  he stated.  As the up-scaling continues, Dalai s team will investigate alternative, lower-cost additives and apply their recipe to other biomaterials, including canola hull, mustard meal and hull, and oat hull. Supplies are plentiful  because we don t have enough cattle in Saskatchewan to eat all of the biomass.  Dalai is also interested in combining agriculture biomass with forest residue to create new formulations.   The potential of using biomass for bioenergy is enormous and exciting,  said Dalai. In addition to generating significant revenue for the agriculture industry,  we all have a responsibility to create an environment that will be good for our children and grandchildren.

McGee-Lawrence, biomedical engineer in the Department of Cellular Biology and Anatomy at the Medical College of Georgia.And drugs that block the receptor, like the hypertension medications spironolactone and eplerenone, may help protect bone cells, says McGee-Lawrence, corresponding author of the study in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.Drugs like prednisone are glucocorticoids, which are better known for their roles in reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response, which is why they work so well for problems like irritable bowel syndrome and arthritis. But, like aging, they can also disrupt the healthy, ongoing dynamic of bone being made and being destroyed.Our natural glucocorticoid levels increase with age, and bone, at least when we are young, has more glucocorticoid receptors than mineralocorticoid receptors. Glucocorticoids can actually coax stem cells to make bone-forming osteoblasts, but it also causes those osteoblasts to store more fat, and too much fat in the bone, like anywhere on our body, is probably not good and typically correlates with bone loss, McGee-Lawrence says.So reducing the impact of glucocorticoid receptors seemed like a logical way to protect bone.The MCG scientists had already been surprised to find that the loss of functioning glucocorticoid receptors did not protect against bone loss in younger mice on calorie-restricted diets. In fact, there was increased fat accumulation in the bone marrow and worsened osteoporosis.This time they were looking at the impact of endogenous glucocorticoids in an aging model, and found again that when the glucocorticoid receptor was blocked, older mice also experienced more fat accumulation in the bone marrow and worsening bone disease.They also found that the mice had a smaller muscle mass, chose to move around less than mice typically do and had higher blood pressure. Another surprise was that when they used drugs to inhibit the mineralocorticoid receptor, many of the problems were reversed.                                                                                                                                                                             The only way we have found to get rid of that lipid storage by osteoblasts was to inhibit the mineralocorticoid receptor with drugs,  she says, and fortunately because of the receptors  clear role in blood pressure there are already drugs that do that.  I think what it means is if we want to understand what these stress hormones, these endogenous glucocorticoids, are doing we cannot just think about signaling through one receptor,  McGee-Lawrence says. For older bone, she thinks mineralocorticoid receptors may be a better target.  We thought that knocking out the glucocorticoid receptor would make things better, but it made them worse,  McGee-Lawrence says.  We think the mineralocorticoid receptor may explain a lot of what is going wrong in aging bone. Both receptors are members of the steroid receptor family and mineralocorticoid receptors are thought to have equal affinity for mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. It may be the signaling paths are different in young and older individuals, she notes.McGee-Lawrence and her colleagues already have some evidence that bone s expression of mineralocorticoid receptors goes up, potentially significantly, as you age. They have early mixed results on whether glucocorticoid receptors go down with age and are exploring more about what happens with both receptor levels as well as learning more about the role of mineralocorticoid receptors in bone, particularly aging bone. We want to know what would cause bone cells to change which receptors they are expressing and how they are responding to these,  she says.  But there are a lot of things that happen with aging. We know inflammation changes with aging, so there are a lot of different cues that could cause these things to change. The whole body impact they saw from their manipulation of receptors, like a higher blood pressure from deleting the glucocorticoid receptor, also is evidence of bone s importance as an endocrine organ, she says. By changing glucocorticoid signaling in the bone, not only are we seeing changes in the bone, but we are seeing changes in the fat, muscle, adrenal glands, in physical activity,  she says which means something from the bone is communicating with all these other body systems, an emerging role of research in her field.In fact, the increased fat presence in the bone marrow found in osteoporosis has resulted in it also being considered a metabolic disease of the bone, much as obesity, particularly excess weight around the middle, is considered a metabolic disease. Increased fat in the bone marrow is associated with disuse, like following a spinal cord injury, a high-fat diet, taking glucocorticoids, like steroids, and aging.While the fat is a ready energy source for bone cells, too much can hinder bone cell formation. The scientists don t yet know whether the cells are no longer using fat well or they are pulling more in, or both; they do know fat accumulating in the bone cells coincides with less bone being made, she reiterates. We are trying to figure out exactly why these things are going wrong so that we can pick the right avenue to pursue for a treatment strategy,  she says.There is a lot of evidence in people that the synthetic glucocorticoids we take via pill or injection, can impact bone, creating an unhealthy imbalance between the amount of bone made and the amount broken down.A focus of the research at MCG has been examining the bone impact from our endogenous glucocorticoids, the ones we make, a less-explored area. For years, McGee-Lawrence and her colleagues have been studying bone-forming osteoblasts which, like most cells, don t function optimally as we age.But it may be that even synthetic glucocorticoids also work through these alternative receptors to damage the bone, which means trying to prevent their damage may also mean a different target, she says, noting again that the pathway may change as the person ages.Interestingly some other tissues that are known to have a lot of mineralocorticoid receptors inactivate glucocorticoids, which bone cannot do, but perhaps it compensates by not having a lot of mineralocorticoid receptors, at least in youth, she says.The adrenal gland makes both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, production which becomes less well-regulated as we age.Reference: Pierce JL, Sharma AK, Roberts RL, et al.

Consequently, one of them is randomly selected and switched off already during early embryonic development. The Xist gene awakens and produces hundreds of RNA molecules, encasing one X chromosome and making it shrink into a small lump.But how does the cell know to turn off one chromosome at a given time   but only if there are two of them? A research team led by Lise Meitner Group Leader Edda Schulz at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG) found the answer to this decades-old puzzle in mouse stem cells and published their results in the journal Molecular Cell.A new genetic circuitThe Berlin scientists identified a genetic circuit that receives information about the developmental stage of the cell and passes it on to the Xist gene.  We found the regulatory region that senses whether the cell has left its stem cell state,  says Edda Schulz.The newly discovered gene switch, dubbed  Xert , is a member of the  enhancer  family of regulatory sequences. It is not sufficient to trigger the deactivation program on its own. Xist will only respond to the developmental cues if it is freely accessible and not blocked by other factors, which is the case when two X chromosomes are present in the cell. Only when both conditions are met, Xist can silence the  surplus  X chromosome.The DNA elements around Xist process information from different sources, almost like a computer, says Schulz:  A cell has programs that can be started and stopped. But unlike a machine made of wires and silicon, its circuits are made of molecules that dock to one another or are created by chemical reactions.""Gaining insight by disruption Our goal was to trace the genetic circuits without knowing the schematics,  says Rutger Gjaltema, scientist in Schulz's lab and first author of the paper.  In the end, we got a fairly complete picture of the regulatory landscape of Xist. In an initial screening experiment, the scientists determined 138 DNA segments on the X chromosome that appeared to be involved in signaling around the Xist gene in some way. For each of the segments, they designed a snippet of DNA that could individually target and knock out the potential gene switches. The researchers put the snippets into virus-like particles, infected cells with them, and observed in which cases Xist RNA production was enhanced or impaired. We tracked down numerous Xist regulators that we already knew, which was a good sign because it confirmed that our approach was working,  says Till Schw mmle, another scientist on Schulz's team and also first author of the paper.  More exciting, of course, was that a number of completely unknown sequences turned up in the analyses. Division of labor in spaceTo investigate the function of the new sequences, Gjaltema and Schw mmle compared their activity in stem cells, developing cells, and cells with two or only one X chromosome. They noticed that there appears to be a division of labor between the genetic switches and a striking spatial separation.The first switch is located in the immediate vicinity of Xist and its starting sequence. It only flips when a double dose of X-linked encoded enzymes is present. These enzymes appear to mediate the degradation of factors that block sections near Xist. Once there is enough enzyme, the gene gets accessible to the Xert enhancer signals. However, with only one X chromosome, there is too little of it and Xist remains blocked and unable to do its job.The second switch is not located near Xist, Schulz explains:  Similar to other developmental genes, the enhancer is relatively far away from its target gene. The DNA has to bend into a loop in order to make contact with the gene,  the scientist says. Together with Stefan Mundlos' research group at the MPIMG, her team studied the three-dimensional structure of the DNA around the Xist gene.  We show that signals far away from each other on the DNA strand are integrated. The two signaling pathways are linked , Schulz says.  The region in close proximity to Xist arms the mechanism, acting like an on-off switch. Then, the enhancer can pull the trigger when the cell has developed far enough. A model for other developmental genesThe new discoveries provide clues for years of further study to fully elucidate X chromosome inactivation, Schulz says. However, while the process controlled by Xist is unique in the animal kingdom, the genetic control mechanisms are not. Schulz believes that Xist regulation can also be used to better understand other developmental genes:  X inactivation is a fascinating system in itself, but most importantly, it's a very valuable model to better understand the regulatory relationships in our genome.

What differentiates a heart cell from a skin cell from a brain cell is the expression or silencing of genes.This process was once thought to only happen in animals, plants and other organisms with cells containing a nucleus, known as eukaryotes. A new study from U-M researchers, published in the journal Science Advances, lends further support to the emerging notion that bacteria also employ genetic silencing to protect themselves from harmful mutations. For a very long time, bacterial chromosomes were thought to be fully expressed, with no control with regard to chromosome accessibility,  said Ursula Jakob, Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology and biological chemistry at U-M Medical School and senior author on the new study.  That view has changed dramatically. In eukaryotes, proteins called histones help control which genes are activated. These proteins until recently were thought to be absent in bacteria. However, researchers including Jakob s U-M collaborator Peter Freddolino, Ph.D., associate professor of biological chemistry and computational medicine and bioinformatics, have revealed that bacteria do in fact regulate gene expression.  The types of elements that are silenced are some of the same things that get silenced by heterochromatin in eukaryotes: mobile, problematic genetic elements,  said Freddolino. Heterochromatin is a tightly packed bundle of DNA which supports the chromosome and regulates gene expression.And just like in animal cells, which can experience altered gene expression under stress, bacteria contain genetic sequences that can become problematic. For example, bacteria can become infected with viruses that integrate into their genomes, becoming genetic elements called prophages. Under certain conditions, these prophages can lead to the death of the bacterial cell. Finding and silencing these regions is critical for the cell s survival.The team s recent work reveals how bacteria pull this off using an ancient molecule found wherever there is life, called polyphosphate. The molecule was so important, says Jakob, that Nobel prize winner Arthur Kornberg spent the last 20 years of his career studying it. He found it plays a role in bacteria, in virulence, in stress responses, but could never figure out what exactly it was doing,  remarked Jakob. Jakob, Freddolino and their team found that this simple molecule targets a nucleoid-associated protein to the regions in the bacterial genome containing these problematic elements and suppresses their transcription.Remove the polyphosphate or the nucleoid-associated protein, said Jakob, and the bacteria suddenly mobilizes these prophages resulting in significant mutations. The bacteria can die very easily under those circumstances,  said Freddolino,  It s an extremely important system that had not been appreciated until now. Furthermore, the team has shown that in vitro, polyphosphate, the nucleoid-associated protein and DNA form droplets in a process called liquid-liquid phase separation, a mechanism that also underlies the organization of compartments outside the nucleus within cells in eukaryotes.  This discovery continues to push the idea we now have that bacteria behave in very similar ways to eukaryotes in the way in which they organize their chromosomes,  said Freddolino. Exploiting this silencing process, he says, could enable scientists the ability to reverse it, opening up completely new avenues for antibiotics.Reference: Beaufay F, Amemiya HM, Guan J, et al.

The United Nations recently projected that, unless new drugs are developed, multidrug-resistant infections will force up to 24 million people into extreme poverty within the next decade and cause 10 million annual deaths by 2050.  Scientists are especially apprehensive about a broad group of bacteria that circulate in hospitals and can dodge not only blockbuster drugs like penicillin and tetracycline, but even colistin, an antibiotic long used as a crucial last option. When colistin fails, there is often no effective antibiotics for patients with multidrug-resistant infections.  Now, Rockefeller scientists report on their discovery of a compound that could potentially outmaneuver colistin resistance. In animal experiments, this prospective antibiotic was highly potent against dangerous opportunistic pathogens like Acinetobacter baumannii, the most common cause of infections in healthcare settings. Published in Nature, the findings could make it possible to develop a new class of antibiotics to combat strains responding to no other treatments. Colistin has long been abundantly used in the livestock industry, and more recently in the clinic. The overuse is believed to have put a staunch evolutionary pressure on bacteria, compelling them to develop new traits to survive. As a result, some species have acquired a new gene called mcr-1 that evades colistin s toxicity, making these bacteria resistant to the drug.   Colistin resistance spreads fast, in part because mcr-1 sits on a plasmid, a ring of DNA that isn t part of the bulk bacterial genome and can transfer easily from cell to cell.  It jumps from one bacterial strain to another, or from one patient s infection to another s,  says Zongqiang Wang, a postdoctoral associate in the lab of Sean F. Brady. Wang and his colleagues wondered if there are natural compounds that could be used to fight colistin-resistant bacteria. In nature, bacteria are constantly competing for resources, developing new strategies to thwart neighboring strains. In fact, colistin itself is produced by a soil bacterium to eliminate competitors. If a rival resists the attack by picking up mcr-1, the first microbe might subsequently acquire a new mutation, launching a novel version of colistin capable of killing the mcr-1 bacteria.   We set out to search for natural compounds that soil bacteria may have evolved to fight their own colistin resistance problem,  says Brady, who is Rockefeller s Evnin Professor.   His team used an innovative approach that sidesteps the limitations of traditional methods for antibiotics discovery. Instead of growing bacteria in the lab and fishing for the compounds they produce, the researchers search bacterial DNA for the corresponding genes. In sifting through more than 10,000 bacterial genomes, they found 35 groups of genes that they predicted would produce colistin-like structures.  One group looked particularly interesting as it included genes that were sufficiently different from those that produce colistin to suggest they would produce a functionally distinct version of the drug. In further analyzing these genes, the researchers were able to predict the structure of this new molecule, which they named macolacin. They then chemically synthesized this never-before-seen relative of colistin, yielding a novel compound without ever needing to extract it from its natural source.In lab experiments, macolacin was shown to be potent against several types of colistin-resistant bacteria including intrinsically resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a pathogen classified as a highest-level threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Colistin, on the other hand, appeared to be totally inactive against this bacterium.   Next, the scientists tested the new agent in mice infected with colistin-resistant XDR A. baumannii, another highest-level threat pathogens. Mice that received an injection of optimized macolacin completely cleared away the infection in 24 hours, while those treated with colistin or placebo retained at least the same amount of bacteria present during the initial infection.   Our findings suggest macolacin could potentially be developed into a drug to be deployed against some of the most troubling multidrug-resistant pathogens,  says Brady.In another study, Brady s lab used similar methods to explore a different class of antibiotics, called menaquinone-binding antibiotics (MBA). In work published recently in Nature Microbiology, the researchers showed that, in mice, the new MBAs they identified are effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, another cause of dangerous infections in healthcare settings.Wang adds that the evolution-based genome mining method used to discover macolacin could be applied to other drug-resistance problems, as well.  In principle, you could search bacterial DNA for new variants of any known antibiotic rendered ineffective by drug-resistant strains,  he says. Reference: Wang Z, Koirala B, Hernandez Y, et al.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/using-retrons-for-more-efficient-genome-editing-357236,Using Retrons for More Efficient Genome Editing Researchers at Gladstone Institutes have fine tuned an additional system for more efficient gene editing  using molecules called retrons  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Over the past decade, the CRISPR genome-editing system has revolutionized molecular biology, giving scientists the ability to alter genes inside living cells for research or medical applications. Now, researchers at Gladstone Institutes have fine-tuned an additional system for more efficient gene editing, using molecules called retrons.Retrons, the group reported in the journal Nature Chemical Biology, can be optimized for efficiency and used to edit genes in a variety of cell types, from fungi to human cells. This work really solidifies retrons as a platform that can be used across organisms,  says Gladstone Assistant Investigator Seth Shipman, PhD, senior author of the new study.  We can make precise modifications to genes more easily, quickly, and efficiently than with current approaches. A One-Stop Shop for Gene EditingMost current gene-editing technologies based on the CRISPR system involve cutting a section of DNA out of a cell s genome, and then introducing new genetic material called  template DNA  to replace it. As the cell repairs the places where an existing gene was cut, the template DNA is integrated.That template DNA is normally produced in the lab and then introduced to cells from the outside. The protein that cuts the cell s genome called Cas9 is delivered separately. Neither Cas9 nor the template DNA penetrate every cell, limiting the efficiency of CRISPR gene editing.Retrons, however, act like DNA factories, producing abundant copies of template DNA from inside cells. Moreover, retrons can be delivered along with the rest of the CRISPR components so that cells get all the material needed for gene editing simultaneously the genetic codes for template DNA, Cas9, and molecules that help researchers track the edits that have been made. This means we only have to introduce one element to each cell,  says Santiago Lopez, a graduate student in the Shipman Lab and first author of the new paper.  That significantly simplifies the process and opens the door for new types of experiments. Shipman (left) and Lopez (right) engineered a new retron system that boosts gene editing efficiency.Re-Engineering RetronsBoth retrons and CRISPR originate from bacteria; both are defense mechanisms that bacteria use to alter DNA in response to infections. After the advent of CRISPR genome editing, in which the CRISPR system was co-opted to selectively target genes in other cell types, some researchers began probing whether retrons could be used to supply the templates for precise gene editing. However, the roles of different sections of the retron s structure in its function and how to tweak those sections to improve retrons has been unknown. The retron system evolved to help defend bacteria,  says Shipman, who is also an assistant professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at UC San Francisco (UCSF).  But we wanted to change it from what it does normally to what we want it to do produce templates for gene editing. In the new study, Shipman s group engineered E. coli retrons to create hundreds of new variants. They tested each new variant and discovered a series of changes that, together, led to an 8-to-10-fold increase in how much template DNA was eventually produced by the retron in E. coli cells.Next, the researchers tested the new re-engineered retron system in the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker s yeast) and in cultured human cells, and they found that this optimized system worked in all cases. This was the first demonstration of retrons  use in human cells and their portability across cell types.Shipman (left) and Lopez (right) developed a useful research tool for editing genes in different cell types in the lab.Since the team could now fine-tune exactly how much template DNA the retrons produced, they were also able to show that when the retrons produce high levels of template DNA, this boosts gene editing efficiency. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the more template DNA we can produce, the better the genome editing,  says Shipman.  Better and more precise editing ultimately means more effective and safer genomic medicines and more advanced fundamental research. Taking Tools from BacteriaRetrons, Shipman says, are immediately useful as a research tool for editing genes in different cell types in the lab. While the platform isn t yet ready for use in humans, it also holds the potential to help edit genes for therapeutic purposes for example by repairing gene mutations that cause disease.Since different bacteria contain different retrons, his group also plans to explore whether other retron variations have benefits over the E. coli retron they optimized in this study. We re taking a general approach in which we re mining parts that we find in bacteria and domesticating them for our own use,  says Shipman.  This has already been incredibly fruitful for developing new tools, but I think we re only just beginning to reap the benefits of applying these tools in biotechnology.

Contrary to previous observations in Italy, they observed an explosive propagation of the virus, with more than 75 percent of tested plants becoming infected between 2014 and 2015. Surprisingly, only a marginal number of grapevines tested positive during the remaining five years of the study.  GPGV was first spotted in northeastern Italy in 2011 thanks to High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS), a newer technology that has enhanced our ability to better understand plant responses and genome expression. Plant pathologists can also use HTS to identify virome, which depicts the assemblage of viral genomes in a sample.  In looking at GPGV, plant pathologist Jean-Michel Hily and colleagues recovered genomic information from 18 samples and re-assembled 25 complete genomes. Coupled with phylogenetic analyses, we proposed a phylodynamic reconstruction model of the GPGV introduction and propagation events in the Chateauneuf-du-Pape region,  explained Hily.  The highest probability of GPGV introduction in the CDP vineyard was estimated between 1999 and 2003, with 3 to 6 possible independent introductions. It is also important to point out how powerful bioinformatics tools have become our model accurately predicted a wave of transmission within the vineyard between 2014 and 2015, as already confirmed by RT-PCR.   Their findings contrast with the GPGV situations in two Italian vineyards, which depicted a fast but regular and progressive spread of the virus over time. The explosive nature of the virus in the French vineyard adds to our understanding of GPGV and raises questions about vectors, specific climatic conditions, or other unknown parameters.  Hily and colleagues have written about GPGV before. Their first work provided a worldwide evolutionary history study of the virus and is a great complement to their latest work, which offers more details on the epidemiology at a local scale. Our results highlight also the decoupling between introduction of the virus, most likely from infected materials, and its plant-to-plant transmission by vectors.

Characterized by chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, IBD can be triggered or made worse by diet and environmental factors. Microplastics can cause intestinal inflammation, gut microbiome disturbances and other problems in animal models, so Faming Zhang, Yan Zhang and colleagues wondered if they could also contribute to IBD. As a first step toward finding out, the researchers wanted to compare the levels of microplastics in feces from healthy subjects and people with different severities of IBD. The team obtained fecal samples from 50 healthy people and 52 people with IBD from different geographic regions of China. Analysis of the samples showed that feces from IBD patients contained about 1.5 times more microplastic particles per gram than those from healthy subjects. The microplastics had similar shapes (mostly sheets and fibers) in the two groups, but the IBD feces had more small (less than 50  m) particles. The two most common types of plastic in both groups were polyethylene terephthalate (PET; used in bottles and food containers) and polyamide (PA; found in food packaging and textiles). People with more severe IBD symptoms tended to have higher levels of fecal microplastics. Through a questionnaire, the researchers found that people in both groups who drank bottled water, ate takeaway food and were often exposed to dust had more microplastics in their feces. These results suggest that people with IBD may be exposed to more microplastics in their gastrointestinal tract. However, it s still unclear whether this exposure could cause or contribute to IBD, or whether people with IBD accumulate more fecal microplastics as a result of their disease, the researcher say.Reference Yan Z, Liu Y, Zhang T, Zhang F, Ren H, Zhang Y.

The study was published on Jan. 5 in Cancer Research Communications. Stephen Clark, MD, PhD, a neuro-oncologist at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, who is the study s corresponding and lead author, said that this is the first time DNA methylome reprogramming has occurred with any solid human tumor.The DNA methylome is one aspect of the epigenome; the epigenome is a modification of DNA and proteins in a cell that is influenced by the environment. DNA methylation is one such modification, where methyl groups are added to DNA and is a mechanism that controls gene expression, including the silencing or activation of genes related to cancer.The researchers sought to determine if re-methylation of IDH wild-type tumors, which have a worse prognosis and lower DNA methylation than IDH mutant tumors, could improve survival. They succeeded in showing that the DNA methylome of IDH wild-type, high-grade gliomas could be reprogrammed, but the study group was too small to ascertain the impact on survival. This is an important first step in understanding how we can manipulate the epigenome, and hopefully, this study will help design future epigenetic studies in glioblastoma treatment,  said Clark, assistant professor of Neurology in the Division of Neuro-Oncology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.Although the study group of 14 patients was not large enough to detect a statistically significant survival advantage, the patients treated with the folic acid supplement L-methylfolate had a median overall survival of 9.5 months, compared to the typical median overall survival of 8.6 months. One of the patients is still alive.The study provides greater insight into the dynamics of epigenetic reprogramming, which is an emerging treatment for enhancing immunotherapies. In this phase 1 clinical trial, the researchers assessed the response of patients receiving bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that prevents the growth and maintenance of tumor blood vessels, when the treatment is augmented with L-methylfolate. The patients also received temozolomide, a chemotherapeutic agent. L-methylfolate was well tolerated, with no toxicities reported. Epigenetic reprogramming is not a new concept; for instance, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor treatment (5-Azacytidine) has been studied and is approved for the treatment of some leukemias. What is exciting about this work is that L-methylfolate, acts oppositely to 5-Azacytidine; it increases the availability of the active folate for the DNA methyltransferases. Consequently, it could remethylate and repress genes activated during tumorigenesis,  said the study s first author, Lucas Salas, MD, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of Epidemiology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and investigator in the Cancer Population Sciences Research Program at Dartmouth s Norris Cotton Cancer Center. Further, we observed changes in the level of DNA methylation in the tumors of those receiving L-methylfolate, suggesting that L-methylfolate not only crosses the blood-brain barrier, but it seems to modify the tumor epigenetic landscape actively. Six of the trial participants donated their brains at death for additional studies. Autopsies indicated a significant methylation dysregulation difference between these six autopsy samples and the patient s initial tumor sample at diagnosis.The researchers plan to expand the study to include a larger group with a phase 2 clinical trial of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Future studies could also include combinations of epigenetic drugs with immunotherapy.Reference: Salas LA, Stewart TG, Mobley BC, et al.

Lurie Children s Hospital of Chicago developed a unique nanoparticle to deliver genome editing technology, including CRISPR/Cas9, to endothelial cells, which are cells that line blood vessel walls. This is the first time that vascular endothelial cells could be reached for genome editing, since the usual way to deliver CRISPR/Cas9   through a virus   does not work for this cell type. Findings were published in the journal Cell Reports. The nanoparticle we developed is a powerful new delivery system for genome editing in vascular endothelial cells, and could be used to treat many diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe COVID-19,  said senior author Dr. Zhao from Lurie Children s.  With this nanoparticle we can introduce genes to inhibit vascular injury and/or promote vascular repair, correct gene mutations and turn genes on or off to restore normal function. It also allows us to edit multiple genes at the same time. This is an important advance for treating any disease caused by endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is at the root of many diseases, such as coronary artery disease, stroke, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary artery hypertension. Dr. Zhao explained that genome editing in endothelial cells could even treat cancers by cutting off the blood supply to the tumor or blocking cancer metastasis.At this stage, Dr. Zhao and colleagues achieved excellent results in a mouse model. The nanoparticle carrying CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid DNA was introduced via a one-time IV injection and required a few days to be effective. Preclinical testing will be necessary before clinical trials can begin. Our nanoparticle delivery system for genome editing and transgene expression also is a huge advance for cardiovascular research,  added Dr. Zhao.Reference: Zhang X, Jin H, Huang X, et al.

Current transport methods use dry ice to maintain desired temperatures. However, longer travel times, particularly to remote locations without supportive infrastructure, require extended refrigeration.In a study, researchers collaborated with Carrier and created a testbed using a lightweight aluminum container equipped with a refrigeration system, vaccine packages and optimal cargo layout and storage rack design that kept temperatures consistent and uniform throughout the container. Simulation studies demonstrated this method can hold required temperatures twice as long. We significantly increased the dry ice life, providing reliable temperature control and a safe, secure solution for cooling vaccines for transport and last mile storage,  ORNL s Jian Sun said.Reference: Sun J, Zhang M, Gehl A, et al.

Given their central role in gene expression, growth and development, it is not surprising that NPC defects are linked to many diseases such as viral infections, cancers and certain neurodegenerative diseases, and that nuclear transport is a target for possible therapeutics.Using rapid plunge freezing and cryo-EM (electron microscopy) with computational methods, researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) have produced a comprehensive model of the yeast NPC which reveals the interconnected architecture of its core scaffold. This work provides molecular models for two configurations: one that is easier to study in isolated samples to provide a more detailed overview of a radially-compact form and a second expanded form in the living yeast cell, albeit this ""in situ"" form is currently visualized with a lower level of detail. This research significantly extends our understanding of the architecture of the NPC from brewers' yeast, a model organism that is used to study the biology of cells that contain a nucleus and thus provides new insights on multiple levels into the functions of this transport machine,  explains corresponding author Christopher W. Akey, PhD, professor of physiology and biophysics at BUSM.According to researchers, this model will provide a better understanding of how these large mega-channels assemble and how they can flex and adapt to changes in transport by expansion of their central passageway.  Moreover, we have observed multiple types of NPC in the same cell for the first time, which reflects the lego-like ability of this assembly to use interchangeable parts to modify its architecture on the nuclear side. This adaptability may play a role in tailoring the functions of these machines for different local environments at the periphery of the nucleus,  says Akey.The researchers believe that these findings now set the table for studies of how viruses may usurp this important pathway to infect cells and alter their physiology to cause disease.

Using a single injection of a low dose gene therapy vector, researchers restored the ability of injured muscle fibers to repair in a way that reduced muscle degeneration and enhanced the functioning of the diseased muscle. The treatment was safe, attenuated fibro-fatty muscle degeneration, and restored myofiber size and muscle strength, according to the study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. With an incidence of less than 1 in 100,000, LGMD2B is a rare disorder caused by a genetic mutation in a large gene called dysferlin. This faulty gene leads to muscle weakness in the arms, legs, shoulder and pelvic girdle. Affected children and adults face trouble walking, climbing stairs, and getting out of chairs. Individuals typically lose the ability to walk within years after the onset of symptoms, and often need assistance with everyday tasks such as showering, dressing and transferring.This study described a new approach that avoids the need for packaging a large gene, like dysferlin, or giving a large vector dose to target the muscles, which are bottlenecks faced in ongoing gene therapy efforts aimed at muscular dystrophies. Currently, patients with LGMD2B have no gene or drug-based therapies available to them, and we are amongst the few centers developing therapeutic approaches for this disease,  said Jyoti K. Jaiswal, M.Sc. Ph.D., senior investigator of the Center for Genetic Medicine Research at Children's National.  We are working to further enhance the efficacy of this approach and perform a longer-term safety and efficacy study to enable the clinical translation of this therapy. The genetic defect in dysferlin that is associated with LGMD2B causes the encoded protein to be truncated or degraded. This hinders the muscle fiber s ability to heal, which is required for healthy muscles. In recessive genetic disorders, like LGMD2B, common pre-clinical gene therapy approaches usually target the mutated gene in the muscle, making them capable of producing the missing proteins. The large size of the gene mutated in this disease, and impediments in body-wide delivery of gene therapy vectors to reach all the muscles, pose significant challenges for developing gene therapies to treat this disease,  said Jaiswal.To overcome these challenges, the researchers found another way to slow down the disease s progression. The authors built upon their previous discovery that acid sphingomyelinase (hASM) protein is required to repair injured muscle cells. In this current work, the research team administered a single in vivo dose of an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector that produces a secreted version of hASM in the liver, which then was delivered to the muscles via blood circulation at a level determined to be efficacious in repairing LGMD2B patient s injured muscle cells. Increased muscle degeneration necessitates greater muscle regeneration, and we found that improved repair of dysferlin-deficient myofibers by hASM-AAV reduces the need for regeneration, causing a 2-fold decrease in the number of regenerated myofibers,  said Daniel Bittel, D.P.T., PhD., research postdoctoral fellow of the Center for Genetic Medicine Research at Children's National and a lead author of this study.Sreetama Sen Chandra, Ph.D., who was a research postdoctoral fellow at Children s National at the time of this study and served as co-lead author, also added that  these findings are also of interest to patients with Niemann-Pick disease type A since the pre-clinical model for this disease also manifests poor sarcolemma repair.

Our results suggest that one autoimmune disease, such as inflammatory arthritis, may also lead to a secondary autoimmune disease such as AxSpA,  said the study s lead author Nirmal Banda, PhD, professor in the division of rheumatology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.  This interesting disease association may be due to the binding of anti-collagen autoantibodies to the spine, or to some alteration of the immune system that requires further investigation. These same anti-collagen antibodies are also present in humans with arthritis. They directly attack joint cartilage resulting in inflammation and pain.Banda noted that every mouse injected with collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) developed arthritis and then curvature of the spine consistent with axial spondyloarthritis. I began to notice the proliferation of bone in the spine and fusing of the vertebrate,  he said.  The  normal spaces between the spine vertebrate in certain location were disappearing. This is similar to what happens to humans with AxSpA. The connection, he said, has not been made in any other study he s seen. I believe we are the first to make this link,  he said.But exactly how one autoimmune disease could trigger another remains a mystery, one that Banda hopes to investigate. I want to know what the mechanism is,  he said.In the meantime, he suggested that those with an autoimmune disease be vigilant in case they develop another. I believe because of our changing environment we are seeing a growth in autoimmune diseases,  he said.  There are already connections between gum disease and rheumatoid arthritis and dry age-related macular degeneration and rheumatoid arthritis. I believe this is an area that needs further exploration.

The drug, called NXP800, was discovered at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and targets the pathway regulated by the HSF1 transcription factor. HSFI is a  master switch  in cells that controls the activity of a variety of genes   and its signalling is hijacked by a variety of cancers to support their growth and spread.The phase I clinical trial is sponsored by oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company Nuvectis Pharma, which is now leading the drug s development.The trial is being led by Professor Udai Banerji, Deputy Director of Drug Development at the ICR and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, in patients with advanced cancers.The trial will have two parts: dose escalation, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NXP800, and dose expansion, which will also evaluate its anti-tumour activity. The dose-expansion phase will focus on evaluating NXP800 in patients selected using biomarker analysis, initially in clear cell ovarian and endometrioid ovarian cancers.Preclinical studies in cancer cells and in mice have suggested the drug could be particularly effective in women with ovarian clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancers with defects in the ARID1A gene.During the trial, expert teams in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics from the ICR will lead on gathering data on the molecular effects of NXP800 and how it is processed by the body. Biomarkers will be measured to form a  pharmacological audit trail' of the drug s behaviour. The trial follows the discovery of NXP800 in a multi-year project carried out by an ICR team led by Professor Paul Workman, Harrap Professor of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at ICR, with earlier work supported by the ICR and funding organisations including Cancer Research UK, the Battle Against Cancer Investment Trust (BACIT) and the CRT Pioneer Fund LP  a specialist oncology investment fund managed by Sixth Element Capital. The medicinal chemistry component of the multidisciplinary research project was led by Professor Keith Jones at the ICR.Trial chief investigator Professor Udai Banerji, Deputy Director of Drug Development at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said: We re very pleased to begin the first trial of this innovative new drug, NXP800, in partnership with Nuvectis. We look forward to assessing the drug s safety and pharmacokinetics, checking it is acting on cancer signalling as expected, and optimising its dose and schedule. We hope to unlock its therapeutic potential in specific hard-to-treat cancers where new treatments are urgently needed.  Professor Kristian Helin, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: We re delighted to see this innovative inhibitor of HSF1 signalling enter its first clinical trial. I hope the results of clinical trials will show that this new drug can make a real difference in the treatment of cancers patients, including those with clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancers. NXP800 is the 12th ICR-discovered drug we ve taken into clinical trials for cancer patients since 2005, in collaboration with industrial partners like Nuvectis. That track record is unrivalled in the academic world. Ron Bentsur, Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nuvectis, said:  We are pleased to have achieved this important milestone in the NXP800 development programme. NXP800 has demonstrated great promise in preclinical studies, and we re excited to advance it into clinical trials.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

One of the most appealing properties of ELMs is self-healing, since the encapsulated cells of the biofilm can self-regenerate and heal the material over time.This self-healing process is caused, in theory, by cell growth, which takes hours. However, in applications involving soft and conformable devices, the healing process needs to happen in minutes, which is obviously much faster than cell cycles.Previous studies have reported the engineering of fast self-healing material by incorporating non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds. Inspired by this strategy, the scientists from SIAT sought to functionalize each bacterium with non-covalent binding groups to generate macroscopic living functional materials by adhering bacteria together.Previously, David S. Glass et al. developed a synthetic bacterial cell-cell adhesion toolbox based on outer membrane-anchored nanobody (Nb)-antigen (Ag) pairs.Using this toolbox, the team engineered cells to display nanobodies or antigens on their surfaces and cultured these cells separately in liquid cultures. Mixing the two populations in large quantities generated processable macroscopic materials known as ""living assembled material by bacterial adhesion"" (LAMBA).LAMBA demonstrates better mechanical properties and processability than individual cells (Nb-cells or Ag-cells) and can be subjected to versatile engineering methods to fabricate macroscale or microscale objects.By functionalizing LAMBA extracellularly and intracellularly, the material is able to degrade organophosphate pesticides through a hybrid enzyme inorganic sequential catalysis or synthesize trehalose by harnessing extracellular-intracellular bioconversions.LAMBA also can self-heal. Besides the self-healing process led by cell growth, adhesion between Nb-Ag pairs leads to the recovery of the material s property within several minutes. For example, sliced LAMBA, after recovery, can maintain its conductivity under multiple cycles of stretching.The team assembled stretchable LAMBA sensors to detect bioelectrical or biomechanical signals. Results showed that the stretchable LAMBA strain sensor could report a finger joint bending in a stable and reliable manner, while a traditional stretchable sensor made of gold film lost function easily due to the large deformation of the finger joint.The LAMBA strain sensor functioned properly to monitor finger-joint bending with repeated usage (25-150 finger-bending cycles) every day for a month.This work established a novel methodology for assembling living material by bacterial adhesion. Inspiration from polymer physics armed the bacteria with non-covalent binding groups that can self-heal in minutes.The genetically editable cells allow flexible programming of living functional material such that the materials can be used in biomanufacturing and bioremediation.Reference: Chen B, Kang W, Sun J, et al.

The findings are published in the Journal of Translational Medicine. When people are infected with a virus or other pathogen, their bodies unleash proteins called antibodies that detect foreign substances and keep them from invading cells. In some cases, however, people produce autoantibodies that can attack the body s own organs and tissues over time. The Cedars-Sinai investigators found that people with prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have a wide variety of autoantibodies up to six months after they have fully recovered. Prior to this study, researchers knew that severe cases of COVID-19 can stress the immune system so much that autoantibodies are produced. This study is the first to report not only the presence of elevated autoantibodies after mild or asymptomatic infection, but their persistence over time.  These findings help to explain what makes COVID-19 an especially unique disease,  said Justyna Fert-Bober, PhD, research scientist in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute and co-senior author of the study.  These patterns of immune dysregulation could be underlying the different types of persistent symptoms we see in people who go on to develop the condition now referred to as long COVID-19. To conduct their study, the Cedars-Sinai research team recruited 177 people with confirmed evidence of a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. They compared blood samples from these individuals with samples taken from healthy people prior to the pandemic. All those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had elevated levels of autoantibodies. Some of the autoantibodies also have been found in people with diseases in which the immune system attacks its own healthy cells, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  We found signals of autoantibody activity that are usually linked to chronic inflammation and injury involving specific organ systems and tissues such as the joints, skin and nervous system,  said Susan Cheng, MD, MPH, MMSc, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute and co-senior author of the study. Some of the autoantibodies have been linked to autoimmune diseases that typically affect women more often than men. In this study, however, men had a higher number of elevated autoantibodies than women.  On the one hand, this finding is paradoxical given that autoimmune conditions are usually more common in females,  Fert-Bober said.  On the other hand, it is also somewhat expected given all that we know about males being more vulnerable to the most severe forms of COVID-19.  The research team is interested in expanding the study to look for the types of autoantibodies that may be present and persist in people with long-haul COVID-19 symptoms. Because this study was in people infected before the advent of vaccines, the researchers will also examine whether autoantibodies are similarly generated in people with breakthrough infections.  If we can better understand these autoantibody responses, and how it is that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers and drives these variable responses, then we can get one step closer to identifying ways to treat and even prevent these effects from developing in people at risk,  Cheng said.Reference Liu Y, Ebinger JE, Mostafa R, et al.

We ll be able to take a drop of blood in a community setting such as a barbershop and be able to deliver results in 10 to 15 minutes right there, which can indicate when somebody needs to come in for further tests,  said Dr. Saurabh Mehta, the Janet and Gordon Lankton Professor in the Division of Nutritional Sciences and the paper s senior author. Balaji Srinivasan, a research associate in Mehta s research group, is the paper s first author. It s creating that first point of contact that hopefully builds rapport and brings health care services to the people at the point of need,  Mehta said.The kit comes with a test strip, similar to those found in at-home COVID-19 antigen or pregnancy tests. Users would draw a drop of blood and apply it to the test strip, and in about 15 minutes, two lines appear on the strip.The color of the two lines is due to 150-nanometer gold nanoshells, which greatly enhance the test s sensitivity to detect PSAs and make the lines appear more intense in their presence, Srinivasan said. While a pregnancy test gives a positive or negative result, the cube reader senses the intensity of the test strip lines and then calculates and displays a measurement of PSA concentration in the blood. Another advantage of test strips is that the technology to make them really cheap or mass produce them has been around for many years,  Srinivasan said. He estimates that PSA test kits may be mass produced and sold for a few dollars each.While a different PSA test kit developed by a private company has been approved by the FDA, it works by putting a blood sample into a microfluidic channel and has a larger bench-top analyzer, making it less portable and more expensive to own and operate.Study co-author David Erickson, the S.C. Thomas Sze Director and Sibley College Professor in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, has worked with Mehta to also develop a mobile phone-based system to detect infectious diseases, inflammation and nutritional deficiencies in saliva. Meanwhile, co-author Dr. David Nanus, professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and a member of the Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, reached out to Mehta wanting to collaborate on a portable PSA screening device to reach underserved populations.African American men frequently do not have access to prostate cancer PSA screening and are diagnosed with more advanced prostate cancer, contributing to disproportionately higher mortality rates. PSA testing frequency has declined among all U.S. ethnic and racial groups over the last decade, with the rate of decline steeper for African American men, particularly those between 40 and 54 years old. Close to 43% of African American men aged 41 and older have never had a PSA test, according to one study. There is a need for increasing access to PSA screening among African American men who are otherwise not able to get tested periodically, and one of the ways is we take the test to them at various community settings,  Srinivasan said.Reference: Srinivasan B, Nanus DM, Erickson D, Mehta S.

Together with the retailer Lidl Switzerland, Empa researchers have now developed a protective cover for fruit and vegetables based on renewable raw materials. For this project, Lidl chose Empa as a partner because Empa had decades of research experience with cellulose products. In Empa's Cellulose & Wood Materials laboratory, the researchers then spent more than a year developing a special protective cellulose coating that can be applied to fruits and vegetables. The result: Coated fruits and vegetables stay fresh significantly longer. In tests, the shelf life of, for instance, bananas was extended by more than a week. This significantly reduces food waste. ""The big goal is that such bio-coatings will be able to replace a lot of petroleum-based packaging in the future,"" says Gustav Nystr m, head of the Empa lab.    The idea is to process so-called pomace into fibrillated cellulose. Pomace is the solid residue left over after extracting the juice from fruit, vegetables or plants. Previously, this plant leftover was disposed of in biogas plants or directly on the field; in the future, it will be used to create a protective coating for fresh fruit. The coating is either sprayed onto the fruit or applied to the produce as a dip and is easy to wash off. As it is harmless to the consumer, it can also be consumed without harm. The potential of cellulose coatings is by no means exploited yet; there is the possibility of adding additives such as vitamins or antioxidants. In summer, the highly promising preliminary study, which has been ongoing since 2019, was successfully completed and the main study launched. The cellulose layer developed at Empa will be tested and further improved over the next two years together with Lidl Switzerland and a fruit and vegetable supplier. The project is supported by Innosuisse, the Swiss innovation agency. The aim is for the new technology to be used in all 150 Lidl stores throughout Switzerland following the successful main trial.ReferenceAmoroso L, De France KJ, Milz CI, Siqueira G, Zimmermann T, Nystr m G.

Early research has indicated a potential for psilocybin therapy to treat these groups, but no trials have been undertaken at the scale needed for regulatory approval to make the therapy available.The trial is the first of its kind to thoroughly investigate the simultaneous administration of psilocybin. 89 healthy participants with no recent (within 1 year) use of psilocybin were recruited. 60 individuals were randomly picked to receive either a 10mg or 25mg dose of psilocybin in a controlled environment. In addition, all participants were provided with one-to-one support from trained psychotherapists. The remaining 29 participants acted as the control group and received a placebo, also with psychological support.Participants were closely monitored for six to eight hours following administration of psilocybin and then followed up for 12 weeks. During this time, they were assessed for a number of possible changes, including sustained attention, memory, and planning, as well as their ability to process emotions. Throughout the study, there were no instances of anyone withdrawing from the study due to an adverse event, and no consistent trends to suggest that either of the psilocybin doses had any short- or long-term detrimental effects on participants.Professor Guy Goodwin, Chief Medical Officer, COMPASS Pathways, said:  This study was an early part of our clinical development programme for COMP360 psilocybin therapy. It explored the safety and feasibility of simultaneous psilocybin administration, with 1:1 support, in healthy participants, and provided a strong foundation to which we have now added positive results from our phase IIb trial in 233 patients with TRD, and from our open-label study of patients taking SSRI antidepressants alongside psilocybin therapy. We are looking forward to finalising plans for our phase III programme, which we expect to begin in Q3 2022. The investigators have since completed Phase II of the study, which has explored the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in people living with TRD and PTSD, and are analysing the data.Reference: Rucker JJ, Marwood L, Ajantaival R-LJ, et al.

This is shown by a new research result from Aarhus University. The results have just been published in the scientific journal Stroke.There should be more vegetables and less meat on the plate in front of us. A study from the Department of Public Health shows that a sustainable diet not only benefits the climate, but also benefits your health.""If adult men or women follow a sustainable diet and the Nordic recommendations for dietary fibre intake, then we see a lower risk of bleeding or blood clots in the brain,"" says Christina Dahm, who is behind the study.This knowledge is important, as a previous study from the UK found that vegetarians had a higher risk of brain haemorrhages compared with those who ate meat. These findings received a lot of publicity.""A vegetarian diet is very similar to a sustainable diet, and since we need to eat more sustainably in the future, it was a rather worrying result. Our results show that it is safe to eat a sustainable diet,"" says Daniel Ibsen, who has also contributed to the study.The researchers used data from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health population study. A total of 57,053 adults aged 50 to 64 took part in the study in the early 1990s, and answered questions about their eating habits and lifestyles. In the following years, researchers have been able to use the Danish registers to identify participants who developed bleeding and blood clots in the brain.""The food we eat has a crucial influence on our health, but also affects our climate and the environment. We need to eat more sustainably, but of course it s important that we also have a healthy diet,"" says Christina Dahm.According to Christina Dahm, the study should be followed up in the context of today's Danish dietary habits, which contain an increased amount of new sustainable foods such as oat milk and plant-based meat alternatives, as well as studies that examine more specifically how Danes can become better at complying with climate-friendly dietary advice.At the beginning of the year, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Denmark, and the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, launched some climate-friendly dietary recommendations that resemble sustainable diets.

This irradiation disturbs the position and behavior of atoms, which can affect the conversion of mechanical stresses into electricity. Sensors made of piezoelectric materials could help guide the design of prototype nuclear reactors and monitor the health of aging reactors   if the materials can withstand extreme conditions. The researchers investigated aluminum nitride doped with scandium. Compared to undoped material, doped material had a heightened piezoelectric response and improved resilience to irradiation damage.  With theory and experiment, we improved our understanding of how damage is induced in sensors inside a nuclear reactor and how irradiation affects the piezoelectric properties,  said ORNL s Eva Zarkadoula, who led the study.

As illustrated by our study of the fossil record, that's not necessarily the case."" Previous research has shown that brown bears (or grizzly bears) disappeared from some parts of North America for thousands of years prior to the last Ice Age. They later reappeared, walking from Russia to Alaska across the Bering Land Bridge   possibly at the same time as people moved across the Bridge into North America too. But no-one knows exactly why they disappeared in the first place, which is why studying this event is important. A key finding of the new research is that cave lions from the same area became extinct more than once   before their final extinction they also disappeared and reappeared thousands of years later, around the same time as bears. There is no evidence that people caused these temporary disappearances, and cold Ice Age conditions were not to blame. Instead, it looks like a smoking gun pointing to some kind of change in their ecosystem,  Dr Mitchell said.The timing of lions and bear extinction from parts of North America (specifically Alaska and the Yukon Territory) coincides with evidence of widespread vegetation change in the region. The researchers suggest that warm temperatures before the last Ice Age may have caused a change in the abundance of different kinds of plants, which had knock-on effects on herbivores and then their predators (like bears and lions).Colder temperatures leading up to the last Ice Age might have reversed this change and made the area more hospitable for herbivores, and in turn their predators. Lead author from the University of Adelaide Dr Alexander Salis said:  The shared patterns of dispersal between lions and bears correspond with the presence of the Bering Land Bridge that connected Russia and Alaska during Ice Ages. The Bridge was periodically exposed and inundated by changing sea levels during the last few Ice Ages, allowing intermittent dispersal of animals and people between continents and changing the faunal composition. While many might think that species arrive in a region and stay put, we show that the past was much more dynamic, involving multiple waves of dispersal and local extinctions in this case.

Anybody who is in health care or has a family member who has had surgery knows that pain control is important, but narcotics can produce many adverse effects,  said G. Ying Li, M.D., lead author of the study and service chief of pediatric orthopaedics at U-M Health C.S. Mott Children s Hospital.  Reducing the number of opioids consumed by adding non-narcotic medications, which is termed  multimodal pain management,  makes for a much better experience for adolescents undergoing this procedure for scoliosis.""For a long time, the average length of stay after spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis, or a curve in the spine, was between four and five days. During that time, the adolescents who had rods and screws inserted to fuse their spines into a straighter position would receive narcotics either intravenously or through a catheter that went into the spinal canal after surgery.Li worked with Rebecca Hong, M.D., co-author and clinical assistant professor of anesthesiology at U-M Health, to begin administering morphine intrathecally, or through a single injection into the fluid around the spinal cord, without the need for any IV narcotics after surgery. With improved pain control, they were able to reduce the average hospital stay to only two days, and the practice became standard at the hospital. Still, side effects persisted among patients.For the study, published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research, researchers examined the postoperative course of 50 adolescents with scoliosis who had spinal fusion surgery. Half were given intrathecal morphine only while the other 25 also received gabapentin before and after the procedure. All patients received Tylenol, ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant.Researchers found that approximately half of the group who took gabapentin experienced nausea, vomiting and itching after surgery, compared to over 70-80% of the group who received solely intrathecal morphine. The first group also had significantly lower mean total oxycodone consumption during the hospitalization and had more consistent pain scores with fewer reported spikes. Our use of intrathecal morphine and transitioning directly to oral pain medications the day after surgery had already led to our patients getting discharged sooner after this surgery than at most other children s hospitals because their pain was so well-controlled,  Hong said.  However, we continually seek to improve our process, and our patients  and their family s satisfaction with the care they receive here. The addition of gabapentin has helped in regard to both metrics. Future studies are needed for clinicians to find the optimal dosing for the gabapentin-intrathecal morphine combination, researchers concluded. But the method of reducing opioid intake by adding gabapentin has potential to be considered for other procedures beyond spinal fusion for scoliosis, which is a procedure that approximately 38,000 children in the United States undergo every year, Li said. What a lot of providers want is to be able to provide multimodal pain management, not just for kids and orthopaedic surgery,  she said.  During this opioid epidemic, we want to provide options that include non-narcotics to decrease the amount of narcotics we are prescribing and, ultimately, decrease the amount of leftover narcotics at home that can get into the wrong hands.

To increase their chances of survival, they activate the heat shock response, a molecular pathway also employed by human and animal cells for stress protection. Researchers from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have now discovered that plant steroid hormones can promote this response in plants.It may be hard to remember in winter, but July 2021 was the hottest month ever documented. In the USA, the mean temperature was higher than the average for July by 2,6 degrees Fahrenheit, and many southern European countries saw temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius including an all-time high temperature of 48,8 degrees Celsius recorded on the eastern coast of Sicily in Italy.The past few decades have seen increased incidences of heat waves with record highs around the globe, and this is seen as a result of climate change. Heat waves have been occurring more frequently, have been hotter, and have been lasting longer with severe consequences not only for humans and animals but also for plants.  Heat stress can negatively affect plants in their natural habitats and destabilize ecosystems while also drastically reducing crop harvests, thereby threatening our food security,  says Brigitte Poppenberger, Professor for Biotechnology of Horticultural Crops. To survive short periods of heat stress, plants activate a molecular pathway called the heat-shock response. This heat-shock response (common to all organisms) protects cells from damage inflicted by proteotoxic stress, which damages proteins. Such stress is not only caused by heat but can also result from exposure to certain toxins, UV light, or soil salinity. The heat shock response protects cells in various ways, one of them being production of so-called heat-shock proteins, which serve as molecular shields that protect proteins by preventing misfolding. Plants respond to heat stress by activating heat shock factors and also other molecular players. In particular, hormones as chemical messengers are involved. Among the hormones that plants produce are the brassinosteroids, which primarily regulate their growth and developments. But, in addition to their growth-promoting properties, brassinosteroids have other interesting abilities, one of them being their ability to increase the heat stress resistance of plants, and researchers at TUM have recently discovered what contributes to this protective ability.Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a research group led by Prof. Brigitte Poppenberger has been able to elucidate how a specific transcription factor - a special protein responsible for switching certain sections of the DNA on or off - is regulated by brassinosteroids. This transcription factor, called BES1, can interact with heat shock factors thereby allowing genetic information to be targeted towards increased synthesis of heat shock proteins.When BES1 activity is increased, plants become more resistant to heat stress, and when it is decreased, they become more sensitive to it. Furthermore, the group has demonstrated that BES1 is activated by heat stress and that this activation is stimulated by brassinosteroids.  These results are not only of interest to biologists trying to expand our understanding of the heat shock response but also have potential for practical application in agriculture and horticulture,  says Prof. Poppenberger.Bio-stimulants containing brassinosteroids are available and can be tested for their ability to increase heat stress resistance in plants. Such substances are natural products that are approved for organic farming and thus could be used without problems. Alternatively, BES1 may be an interesting target for breeding approaches. This could be used to create varieties that are more resistant to heat stress and thus provide more stable yields in the event of future heat waves.Reference: Albertos P, et al.

Their research, published in Nature Immunology, could potentially open opportunities for designing drug treatment strategies to target malignant cells in many cancers.The new research was led by LJI Professor Anjana Rao, Ph.D., in the LJI Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, and experiments were spearheaded by LJI Instructor Vipul Shukla, Ph.D., (soon to be an Assistant Professor at Northwestern University) and UC San Diego Graduate Student Daniela Samaniego-Castruita.The new research helps scientists finally link two dangerous phenomena in cancer cells.In previous studies, scientists spotted mutations that cause TET enzymes to lose their function in many patients with blood cancers and solid cancers. Researchers have also found that genomic instability, such as double-stranded breaks in the DNA code, are a common feature in cancer cells.In this project, scientists explored one potential way in which TET deficiency is connected to genomic instability.""This study provides insights about an important question in the field,"" says Shukla.By studying a mouse model of lymphoma, the researchers found that deleting TET2 and TET3 enzymes in mature B cells had huge consequences for B-cell homeostasis. ""The TET-deficient mice developed lymphoma, and we observed an increase in marks associated with genomic instability, such as double strand breaks,"" says Samaniego-Castruita.The team then performed genomic analysis for clues to what was happening at the molecular level. They saw that without TET2 and TET3, the DNA became riddled with unusual DNA structures called G-quadruplexes and R-loops.DNA normally has two strands running parallel to each other, like two rails of a ladder. R-loops appear when a third rail, made of RNA, slips in and forces a gap between the two DNA rails. G-quadruplexes act like knots on the DNA rails. Both R-loops and G-quadruplexes make it hard for the original two rails of DNA to ""unzip"" as the cell tries to read the DNA code and keep the cell working properly.Shulka and Samaniego-Castruita examined these DNA structures in depth thanks to funding from the La Jolla Institute's Tullie and Rickey Families SPARK Awards for Innovations in Immunology. ""These structures represent sites in the DNA that are much more fragile than other regions,"" says Shukla. ""With this study, we found that TET enzymes are perhaps related to the regulation of these structures, which could in turn explain one mechanism for acquisition of genomic instability in the absence of TET enzymes.""When it comes to B cell malignancies, G-quadruplexes and R-loops appear to be a missing link between tell-tale TET mutations and dangerous genomic instability.So if G-quadruplexes and R-loops are causing problems, is there a way to stop them from forming?Shukla and Samaniego-Castruita observed that DNMT1 was upregulated in TET-deficient B cells. DNMT1 is a key enzyme responsible for maintaining marks on DNA called ""DNA methylation."" DNA methylation is an important regulatory mark in the genome, and is normally removed through the activity of TET enzymes.Without TET enzymes, the normal give-and-take of DNA methylation marks was broken. So in their next experiment, the scientists also deleted the Dnmt1 gene in TET-deficient B cells in mice to test if levels of G quadruplexes and R-loops could be altered upon removal of DNMT1 protein.Indeed, deleting DNMT1 was associated with a striking delay in the development of aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Deleting DNMT1 was also associated with decreased levels of G-quadruplexes and R-loops, says Samaniego-Castruita.The researchers emphasize that regulating G-quadruplexes and R-loops may be just one way TET enzymes control genomic stability. There's also more work to be done to uncover the precise steps that lead TET-deficient cells to accumulate these enigmatic structures in DNA. Someday, the team hopes to devise strategies through which G-quadruplexes and R-loops could be targeted to help cancer patients.As the Rao Lab continues investigating the effects of TET enzymes, Shukla will be joining the faculty of the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Northwestern University this winter. He plans to launch his own laboratory focused on studying alternative structural conformations in DNA.Reference: Shukla V, Samaniego-Castruita D, Dong Z, et al.

Medical treatments for children often lag woefully behind those of adults because of the separate formulations and studies that are needed. With the evidence from ODYSSEY which used simplified dosing, this treatment gap has been reduced and we hope that countries can quickly scale up children s access to treatment globally. Lead author Dr Anna Turkova (MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL) said:  About 1.8 million children live with HIV but they have had limited treatment options, with medicines that taste unpalatable, that need to be taken twice a day, or that come in large pills that are difficult to swallow. Dolutegravir is given in small tablets usually once a day and the baby pills can be dispersed in water, meaning it s a lot easier for young children to take. This is important in encouraging uptake of the treatment and adherence to it over many years. Sadly, only about half of children living with HIV are currently receiving treatment, and those who are not treated face high risks of impaired immunity and worsening health. In the study, researchers found that 14% of children receiving dolutegravir experienced treatment failure over two years compared to 22% of children receiving standard treatment. Treatment failure was deemed to occur if the virus became measurable in the blood   i.e. it was not fully suppressed   or if the child had symptoms of HIV-related ill health. Such a failure may be a result of the drug not being taken as well as the drug not working.Evidence from adults shows dolutegravir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, meaning viruses are less likely to become resistant to it over time. This was replicated in the ODYSSEY trial, with much less resistance occurring among children and adolescents on dolutegravir-based treatment.  Past studies have suggested dolutegravir may be associated with weight gain among adults but the researchers said the new findings were reassuring for children, with those given dolutegravir gaining 1kg more and growing 1cm higher over two years   both indicating better growth rather than abnormal weight gain. Children in the dolutegravir arm had better lipid profiles, meaning lower risk of cardiovascular disease in the long term.In the main trial, the children all weighed over 14kg and most were aged six and over. The therapy s effectiveness was also looked at among young children and babies weighing under 14kg, enrolled as a separate group in the trial; results are yet to be published.The trial participants were enrolled in Uganda, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Thailand, the UK, Spain, Portugal and Germany. Most of the participants were based in sub-Saharan Africa, where most children living with HIV are.Earlier findings from the ODYSSEY trial showed that children weighing 20kg or more could safely take adult-strength tablets of dolutegravir, informing WHO dosing guidance and contributing to new licences for the drug in the United States and Europe during 2020.Dr Cissy Kityo, from the Joint Clinical Research Centre in Uganda, the country enrolling most children into ODYSSEY, said:  Simplifying the dosing is crucial.

Recent studies have shown variation in the gene-expression profile and phenotype of microglia across brain regions and between different age and disease states. But the molecular mechanisms that contribute to these transcriptomic changes in the human brain are not well understood. Now, a new study targets the methylation profile of microglia from human brain.The study appears in  Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier.Microglia, the brain s own immune cells, were once thought of as a homogenous population that was either  activated  or  inactivated,  with either pro-inflammatory or neuroprotective effects. But the cells are now recognized to have a vast array of phenotypes depending on environmental conditions with myriad functional consequences. Microglia are increasingly appreciated as critical players in neurologic and psychiatric disorders.Fatemeh Haghighi, PhD, senior author of the new work, said:  To address this gap in knowledge, we set out to characterize the DNA methylation landscape of human primary microglia cells and factors that contribute to variations in the microglia methylome. DNA methylation is the main form of epigenetic regulation, which determines the pattern of which genes are being turned  on  or  off  in various circumstances over time.The researchers studied isolated microglia cells from post-mortem human brain tissue from 22 donors of various age, including 1 patient with schizophrenia, 13 with mood disorder, and 8 controls with no psychiatric disorder, taken from 4 brain regions. They analyzed the microglia using genome-scale methylation microarrays.Unsurprisingly, microglia showed DNA methylation profiles that were distinct from other cells in the central nervous system. But less expected, said Haghighi,  we found that interindividual differences rather than brain region differences had a much larger effect on the DNA methylation variability.  In addition, an exploratory analysis showed differences in the methylation profile of microglia from brains of subjects with psychiatric disorders compared to controls.John Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry, said of the work,  These promising data point to pathology of the microglia, key immune cells of the brain, in the biology of depression.

They created a dictionary that links brain activity patterns to simple actions. The finding helps them to understand how the brain decides the timing of future actions, and connects small actions into larger sequences.He and his team reported their results October 29 in the journal Neuron. In this paper, we figured out what the laws were in the brain to create simple behavioral sequences,  Mazzucato said.Every complex behavior is made up of a series of simpler actions, just as a sentence can be deconstructed into the strung-together syllables of words. While there s flexibility in how those steps can be put together, there are also rules governing what combinations make sense and what don t.Take walking across a room, for instance. The pace of one s steps might vary, but it would be unusual to see two left-foot steps in a row. Predicting complicated behaviors requires understanding this grammar both the ways that behaviors are constrained, and the way they aren t.Mazzucato wants to figure out how what makes an animal decide to take a certain action at a specific time, and how that choice is represented in the brain.He and his team, led by postdocs Stefano Recanatesi and Ulises Pereira, partnered up with neuroscientist Zachary Mainen at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal. They set up an experiment in which they trained rats to poke their noses into a spot on the cage wall, and then move to another place in the cage to get a drink of water. If the rats went for the reward immediately, they got a small sip; if they could wait for 10 or 20 seconds, they got more water. The rats  series of actions were relatively fixed, but each animal could choose the timing.While the rats were scurrying around, the researchers tracked the activity of large groups of neurons in a part of the brain called the motor cortex, which is involved in planning movements.The rats  future intentions were represented by the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons in the motor cortex, the researchers found. Each action created a distinct signature in the motor cortex, with a group of neurons behaving in a coordinated and consistent way. When a rat was getting ready to switch to a different action, the neural signature suddenly changed. For every action the animal was performing in the cage, we were able to understand what calculations the neurons were doing in that brain,  Mazzucato said.  We could predict what the animal would do a few hundred milliseconds before they did it . That is, they could distinguish between rats who were going to go for the reward immediately, versus those who were holding out for a bigger drink of water, just by looking at brain activity.They could also replicate the variability of rats  choices via a set of mathematical equations called a recurrent neural network, an example of brain-inspired artificial intelligence.  Now that we have a model, we can generalize it,  Mazzucato said.Here, the team focused on just one behavioral variable, the timing of actions. But in the future, they hope to investigate similar questions around choice and decision-making in scenarios that more closely mimic the complexity of real life.Reference: Recanatesi S, Pereira-Obilinovic U, Murakami M, Mainen Z, Mazzucato L.

Yet, little is known about how DNA is preserved in sediment for long periods of time. An international team of researchers involving scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig and other institutions in Germany, Australia, Portugal, and Russia have now shed light on the matter by isolating DNA from solid blocks of undisturbed sediment that are embedded in plastic resin. The study reveals that ancient human and animal DNA is concentrated in small  hot spots , particularly in microscopic particles of bone or feces. Micro-sampling of such particles can recover substantial amounts of DNA from ancient humans, such as Neanderthals, and other species and link them to archaeological and ecological records at a microscopic scale.Sediments in which archaeological finds are embedded have long been regarded by most archaeologists as unimportant by-products of excavations. However, in recent years it has been shown that sediments can contain ancient biomolecules, including DNA.  The retrieval of ancient human and faunal DNA from sediments offers exciting new opportunities to investigate the geographical and temporal distribution of ancient humans and other organisms at sites where their skeletal remains are rare or absent , says Matthias Meyer, senior author of the study and researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig.To investigate the origin of DNA in the sediment, Max Planck researchers teamed up with an international group of geoarchaeologists - archaeologists who apply geological techniques to reconstruct the formation of sediment and sites - to study DNA preservation in sediment at a microscopic scale. They used undisturbed blocks of sediment that had been previously removed from archaeological sites and soaked in synthetic plastic-like (polyester) resin. The hardened blocks were taken to the laboratory and sliced in sections for microscopic imaging and genetic analysis.The researchers successfully extracted DNA from a collection of blocks of sediment prepared as long as 40 years ago, from sites in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.  The fact that these blocks are an excellent source of ancient DNA   including that originating from hominins - despite often decades of storage in plastic, provides access to a vast untapped repository of genetic information. The study opens up a new era of ancient DNA studies that will revisit samples stored in labs, allowing for analysis of sites that have long since been back-filled, which is especially important given travel restriction and site inaccessibility in a pandemic world , says Mike Morley from Flinders University in Australia who led some of the geoarchaeological analyses. The scientists used blocks of sediment from Denisova Cave, a site located in the Altai Mountains in South Central Siberia where ancient DNA from Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans has been retrieved, and showed that small organic particles yielded more DNA than sediment sampled randomly.  It clearly shows that the high success rate of ancient mammalian DNA retrieval from Denisova Cave sediments comes from the abundance of micro remains in the sediment matrix rather than from free extracellular DNA from feces, bodily fluids or decomposing cellular tissue potentially adsorbed onto mineral grains , says Vera Aldeias, co-author of the study and researcher at the University of Algarve in Portugal.  This study is a big step closer to understand precisely where and under what conditions ancient DNA is preserved in sediments , says Morley.The approach described in the study allows highly localized micro-scale sampling of sediment for DNA analyses and shows that ancient DNA (aDNA) is not uniformly distributed in the sediment; and that specific sediment features are more conducive to ancient DNA preservation than others.  Linking sediment aDNA to the archaeological micro-context means that we can also address the possibility of physical movement of aDNA between sedimentary deposits , says Susan Mentzer a researcher at the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment (Germany).Diyendo Massilani, the lead author of the study, was able to recover substantial amounts of Neanderthal DNA from only a few milligrams of sediment. He could identify the sex of the individuals who left their DNA behind, and showed that they belonged to a population related to a Neanderthal whose genome was previously reconstructed from a bone fragment discovered in the cave.  The Neanderthal DNA in these small samples of plastic-embedded sediment was far more concentrated than what we typically find in loose material , he says.  With this approach it will become possible in the future to analyze the DNA of many different ancient human individuals from just a small cube of solidified sediment. It is amusing to think that this is presumably so because they used the cave as a toilet tens of thousands of years ago .Reference: Massilani D, Morley MW, Mentzer SM, et al.

The study, carried out in mice, could help explain why some babies grow poorly in the womb.As the fetus grows, it needs to communicate its increasing needs for food to the mother. It receives its nourishment via blood vessels in the placenta, a specialised organ that contains cells from both baby and mother.Between 10% and 15% of babies grow poorly in the womb, often showing reduced growth of blood vessels in the placenta. In humans, these blood vessels expand dramatically between mid and late gestation, reaching a total length of approximately 320 kilometres at term.In a study published today in Developmental Cell, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge used genetically engineered mice to show how the fetus produces a signal to encourage growth of blood vessels within the placenta. This signal also causes modifications to other cells of the placenta to allow for more nutrients from the mother to go through to the fetus.Dr Ionel Sandovici, the paper s first author, said:  As it grows in the womb, the fetus needs food from its mum, and healthy blood vessels in the placenta are essential to help it get the correct amount of nutrients it needs. We ve identified one way that the fetus uses to communicate with the placenta to prompt the correct expansion of these blood vessels. When this communication breaks down, the blood vessels don t develop properly and the baby will struggle to get all the food it needs. The team found that the fetus sends a signal known as IGF2 that reaches the placenta through the umbilical cord. In humans, levels of IGF2 in the umbilical cord progressively increase between 29 weeks of gestation and term: too much IGF2 is associated with too much growth, while not enough IGF2 is associated with too little growth. Babies that are too large or too small are more likely to suffer or even die at birth, and have a higher risk to develop diabetes and heart problems as adults.Dr Sandovici added:  We ve known for some time that IGF2 promotes the growth of the organs where it is produced. In this study, we ve shown that IGF2 also acts like a classical hormone   it s produced by the fetus, goes into the fetal blood, through the umbilical cord and to the placenta, where it acts. Particularly interesting is what their findings reveal about the tussle taking place in the womb.In mice, the response to IGF2 in the blood vessels of the placenta is mediated by another protein, called IGF2R. The two genes that produce IGF2 and IGF2R are  imprinted    a process by which molecular switches on the genes identify their parental origin and can turn the genes on or off. In this case, only the copy of the igf2 gene inherited from the father is active, while only the copy of igf2r inherited from the mother is active.Lead author Dr Miguel Const ncia, said:  One theory about imprinted genes is that paternally-expressed genes are greedy and selfish. They want to extract the most resources as possible from the mother. But maternally-expressed genes act as countermeasures to balance these demands. In our study, the father s gene drives the fetus s demands for larger blood vessels and more nutrients, while the mother s gene in the placenta tries to control how much nourishment she provides. There s a tug-of-war taking place, a battle of the sexes at the level of the genome. The team say their findings will allow a better understanding of how the fetus, placenta and mother communicate with each other during pregnancy. This in turn could lead to ways of measuring levels of IGF2 in the fetus and finding ways to use medication to normalise these levels or promote normal development of placental vasculature.The researchers used mice, as it is possible to manipulate their genes to mimic different developmental conditions. This enables them to study in detail the different mechanisms taking place. The physiology and biology of mice have many similarities with those of humans, allowing researchers to model human pregnancy, in order to understand it better.Reference: Sandovici I, Georgopoulou A, P rez-Garc a V, et al.

As lithium batteries cycle, they accumulate little islands of inactive lithium that are cut off from the electrodes, decreasing the battery s capacity to store charge. But the research team discovered that they could make this  dead  lithium creep like a worm toward one of the electrodes until it reconnects, partially reversing the unwanted process. Adding this extra step slowed the degradation of their test battery and increased its lifetime by nearly 30%.  We are now exploring the potential recovery of lost capacity in lithium-ion batteries using an extremely fast discharging step,  said Stanford postdoctoral fellow Fang Liu, the lead author of a study published Dec. 22 in Nature. It s like a very slow worm that inches its head forward and pulls its tail in to move nanometer by nanometer,  Cui said.  In this case, it transports by dissolving away on one end and depositing material to the other end. If we can keep the lithium worm moving, it will eventually touch the anode and reestablish the electrical connection.   ","Published: January 4, 2022"

Scientists at Cedars-Sinai have found that microgravity has the potential to contribute to life-saving advances on Earth by facilitating the rapid mass production of stem cells.A new paper, led by Cedars Sinai and published in the peer-reviewed journal Stem Cell Reports, highlights key opportunities discussed during the 2020 Biomanufacturing in Space Symposium to expand the manufacture of stem cells in space.Biomanufacturing a type of stem cell production that uses biological materials such as microbes to produce substances and biomaterials suitable for use in preclinical, clinical, and therapeutic applications can be more productive in microgravity conditions. We are finding that spaceflight and microgravity is a desirable place for biomanufacturing because it confers a number of very special properties to biological tissues and biological processes that can help mass produce cells or other products in a way that you wouldn t be able to do on Earth,  said stem cell biologist Arun Sharma, PhD, research scientist and head of a new research laboratory in the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute, Smidt Heart Institute and Department of Biomedical Sciences. The last two decades have seen remarkable advances in regenerative medicine and exponential advancement in space technologies enabling new opportunities to access and commercialize space,  he said.Attendees at the virtual space symposium in December identified more than 50 potential commercial opportunities for conducting biomanufacturing work in space, according to the Cedars-Sinai paper. The most promising fell into three categories: disease modeling, biofabrication, and stem-cell-derived products.The first, disease modeling, is used by scientists to study diseases and possible treatments by replicating full-function structures whether using stem cells, organoids (miniature 3D structures grown from human stem cells that resemble human tissue), or other tissues.Investigators have found that once the body is exposed to low-gravity conditions for extended periods of time, it experiences accelerated bone loss and aging. By developing disease models based on this accelerated aging process, research scientists can better understand the mechanisms of the aging process and disease progression. Not only can this work help astronauts, but it can also lead to us manufacturing bone constructs or skeletal muscle constructs that could be applied to diseases like osteoporosis and other forms of accelerated bone aging and muscle wasting that people experience on Earth,  said Sharma, who is the corresponding author of the paper.Another highly discussed topic at the symposium was biofabrication, which uses manufacturing processes to produce materials like tissues and organs. 3D printing is one of the core biofabrication technologies.A major issue with producing these materials on Earth involves gravity-induced density, which makes it hard for cells to expand and grow. With the absence of gravity and density in space, scientists are hopeful that they can use 3D printing to print unique shapes and products, like organoids or cardiac tissues, in a way that can t be replicated on Earth.The third category has to do with the production of stem cells and understanding how some of their fundamental properties are influenced by microgravity. Some of these properties include potency, or the ability of a stem cell to renew itself, and differentiation, the ability for stem cells to turn into other cell types.Understanding some of the effects of spaceflight on stem cells can potentially lead to better ways to manufacture large numbers of cells in the absence of gravity. Scientists from Cedars-Sinai will be sending stem cells into space early next year, in conjunction with NASA and a private contractor, Space Tango, to test whether it is possible to produce large batches in a low gravity environment. While we are still in the exploratory phase of some of this research, this is no longer in the realm of science fiction,  Sharma said.  Within the next five years we may see a scenario where we find cells or tissues that can be made in a way that is simply not possible here on Earth. And I think that s extremely exciting.

Acting as an ion channel in the cell membrane, the protein is responsible for relaying the optical signal from the eye to the brain. If a genetic disorder disrupts the molecular function in a person, they will go blind. Scientists have deciphered the protein s three-dimensional structure, preparing the way for innovative medical treatments. The study is published in the scientific journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology.""It s thanks to the rod cells in our eye that we can observe the stars in the night sky,"" explains Jacopo Marino, a biologist with PSI s Laboratory of Biomolecular Research. ""These photo cells are so sensitive to light that they can detect even a single photon reaching us from a very remote part of the universe   a truly incredible feat."" The ability of our brain to eventually translate these light beams into a visual impression is partly down to the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels whose three-dimensional structure has now been illuminated by a PSI research group led by Jacopo Marino. The ion channel acts as a gatekeeper controlling whether specific particles are allowed through to the interior of the receptor cell. It is embedded in the protein-rich shell   the cell membrane   of the rod cells. In darkness, the ion channel, and thus the gate to the cell, is completely open. But when light hits the eye, it triggers a cascade of processes in the rod cells. This ultimately causes the gate to close, with the result that positively charged particles, such as calcium ions, can no longer enter into the cell. This electrochemical signal continues via the nerve cells into the brain s visual cortex, where a visual impression   such as a flash of light   is created. ""The idea of solving the structure of this channel dates back to nearly 20 years ago, when Gebhard Schertler and Benjamin Kaupp already collaborated on this topic,"" says Jacopo Marino. Both are co-authors of the new study.PhD student Diane Barret first had to extract the channel protein from cows  eyes supplied by an abattoir   a complicated and arduous process. ""This was a very challenging task, as the protein is extremely sensitive and decomposes very quickly. In addition, it is only available in tiny quantities in the source material,"" Barret explains. It took a whole two years to obtain enough protein to work with. ""We were both too stubborn to simply give up,"" says Jacopo Marino, laughing. ""But in the end that stubbornness paid off."" The scientists then used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the ion channel. ""In contrast to previous studies on the structure of the ion channel, we investigated the native protein as it exists in the eye. We are therefore much closer to the real conditions that exist in living creatures,"" Diane Barret says. One of the reasons why a clearer understanding of the channel protein s natural structure is important is to advance the development of treatments for genetic disorders for which there is no known cure, such as retinitis pigmentosa. With this disease, photoreceptors gradually die off, leaving people blind. One possible cause is that the body is unable to correctly produce the CNG channel protein due to a genetic defect. As a result, the ion channel does not close completely when light hits the eye, disrupting the cell s electrochemical balance and causing the cells to die. ""If we could find molecules that affect the protein in such a way that the channel would completely close, we could prevent the cells from dying   and thus stop people going blind,"" explains Jacopo Marino. Now that researchers have identified the precise structure of the protein they are able to search specifically for such molecules.The protein comprises four parts: three lots of subunit A, and one lot of subunit B. A correctly functioning ion channel is only possible in this combination. In their study, PSI scientists show why the B subunit seems to play such an important role: a side arm of the protein   a single amino acid   protrudes from the rest of the protein, like a barrier across a gateway. This narrows the passage in the channel to the point where no ions can pass through. ""No one expected that   it came as a total surprise,"" says Diane Barret. Other narrow places already exist in the A subunit   like main gateways   which were previously thought to be the only ones. It is interesting to note that the additional barrier is found not only in the protein from the cow s eye, but seems to apply to all types of animal, as the scientists showed. Whether crocodiles, eagles or humans   all living creatures with an ion channel in their eye have the same protruding amino acid at this position in the protein. As it has been preserved so consistently during evolution, it must be essential for the functioning of the channel.Reference: Barret DCA, Schertler GFX, Benjamin Kaupp U, Marino J.

In the U.S., you might encounter them as a flavorful ingredient in bubble tea, ice cream or a cocktail. You can also peel them and eat them fresh.Lychees have been grown in China since ancient times, with records of cultivation dating back about 2,000 years. Fresh lychees were an object of such desire that in the Tang Dynasty, one emperor set up a dedicated horse relay to deliver the fruits to the imperial court from harvests made far to the south.Now, scientists have used genomics to peer even deeper into the lychee s history. And in the process, they ve uncovered insights that could help shape the species  future, too. Lychee is an important tropical agricultural crop in the Sapindaceae (maple and horse chestnut) family, and it is one of the most economically significant fruit crops grown in eastern Asia, especially so to the yearly income of farmers in southern China,  says Jianguo Li, PhD, professor in the South China Agricultural University (SCAU) College of Horticulture and a senior author of the study.  By sequencing and analyzing wild and cultivated lychee varieties, we were able to trace the origin and domestication history of lychee. We demonstrated that extremely early- and late-maturing cultivars were derived from independent human domestication events in Yunnan and Hainan, respectively. Additionally,  We identified a specific genetic variant, a deleted stretch of genetic material, that can be developed as a simple biological marker for screening of lychee varieties with different flowering times, contributing importantly to future breeding programs,  adds Rui Xia, PhD, professor in the same college at SCAU and another senior author of the research. Like a puzzle, we re piecing together the history of what humans did with lychee,  says Victor Albert, PhD, University at Buffalo evolutionary biologist, also a senior author of the study.  These are the main stories our research tells: The origins of lychee, the idea that there were two separate domestications, and the discovery of a genetic deletion that we think causes different varieties to fruit and flower at different times. The study is published in Nature Genetics. It was led by SCAU in collaboration with a large international team from China, the U.S., Singapore, France and Canada.Senior authors are Rui Xia, Jianguo Li and Houbin Chen from SCAU; Ray Ming from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Victor Albert from UB. First authors are Guibing Hu, Junting Feng, Chengming Liu and Zhenxian Wu from SCAU; Xu Xiang from the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Jiabao Wang from the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences; and Jarkko Saloj rvi from the Nanyang Technological University. To conduct the study, scientists produced a high-quality  reference genome  for a popular lychee cultivar called  Feizixiao , and compared its DNA to that of other wild and farmed varieties. (All the cultivars belong to the same species, Litchi chinensis).The research shows that the lychee tree, Litchi chinensis, was likely domesticated more than once: Wild lychees originated in Yunnan in southwestern China, spread east and south to Hainan Island, and then were domesticated independently in each of these two locations, the analysis suggests.In Yunnan, people began cultivating very early-flowering varieties, and in Hainan, late-blooming varieties that bear fruit later in the year. Eventually, interbreeding between cultivars from these two regions led to hybrids, including varieties, like  Feizixiao , that remain extremely popular today.The exact timing of these events is uncertain. For instance, the study suggests that one milestone, the evolutionary split between L. chinensis populations in Yunnan and Hainan, which took place before domestication, could have occurred around 18,000 years ago. But that is only an estimate; other solutions are possible. Still, the analysis provides a fascinating look at the evolutionary history of lychees and their link with humans.When will this lychee tree flower? A simple genetic test could tellThe study not only adds new chapters to the history of the lychee; it also provides an in-depth look at flowering time, a hugely important trait in agriculture.  Early-maturing lychees versus late-maturing lychees came from different places and were domesticated independently,  says Albert, PhD, Empire Innovation Professor of Biological Sciences in the UB College of Arts and Sciences.  This, by itself, is an interesting story, but we also wanted to know what causes these differences: Why do these varieties fruit and flower at different times? By comparing the DNA of many lychee varieties, the team identified a genetic variant that could be used to create a simple test for identifying early- and late-blooming lychee plants.The variant is a deletion   a chunk of missing DNA   that lies near two genes associated with flowering, and may help to control the activity of one or both of them.Yunnan cultivars that bloom very early have the deletion, inheriting it from both parents. Hainan varieties that mature late do not have it at all. And Feizixiao   a hybrid with nearly equal amounts of DNA from each of the two regional populations   is  heterozygous  for the deletion, meaning that it has only one copy inherited from one parent. This makes sense, as Feizixiao flowers early, but not extremely early. This is very useful for breeders. Because the lychee is perishable, flowering times have been important to extending the season for which the lychee is available in markets,  Albert says. The team at SCAU initiated the lychee genome study as part of a bigger project that hopes to greatly expand what we know about the DNA of important flowering plants within the same family, Sapindaceae. Sapindaceae is a large family that includes many economically important plants,  Xia says.  So far, only a few of them, including lychee, longan, rambutan, yellowhorn and maple, have had their full genomes sequenced. We, the College of Horticulture at SCAU, are working on a large collaborative project of sequencing more Sapindaceae species native to China and of economic importance, such as rambutan, sapindus (soapberries) and balloon vine, aiming at broad and thorough comparative genomics investigations for Sapindaceae genomics,  Xia adds.  The main research interests will be flowering, secondary metabolism leading to flavors and fragrances, flower and fruit development, among others. Reference: Hu G, Feng J, Xiang X, et al.

Specifically, researchers from North Carolina State University and Northern Michigan University found that wild bears who consumed a lot of processed foods had far less diversity in the microbial ecosystems of their guts. We know a  western  diet can reduce microbial diversity in the guts of humans, mice and other species, which can have an adverse effect on their health,  says Erin McKenney, co-author of the study and an assistant professor of applied ecology at NC State.  We want to know if the same is true for wildlife, particularly given the increasing overlap between where people live and where wildlife lives. One possibility our work here raises is that if wildlife begin consuming human foods, it may affect their ability to derive as much nutrition from their traditional, wild diet if they stop eating human foods. One step toward seeing if the same is true for wildlife is to assess the impact that human foods have on the gut microbiome of wild mammals,  says Sierra Gillman, first author of the study and a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington.  In this particular study, we wanted to know how human foods influence the gut microbiome of black bears.  Gillman did the work while a grad student at NMU.The researchers focused the study on Michigan, which allows hunters to  bait  bears by leaving out large quantities of human food, such as sugary cereals and candy. Hunters will bait specific sites for weeks or months to lure bears to a specific area on a regular basis. As a result, some bears have a diet that is rich in human junk food for an extended period of time.To collect samples from the wild bear population, the researchers worked with guides who lead scheduled trips with hunters in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The guides collected samples from bears that were harvested when the guides went on their regularly scheduled trips with hunters. Specifically, the guides followed a detailed protocol for retrieving hair samples and two gut samples. The gut samples were from the jejunum, which is the middle section of the small intestine, and the colon, which is also called the large intestine. Ultimately, the researchers were able to retrieve samples from 35 legally-harvested bears.The researchers processed the gut samples to identify both what kinds of microbes were present in each bear s microbiome as well as how many of each type of microbe was present.The researchers also conducted a carbon isotope analysis of the bear s hair, which gave them an assessment of each bear s long-term diet. More specifically, the analysis told researchers the extent to which each bear was consuming sugar and corn, which are more likely to be found in processed foods.When analyzing the data, the researchers looked at two measures of gut biodiversity. First they look at the total number of different species present. Second, they looked at a measure called Faith s phylogenetic diversity, which looks at how many different types of species are present. Basically, Faith s phylogenetic diversity assesses how many branches of the bacterial family tree are represented,  Gillman says.Both measures of gut biodiversity were substantially lower in bears that had been eating more processed foods. Essentially, we found that the more human food black bears eat, and the longer they eat it, the less diverse their gut microbiomes,  Gillman says Sugar is very easy to digest,  McKenney says.  Lots of bacteria can consume it. In practical terms, that means processed human foods actually have less food available for bacteria that specialize in breaking down fiber or other microaccessible carbohydrates. Those bacterial specialists have trouble competing with the other bacteria for sugar, and their niche in the food web isn t sustainable if bears don t eat enough of their traditional diet. We think that s one of the mechanisms for reducing gut microdiversity. And if the gut biodiversity suffers when bears begin consuming more human food, that raises the possibility that it would be more difficult for bears to derive as much nutritional value from non-human foods if they return to a  wild  diet,  McKenney says.  Basically, it s not clear how quickly microbial species that break down fiber, etc., would return. Now that we ve identified this association between eating human food and microbial biodiversity, we need to do additional work to determine what this means for the health of these animals   and potentially other animals,  Gillman says. Many hunters use camera traps to monitor their bait sites, and people we ve worked with have told us that they see a wide variety of species   raccoons, fishers, martens, deer, hares   eating the bear bait,  says Diana Lafferty, co-author of the paper and an assistant professor of wildlife ecology at NMU. It s not clear how baiting might be affecting the microbiomes or health of other wildlife that is taking advantage of the free food. As we think about conservation, assessing the impact of our activities on diversity may need to extend to protecting microbial diversity. Because the evidence increasingly suggests that many of these microbial organisms are critical to the health of wildlife species. How does baiting fit into that? Those are issues I think we ll need to explore. Reference: Gillman SJ, McKenney EA, Lafferty DJR. Human-provisioned foods reduce gut microbiome diversity in American black bears (Ursus americanus).

Microbes are important for soil organic matter decomposition,  Morrissey said.  They are the primary actors performing that process and, as a consequence, they play a big role in the global carbon cycle, returning carbon that enters the soil from above ground plant production to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. During the research project, she will use stable isotope probing, an advanced laboratory technique, to track carbon uptake and characterize the function of microbes in their natural communities. Historically, it's been very challenging to understand what microbes are doing in soil and other natural systems because they're so tiny and the communities are so diverse,  Morrissey said.  And if you isolate them in the lab, the way they function in that artificial environment might not be the same as the way they function in their natural environment. With stable isotope probing, researchers add organic substrates like plant debris which contain an uncommon isotope of carbon: C-13. Most atoms of carbon are C-12 and have six neutrons and six protons; however, C-13 has an extra neutron which makes it heavier. This heavy C-13 can then be detected in the DNA of active soil microorganisms.From there, researchers can figure out which microbes are using different types of carbon in the soil and, hopefully, be better able to predict how those processes affect the climate. We use mathematical equations to try to make projections of how changes in climate and changes in vegetation would impact how much carbon dioxide a forest or any ecosystem would store in its vegetation or in its soils,  Brzostek said.  And for the longest time we were making those predictions without actually having equations that represented microbes. Once Morrissey discovers how individual microorganisms function within the soil, Brzostek can use the information to predict how future climate change will impact carbon sequestration by ecosystems.And those predictions have global significance. Countries all over the world rely on predictive models to determine by how much they need to reduce emissions to help keep Earth s temperature within a certain range,  Brzostek said.  Including microbes in the models will make the predictions more accurate. This article has been republished from the following materials. Note: material may have been edited for length and content.

Just like our eating habits basically shape anything in our body, the way cells  eat  matters for the health of the cells,  said Comert Kural, associate professor of physics at The Ohio State University and lead author of the study.  And scientists did not, until now, understand the mechanics of how that happened. The study, published recently in the journal Developmental Cell, found that the intercellular machinery of a cell assembles into a highly curved basket-like structure that eventually grows into a closed cage. Scientists had previously believed that structure began as a flat lattice.Membrane curvature is important, Kural said: It controls the formation of the pockets that carry substances into and out of a cell.The pockets capture substances around the cell, forming around the extracellular substances, before turning into vesicles   small sacs one-one millionth the size of a red blood cell. Vesicles carry important things for a cell s health   proteins, for example   into the cell. But they can also be hijacked by pathogens that can infect cells.But the question of how those pockets formed from membranes that were previously believed to be flat had stymied researchers for nearly 40 years. It was a controversy in cellular studies,  Kural said.  And we were able to use super-resolution fluorescence imaging to actually watch these pockets form within live cells, and so we could answer that question of how they are created. Simply put, in contrast to the previous studies, we made high-resolution movies of cells instead of taking snapshots,  Kural said.  Our experiments revealed that protein scaffolds start deforming the underlying membrane as soon as they are recruited to the sites of vesicle formation. That contrasts with previous hypotheses that the protein scaffolds of a cell had to go through an energy-intensive reorganization in order for the membrane to curve, Kural said.The way cells consume and expel vesicles plays a key role for living organisms. The process helps clear bad cholesterol from blood; it also transmits neural signals. The process is known to break down in several diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer s disease. Understanding the origin and dynamics of membrane-bound vesicles is important   they can be utilized for delivering drugs for medicinal purposes but, at the same time, hijacked by pathogens such as viruses to enter and infect cells,  Kural said.  Our results matter, not only for our understanding of the fundamentals of life, but also for developing better therapeutic strategies. Reference: Willy NM, Ferguson JP, Akatay A, et al.

When you are depressed, adenylyl cyclase is low. The reason adenylyl cyclase is attenuated is that the intermediary protein that allows the neurotransmitter to make the adenylyl cyclase, Gs alpha, is stuck in a cholesterol-rich matrix of the membrane   a lipid raft  where they don t work very well,  Rasenick said. The new study,  A Novel Peripheral Biomarker for Depression and Antidepressant Response,  published in Molecular Psychiatry, has identified the cellular biomarker for translocation of Gs alpha from lipid rafts. The biomarker can be identified through a blood test.  What we have developed is a test that can not only indicate the presence of depression but it can also indicate therapeutic response with a single biomarker, and that is something that has not existed to date,  said Rasenick, who is also a research career scientist at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.  The researchers hypothesize they will be able to use this blood test to determine if antidepressant therapies are working, perhaps as soon as one week after beginning treatment. Previous research has shown that when patients showed improvement in their depression symptoms, the Gs alpha was out of the lipid raft. However, in patients who took antidepressants but showed no improvement in their symptoms, the Gs alpha was still stuck in the raft   meaning simply having antidepressants in the bloodstream was not good enough to improve symptoms. A blood test may be able to show whether or not the Gs alpha was out of the lipid raft after one week.   Because platelets turn over in one week, you would see a change in people who were going to get better. You d be able to see the biomarker that should presage successful treatment,  Rasenick said.Currently, patients and their physicians have to wait several weeks, sometimes months, to determine if antidepressants are working, and when it is determined they aren t working, different therapies are tried.   About 30% of people don t get better   their depression doesn t resolve. Perhaps, failure begets failure and both doctors and patients make the assumption that nothing is going to work,  Rasenick said.  Most depression is diagnosed in primary care doctor s offices where they don t have sophisticated screening. With this test, a doctor could say,  Gee, they look like they are depressed, but their blood doesn t tell us they are. So, maybe we need to re-examine this.

This rare and chronic autoimmune disease is characterized by debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness.The new drug, efgartigimod alfa-fcab, is an engineered fragment of a human antibody that binds to a cell surface receptor known as the neonatal Fc receptor, or FcRn. Between 1990 and 2015, former UTSW Professor of Immunology E. Sally Ward, Ph.D., led work that characterized this receptor s role in regulating the levels and persistence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. In 2005, her laboratory described an approach to lower antibody levels by blocking FcRn activity, and subsequently demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept to treat antibody-mediated autoimmune disease. The global immunology company argenx has licensed exclusive patent rights related to this drug from UTSW. The development of this FcRn inhibitor came out of the fundamental work on FcRn biology that my group had worked on during the decades that I was on the UTSW faculty,  said Dr. Ward, now a Professor of Molecular Immunology and Director of Translational Immunology at the University of Southampton in England.  Working out the molecular and cell biological processes involved in FcRn biology and its regulation and transport of antibody molecules was a major focus of our work at UTSW over more than two decades, starting when I was an assistant professor there. Clinical trials that led to the recent FDA approval found that 68% percent of patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive myasthenia gravis responded to efgartigimod, compared to 30% of those taking a placebo. The company is exploring possible uses for the agent in other conditions mediated by IgG.  Efgartigimod represents Dr. Ward s second commercial success based on fundamental research conducted at UTSW. That work also led to technology that can extend the half-life of therapeutic antibodies and currently is used in the FDA-approved drug ravulizumab and two antibody therapies against COVID-19, as well as another antibody in development to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).It is also the second first-in-kind drug developed from basic research at UTSW to be approved by the FDA in the past year. Less than six months ago, belzutifan, a HIF-2  inhibitor, received approval as a treatment for familial kidney cancer. Considered together, these approvals mark UTSW as one of the major sources of breakthrough medicines for previously untreatable diseases. We are indeed a center for biotechnology,  said Michael Brown, M.D., Professor of Molecular Genetics and Internal Medicine and joint recipient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with research partner UTSW colleague Joseph Goldstein, M.D. Dr. Brown helped recruit Dr. Ward to UTSW in 1990.This article has been republished from the following materials.

The scientists found that silencing ATF4 in DLBCL cells essentially fools the cells into starving themselves and slowing their growth and that targeting ATF4 along with a closely related metabolic protein, SIRT3, even further enhances this cancer-killing effect. ATF4 represents a crucial and exploitable vulnerability in DLBCLs and one that they appear to share regardless of the specific genetic mutations that trigger them,  said study co-senior author Dr. Ari Melnick, the Gebroe Family Professor of Hematology / Oncology in the Division of Hematology and Clinical Oncology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.Dr. Hening Lin, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University in Ithaca and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, is the other co-senior author of the study.Lymphomas are blood cancers that usually originate from immune cells such as B cells, the producers of antibodies. The vast majority of lymphomas are so-called non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and DLBCLs account for about a third of these, or roughly 25,000 cases per year in the United States. DLBCLs are relatively fast-growing and aggressive, and despite many advances in lymphoma treatment in recent decades, about 40 percent of cases are not cured a statistic that underscores the need for new treatment strategies.Dr. Melnick, Dr. Lin and their colleagues set out in the study to investigate SIRT3, which resides in mitochondria, the tiny, oxygen-burning fuel reactors in our cells that are essential for powering cellular activities. The research team had discovered in a 2019 study that SIRT3 strongly supports the growth and survival of DLBCLs by speeding up the biochemical reactions that produce the molecular building blocks cells need to proliferate.In the new study, the researchers explored further how SIRT3 promotes DLBCL growth, and found that one of the important ways it does this is by increasing the production of another metabolism-influencing protein, ATF4.Their experiments revealed that SIRT3, as it turbo-boosts DLBCL metabolism, reduces the pools of amino acids that cells use to make proteins and otherwise fuel their growth. This reduction amounts to a starvation signal that activates the production of ATF4, which in turn ramps up the production and import of amino acids, further sustaining DLBCLs  malignant proliferation.Dr. Melnick and Dr. Lin in their 2019 study developed a selective SIRT3 inhibitor and showed that it kills DLBCL cells regardless of the cancer-driving mutations they carry. In the new study the researchers showed that SIRT3 inhibition results in accumulation of specific amino acids that are generated by the treated cells cannibalizing their own proteins. This situation essentially tricks DLBCL cells into behaving as if they had an adequate nutrient supplies and results in paradoxical suppression of ATF4 production, in turn leading to more severe starvation.Further harnessing this effect for therapeutic benefit, the investigators experimented with a compound that blocks the activation of ATF4 and found that it has a similar broad impact on DLBCL cells. In addition, they found that combining the blockers of ATF4 and SIRT3 has a striking lymphoma cell-killing effect much more potent than either blocker on its own. Combining ATF4 and SIRT3 inhibitors thus seems a promising strategy against DLBCLs.  One of the really interesting things about this study is that it shows how nutrient conditions, in principle even from patients  diets, can profoundly affect cancer-cell activity,  said study first author Dr. Meng Li, a member of the Melnick Laboratory who is also an instructor of cancer genomics in medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.The team is now conducting further experiments to find the best way to target the SIRT3-ATF4 axis to treat DLBCLs. My lab has been working on the sirtuin family of enzymes for more than 10 years, yet this study revealed some very interesting connections among SIRT3, metabolism and nutrient or stress sensing,  said Dr. Lin.  We are excited to consider the translational potential of this finding in treating lymphoma. Reference: Li M, Teater MR, Hong JY, et al.

T cells, generated both by vaccinations and COVID-19 infections, have been shown to be critical in limiting progression to severe disease by eliminating virus-infected cells and helping with other immune system functions. Preliminary studies have reported that Omicron (fast becoming the most dominant circulating strain globally) can escape antibodies produced by vaccination or natural COVID-19 infection, raising concerns about the increased possibility of reinfection and breakthrough cases. Published yesterday in Viruses, the team analyzed over 1,500 fragments of SARS-CoV-2 s viral proteins, called epitopes, that have been found to be recognized by T cells in recovered COVID-19 patients or after vaccination. The team s findings suggest Omicron is unlikely to be able to evade T cells, adding to a growing body of evidence from research groups around the world who are also investigating T cell responses to COVID-19.  Despite being a preliminary study, we believe this is positive news. Even if Omicron, or some other variant for that matter, can potentially escape antibodies, a robust T cell response can still be expected to offer protection and help to prevent significant illness,  said Prof. Matthew MCKAY from the University of Melbourne, who co-led the research. The most concerning aspect of Omicron is the abundance of mutations in its spike protein, which is the primary target of COVID-19 vaccines. The spike enables the virus to attach and enter cells in humans. Current vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies aimed at blocking this process, however these antibodies have been reported to be less effective against Omicron compared with previous variants, like Delta.  In analyzing virus epitopes from the spike protein that are targeted by T cells in vaccinated or previously infected individuals, the study found that only 20 per cent showed mutations associated with Omicron. Even then, these mutations do not necessarily mean the virus will be able to evade the body s T cells.   Among these T cell epitopes that have Omicron mutations, our further analysis revealed that more than half are predicted to still be visible to T cells. This further diminishes the chance that Omicron may escape T cells  defences,  said study co-lead Prof. Ahmed Abdul QUADEER, Research Assistant Professor at HKUST s Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering.   While the study focused on the spike protein of the virus, when the team broadened their analysis to other virus proteins, they found an overwhelming majority (more than 97 per cent) of non-spike T cell epitopes do not encompass mutations associated with Omicron.   These results overall, would suggest that broad escape from T cells is very unlikely,  Prof. McKay said.  Based on our data, we anticipate that T cell responses elicited by vaccines and boosters, for example, will continue to help protect against Omicron, as observed for other variants.ReferenceAhmed SF, Quadeer AA, McKay MR.

These antibodies target areas of the virus spike protein that remain essentially unchanged as the viruses mutate.By identifying the targets of these  broadly neutralizing  antibodies on the spike protein, it might be possible to design vaccines and antibody treatments that will be effective against not only the omicron variant but other variants that may emerge in the future, said David Veesler, investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.  This finding tells us that by focusing on antibodies that target these highly conserved sites on the spike protein, there is a way to overcome the virus  continual evolution,  Veesler said.Veesler led the research project with Davide Corti of Humabs Biomed SA, Vir Biotechnology, in Switzerland. The study s findings were published Dec. 23 in the journal Nature. The lead authors of the study were Elisabetta Cameroni and Christian Saliba (Humabs), John E. Bowen (UW Biochemistry) and Laura Rosen (Vir).The omicron variant has 37 mutations in the spike protein, which it uses to latch onto and invade cells. This is an unusually high number of mutations. It is thought that these changes explain in part why the variant has been able to spread so rapidly, to infect people who have been vaccinated and to reinfect those who have previously been infected. The main questions we were trying to answer were: how has this constellation of mutations in the spike protein of the omicron variant affected its ability to bind to cells and to evade the immune system s antibody responses,  Veesler said.Veesler and his colleagues speculate that omicron's large number of mutations might have accumulated during a prolonged infection in someone with a weakened immune system or by the virus jumping from humans to an animal species and back again.To assess the effect of these mutations, the researchers engineered a disabled, nonreplicating virus, called a pseudovirus, to produce spike proteins on its surface, as coronaviruses do. They then created pseudoviruses that had spike proteins with the omicron mutations and those found on the earliest variants identified in the pandemic.The researchers first looked to see how well the different versions of the spike protein were able to bind to protein on the surface of cells, that the virus uses to latch onto and enter the cell. This protein is called the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor.They found the omicron variant spike protein was able to bind 2.4 times better than spike protein found in the virus isolated at the very beginning of the pandemic.   That s not a huge increase,  Veesler noted,  but in the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, mutations in the spike protein that increased affinity were associated with higher transmissibility and infectivity.  They also found that the omicron version was able to bind to mouse ACE2 receptors efficiently, suggesting omicron might be able to  ping-pong  between humans and other mammals.The researchers then looked at how well antibodies against earlier isolates of the virus protected against the omicron variant. They did this by using antibodies from patients who had previously been infected with earlier versions of the virus, vaccinated against earlier strains of the virus, or had been infected and then vaccinated.They found that antibodies from people who had been infected by earlier strains and from those who had received one of the six most-used vaccines currently available all had reduced ability to block infection.Antibodies from people who had previously been infected and those who had received the Sputnik V or Sinopharm vaccines as well as a single dose of Johnson & Johnson had little or no ability to block  or  neutralize  the omicron variant's entry into cells. Antibodies from people who had received two doses of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and AstraZeneca vaccines retained some neutralizing activity, albeit reduced by 20- to 40-fold, much more than any other variants.Antibodies from people who had been infected, recovered, and then had two doses of vaccine also had reduced activity, but the reduction was less, about fivefold, clearly demonstrating that vaccination after infection is useful.Antibodies from people, in this case a group of renal dialysis patients, who had received a booster with a third dose of the mRNA vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech showed only a 4-fold reduction in neutralizing activity.  This shows that a third dose is really, really helpful against omicron,  Veesler said.All but one antibody treatments currently authorized or approved to be used with patients exposed to the virus, had no or had markedly reduced activity against omicron in the laboratory. The exception was an antibody called sotrovimab, which had a two- to three-fold reduction of neutralizing activity, the study finds.But when they tested a larger panel of antibodies that have been generated against earlier versions of the virus, the researchers identified four classes of antibodies that retained their ability to neutralize omicron. Members of each of these classes target one of four specific areas of the spike protein present in not only SARS-CoV-2 variants but also a group of related coronaviruses, called sarbecoviruses. These sites on the protein may persist because they play an essential function that the protein would lose if they mutated. Such areas are called  conserved. The finding that antibodies are able to neutralize via recognition of conserved areas in so many different variants of the virus suggests that designing vaccines and antibody treatments that target these regions could be effective against a broad spectrum of variants that emerge through mutation, Veesler said.Reference: Cameroni E, Bowen J, Rosen L et al.

The team further discovered that inhibiting the gene, OR5B21, significantly decreased the metastasis of breast cancer cells to these organs and could thus be an important target for future therapy to prevent its spread, according to a paper published in Science. The common perception is that the only role of olfactory receptors, which line the nasal cavity and relay sensory data to the brain, is to recognize odor and smell,  says Bakhos Tannous, PhD, director of the Experimental Therapeutics Unit in the Department of Neurology at MGH and senior author of the study.  Our work suggests that the olfactory receptor 5B21 is also a novel oncogene that may figure prominently in cancer progression by driving breast cancer cells to the brain and other sites in the body. Breast cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed malignancy behind lung cancer, and the leading cause of cancer in women, with more than two million new cases reported each year. Moreover, migration of breast cancer to the brain is the leading cause of mortality from the disease, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic targets to delay or halt its metastasis. The olfactory receptor family of genes is known to be overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including prostate, melanoma, lung and liver, though its role in breast cancer has been understudied in the past,  says Litia Carvalho, PhD, co-corresponding author of the study and an instructor in Neurology at MGH. The team learned through its research with animal models that OR5B21 enhances or primes breast cancer cells to metastasize through a signaling pathway that activates a process known as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT prompts multiple biochemical or phenotypical changes in the olfactory cells which include enhanced migratory capacity to distant organs, especially the brain. This activation converts a wide range of extracellular signals into intracellular messages through the signaling pathway NF- B/STAT, resulting in cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis,  explains lead author Mao Li, a graduate student researcher in the Experimental Therapeutics Unit.  Our findings are novel for the field, though further research is needed to determine exactly how OR5B21 induces metastasis. Future research might also lead to a molecular inhibitor of OR5B21 in response to the team s discovery that downregulating the olfactory receptor resulted in a significant decrease in cancer cell metastasis.  Our hope,  says Tannous,  is that using OR5B21 as a target for adjuvant therapy could help fill a huge unmet medical need by preventing breast cancer metastasis to the brain and other organs, and thus prolong survival of patients.

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is one such protein with an important role in cardiovascular health, but its mechanism of action on the phospholipid membrane was unknown. To address this, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine used state-of-the-art experimental and computational tools to show exactly how the enzyme interacts with the membrane and extracts its specific substrates.The findings are publishing Jan. 3, 2022 in the online issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Lp-PLA2 works on lipoproteins in the bloodstream, including common forms like low- and high-density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL). These lipoprotein particles are made up of a spherical layer of phospholipids surrounding a drop of fat and cholesterol esters. Over time, the phospholipids in this outer layer become oxidized, attracting free radicals and further oxidation, which contributes to plaque buildup and cardiovascular disease. Lp-PLA2 extracts these oxidized phospholipids from the lipoprotein membrane and releases their fatty acids to be further metabolized. Understanding exactly how this process works creates new opportunities for therapeutics against cardiovascular disease. I am very pleased that we were able to go into much greater depth on how this enzyme works than ever before,  said Edward A. Dennis, PhD, senior author of the study and Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology, Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  Using the latest advances in lipidomics and computational molecular dynamics simulations, we got a picture which is worth a thousand words. We now have movies that show how this enzyme works at the atomic level, and that should help us figure out ways to activate or inactivate the enzyme as necessary for health.  This advanced approach revealed a specific peptide region consisting of two alpha helices connected with a loop that acts as a gate to the enzyme s active site. Typically, this gate is in a  closed  position, but when Lp-PLA2 binds to the phospholipid membrane, it undergoes an allosteric conformational change that opens the gate and increases the volume of the active site.Dennis  team, led by first author Varnavas D. Mouchlis, PhD, also showed which oxidized phospholipid substrates Lp-PLA2 has the greatest affinity for. They further identified a binding pocket distinct from known drug inhibitor binding pockets, which may serve as a new target for future therapeutic drugs.This study is the latest in a long line of work from the Dennis lab to develop a unifying theory on the function of phospholipases. The group had previously introduced this concept of membrane-facilitated allosteric regulation of PLA2 enzymes, but had until this point only studied enzymes that function on phospholipid bilayers (as seen on cells and intracellular organelles). This study confirmed that a similar mechanism could be used to facilitate phospholipase action on phospholipid monolayers, such as those on lipoproteins. PLA2 enzymes have all sorts of important functions in inflammation, digestion, brain health, and more, so it s amazing to see this wide variety of enzymes all show a similar action strategy,  said Dennis.  We ve been studying this superfamily of enzymes for almost 50 years, so to finally have this complete picture of how they work is really satisfying, and the whole field advances.

Published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A, the study shows that the new metal organic framework, loaded with a common industrial chemical, propylene oxide, can catalyze the production of cyclic carbonates while scrubbing CO2 from factory flue gases. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, results from burning fossil fuels and is one of the primary causes of climate change. Cyclic carbonates are a class of compounds with great industrial interest, meaning the findings are a boost for green-economy initiatives because they show useful products such as battery electrolytes and pharmaceutical precursors can be derived from the same process deployed to clean emissions from manufacturing facilities. The new, three-dimensional, lanthanide-based metal organic framework, or MOF, can also be used to catalyze cyclic carbonate production from biogas, a mix of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases arising from the decomposition of organic matter. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change, and lanthanides are a group of soft, silvery-white metals whose applications range from night vision goggles to flints for cigarette lighters. Examples of lanthanides include cerium, europium and gadolinium.  We ve taken a big step toward solving a crucial challenge associated with the hoped-for circular carbon economy by developing an effective catalyst,  said chemistry researcher Kyriakos Stylianou of the OSU College of Science, who led the study.  A key to that is understanding the molecular interactions between the active sites in MOFs with potentially reactive molecules.  A MOF is an inorganic-organic hybrid, a crystalline porous material made up of positively charged metal ions surrounded by organic  linker  molecules, in this case lanthanide metals and tetracarboxylate linkers. The metal ions make nodes that bind the linkers  arms to form a repeating structure that looks something like a cage; the structure has nanosized pores that adsorb gases, similar to a sponge. MOFs can be designed with a variety of components, which determine the MOF s properties. Lanthanide-based materials are generally stable because of the relatively large size of lanthanide ions, Stylianou said, and that s true as well with lanthanide MOFs, where the acidic metals form strong bonds with the linkers, keeping the MOFs stable in water and at high temperatures; that s important because flue gases and biogas are hot as well as moisture rich. The lanthanide MOFs are also selective for carbon dioxide, meaning they re not bothered by the presence of the other gases contained by industrial emissions and biogas.  We observed that within the pores, propylene oxide can directly bind to the cerium centers and activate interactions for the cycloaddition of carbon dioxide,  Stylianou said.  Using our MOFs, stable after multiple cycles of carbon dioxide capture and conversion, we describe the fixation of carbon dioxide into the propylene oxide s epoxy ring for the production of cyclic carbonates. Cyclic carbonates have a broad range of industrial applications, including as polar solvents, precursors for polycarbonate materials such as eyeglass lenses and digital discs, electrolytes in lithium batteries, and precursors for pharmaceuticals. These are very exciting findings,  Stylianou said.  And being able to directly use carbon dioxide from impure sources saves the cost and energy of separating it before it can be used to make cyclic carbonates, which will be a boon for the green economy.

Results from an early preclinical study suggest that tests with the new assay may be just as reliable as the laboratory-based molecular tests   called PCR tests   used by hospitals for clinical diagnostics.  Having fast and easy-to-use tests for COVID-19 is critical, especially in the communities that have low rates of vaccination and low access to health care services, including COVID-19 surveillance and diagnostic testing,  said Xiaowei Wang, UIC professor of pharmacology and bioengineering.  The current crisis has created an unprecedented need for rapid tests that are highly sensitive and the sooner we can develop better technology and testing options, the better it will be for everyone.  Assay reagents create a chemical reaction when mixed with a biological sample containing a virus or other marker. For example, an at-home pregnancy test consists of assay reagents that react to pregnancy hormones in a urine sample. In laboratory molecular tests, scientists mix samples with assay reagents in a highly controlled process. Because the reaction conditions (like temperature) are tightly controlled, the tests are both sensitive and selective, meaning the chance of false positives or false negatives is very low.However, these laboratory tests can be expensive and are not accessible in all communities and field settings. The challenge with at-home and field tests is that they need assay reagents to work under less controlled conditions, which increases the chances for false results or inconclusive tests. One method, called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which uses six DNA primers for pathogen detection, has shown promise for other pathogens, like malaria, but has not been efficiently applied to COVID-19. Wang and the UIC researchers who developed the new COVID-19 assay first created and applied a bioinformatics algorithm to identify the best potential DNA primer combinations for reliably detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, with the LAMP method. Then, the researchers ran a series of simulations to optimize the conditions under which the potential DNA primer combinations worked best in the field environments.After using their analysis to develop a testing method using the DNA primers and conditions, the team designed experiments to see how the test performed.In experiments, Wang and his collaborators processed artificial samples and human samples with a standard PCR test and with their new test. When the results were compared, the researchers not only saw significant improvement in the efficiency of their test over others using the LAMP method to detect the virus but also that it was comparable to more expensive gold standard PCR tests. In their article,  Developing RT-LAMP Assays for Rapid Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in Saliva,  published in the journalEBioMedicine, the researchers report that the new LAMP assays were as effective as standard PCR assays in SARS-CoV-2 detection and that their new assays have unique advantages, like speed and direct detection of viral RNA in saliva, that make the test  ideal for inexpensive point-of-care diagnosis.  Wang said this lab-based study shows that their test works, but that they will need to validate the test in further studies with a greater number of samples from real patients. He hopes that by summer they will have conducted a study including about 1,500 patient samples. If the study validates the test, the data will be submitted with an application to U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Emergency Use Authorization.Reference: Huang X, Tang G, Ismail N, Wang X.

Antibodies against a long-ignored section of the virus, which the team dubbed the anchor, have the potential to recognize a broad variety of flu strains, even as the virus mutates from year to year, they reported Dec. 23, 2021 in the journal Nature. It s always very exciting to discover a new site of vulnerability on a virus because it paves the way for rational vaccine design,  says co-senior author Andrew Ward, PhD, professor of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at Scripps Research.  It also demonstrates that despite all the years and effort of influenza vaccine research there are still new things to discover. By identifying sites of vulnerability to antibodies that are shared by large numbers of variant influenza strains we can design vaccines that are less affected by viral mutations,  says study co-senior author Patrick Wilson, MD, who was previously at the University of Chicago and recently recruited to Weill Cornell Medicine as a professor of pediatrics and a scientist in the institution s Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children s Health.  The anchor antibodies we describe bind to such a site. The antibodies themselves can also be developed as drugs with broad therapeutic applications. In a typical year, influenza affects more than 20 million people in the United States and leads to more than 20,000 deaths. Vaccines against influenza typically coax the immune system to generate antibodies that recognize the head of hemagglutinin (HA), a protein that extends outward from the surface of the flu virus. The head is the most accessible regions of HA, making it a good target for the immune system; unfortunately, it is also one of the most variable. From year to year, the head of HA often mutates, necessitating new vaccines.Researchers have designed experimental influenza vaccines to be more universal, spurring the body to create antibodies against the less-variable stalk region of HA, which extends like a stem between the influenza virion and the HA head. Some of these universal flu vaccines are currently in early clinical trials.In the new study, a collaborative team of scientists characterized 358 different antibodies present in the blood of people who had either been given a seasonal influenza vaccine, were in a phase I trial for an experimental, universal influenza vaccine, or had been naturally infected with influenza.Many of the antibodies present in the blood of participants were antibodies already known to recognize either the HA head or stalk. But a collection of new antibodies stood out; the antibodies bound to the very bottom of the stalk, near where each HA molecule is attached to the membrane of the flu virion.The co-first authors of the manuscript Julianna Han, a staff scientist in the Ward lab, and Jenna Guthmiller, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago named this section of HA the anchor, and began studying it further. In all, the scientists identified 50 different antibodies to the HA anchor, from a total of 21 individuals. The antibodies, they discovered, recognized a variety of H1 influenza viruses, which account for many seasonal flu strains. Some of the antibodies were also able to recognize pandemic H2 and H5 strains of influenza in lab tests. And in mice, the antibodies successfully protected against infection by three different H1 influenza viruses. In order to increase our protection to these highly mutating viruses, we need to have as many tools as we can,  says Han.  This discovery adds one more highly potent target to our repertoire.  Importantly, these antibodies appear to be fairly common in people, and belong to a class of antibodies that any person s body can produce an important consideration in designing a vaccine to spur their development. The human immune system already has the ability to make antibodies to this epitope, so it s just a matter of applying modern protein engineering methods to make a vaccine that can induce those antibodies in sufficient numbers,  adds Guthmiller.The researchers say that future, improved iterations of a universal vaccine could more purposefully aim to generate anchor antibodies. Until now, scientists designing universal vaccines hadn t paid attention to whether the anchor region of the stem was included as a target. Ideally, a universal influenza vaccine will lead to antibodies against multiple sections of the virus such as both the HA anchor and the stalk to increase protection to evolving viruses.The researchers are planning future studies on how to design a vaccine that most directly targets the HA anchor of different influenza strains.Reference: Guthmiller JJ, Han J, Utset HA, et al.

And it s not just about fats and cholesterol. Past research spearheaded by Stanley Hazen, MD, Chairman of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic s Lerner Research Institute, has established that bacteria in the gut is a key player in red meat s effect on heart disease risk.Gut bacteria produce a compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) when they digests choline, lecithin and carnitine, which are nutrients that are abundant in animal products such as red meat and liver, as well as other animal products. High levels of circulating TMAO in the body have been shown to be a powerful tool for predicting future heart attack, stroke and death risk. Dr. Hazen s latest study found a two- to three-fold increase in TMAO levels in participants who ate red meat as their primary source of protein (accounting for 25 percent of their daily calories) for one month, compared to participants who relied on either white meat or plant-based foods as their top sources of protein.The red meat diet delivered a double whammy effect   not only did the study participants who followed it produce more TMAO than those on the other diets, but their kidneys were also less efficient at eliminating the TMAO from the body.However, after those participants stopped eating the high-red meat diet, their TMAO levels came back down to normal within three to four weeks. This indicates that TMAO levels are modifiable, meaning we can change our heart disease risk by making changes to our diet, Dr. Hazen says.The study participants who got their protein from white meat or plant-based sources had lower gut microbe creation of TMAO and improved kidney elimination of TMAO, suggesting that these types of diets are healthier for our hearts and bodies, he adds. We know lifestyle factors are critical for cardiovascular health, and these findings build upon our previous research on TMAO s link with heart disease,  Dr. Hazen says.  They provide further evidence for how dietary interventions may be an effective treatment strategy to reduce TMAO levels and lower subsequent risk of heart disease. As researchers learn more about TMAO and how gut microbes create it from choline, carnitine and lecithin, it opens up the possibility of finding ways to interrupt that process in order to reduce a person s risk for cardiovascular disease.Dr. Hazen explains,  We can use a TMAO level to help personalize dietary choices in an individual to help identify, for a given person, how much red meat is too much, and how to try to chase after lowering the level, much in the same way we do with cholesterol levels or triglyceride levels or glucose levels.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/one-atom-thick-christmas-tree-created-357124,One Atom Thick Christmas Tree Created  Researchers have created a Christmas tree that is a third of a nanometer thick  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The Christmas tree in the pictures above is 14 centimetres long. Since it is made of graphene, it consists of carbon atoms in only one layer and is only a third of a nanometer thick. It is cut out of a 10-meter long roll of graphene, transferred in one piece using a rebuilt laminating machine and then scanned with terahertz radiation.The experiment shows that continuous quality control can be done during the production of graphene, which is expected to play a significant role in future high-speed electronics, i.e. medical instruments and sensors.Graphene is a so-called two-dimensional material, i.e. it consists of atoms in one cohesive layer that is only one atom thin. It is more robust, stiffer and better at conducting electricity and heat than any other material we know of. Therefore, graphene is an obvious candidate for electronic circuits that take up less space, weigh less, are bendable and are more efficient than the electronics we know today. Even if you could make a pencil drawing of a Christmas tree and lift it off the paper which, figuratively, is what we have done it would be much thicker than one atom. A bacterium is, e.g. 3000 times thicker than the graphene layer we used. That s why I dare call this the world s thinnest Christmas tree. And although the starting point is carbon, just like the graphite in a pencil, graphene is at the same time even more conductive than copper. The  drawing  is made in one perfect layer in one piece,   says Professor Peter B ggild who lead the team behind the Christmas tree experiment. But behind the Christmas joke hides an important breakthrough. For the first time, we managed to make an in-line quality control of the graphene layer while we transferred it. Doing this is the key to gaining stable, reproducible and usable material properties, which is the prerequisite for utilising graphene in, e.g. electronic circuits.   As the researchers have done in this case, the graphene can be  grown  on copper film. The graphene is deposited on a roll of copper foil at around 1000   C. That process is well known and well-functioning. But a lot can go wrong when the ultra-thin graphene film is moved from the copper roller to where it is used. Since graphene is 30,000 times thinner than kitchen film, it is a demanding process. Researcher Abhay Shivayogimath has been behind several new inventions in DTU s transfer process, ensuring a stable transfer of the graphene layers from the copper roll.Moreover, there has been no technology that could control the electrical quality of graphene on the go - while transferring it. This yearPeter B ggild and his colleague Professor Peter Uhd Jepsen from DTU Fotonik, one of the world s leading terahertz researchers, established a way to do it.The coloured images are measurements of how the graphene layer absorbs terahertz radiation. The absorption is directly related to the electric conductivity: the better the conductive graphene, the better it absorbs.Terahertz rays are high-frequency radio waves that lie between infrared radiation and microwaves. Like X-rays, they can be used to scan human bodies, as we know it from airport security. Terahertz rays can also take pictures of the electrical resistance of the graphene layer. By connecting the terahertz scanner to the machine that transfers the graphene film, it is possible to image the electrical properties of the film during the transfer process. Suppose the implementation of graphene and other 2D materials is to be accelerated. In that case, ongoing quality assurance is a prerequisite, says Peter B ggild. Quality control precedes trust, he says. The technology can guarantee that graphene-based technologies are manufactured more uniformly and predictably with fewer errors. This year, the DTU researchers  method was approved as the first official international measurement standard for graphene. Their method was described earlier this year in the article Terahertz imaging of graphene paves the way to industrialisation.The potential is excellent. Graphene and other two-dimensional materials can e.g. enable the manufacturing of high-speed electronics performing lightning-fast calculations with far less power consumption than the technologies we use today. But before graphene can become more widespread on an industrial scale and be used in electronics, we encounter in everyday life three main problems must be solved.First, the price is too high. More and faster production is needed to bring the price down. But with that, you face the second problem: When you increase the speed and can not at the same time check the quality, the risk of error also increases dramatically. At high high-speed transfer, everything must be set precisely.This brings us to the third problem: How do you know what is precise?It requires measurements. And preferably measurements during the actual transfer process. The DTU team is convinced that the best bet on that method is quality control using terahertz radiation.Peter B ggild emphasises that these three problems have not been solved with the new method alone: We have taken a very significant step. We have converted a laminating machine into a so-called roll-2-roll transfer system. It gently lifts the graphene layer from the copper roll on which the graphene layer is grown and moves it onto plastic foil without it breaking, becoming wrinkled or dirty. When we combine this with the terahertz system, we can immediately see if the process has gone well. That is, whether we have unbroken graphene with low electrical resistance,  says Peter B ggild.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Drawing on animal and human data, the researchers found that buildup of the protein, called fibrin, triggers an overactive immune response that damages the gums and underlying bone. The study, which was published in Science, suggests that suppressing abnormal fibrin activity could hold promise for preventing or treating periodontal disease, as well as other inflammatory disorders marked by fibrin buildup, including arthritis and multiple sclerosis.Periodontal disease affects nearly half of Americans over age 30, and 70% of those 65 and older. It is a bacterial infection of the tissues supporting the teeth. In its early stages, periodontal disease causes redness and swelling (inflammation) of the gums. In advanced stages, called periodontitis, the underlying bone becomes damaged, leading to tooth loss. While scientists have known that periodontitis is driven in part by an exaggerated immune cell response, until now, it was unclear what triggered the response, and how it caused tissue and bone damage. Severe periodontal disease can lead to tooth loss and remains a barrier to productivity and quality of life for far too many Americans, especially those lacking adequate access to dental care,  said NIDCR Director Rena D Souza, D.D.S., Ph.D.  By providing the most comprehensive picture yet of the underlying mechanisms of periodontal disease, this study brings us closer to more effective methods for prevention and treatment. At sites of injury or inflammation, fibrin normally plays a protective role, helping to form blood clots and activating immune cells to fight infection. But too much fibrin has been linked with health problems, including a rare form of periodontitis due to a condition called plasminogen (PLG) deficiency. In affected people, mutations in the PLG gene lead to fibrin buildup and disease at various body sites, including the mouth.To explore the connection between abnormal fibrin buildup and periodontitis, the scientists, led by NIDCR investigators Niki Moutsopoulos, D.D.S., Ph.D., and Thomas Bugge, Ph.D., studied PLG deficiency in mice and analyzed human genetic data.Like humans with the condition, PLG-deficient mice developed periodontitis, including periodontal bone loss and elevated levels of fibrin in the gums. The mice s gums were crowded with immune cells called neutrophils, which are also found at high levels in common forms of periodontitis.Neutrophils typically defend the oral cavity from harmful microbes. But an excessive neutrophil response is thought to cause tissue damage.To find out if fibrin was driving this overactive response, the researchers impaired its ability to interact with (bind to) protein receptors on neutrophils. The weakened binding between fibrin and neutrophils completely prevented periodontal bone loss in PLG-deficient mice. Strikingly, it also reduced bone loss in normal mice with a common, age-related form of periodontitis, suggesting that similar mechanisms were at play in both forms of the disease. This study suggests that fibrin can cause neutrophil immunity to shift from protective to damaging in certain circumstances,  said Moutsopoulos, who credited postdoctoral fellow and study first author Lakmali Silva, Ph.D., for her research that led to the findings.  This fibrin-neutrophil engagement may be a driver of periodontitis. A genetic analysis of over 1,000 people seemed to support the animal findings. Even in the absence of PLG deficiency, variations in the PLG gene were linked to an increased risk of severe periodontitis, consistent with the idea that similar processes contribute to rare and common forms of the disease.Taken together, the study suggests that excessive buildup of fibrin in the gums whether due to changes in genes like PLG, chronic inflammation from a bacterial infection, or some combination of the two triggers an elevated and ultimately harmful neutrophil response that causes periodontal disease.The results are also in line with findings from other research teams, which have found that elevated fibrin may contribute to other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and that interfering with fibrin activity could help treat these conditions. Our data support the idea that targeting the fibrin-neutrophil interaction could be a promising treatment avenue to explore in both rare and common forms of periodontitis,  added Silva.Reference: Silva LM, Doyle AD, Greenwell-Wild T, et al.

Results from the study, which analyzed both people with melanoma and mouse models of the disease, appeared December 24, 2021, in Science.Among patients with advanced melanoma who underwent immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockers, those who consumed at least 20 grams a day of dietary fiber survived the longest without their disease progressing. In contrast, use of probiotic supplements appeared to lessen somewhat the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blocker regimens. Probiotics are live microorganisms typically consumed as a supplement to improve gut health. The data suggest that one can target the composition of the gut microbiota and affect the ability of the patient to respond to immunotherapy,  said Giorgio Trinchieri, M.D., chief of the Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology in NCI s Center for Cancer Research, one of the study s coleaders.  Consuming a diet rich in fiber, like fruits, vegetables, and legumes, could improve your ability to respond to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockers helps restore the immune system s natural ability to recognize and kill tumor cells. These drugs have been transformative in melanoma, improving how long some people with advanced disease live, sometimes by years. However, for many patients, immune checkpoint blockers fail to stop their tumors from growing. Several studies have suggested that the composition of the bacteria in the gut may influence the response to immunotherapy. The question is, can we change the composition of the type of bacteria in the gut and improve the ability of the patient to respond?  Dr. Trinchieri said.In a previous study, Dr. Trinchieri and a different group of collaborators showed that some people with melanoma who initially did not respond to treatment with an immune checkpoint blocker did respond after receiving a fecal transplant from a patient who had responded to the drug. The fecal transplant, they concluded, had introduced different gut bacteria that helped make it easier for immune cells to invade and kill their tumors. Dietary fiber intake and use of probiotic supplements have also been shown to affect the composition of gut bacteria. More cancer patients are taking probiotic supplements in an effort to improve their gut health, but little is known about how probiotics which basically change the ecology of the gut bacteria impact immunotherapy response,  he said.The connection between fiber intake and immunotherapy response has also been unclear. However, a recent study led by Romina Goldszmid, Ph.D., also of NCI s Center for Cancer Research, showed that mice fed a diet rich in pectin, which is a fiber abundant in apples, were able to stave off tumor growth by activating immune cells and reprogramming the tumor microenvironment.In the new study, Dr. Trinchieri and study co-leads Carrie R. Daniel, Ph.D., M.P.H., and Jennifer A. Wargo, M.D., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and their collaborators looked at the composition of fecal microorganisms (the gut microbiota), dietary habits, and probiotic supplement use among patients who were being treated for advanced melanoma with immune checkpoint blockers.Among the 128 patients whose dietary fiber intake was known, those who reported consuming at least 20 grams of dietary fiber per day (an amount the researchers designated as  sufficient  for the purposes of this study) lived longer without their cancer progressing than those who consumed less dietary fiber. Every 5-gram increase in daily dietary fiber intake corresponded to a 30% lower risk of progression of the disease.The researchers also looked at the impact of dietary fiber on the response to treatment with anti-PD-1 drugs, a category of immune checkpoint blockers, in mouse models of melanoma. To mimic the different diets in the melanoma patients, they fed mice either a fiber-rich or a low-fiber diet, injected the mice with melanoma cells, and then treated the mice with anti-PD-1 therapy. Mice given the fiber-rich diet had delayed tumor growth after anti-PD-1 treatment, compared with mice given the low-fiber diet.The researchers then repeated the experiments in germ-free mice that is, mice that have no bacteria in their guts. In germ-free mice, the diet made no difference in the immunotherapy response,  Dr. Trinchieri said.  That suggests that the diet is affecting the response to immune checkpoint therapy by changing the composition of the gut microbiota. Dr. Trinchieri noted that one possible mechanism through which dietary fiber exerts its beneficial effect is by increasing the types of bacteria in the gut, such as Ruminococcaceae, that produce high levels of certain short-chain fatty acids that have an antitumor effect. We did see an increase in one of these short-chain fatty acids, propionate, in mice that were fed a high-fiber diet,  Dr. Trinchieri said.  Moreover, patients whose cancer responded to immunotherapy had a greater abundance of Ruminococcaceae bacteria in their gut microbiota compared with those who did not respond to therapy. The researchers also looked at the impact of probiotics on gut bacteria in the mouse model of melanoma. Mice fed probiotics had a reduced response to treatment with anti-PD-L1 drugs and developed larger tumors than control mice. Further analysis showed that mice fed probiotics had lower levels of tumor-killing immune cells, suggesting a weakened immune response.In the human study, nearly one-third of the patients reported they had taken a probiotic supplement within the past month. Although the researchers noted that the small sample size and variety of probiotics used by the patients made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the association between probiotic use and response to immune checkpoint blockers, they did observe that patients who consumed the highest levels of dietary fiber with no probiotic use survived the longest. The impact of dietary fiber and probiotics on the gut microbiota is only part of the bigger picture,  Dr. Trinchieri cautioned.  Many factors can affect the ability of a patient with melanoma to respond to immunotherapy. However, from these data, the microbiota seems to be one of the dominant factors. The data also suggest that it s probably better for people with cancer receiving immunotherapy not to use commercially available probiotics. He noted that larger studies are warranted and should include cancers other than melanoma.Reference: Spencer CN, McQuade JL, Gopalakrishnan V, et al.

While dinosaurs ruled the land, ichthyosaurs and other aquatic reptiles (that were emphatically not dinosaurs) ruled the waves, reaching similarly gargantuan sizes and species diversity. Evolving fins and hydrodynamic body-shapes seen in both fish and whales, ichthyosaurs swam the ancient oceans for nearly the entirety of the Age of Dinosaurs.  Ichthyosaurs derive from an as yet unknown group of land-living reptiles and were air-breathing themselves,  says lead author Dr. Martin Sander, paleontologist at the University of Bonn and Research Associate with the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHM).  From the first skeleton discoveries in southern England and Germany over 250 years ago, these  fish-saurians  were among the first large fossil reptiles known to science, long before the dinosaurs, and they have captured the popular imagination ever since. Excavated from a rock unit called the Fossil Hill Member in the Augusta Mountains of Nevada, the well-preserved skull, along with part of the backbone, shoulder, and forefin, date back to the Middle Triassic (247.2-237 million years ago), representing the earliest case of an ichthyosaur reaching epic proportions. As big as a large sperm whale at more than 17 meters (55.78 feet) long, the newly named Cymbospondylus youngorum is the largest animal yet discovered from that time period, on land or in the sea. In fact, it was the first giant creature to ever inhabit the Earth that we know of. The importance of the find was not immediately apparent,  notes Dr. Sander,  because only a few vertebrae were exposed on the side of the canyon. However, the anatomy of the vertebrae suggested that the front end of the animal might still be hidden in the rocks. Then, one cold September day in 2011, the crew needed a warm-up and tested this suggestion by excavation, finding the skull, forelimbs, and chest region. The new name for the species, C. youngorum, honors a happy coincidence, the sponsoring of the fieldwork by Great Basin Brewery of Reno, owned and operated by Tom and Bonda Young, the inventors of the locally famous Icky beer which features an ichthyosaur on its label.In other mountain ranges of Nevada, paleontologists have been recovering fossils from the Fossil Hill Member s limestone, shale, and siltstone since 1902, opening a window into the Triassic. The mountains connect our present to ancient oceans and have produced many species of ammonites, shelled ancestors of modern cephalopods like cuttlefish and octopuses, as well as marine reptiles. All these animal specimens are collectively known as the Fossil Hill Fauna, representing many of C. youngorum s prey and competitors.C. youngorum stalked the oceans some 246 million years ago, or only about three million years after the first ichthyosaurs got their fins wet, an amazingly short time to get this big. The elongated snout and conical teeth suggest that C. youngorum preyed on squid and fish, but its size meant that it could have hunted smaller and juvenile marine reptiles as well. The giant predator probably had some hefty competition. Through sophisticated computational modeling, the authors examined the likely energy running through the Fossil Hill Fauna s food web, recreating the ancient environment through data, finding that marine food webs were able to support a few more colossal meat-eating ichthyosaurs. Ichthyosaurs of different sizes and survival strategies proliferated, comparable to modern cetaceans  from relatively small dolphins to massive filter-feeding baleen whales, and giant squid-hunting sperm whales.Co-author and ecological modeler Dr. Eva Maria Griebeler from the University of Mainz in Germany notes,  due to their large size and resulting energy demands, the densities of the largest ichthyosaurs from the Fossil Hill Fauna including C. youngourum must have been substantially lower than suggested by our field census. The ecological functioning of this food web from ecological modeling was very exciting as modern highly productive primary producers were absent in Mesozoic food webs and were an important driver in the size evolution of whales. Whales and ichthyosaurs share more than a size range. They have similar body plans, and both initially arose after mass extinctions. These similarities make them scientifically valuable for comparative study. The authors combined computer modeling and traditional paleontology to study how these marine animals reached record-setting sizes independently. One rather unique aspect of this project is the integrative nature of our approach. We first had to describe the anatomy of the giant skull in detail and determine how this animal is related to other ichthyosaurs,  says senior author Dr. Lars Schmitz, Associate Professor of Biology at Scripps College and Dinosaur Institute Research Associate.  We did not stop there, as we wanted to understand the significance of the new discovery in the context of the large-scale evolutionary pattern of ichthyosaur and whale body sizes, and how the fossil ecosystem of the Fossil Hill Fauna may have functioned. Both the evolutionary and ecological analyses required a substantial amount of computation, ultimately leading to a confluence of modeling with traditional paleontology. They found that while both cetaceans and ichthyosaurs evolved very large body sizes, their respective evolutionary trajectories toward gigantism were different. Ichthyosaurs had an initial boom in size, becoming giants early on in their evolutionary history, while whales took much longer to reach the outer limits of huge. They found a connection between large size and raptorial hunting think of a sperm whale diving down to hunt giant squid and a connection between large size and a loss of teeth think of the giant filter-feeding whales that are the largest animals ever to live on Earth.Ichthyosaurs' initial foray into gigantism was likely thanks to the boom in ammonites and jawless eel-like conodonts filling the ecological void following the end-Permian mass extinction. While their evolutionary routes were different, both whales and ichthyosaurs relied on exploiting niches in the food chain to make it really big. As researchers, we often talk about similarities between ichthyosaurs and cetaceans, but rarely dive into the details. That s one way this study stands out, as it allowed us to explore and gain some additional insight into body size evolution within these groups of marine tetrapods,  says NHM s Associate Curator of Mammalogy (Marine Mammals), Dr. Jorge Velez-Juarbe.  Another interesting aspect is that Cymbospondylus youngorum and the rest of the Fossil Hill Fauna are a testament to the resilience of life in the oceans after the worst mass extinction in Earth's history. You can say this is the first big splash for tetrapods in the oceans. C. youngorum will be permanently housed at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, where it is currently on view.

The new study tested the ability of antibodies generated by vaccination to neutralize the omicron variant in laboratory assays that pitted antibodies against live viruses and against pseudoviruses constructed in the lab to mimic omicron.Antibodies from people double-vaccinated with any of the four most widely used vaccines Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson were significantly less effective at neutralizing the omicron variant compared to the ancestral virus. Antibodies from previously infected individuals were even less likely to neutralize omicron.Individuals who received a booster shot of either of the two mRNA vaccines are likely to be better protected, although even their antibodies exhibited diminished neutralizing activity against omicron. The new results suggest that previously infected individuals and fully vaccinated individuals are at risk for infection with the omicron variant,  says Ho.  Even a third booster shot may not adequately protect against omicron infection, but of course it is advisable to get one, as you ll still benefit from some immunity. The results are consistent with other neutralization studies, as well as early epidemiological data from South Africa and the U.K., which show efficacy of two doses of the vaccines against symptomatic disease is significantly reduced against the omicron variant. When administered early in the course of infection, monoclonal antibodies can prevent many individuals from developing severe COVID. But the new study suggests that all of the therapies currently in use and most in development are much less effective against omicron, if they work at all.In neutralization studies with monoclonal antibodies, only one (Brii198 approved in China) maintained notable activity against omicron. A minor form of omicron is completely resistant to all antibodies in clinical use today. The authors note that omicron is now the most complete  escapee  from neutralization that scientists have seen.In this study Ho s lab also identified four new spike mutations in omicron that help the virus evade antibodies. This information should inform the design of new approaches to combat the new variant. Ho suggests that scientists will need to develop vaccines and treatments that can better anticipate how the virus is evolving. It is not too far-fetched to think that SARS-CoV-2 is now only a mutation or two away from being completely resistant to current antibodies, either the monoclonal antibodies used as therapies or the antibodies generated by vaccination or infection with previous variants,  says Ho.Reference: Liu L, Iketani S, Guo Y, et al.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-insights-into-how-the-brain-functions-357114,New Insights Into How the Brain Functions Advanced computational methods have led to new insights into the intricacies of brain structure and function that may enhance the understanding of this complex organ  both in health and disease ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. To better appreciate how a complex organ such as the brain functions, scientists strive to accurately understand both its detailed cellular architecture and the intercellular communications taking place within it.At Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. Md. Abul Hassan Samee and his colleagues have taken a major step in that direction. They developed advanced computational methods that led to new insights into the intricacies of brain structure and function that may enhance the understanding of this complex organ, both in health and disease. Currently, we have technologies that allow us to identify and locate individual cells in a tissue. We are also capable of determining what are the products produced by each single cell in that tissue,  said corresponding author Samee, assistant professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and a member of the Center for Organ Repair and Renewal at Baylor.Mammalian brains are complex and comprise several millions to hundreds of billions of cells, and, when analyzed, they generate vast amounts of data. The challenge has been to develop ways to integrate the information in those datasets to generate a model that reliably reflects how an organ works. In the current study, Samee collaborated with Francisco Jos  Grisanti Canozo, first author of the work, and Dr. James Martin, both with Baylor and the Texas Heart Institute, and Zhen Zuo, also with Baylor, to develop a neural network model to elucidate architectural and functional aspects of complex tissues. They have called the model Spatial Transcriptomics cell-types Assignment using Neural Networks (STANN). We also used other advanced, sophisticated computational methodologies that make the model more rigorous,  Samee said.  We applied STANN and the other methods to existing brain datasets of the mouse olfactory bulb and started to see very interesting patterns in the brain s cellular architecture and functionality. The brain comprises distinct morphological layers, and STANN allowed the researchers to predict a detailed picture of their cellular organization.  Layer by layer, our model provided the precise location of different cell types, whether they communicated with each other and by which means,  Samee said.  This was a  eureka moment  for us. Samee and his colleagues determined that the cell-type composition is quite consistent within a morphological layer. For example, a particular layer may have a certain percentage of astrocytes, neurons and microglia that remains the same throughout the same layer.  If we take several small sections from different areas of the same morphological layer, these percentages look very similar to each other. However, the percentages may change from one layer to another,  Samee explained.The team saw a different pattern emerge when they looked at cell colocalization.  For instance, in one area of a morphological layer we may see astrocytes colocalize with olfactory neurons. But in another area from the same morphological layer these cells can be completely separated,  Samee explained.  We also see that intercellular communication between two cell types changes in different areas of a morphological layer, a reflection that gene regulatory networks are changing with location. The researchers hypothesize that morphological layers in the brain have different spatially localized communities of cell types. The communities are similar in cell type composition, but there are large differences in how cell types colocalize and communicate within a community. This suggests that brain cell types have spatially localized subtypes performing location-specific functions. This new detailed view of brain organization at the single-cell and functional levels had not been described before,  Samee said. The neural network model approach we have developed in this work presents an  instruction manual  for other researchers to use to study other areas of the brain or other organs, such as the heart, the main interest of my lab,  said co-author Martin, vice chairman and professor of molecular physiology and biophysics, Vivian L.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-insights-into-when-modern-mammals-evolved-357112,New Insights Into When Modern Mammals Evolved A new study has provided the most detailed timeline of mammal evolution to date  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new study has provided the most detailed timeline of mammal evolution to date.The research describes a new and fast computational approach to obtain precisely dated evolutionary trees, known as  timetrees .The authors used the novel method to analyse a mammal genomic dataset with the aim to answer a long-standing question around whether modern mammal groups originated before or after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) mass extinction, which wiped out over 70 percent of all species, including all dinosaurs.The findings, published in the journal Nature, confirm the ancestors of modern mammal groups postdate the K-Pg extinction that occurred 66 million years ago, settling a controversy around the origins of modern mammals.The research team was led by Dr Mario dos Reis (Queen Mary University of London) and Professor Phil Donoghue (University of Bristol), and included scientists from Queen Mary, University of Bristol, UCL, Imperial College London, and the University of Cambridge.Dr Sandra  lvarez-Carretero, lead author of the paper from UCL (then at Queen Mary), said:  By integrating complete genomes in the analysis and the necessary fossil information, we were able to reduce uncertainties and obtain a precise evolutionary timeline. Did modern mammal groups co-exist with the dinosaurs, or did they originate after the mass extinction? We now have a definite answer. Professor Donoghue from the University of Bristol s School of Earth Sciences, added:  The timeline of mammal evolution is perhaps one of the most contentious topics in evolutionary biology. Early studies provided origination estimates for modern groups deep in the Cretaceous, in the dinosaur era. The past two decades had seen studies moving back and forth between post- and pre-K-Pg diversification scenarios. Our precise timeline settles the issue. With worldwide sequencing projects now producing hundreds to thousands of genome sequences, and with imminent plans to sequence more than a million species, evolutionary biologists will soon have a wealth of information at their hands. However, current methods to analyse the vast genomic datasets available and create evolutionary timelines are inefficient and computationally expensive.Dr dos Reis said:  Inferring evolutionary timelines is a fundamental goal of biology. However, state-of-the-art methods rely on using computers to simulate evolutionary timelines and assess the most plausible ones. In our case, this was difficult due to the gigantic dataset analysed, involving genetic data from almost 5,000 mammal species and 72 complete genomes. In this study, the researchers developed a new, fast Bayesian approach to analyse large numbers of genome sequences, whilst also accounting for uncertainties within the data.Dr dos Reis added:  We solved the computational hurdles by dividing the analysis in sub-steps: first simulating timelines using the 72 genomes and then using the results to guide the simulations on the remaining species. Using genomes reduces uncertainty because it allows rejection of unplausible timelines from the simulations. Dr Asif Tamuri, co-lead author of the paper from UCL, who was responsible for assembling the mammal genomic dataset, said:  Our data processing pipeline sourced as much genomic data for as many mammal species as possible. This was challenging because genetic databases contain inaccuracies and we had to develop a strategy to identify poor quality samples or mislabelled data that had to be removed. Using their novel approach, the team were able to reduce computation time for this complex analysis from decades to months.Dr  lvarez-Carretero added:  If we had tried to analyse this large mammal dataset in a supercomputer without using the Bayesian method we have developed, we would have had to wait decades to infer the mammal timetree. Just imagine how long this analysis could take if we were to use our own PCs. In addition, we managed to reduce computation time by a factor of 100. This new approach not only allows the analysis of genomic datasets, but also, by being more efficient, substantially reduces the CO2 emissions released due to computing. The method developed in the study could be used to tackle other contentious evolutionary timelines that require analysis of large datasets. By integrating the novel Bayesian approach with the forthcoming genomes from the Darwin Tree of Life and Earth BioGenome projects, the idea of estimating a reliable evolutionary timescale for the Tree of Life now seems within reach.The research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council, UK.Reference:   lvarez-Carretero S, Tamuri AU, Battini M, et al.

It could be the sweet fragrance of jasmine, or the musty scent of algae. Suddenly, you are back at your childhood home, or under the burning sun of a distant shore.This association between smells and places seems to be a deeply embedded aspect of human cognition. But how are the two linked in the brain? A study published today (December 22nd) in the scientific journal Nature presents a potential explanation. ""Odour molecules do not inherently carry spatial information. However, animals in the wild use odours for spatial navigation and memory, which allow them to locate valuable resources such as food , said Cindy Poo, the study's first author.  We wanted to understand the neural basis of these behaviours, and so we decided to study how the brain combines olfactory and spatial information.""The researchers focused on the primary olfactory cortex. ""The olfactory system is unique among the senses"", said the study's senior author, Zachary Mainen, a principal investigator at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Portugal. ""Only olfaction has direct reciprocal connections to the hippocampal system, which is involved in memory and navigation.""Hippocampal neurons are famous for functioning as ""place cells"". This is because each cell becomes active at a specific location within an environment. Together, these neurons encode the entire area, effectively creating a neural map of space. Hippocampal place cells, whose discovery in rats led to the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2014, are so reliable that scientists can tell where an animal is simply by observing their activity. ""We know that the hippocampal system sends signals to the primary olfactory cortex"", said Poo. ""So we suspected that this brain region might do more than just identify different smells."" To test this idea, the researchers developed a custom-made puzzle for rats, which are highly adept at olfaction. The rats sampled odours at the four ends of a plus-shaped maze. Then, depending on the scent, they had to figure out where the reward was hidden. ""In this task, the rats had to learn and remember exact associations of odours and locations"", Poo explained. While the animals were solving the puzzle, the researchers monitored the activity of neurons in a part of the primary olfactory cortex called the posterior piriform cortex. ""Neurons communicate with one another by emitting electric impulses"", explained Mainen. ""By recording the electric signals emitted by hundreds of individual neurons in this brain area, we were able to decode what specific neurons cared about. For instance, whether they became active when the animal was smelling a specific odour, or when it was at a certain location in the maze.""""Our results exceeded our expectations"", said Poo. ""We had predicted that some neurons here might care about location to a certain degree. ""However, by carefully studying the activity of olfactory cortex neurons while the animal was navigating in the maze, we found that these neurons had learned an entire map of the environment."" The researchers discovered a large population of neurons that, similarly to hippocampal place cells, became active at a specific location in the maze. Interestingly, the map didn't cover the entire environment equally. Instead, it was largely restricted to behaviourally significant spots on the maze: where the animals experienced the odours and received rewards.""It appears that important locations were learned through experience and encoded into a map. It was remarkable that these cells in the olfactory system started responding in a given location when no odours were present, even when the rat was just walking around not engaged in the task , Mainen added. Is this how we come to form memories that link certain smells with specific places? ""We found that some neurons here responded to smell, others to location, and yet others to both types of information to varying degrees. All these different neurons are mixed together, and are probably interconnected. Therefore, one can speculate that activating smell-space associations can happen through activity within this network"", suggested Poo.  ""This study also opens up a new window to understand how the senses are used for navigation and memory"", added Mainen.

New research from the laboratory of Dr. Natasza Kurpios, associate professor in the Department of Molecular Medicine in the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine, has now revealed a key molecular mechanism that can send those fats on the wrong path, potentially resulting in debilitating diseases. Our research reveals a new mechanism in dietary fat absorption,  says Kurpios,  and highlights an alternative pathway for fats that could be explored in several disease states of the intestine. Their study, published in the Nov. 23 issue of the journal Cell Reports, looks closely at intestinal lacteals. Part of the lymphatic system, these tiny channels absorb dietary fat and direct those lipid molecules into the blood circulation. Scientists knew that lacteals were crucial for fat absorption, but how those lacteals form, and what causes their malfunction, remains unclear.Kurpios and her team have studied how intestines first develop in embryos, and knew that the Pitx2 gene tells the embryo s cells which way is left or right   a key mechanism in the gut s twisting formation. They wanted to know if misregulation of Pitx2 might also be the culprit behind lacteal dysfunction.They created genetically modified mice that made less of the Pitx2 protein, then bottle-fed the baby mice using fluorescent lipids, which allowed them to do state-of-the-art, three-dimensional fluorescent imaging to see where exactly those dietary lipids traveled in the mice s bodies.  We found that these mice had intestinal lymphatics that didn t function correctly,  says Kurpios.  Instead, the fats from their diet were shunted through a different route straight to the liver, where they accumulated and caused fatty liver disease. Looking deeper, Kurpios and her team showed that lacteals grow alongside, and depend on, neighboring vascular smooth muscle cells, known as 'star cells.' Functional gut lymphatics require support and signaling from these muscle star cells and depend on the Pitx2 left-right pathway to properly organize the gut lymphatics, protecting from fatty liver disease. This muscle-to-lymphatic signaling proceeds with messages encoded in the flow of reactive oxygen species between these cells, a novel and exciting feature of the study that will spawn further investigations in the intestine and elsewhere in the body.Kurpios  finding has real-world implications. For example, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent in the United States, with up to 25-33% of American adults estimated to be affected. The disease can lead to eventual loss of liver function.  Our study suggests that NAFLD can arise from altered intestinal lymphatic transport of fat   and not just from causes within the liver itself   inspiring discoveries of new mechanisms and regulators of this disease,  says Dr. Shing Hu, the lead author on the paper.The next step will be to develop a mouse model that allows more precise analyses of the ways in which Pitx2 works to direct the formation of gut lymphatics, and of the intestine as a complete organ. With funding from the Center for Vertebrate Genomics, the researchers will also collaborate with Dr. Iwijn De Vlaminck, associate professor at the Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, to generate gene expression maps of all intestinal cell types at single-cell resolution and across key stages to remove Pitx2 with spatiotemporal precision. Collectively, we hope that our studies hold promise toward combating intestinal diseases and will prompt new discoveries on how fats are absorbed into the body,  Kurpios says.Reference: Hu S, Mahadevan A, Elysee IF, et al.

While there was already some data out there on the lifetime of the virus on common-touch surfaces like stainless steel, plastics and copper, the lifetime of the virus on engineered coatings was less understood,  said Kevin Mussleman, the Waterloo mechanical and mechatronics engineering professor who led the study.The Waterloo team partnered with Wilfrid Laurier University researchers who tested the effectiveness of the antiviral coatings on glass and N95 mask fabric.Testing involved depositing coatings that were about 1,000 times thinner than a human hair, then immersing the coated glass and fabric in a viral solution or exposing them to smaller droplets of the viral solution. After removing the virus from the coatings, each extract was placed in contact with healthy cells and measured for its ability to replicate.Results showed the other coatings did not have the same antiviral effects as copper or a copper-containing compound.Additionally, they found that in some cases  nanoscale thin films of copper can come off from the surface and rapidly dissolve in virus-containing droplets, enhancing the virucidal effect,  said lead study author Louis Delumeau, who recently graduated from Waterloo with a master s degree in nanotechnology engineering.  There is an opportunity to tailor the coating in a way that enhances its interaction with the viral droplet and the antiviral effect,  added Musselman. While wearing a mask is an effective way of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Delumeau said adding an antiviral coating containing copper to the outside of the protective material or an inside filter could add an additional layer of safety. Not only would a mask that covers the nose and mouth greatly limit the transmission of the virus but adding a coating such as the one we developed could actually kill the virus rapidly and reduce the amount of virus spread,  he said. The researchers  antiviral coating could also be applied to high-touch public surfaces, Delumeau said.The Waterloo research group is developing coating techniques for masks and is continuing to explore the dissolution process for smaller droplet sizes, as well as investigating how to control the adhesion of copper films to various surfaces.Reference: Delumeau LV, Asgarimoghaddam H, Alkie T, et al.

Researchers found that one-quarter of over 200 species tested contained ergot alkaloids and were therefore symbiotic. The symbiosis and ergot alkaloids are specific to particular branches of the morning glory evolutionary tree, and each branch contains different ergot alkaloids and alkaloid mixtures,  Clay said.Named for the ergot fungus responsible for deadly outbreaks of Saint Anthony s Fire, a disease caused by ingestion of the fungus, in the Middle Ages, ergot alkaloids have had long and convoluted association with humans. The best-known ergot alkaloid is LSD, a synthetic derivative of naturally occurring ergot alkaloids in morning glories produced by their fungal partners.Historically, such alkaloid compounds have been used by indigenous peoples of Central and South America for their effects on the human mind and for regulating human reproduction. More recently they have been used for obstetric issues during labor and delivery and for treatment of migraine, Parkinson s and other maladies. We have known a lot about the fungal alkaloid chemistry and its effects on the mind and body for long time,  Clay said.  Our study is the first to show how highly coevolved morning glories and their symbiotic fungi are, and that coevolution is manifested by different mixtures and concentrations of ergot alkaloids across the morning glory evolutionary tree.

The initial findings of a long-term study show that certain degenerative processes are reduced in the brains of academics. Their brains are better able to compensate age-related cognitive and neural limitations.A good education is an excellent way to embark on a successful career and develop your personality. But can education also have a positive effect on our brains as we get older? A team of researchers under the University Research Priority Program  Dynamics of Healthy Aging  led by Lutz J ncke, professor of neuropsychology at the University of Zurich, has now explored this question in a long-term study.The researchers followed more than 200 senior citizens for over seven years. The study participants are not affected by dementia, have average to above-average intelligence and lead highly active social lives. They were examined neuroanatomically as well as neuropsychologically using magnetic resonance imaging at regular intervals. Based on complex statistical analyses, the researchers were able to show that academic education had a positive effect on age-related brain degeneration. In her PhD thesis, first author Isabel Hotz used novel automatic methods among others to study so-called lacunes and white matter hyperintensities. These degenerative processes showed up as  black holes  and  white spots  on the digital images. The reasons for this are not yet known and may have to do with small, unnoticed cerebral infarcts, reduced blood flow or loss of nerve pathways or neurons. This can limit a person s cognitive performance, in particular when degeneration affects key regions of the brain.The findings revealed that over the course of seven years, senior citizens with an academic background showed a significantly lower increase in these typical signs of brain degeneration.  In addition, academics also processed information faster and more accurately   for example, when matching letters, numbers of patterns. The decline in their mental processing performance was lower overall,  summarizes Hotz. The findings add to initial findings of other research groups, who have found that education has a positive effect on brain aging. Previous studies also suggest that mental processing speed depends on the integrity of neural networks in the brain. If these networks are affected, mental processing speed decreases.Even though no causal link between education and reduced natural brain degeneration has so far been found, the following at least seems likely:  We suspect that a high level of education leads to an increase in neural and cognitive networks over the course of people s lives, and that they build up reserves, so to speak. In old age, their brains are then better able to compensate any impairments that occur,  says neuropsychologist Lutz J ncke. It is also possible that brains that are active well into old age are less susceptible to degeneration processes, adds the neuropsychologist, though this would have to be verified in the further course of the ongoing long-term study.Reference: Hotz I, Deschwanden PF, M rillat S, Liem F, Kollias S, J ncke L.

Whereas human lungs develop over months and years into baroque tree-like structures, the anole lung develops in just a few days into crude lobes covered with bulbous protuberances. These gourd-like structures, while far less refined, allow the lizard to exchange oxygen for waste gases just as human lungs do. And because they grow quickly by leveraging simple mechanical processes, anole lungs provide new inspiration for engineers designing advanced biotechnologies.""Our group is really interested in understanding lung development for engineering purposes,"" said Celeste Nelson, the Wilke Family Professor in Bioengineering and the study's principal investigator. ""If we understand how lungs build themselves, then perhaps we can take advantage of the mechanisms mother nature uses to regenerate or engineer tissues.""While avian and mammalian lungs develop great complexity through endless branching and complicated biochemical signaling, the brown anole lung forms its relatively modest complexity through a mechanical process the authors likened to a mesh stress ball   the common toy found in desk drawers and DIY videos. The study, published Dec. 22 in the journal Science Advances, is the first ever to look at the development of a reptile lung, according to the researchers.The anole lung starts a few days into development as a hollow, elongated membrane surrounded by a uniform layer of smooth muscle. During development the lung cells secrete fluid, and as they do so the inner membrane slowly inflates and thins like a balloon. The pressure pushes against the smooth muscle, causing it to tighten and spread apart into fiber bundles that ultimately form a honeycomb-shaped mesh. Fluid pressure continues pushing the stretchy membrane outward, bulging through the gaps in the sinewy mesh and forming fluid-filled bulbs that cover the lung. Those bulges create lots of surface area where the gas exchange occurs. And that's it. The whole process takes less than two days and is complete within the first week of incubation. After the lizard hatches, air comes in at the top of the lung, swirls around the cavities, and then flows back out.For engineers looking to crib nature's short cuts on behalf of human health, this speed and simplicity make for a radical new design paradigm. The study also breaks new ground for scientists to study reptile development in far greater detail.When Nelson first started studying chicken lungs in the late 2000s, the conventional wisdom held ""that chicken lungs were the same as mouse lungs were the same as human lungs,"" Nelson said. ""And that's not true.""Eager to unsettle those assumptions, she guided her team to ask fundamental questions about how the lungs of different classes of vertebrates build themselves. ""The architecture of the bird lung is just so incredibly different from that of the mammalian lung,"" Nelson said. For example, instead of a diaphragm, birds have air sacs embedded throughout their bodies that act as bellows.To adapt the exquisite complexity of avian lungs for tools that could benefit human health, Nelson believed science needed to go even deeper. Nature had solved the gas-exchange problem with two radically different systems. How were they linked? And might there not be other systems, too? This led her team back in evolutionary time in search of a common origin. And there sat the reptile, doing what reptiles do so well: hiding in plain sight.When Michael Palmer joined the lab as a graduate student, he took up the challenge of organizing this study   quite literally   from the ground up. Alligators proved too ornery. Green anoles refused to breed. After years of preliminary work, Palmer took a trip to Florida to capture wild brown anoles in late 2019. He and his colleague traipsed through the mud of a suburban park, turning over rocks and leaves along the edge of the woods. They used traps made of dental floss to capture around a dozen individuals and place them each in their own miniature vivarium. They then drove the animals from north Florida back to Princeton, where the University's veterinarians and animal resources staff helped the team establish a permanent anole facility.That's when Palmer started looking at the eggs to map the organisms' lung development. Working with Andrej Ko mrlj, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, as well as graduate student Anvitha Sudhakar, Palmer used his observations to build a computational model of the lung and understand its physics.""We were curious if we could learn anything about the basics of lung development from studying such a simple lung,"" said Palmer, who earned his Ph.D. in chemical and biological engineering earlier this year. He had seen evidence that smooth muscle played a sculpting role in other systems, but in this study he was able to observe how that worked directly.""The lizard lung develops using a very physical mechanism,"" Palmer said. ""A cascade of pressure-induced tensions and pressure-induced buckling."" In less than two days, the organ goes from flat balloon to fully formed lung. And the process is simple enough that Palmer could use his computational model to build a working replica in the lab. While the engineered system didn't match the living system's full complexity, it got close.The researchers cast the membrane using a silicone material called Ecoflex, commonly used in the film industry for makeup and special effects. They then encased that silicone with 3D printed muscle cells to create the same kinds of corrugations in the inflated silicone that Palmer had found in the living organ. They met technical barriers that limited their creation's verisimilitude, but in the end it was uncannily similar to the living organ.Those humble backyard lizards had inspired a new kind of artificial lung and a framework that engineers can refine toward unknowable future ends.""Different organisms have different organ structures, and that's beautiful, and we can learn a lot from it,"" Nelson said. ""If we appreciate that there's a lot of biodiversity that we can't see, and we try to take advantage of it, then we as engineers will have more tools to tackle some of the major challenges that face society.""Reference: Palmer MA, Nerger BA, Goodwin K, et al.

The group lived approximately 5700 years ago   around 3700-3600 BC - around 100 years after farming had been introduced to Britain.Published in Nature, it is the first study to reveal in such detail how prehistoric families were structured, and the international team of archaeologists and geneticists say that the results provide new insights into kinship and burial practices in Neolithic times.The research team   which included archaeologists from Newcastle University, UK, and geneticists from the University of the Basque Country, University of Vienna and Harvard University - show that most of those buried in the tomb were descended from four women who had all had children with the same man.The cairn at Hazleton North included two L-shaped chambered areas which were located north and south of the main  spine  of the linear structure. After they had died, individuals were buried inside these two chambered areas and the research findings indicate that men were generally buried with their father and brothers, suggesting that descent was patrilineal with later generations buried at the tomb connected to the first generation entirely through male relatives.While two of the daughters of the lineage who died in childhood were buried in the tomb, the complete absence of adult daughters suggests that their remains were placed either in the tombs of male partners with whom they had children, or elsewhere.Although the right to use the tomb ran through patrilineal ties, the choice of whether individuals were buried in the north or south chambered area initially depended on the first-generation woman from whom they were descended, suggesting that these first-generation women were socially significant in the memories of this community.There are also indications that  stepsons  were adopted into the lineage, the researchers say - males whose mother was buried in the tomb but not their biological father, and whose mother had also had children with a male from the patriline. Additionally, the team found no evidence that another eight individuals were biological relatives of those in the family tree, which might further suggest that biological relatedness was not the only criterion for inclusion. However, three of these were women and it is possible that they could have had a partner in the tomb but either did not have any children or had daughters who reached adulthood and left the community so are absent from the tomb.Dr Chris Fowler of Newcastle University, the first author and lead archaeologist of the study, said:  This study gives us an unprecedented insight into kinship in a Neolithic community. The tomb at Hazleton North has two separate chambered areas, one accessed via a northern entrance and the other from a southern entrance, and just one extraordinary finding is that initially each of the two halves of the tomb were used to place the remains of the dead from one of two branches of the same family. This is of wider importance because it suggests that the architectural layout of other Neolithic tombs might tell us about how kinship operated at those tombs. I igo Olalde of the University of the Basque Country and Ikerbasque, the lead geneticist for the study and co-first author, said:  The excellent DNA preservation at the tomb and the use of the latest technologies in ancient DNA recovery and analysis allowed us to uncover the oldest family tree ever reconstructed and analyse it to understand something profound about the social structure of these ancient groups. David Reich at Harvard University, whose laboratory led the ancient DNA generation, added:  This study reflects what I think is the future of ancient DNA: one in which archaeologists are able to apply ancient DNA analysis at sufficiently high resolution to address the questions that truly matter to archaeologists. Ron Pinhasi, of the University of Vienna, said:  It was difficult to imagine just a few years ago that we would ever know about Neolithic kinship structures. But this is just the beginning and no doubt there is a lot more to be discovered from other sites in Britain, Atlantic France, and other regions. Reference: Fowler C, Olalde I, Cummings V, et al.

To truly understand how global change is affecting natural communities and to identify effective strategies to mitigate the ongoing dramatic biodiversity loss, it is fundamental to account for the overarching complexity emerging from biotic interactions. As we show in our new research, doing this might reveal important counterintuitive mechanisms,  Giovanni Strona says.The researchers combined a massive dataset of fish distribution and ecological traits for more than 9,000 fish species. Using artificial intelligence techniques, they generated thousands of networks mapping the interactions between corals and fish and those between fish prey and fish predators in all reef localities worldwide.They quantified, for each locality, the degree of fish dependency on corals. This analysis confirmed what Strona and colleagues showed in another paper published earlier this year: coral loss might detrimentally affect, on average, around 40 per cent of fish species in each coral reef area.The researchers also found that the dependency between fish and corals becomes stronger the further away they are from humans. This means that fish communities in remote reefs might be the most vulnerable to the cascading effects of coral mortality.Next, the researchers asked whether the increased risk that stems from the potential cascading effects of coral mortality might counteract the benefits that remote fish communities experience because they are far away from direct impacts of human activities. For this, we devised a novel risk assessment framework that is applicable to any ecosystem. It combines local anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing and pollution and global impacts like climate and environmental change with the risk deriving from ecological interactions,  explains Mar Cabeza, head of the Global Change and Conservation Lab at the University of Helsinki.The framework revealed that taking into account ecological dependencies flattens the expected negative relationship between extinction risk for fish communities and remoteness. For example, the hotspots of risks for fish communities from local human-derived impacts and global change are almost perfectly the same as the hotspots of risk from fish coral dependencies. This produces a global map of risk for fish communities where no place is safe, regardless of distance from humans,  Giovanni Strona says. The validity and relevance of these findings might extend far beyond reef fish, depicting a world where remote localities, rather than safe havens for biodiversity, might be, instead, areas of critical vulnerability,  Mar Cabeza concludes.Reference: Strona G, Beck PSA, Cabeza M, et al.

Deleting just that one enzyme, which they called EtfDMtb, rendered Mtb unable to sustain an infection in mice. This enzyme is an attractive drug target for TB silencing it not only starves the bacterium but also has an additional toxic effect on it,  said senior author Dr. Sabine Ehrt, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine.The new findings arose from an observation by lead author Dr. Tiago Beites, an instructor in the Ehrt laboratory. Dr. Beites was analyzing Mtb proteins and noted that two of them have intriguingly close resemblances to human metabolic enzymes called ETF-  and ETF- . The latter are known to be involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, and their mutation can cause metabolic disease.Dr. Beites and his colleagues investigated further, and ultimately discovered that the two Mtb proteins, which they renamed EtfAMtb and EtfBMtb, together form an enzyme that works with another Mtb enzyme, which they called EtfDMtb, to carry out a similar metabolic function for Mtb specifically a breakdown-related process called the beta oxidation of fatty acids.Although it had been assumed that fatty acid metabolism in Mtb was covered by a multitude of redundant enzymes, making this set of pathways a poor drug target, the team found that the three-component complex they uncovered is critical for Mtb s normal growth and survival. A mutant Mtb lacking EtfDMtb the most promising drug target of the three because it has no human counterpart was unable to fuel its growth with fatty acids or related cholesterol. It was also directly harmed through a toxic effect by the buildup of long-chain fatty acids and could not establish a long-term infection in mice. This is a good initial indication that inhibiting this enzyme would be an effective way to treat TB,  Dr. Beites said.Even now in the age of antibiotics, Mtb remains a major public health threat. It is estimated to infect nearly a quarter of the human population at any one time, mostly in South and Southeast Asia, China, and parts of Africa. It also has been killing about 1.5 million people annually more than any other pathogen except, in the past two years, SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19.Mtb has been hard to fight because it grows slowly and can hide from the immune system within the immune system itself specifically in large immune cells called macrophages, which engulf Mtb but then cannot destroy it. Curing Mtb infection with antibiotics is possible but requires lengthy treatment regimens with which patients often fail to comply.With about 4,000 genes in its genome, Mtb also has a formidable ability to evolve treatment resistance. Multi-drug-resistant Mtb strains have become a major medical problem in many parts of the world, and have created an urgent need for drugs that kill this pathogen through new mechanisms.Evidence is emerging in support of targeting fatty acid metabolism. Last year, a separate team of researchers in Europe reported that certain chemical compounds called dioxobenzo-pyrido-indoles can kill Mtb by inhibiting the enzyme that Dr. Beites and Dr. Ehrt call EtfDMtb. The Weill Cornell Medicine researchers, having begun to elucidate the functions of EtfDMtb, therefore hope to work with the European team to test these compounds further.The researchers also plan additional studies to determine whether EtfDMtb or closely related enzymes could be good drug targets in other disease-causing bacteria.Reference: Beites T, Jansen RS, Wang R, et al.

Targeting pathways altered by MLL4 mutations to induce proper cell turnover and death offers an approach to suppress tumor growth, according to a new study from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The study was published this month in the journal Science Advances. The gene MLL4 is one of the most commonly mutated genes across all of human cancers. Previous work has shown that MLL4 is linked to tumor suppression in a variety of cancers, but its role in skin cancer was unknown. In order to uncover how MLL4 influences cancer growth, researchers knocked out only this gene in the epithelial tissues of mice and found that skin cells proliferated, the skin thickened, and a form of normal skin cell turnover and death, called ferroptosis, was inhibited. Your skin cells need to be able to undergo cell death,  said Brian Capell, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of Dermatology and Genetics and lead author of the study.  If cells don t die and turn over, they stick around, continue to grow, and become cancerous. We saw that a loss of MLL4 impaired ferroptosis by activating genes that encourage tumor growth while simultaneously suppressing genes that prevent cancerous proliferation. To combat cancer-cell development in individuals with MLL4 genetic mutations, the researchers believe that specific medications that can promote ferroptosis may be a future way to inhibit cancer growth and encourage healthy cell turnover. The good news is that there are pharmaceuticals currently available that correct and promote the pathways that are impaired when MLL4 is mutated,  said Capell.  Our lab plans on studying whether these ferroptosis-promoting medications can be effective to treat skin cancers like squamous cell carcinoma. Another potential avenue for treatment involves testing whether these medications can be given in combination with other anti-cancer drugs such as immunotherapies to enhance the abilities of each to stop cancers. Aside from cancer, the Penn scientists believe that modulating ferroptosis may have a significant impact on other skin disorders marked by aberrant skin turnover, too, such as psoriasis. According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, it s estimated that over 85 million Americans have some kind of skin disease.Reference: Egolf S, Zou J, Anderson A, et al.

They detected markers in the blood associated with patients becoming so ill they needed treatment in intensive care.The findings may lead to new ways for triaging and assessing the risk of Covid patients, relieving the pressure from hospitals during infection spikes. Since the start of the pandemic, researchers have been working to understand how and why Covid affects individuals differently. Even patients hospitalised with the disease have diverse treatment needs, with some milder cases simply requiring extra oxygen while others need invasive ventilation in intensive care.The lead author of the study Dr Dimitris Lagos, from Hull York Medical School at the University of York, said:  Our study identified factors in the blood that are uniquely correlated with severe and fatal outcomes for hospitalised Covid patients.  These findings support the observation that Covid is a disease that develops in stages and have the potential to provide doctors with vital information, allowing them to tailor treatments according to severity of disease and identify high-risk patients early. Importantly, our findings could provide the basis for new tests that are feasible in any hospital as samples we used were from routine blood tests already carried out as part of standard care for Covid patients.  The research, published in the journal iScience, involved testing blood samples from over 160 patients admitted to hospital during the first and second wave of the pandemic and was carried out in collaboration with York and Scarborough Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester University and four NHS Trusts in Greater Manchester.The researchers measured levels of cytokines and chemokines   the proteins in the blood which drive the overwhelming immune response observed in patients with Covid   as well as tiny RNAs, called microRNAs   which reflect the state of diseased tissues and are already known to be good indicators of severity and stage in several other diseases. They identified a set of cytokines, chemokines, and microRNAs linked with fatal outcomes from Covid. Co-Investigator of the study, Dr Nathalie Signoret, from Hull York Medical School at the University of York, said:  Early in the pandemic, researchers observed high levels of inflammatory cytokines   molecules which adjust or alter the immune system response   in Covid patients with poor outcomes. However, this so called  cytokine storm  was also present in hospitalised patients with a milder version of the disease. We set out to fine tune our knowledge of which factors in the blood correlate with severe disease with more insight and accuracy.  Our findings provide a scientific foundation for the development of blood tests that could provide doctors with vital information on which treatments will be most effective for a patient. The fact that this analysis could be carried out as part of already established routine clinical blood testing could provide all hospitals with better tools for triaging patients and identifying early individuals who are more likely to suffer worse outcomes.  Dr David Yates, Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine and the Clinical Lead for Research at York and Scarborough Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said:  This collaborative work is very exciting. Having the ability to spot which hospitalised patients are more likely to deteriorate and need our services in Critical Care will open up a whole new area of research into which treatments should be given at different stages of this terrible disease. Other national research projects our trust has been involved with in like the Recovery and REMAP-CAP trials, have already given us a handful of effective treatments for Covid-19. The trial goes one step further in identifying very specific features in used blood samples that would otherwise have just been thrown away. This means we might be able to target those novel treatments more effectively to those patients at the greatest risk. Reference: Wilson JC, Kealy D, James SR, et al.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genes-are-switched-on-in-the-human-embryo-straight-away-357064,Genes are Switched on in the Human Embryo Straight Away Scientists have discovered that genes in human embryos rapidly become active after fertilization  opening a new window onto the start of human embryonic life  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The finding that some genes are active from the get-go challenges the textbook view that genes don't become active in human embryos until they are made up of four-to-eight cells, two or three days after fertilisation.The newly discovered activity begins at the one-cell stage   far sooner than previously thought   promising to change the way we think about our developmental origins.The research, published today in Cell Stem Cell, was co-led by Professor Tony Perry at the University of Bath, Dr Giles Yeo at the University of Cambridge and Dr Matthew VerMilyea at Ovation Fertility, US.Using a method called RNA-sequencing, the team applied precision analysis to individual human eggs and one-cell embryos to make a detailed inventory of tell-tale products of gene activity, called RNA transcripts. It revealed that hundreds of genes awaken in human one-cell embryos. Because the gene activity starts small, previous techniques had not been sensitive enough to detect it. But state-of-the art RNA-sequencing used in this study was able to reveal even small changes.""This is the first good look at the beginning of a biological process that we all go through   the transit through the one-cell embryo stage,"" said Professor Perry, from the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at Bath. ""Without genome awakening, development fails, so it's a fundamental step.""The team found that many genes activated in one-cell embryos remain switched on until the four-to-eight cell stage, at which point they are switched off. It looks as if there is a sort of genetic shift-work in early embryos: the first shift starts soon after fertilisation, in one-cell embryos, and a second shift takes over at the eight-cell stage,  said Professor Perry. At the moment of human fertilisation, sperm and egg genomes   the collection of all of their genes   are inactive: the sperm and egg rely on transcripts produced when they were being formed for instructions that regulate their characteristics.Transcripts provide essential instructions in all cells, and embryo cells are no exception. This means that it is essential for parental (sperm and egg) genomes to awaken in the new embryo. But when and how does this happen?Understanding the process of genome awakening is important: it is a key piece of the jigsaw of development that promises a better understanding of disease, inheritance and infertility. The scientists found some activated genes that might be expected to play roles in early embryos, but the roles of others were unknown and could point to embryonic events that we don't yet understand.The team's findings also shine a light on how the genes are activated. ""Although the trigger for activation is thought to come from the egg, it's not known how; now we know which genes are involved, we can locate their addresses and use molecular techniques to find out,"" said Professor Perry. Remarkably, candidates that might trigger gene activation include factors usually associated with cancer, such as some well-known oncogenes. This led the researchers to speculate that the natural, healthy role of factors that are known to misbehave in cancer, is to awaken genes in one-cell embryos. If this proves to be correct, the team s findings could illuminate events that initiate cancer, providing new diagnostic and preventive opportunities.The findings also have clinical implications for the inheritance of acquired traits, such as obesity: parents who gain weight seem to pass the trait to their kids. It is not known how such acquired traits are transmitted, but altering gene activation after fertilisation is a possible mechanism.As Dr Yeo from the Medical Research Council Metabolic Diseases Unit at Cambridge suggests, ""If true, we should be able to see this altered gene activation signature at the one cell stage.""The team also looked at unhealthy one-cell embryos that do not go on to develop, and found that many of their genes fail to activate. Abnormal embryos have been used to evaluate methods of human heritable genome editing, but the new findings suggest they may be inappropriate as a reliable test system.Reference: Asami M, Lam BYH, Ma MK, et al.

With expertise and technologies from WEHI s Advanced Genomics facility and Centre for Dynamic Imaging, they were able to visualise the parasites in real-time.The discovery provides a better understanding of how Toxoplasma parasites can hide in the brain and what triggers them to reactivate and cause disease. It could pave the way for new drug targets to treat patients suffering from chronic toxoplasmosis infections.The research, led by Dr Simona Seizova, PhD student Ms Ushma Ruparel, Associate Professor Chris Tonkin and colleagues from WEHI, was published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe.Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that affects humans and other mammals. It is caused by eating undercooked or contaminated meat, and from exposure to infected cat faeces.Around one in five Australians have been infected with Toxoplasma gondii, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma infections can cause congenital birth defects, blindness and neurological dysfunction in unborn children. In adults who are immunocompromised, it can cause blindness and even death.PhD student Ushma Ruparel said Toxoplasma parasites often lay dormant in the brain of the host animal, where they could reactivate to cause severe disease. We know that Toxoplasma parasites make their own molecules and proteins that it exports into the host cell to protect itself from detection by the immune system. While this is well-understood in the acute, initial stage of infection, how Toxoplasma hijacks its host cells in its dormant form was unknown,  Ms Ruparel said. With our colleagues who have expertise in genomics and advanced imaging, we showed that the parasite exports proteins called Inhibitor of STAT1 transcription (IST) to the host cell to suppress immune signals. Associate Professor Tonkin said IST played a key role in limiting interferon signalling in bradyzoites, to protect host cells from immune-mediated cell death, which is essential to the body s fight against Toxoplasma. Interferon is the beacon molecule of the immune system. It gives off a blinking sign to notify the immune system that the body has been infected with a range of diseases, including Toxoplasma,  he said. Interferon is crucial in the fight against disease. However, the cunning parasite tries to turn this signal off during the latent period, as this is the only way it can survive. While the immune system is determined to rid the infection from the body, the parasite only has survival on its mind. So, it s essentially a tug-of-war, a molecular battle.  While the exact mechanism of why and how the pathogen is reactivated to create disease is little understood, there appears to be a correlation between people who have immune deficiencies and brain lesions.The association of Toxoplasma with neuropsychiatric conditions over the past decade is another curious element to this disease, said Associate Professor Tonkin. While there is a correlation between Toxoplasma infection and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer s, there s no causation yet as we don t know the cause and effect,  Associate Professor Tonkin said. The way this parasite resides in our brains during chronic infection and the way that it shuts down our innate immune system to survive is quite unique. While this work was all done in the laboratory, it will lay the foundation to bring us closer to understanding these age-old questions about how these pathogens interfere in our neural pathways and what their exact role is. Our next step is to figure out what it is about chronic infections that make those changes really unique to chronic infections. We have found one specific parasite protein that seems to have a role, but it doesn t seem to account for all changes, and we want to explore if there are any others.  The findings have started to unravel the molecular players that help pathogens create latency, which could pave the way for a better understanding of the impact of parasites on the brain.Associate Professor Tonkin said latent infections were one of the biggest global health burdens. Diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, malaria and tuberculosis are all examples of chronic or latent infections that cause significant disease, disability and economic impact. If we can understand what causes these latent infections to reactivate and their control over our cells and brain, we will be on the pathway to finding new treatments that diminish this burden for some of the most underprivileged people around the world.

Among the most complete dinosaur embryos ever found, the fossil suggests that these dinosaurs developed bird-like postures close to hatching.Scientists found the posture of  Baby Yingliang  unique among known dinosaur embryos   its head lies below the body, with the feet on either side and the back curled along the blunt end of the egg. Previously unrecognised in dinosaurs, this posture is similar to that of modern bird embryos.In modern birds, such postures are related to  tucking    a behaviour controlled by the central nervous system and critical for hatching success. After studying egg and embryo, researchers believe that such pre-hatching behaviour, previously considered unique to birds, may have originated among non-avian theropods.Led by scientists from the University of Birmingham and China University of Geosciences (Beijing), the research team from institutions in China, UK and Canada today published its findings in iScience.The embryo is articulated in its life position without much disruption from fossilisation. Estimated to be 27 cm long from head to tail, the creature lies inside a 17-cm-long elongatoolithid egg. The specimen is housed in Yingliang Stone Nature History Museum.Fion Waisum Ma, joint first author and PhD researcher at the University of Birmingham, said:  Dinosaur embryos are some of the rarest fossils and most of them are incomplete with the bones dislocated. We are very excited about the discovery of 'Baby Yingliang' - it is preserved in a great condition and helps us answer a lot of questions about dinosaur growth and reproduction with it. It is interesting to see this dinosaur embryo and a chicken embryo pose in a similar way inside the egg, which possibly indicates similar prehatching behaviours. Baby Yingliang  was identified as an oviraptorosaur based on its deep, toothless skull. Oviraptorosaurs are a group of feathered theropod dinosaurs, closely related to modern-day birds, known from the Cretaceous of Asia and North America. Their variable beak shapes and body sizes are likely to have allowed them to adopt a wide range of diets, including herbivory, omnivory and carnivory.Birds are known to develop a series of tucking postures, in which they bend their body and bring their head under their wing, soon before hatching. Embryos that fail to attain such postures have a higher chance of death due to unsuccessful hatching.By comparing  Baby Yingliang  with the embryos of other theropods, long-necked sauropod dinosaurs and birds, the team proposed that tucking behaviour, which was considered unique to birds, first evolved in theropod dinosaurs many tens or hundreds of millions of years ago. Additional discoveries of embryo fossils would be invaluable to further test this hypothesis.Professor Lida Xing from China University of Geosciences (Beijing), joint first author of the study, said:  This dinosaur embryo was acquired by the director of Yingliang Group, Mr Liang Liu, as suspected egg fossils around the 2000. During the construction of Yingliang Stone Nature History Museum in 2010s, museum staff sorted through the storage and discovered the specimens. These specimens were identified as dinosaur egg fossils. Fossil preparation was conducted and eventually unveiled the embryo hidden inside the egg. This is how  Baby Yingliang  was brought to light. Professor Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh, part of the research team, said:  This dinosaur embryo inside its egg is one of the most beautiful fossils I have ever seen. This little prenatal dinosaur looks just like a baby bird curled in its egg, which is yet more evidence that many features characteristic of today s birds first evolved in their dinosaur ancestors.

Amyloid is a protein that accumulates in the brain very early in the development of Alzheimer s disease,  said Dr Koncz.According to Professor Perminder Sachdev, Co-Director of CHeBA and Leader of the Older Australian Twins Study, twins provide a unique opportunity to investigate the relative importance of genetic and lifestyle factors for Alzheimer s disease, because monozygotic twins share 100% of their genetic material, and dizygotic twins share an estimated 50%. Australia has one of the world s leading twin registries   Twin Research Australia   members of which participated in the study.The amyloid PET imaging was done in collaboration with the Department of Molecular Imaging and Therapy, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, and the Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET at Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. The researchers discovered that the heritability of amyloid is moderate   meaning genes play only a moderate role in determining the variation in amyloid build up in the brain.   With respect to modifiable risk factors, we examined whether vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, or a history of heart disease were significantly associated with amyloid burden or had any shared genetic basis,  said Dr Koncz. While the study did not find an association between vascular risk factors and amyloid, larger studies are required.  Identifying modifiable risk factors will lead us to interventions that reduce the risk of amyloid accumulation   and ultimately risk reduction of developing Alzheimer s disease,  said Professor Perminder Sachdev.ReferenceVillemagne VL, Rowe CC, Sachdev PS et al.

The methods, published in Genome Biology, can be applied to large collections of pathogens and will strengthen global research collaborations to tackle future pandemics.Over the past decade, WGS has revolutionised the understanding of bacterial disease. WGS data can be used for surveillance, functional genomics and population dynamics, leading to both public health and research scientists adopting genome-based approaches.The genome sequencing of thousands of microorganisms has remained expensive - largely due to costs associated with sample transportation and library DNA construction - while the need to genome sequence collections of key pathogens has grown substantially in recent years.Until now, large-scale bacterial genome projects could only be performed in a handful of sequencing centres around the world. With this study, the team of scientists have managed to make this technology accessible to laboratories worldwide. It has been 26 years since the first bacterial genome was sequenced, and it is now possible to sequence bacterial isolates at scale. However, access to this game-changing technology for scientists in some low- and middle-income countries has remained restricted, said study author and Director of the Earlham Institute Prof Neil Hall. The need to  democratise  the field of pathogen genomic analysis prompted us to develop a new strategy to sequence thousands of bacterial isolates with collaborators based in many economically-challenged countries. 10k Salmonella strainsFocusing on the organism Salmonella enterica, a pathogen with a global significance that causes infection and deadly disease, this large-scale genomic sequencing initiative was led by the worldwide 10,000 Salmonella genomes research consortium (10KSG) with scientists from 16 countries.The objectives of 10KSG are to make genomic data more accessible to low and middle income countries, especially because mortality rates for Salmonella in sub-Saharan Africa are exceptionally high. Understanding the genetic makeup of the collective of such bacteria strains was imperative, and the project sequenced and analysed 10,000 Salmonella genomes from Africa and Latin America.The researcher s innovative WGS approach aimed to streamline the large-scale collection and genome sequencing of bacterial isolates, and collected more than 10,400 clinical and environmental bacterial isolates from LMICs in under a year.The sample logistics pipeline, developed by the University of Liverpool, was optimised by shipping the heat-inactivated bacterial isolates as  thermolysates  in ambient conditions from across the world to the UK. Subsequently, isolates were sequenced at the Earlham Institute using the unique LITE protocol - a low cost, low input automated method for rapid genome sequencing. In total, the gene library construction and DNA sequencing bioinformatic analysis was done with a total reagent cost of less than USD$10 (around  7.50GBP) per genome. Prof of Microbial Pathogenesis and study author Jay Hinton from the University of Liverpool, said:  One of the most significant challenges facing public health researchers in LMI countries is access to state-of-the-art technology. For a combination of logistical and economic reasons, the regions associated with the greatest burden of severe bacterial disease have not benefited from widespread availability of WGS. The 10,000 Salmonella genomes project was designed to begin to address this inequality. Dr Blanca Perez Sepulveda, Postdoctoral Research Associate and study author from the University of Liverpool, who led the global sample collection, optimisation and analysis, added:  The adoption of large-scale genome sequencing and analysis of bacterial pathogens will be an enormous asset to public health and surveillance in LMI countries. Here, we have established an efficient and relatively inexpensive pipeline for the worldwide collection and sequencing of bacterial genomes.  Deadly bacteriaNon-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) have been widely associated with enterocolitis in humans, a zoonotic disease that is linked to the industrialisation of food production. Due to the scale of human cases of enterocolitis and concerns related to food safety, more genome sequences have been generated for Salmonella than any other genus. In recent years, new lineages of NTS serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis have been recognised as common causes of invasive bloodstream infections (iNTS disease), responsible for about 77,000 deaths per year worldwide.  Approximately 80 percent of deaths due to iNTS disease occur in sub-Saharan Africa. The new Salmonella lineages responsible for bloodstream infections can be identified by genomics, due to gene degradation, altered prophage repertoires and novel multidrug resistant plasmids.  Prof Neil Hall, added:  The number of publicly-available sequenced Salmonella genomes reached 350,000 in 2021 and are available from several online repositories. However, limited genome-based surveillance of Salmonella infections has been done in some LMI countries, and the existing dataset did not accurately represent the Salmonella pathogens that are currently causing disease across the world.   Global pipelineDr Darren Heavens, Postdoctoral Scientist at the Earlham Institute, who developed the whole-genome sequencing pipeline, said:  We saw the need to simplify and expand genome-based surveillance of salmonellae from Africa and other parts of the world, involving isolates associated with invasive disease and gastroenteritis in humans, and extending to bacteria derived from animals and the environment.  Our pipeline represents a cost-effective and robust tool for generating bacterial genomic data from LMI countries, to allow investigation of the epidemiology, drug resistance and virulence factors of isolates.  Development of the global 10KSG consortium that involved collaborators from 25 institutions, research and reference laboratories across 16 countries. Members of the 10KSG provided access to 10,419 bacterial isolates sourced from51 LMICs and regions - covering seven bacterial genera: Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Shigella, and Staphylococcus - coordinating the sample collection and transport of materials to be sequenced in the UK.  Limited funding resources led us to design a genomic approach that ensured accurate sample tracking and captured comprehensive metadata for individual bacterial isolates, while keeping costs to a minimum for the Consortium, said Prof Hall.  The pipeline streamlined the large-scale collection and sequencing of samples from LMICs. A key driver was to facilitate access to WGS and allow a worldwide collaborative effort to generate a remarkably informative and robust set of genomic data.

In this birth defect, the neural tube that forms the spinal cord during pregnancy, does not close so that spinal nerves are exposed, resulting in paralysis and high risk of other complications.Their new study, published online Dec. 16 in PNAS,  brings us closer to being able to provide a precision medicine approach to families who are looking to ensure healthy birth outcomes and the greatest potential for infants affected by spina bifida,  said senior author Dr. Margaret Elizabeth Ross, director of the Center for Neurogenetics and professor of neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and the Nathan Cummings Professor in Neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine.Spina bifida is a complex genetic disorder, meaning it's not generally caused by malfunction in a single gene but usually requires an interplay of several genes that have been altered in relatively small ways. Environmental conditions such as nutrition and the medications and supplements women are taking can also impact fetal health.  The challenge is to understand the role of genetic variation in individual families, coupled with the environmental factors, so we can do our best to ensure a healthy baby,  said Dr. Ross, who also heads the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Development at Weill Cornell Medicine.Studying the genes involved in causing spina bifida has been challenging. Mouse models bearing specific gene mutations have helped researchers gain insight into genetic pathways that may be important to neural tube closure, and researchers have looked for alterations to these genetic pathways in humans. However, the problem with this approach to scientific investigation is bias.  You tend to get what you look for,  Dr. Ross said.In order to find ways to prevent and treat complex genetic disorders, it is necessary to reduce this bias inherent in a  candidate gene search , that is, to avoid limiting the search for clinically relevant genes to those already implicated in experimental models. One way to look at our genes without a preconceived notion of what causes disease is to search across the complete set of genes in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A successful GWAS requires thousands of patients to find specific mutations related to a disease. While such large patient collections have been gathered for common complex disorders like autism spectrum that affects 1 in 54 children in the United States, a GWAS approach is really challenging for spina bifida that affects one in every 2,758 live births in the United States or 1,427 babies born each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  We need to devise new ways for genome-wide investigations of complex genetic conditions that are less common but still impact many families.  Dr. Ross said.Tackling these obstacles, Dr. Ross and her colleagues, including at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Baylor College of Medicine, and Stanford Medicine, developed an unbiased approach to study a smaller number of people to find genes that distinguish patients with spina bifida versus individuals without the condition, and apply further systems biology tools to assess relevance of those genes to human spina bifida. The researchers examined the genomes of 149 people with spina bifida and 149 healthy controls with similar genetic backgrounds. Because spina bifida is rare, studying people from around the globe is necessary to obtain enough data, Dr. Ross said. This is why the researchers evaluated genetic information from people in both the United States and Qatar. Using machine learning, in which a computer algorithm sorts through and categorizes data, they were able to determine which genes bearing predicted function-changing variants had the greatest potential for distinguishing cases from controls.The researchers then analyzed how these genes relate to activities at the molecular level. The pathways that were most highly significant involved glucose and lipid metabolism, meaning the body s ability to break down and use sugar and fats for cell energy and function.  These processes are relevant to conditions like diabetes and obesity,  Dr. Ross said. Diabetes and obesity during pregnancy are both known risk factors for neural tube defects.  This really gave us a lot of encouragement that our machine learning approach was coming up with clinically relevant information,  she said, and the method is identifying additional significant molecular pathways that underpin the condition. We continue to build an international consortium of clinicians and families to increase the power of this approach toward understanding human spina bifida,  Dr. Ross said. Ultimately, she hopes it will be possible to analyze the genomes of couples who want to conceive, to identify their optimal strategies for preventing spina bifida. For example, for some couples, additional folic acid may be an excellent preventive measure, while for others, taking a supplement like inositol that can support cell membrane function may help lower the risk of spina bifida, according to some studies.  One day we will be able to counsel individual couples on what is the most effective route for them to have a healthy birth outcome, and for a child affected by spina bifida, to optimize their development and quality of life into adulthood,  she said.Reference: Aguiar-Pulido V, Wolujewicz P, Martinez-Fundichely A, et al.

The fossil reveals that Arthropleura was the largest-known invertebrate animal of all time, larger than the ancient sea scorpions that were the previous record holders.The specimen, found on a Northumberland beach about 40 miles north of Newcastle, is made up of multiple articulated exoskeleton segments, broadly similar in form to modern millipedes. It is just the third such fossil ever found. It is also the oldest and largest: the segment is about 75 centimetres long, while the original creature is estimated to have measured around 2.7 metres long and weighed around 50 kilograms. The results are reported in the Journal of the Geological Society.The fossil was discovered in January 2018 in a large block of sandstone that had fallen from a cliff to the beach at Howick Bay in Northumberland.  It was a complete fluke of a discovery,  said Dr Neil Davies from Cambridge s Department of Earth Sciences, the paper s lead author.  The way the boulder had fallen, it had cracked open and perfectly exposed the fossil, which one of our former PhD students happened to spot when walking by. Unlike the cool and wet weather associated with the region today, Northumberland had a more tropical climate in the Carboniferous Period, when Great Britain lay near the Equator. Invertebrates and early amphibians lived off the scattered vegetation around a series of creeks and rivers. The specimen identified by the researchers was found in a fossilised river channel: it was likely a moulted segment of the Arthropleura s exoskeleton that filled with sand, preserving it for hundreds of millions of years.The fossil was extracted in May 2018 with permission from Natural England and the landowners, the Howick Estate.  It was an incredibly exciting find, but the fossil is so large it took four of us to carry it up the cliff face,  said Davies.The fossil was brought back to Cambridge so that it could be examined in detail. It was compared with all previous records and revealed new information about the animal s habitat and evolution. The animal can be seen to have only existed in places that were once located at the Equator, such as Great Britain during the Carboniferous. Previous reconstructions have suggested that the animal lived in coal swamps, but this specimen showed Arthropleura preferred open woodland habitats near the coast.There are only two other known Arthropleura fossils, both from Germany, and both much smaller than the new specimen. Although this is the largest Arthropleura fossil skeleton ever found, there is still much to learn about these creatures.  Finding these giant millipede fossils is rare, because once they died, their bodies tend to disarticulate, so it s likely that the fossil is a moulted carapace that the animal shed as it grew,  said Davies.  We have not yet found a fossilised head, so it s difficult to know everything about them. The great size of Arthropleura has previously been attributed to a peak in atmospheric oxygen during the late Carboniferous and Permian periods, but because the new fossil comes from rocks deposited before this peak, it shows that oxygen cannot be the only explanation.The researchers believe that to get to such a large size, Arthropleura must have had a high-nutrient diet.  While we can t know for sure what they ate, there were plenty of nutritious nuts and seeds available in the leaf litter at the time, and they may even have been predators that fed off other invertebrates and even small vertebrates such as amphibians,  said Davies.Arthropleura animals crawled around Earth s equatorial region for around 45 million years, before going extinct during the Permian period. The cause of their extinction is uncertain, but could be due to global warming that made the climate too dry for them to survive, or to the rise of reptiles, who out-competed them for food and soon dominated the same habitats.The fossil will go on public display at Cambridge s Sedgwick Museum in the New Year.Reference: Davies NS, Garwood RJ, McMahon WJ, Schneider JW, Shillito AP.

The key to unlocking the power of these plants is in amplifying the amount of the compound created or synthesizing the compound for drug development.Researchers at Purdue University achieved the first step toward using the compound in pharmaceuticals by mapping its biosynthetic pathway, a sort of molecular recipe of the ingredients and steps needed.   These plants contain important compounds, but the amount is very low and extraction won t be enough,  said Natalia Dudareva, a Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry in Purdue s College of Agriculture, who co-led the project.  By understanding how these compounds are formed, we open a path to engineering plants with higher levels of them or to synthesizing the compounds in microorganisms for medical use. It is an amazing time for plant science right now. We have tools that are faster, cheaper and provide much more insight. It is like looking inside the cell; it is almost unbelievable. Thymol, carvacrol and thymohydroquinone are flavor compounds in thyme, oregano and other plants in the Lamiaceae family. They also have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other properties beneficial to human health. Thymohydroquinone has been shown to have anti-cancer properties and is particularly of interest, said Dudareva, who also is director of Purdue s Center for Plant Biology.In collaboration with scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany and Michigan State University, the team uncovered the entire biosynthetic pathway to thymohydroquinone, including the formation of its precursors thymol and carvacrol, and the short-lived intermediate compounds along the way.The findings alter previous views of the formation of this class of compounds, called phenolic or aromatic monoterpenes, for which only a few biosynthetic pathways have been discovered in other plants, she said. The work is detailed in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. These findings provide new targets for engineering high-value compounds in plants and other organisms,  said Pan Liao, co-first author of the paper and a postdoctoral researcher in Dudareva s lab.  Not only do many plants contain medicinal properties, but the compounds within them are used as food additives and for perfumes, cosmetics and other products. Now that this pathway is known, plant scientists could develop cultivars that produce much more of the beneficial compounds or it could be incorporated into microorganisms, like yeast, for production. The latter method involves a fermentation process to obtain the valuable compounds, as is true for many plant-based products, he said.The fermentation process is so important to food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and biofuels production that Purdue now offers a fermentation science major.A $5 million grant from the National Science Foundation supported the research. Using RNA sequencing and correlation analysis, the team screened more than 80,000 genes from plant tissue samples and identified the genes needed for thymohydroquinone production. Based on what was known about the compound structure and through metabolite profiling and biochemical testing, the team identified the biosynthetic pathway. The intermediate formed in the pathway was not what had been predicted,  Liao said.  We found that the aromatic backbone of both thymol and carvacrol is formed from  -terpinene by a P450 monooxygenase in combination with a dehydrogenase via two unstable intermediates, but not p-cymene, as was proposed. More pathways are being discovered now because of the ability to use RNA sequencing to perform high-throughput gene expression analysis, Dudareva said.The results of this research also will be useful for biochemistry and plant sciences research of other species of plants, she said. We, as scientists, are always comparing pathways in different systems and plants,  Dudareva said.  We are always in pursuit of new possibilities. The more we learn, the more we are able to recognize the similarities and differences that could be key to the next breakthrough. Reference: Krause ST, Liao P, Crocoll C, et al.

That may be different in individuals recovering from cocaine addiction and who are also HIV-positive. Scientists have long known that drug abuse can cause damage to the brain. We also know HIV infection can cause brain changes,  said John Foxe, Ph.D., director of the Del Monte Institute for Neurosciences and senior author of the study published in Neuropharmacology.  Since drug use is common in individuals with HIV, an important question is how brain deficits associated with both conditions might add up. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the brain responses of cocaine addicts and patients with HIV while participants played a game that involved purposefully withholding responses to target stimuli.  The challenging thing about the game we asked participants to play isn t exactly playing it, per se,  said Kathryn Mary Wakim, Ph.D., a recent graduate from the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Rochester and the first author of the study.  What s really hard is not playing the game. What we wanted to measure was how the brain holds back a response under certain task conditions. Difficulty withholding inappropriate responses are thought to be a central issue in addiction. Researchers found that participants diagnosed with both HIV and cocaine dependence had a difficult time holding back behavioral responses while playing the game, changes which were also reflected in brain activity. A companion study also published in Neuropharmacology found similar results while brain activity was measured using electroencephalography (EEG). Brain activity during response withholding in HIV+ participants in recovery from cocaine dependence was different than brain activity in HIV- participants in recovery. Currently, when someone who is HIV positive enters a recovery program they are treated in much the same fashion as any other person with an addiction issue,  said Foxe.  But our findings show that they, very likely, need to be treated differently or more intensively. HIV and drug addiction should be a dual diagnosis when it comes to recovery, and we will need to design specific targeted intervention approaches for this population, given their unique vulnerability. When people with HIV relapse, it's a big deal. The majority of participants in our study contracted HIV   not by injecting cocaine   but by having unprotected sex,  Wakim said.  Relapse is an outcome that should be minimized in this population, because cocaine use is strongly associated with risky sexual behavior, which makes the spread of HIV more likely when a relapse occurs.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/diabetes-drug-normalizes-insulin-action-in-the-brain-357023,Diabetes Drug Normalizes Insulin Action in the Brain Researchers have now shown for the first time that the SGLT  inhibitor empagliflozin can be used to treat insulin resistance in the brain   with positive effects on the metabolism of the entire body   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Overweight or obesity, an unfavorable distribution of fat in the body and the development of type 2 diabetes are often associated with a reduced effect of the hormone insulin in many organs, including the brain (insulin resistance). So far there is no treatment to restore insulin sensitivity in the brain, which plays a key role in metabolic control. Researchers of the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), the departments of Internal Medicine IV (Director: Prof. Andreas Birkenfeld) and Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry (Director: Prof. Andreas Peter) of T bingen University Hospital and the Institute of Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) at Helmholtz Munich have now shown for the first time that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin can be used to treat insulin resistance in the brain   with positive effects on the metabolism of the entire body. This study has now been published in Diabetes Care.  The brain has a decisive influence on our eating behavior and thus also on body weight and metabolism. If the brain reacts sensitively to insulin, we eat less, less abdominal fat is stored, and the insulin sensitivity of the entire body improves. However, in people with obesity or type 2 diabetes, the hormone in the brain is no longer effective. This insulin resistance leads to a disturbed metabolism. So far, insulin resistance in the brain cannot be treated with drugs. The researchers investigated whether a diabetes drug from the SGLT2 inhibitor group can also reverse insulin resistance in the brain. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes by promoting glucose excretion through the urine and have a beneficial effect on the heart, circulation and kidneys. For this purpose, the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on the insulin sensitivity of the brain was investigated in study participants with a preliminary stage of diabetes (prediabetes).  In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 40 people with prediabetes (age: 60   9 years; BMI: 31.5   3.8 kg/m ) received the drug empagliflozin or a placebo for eight weeks. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the insulin sensitivity of the brain before and after treatment. For this purpose, the subjects were given insulin via a nasal spray. When the hormone is absorbed through the nose, it reaches the brain directly. In addition, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to determine fat distribution. ""While placebo administration had no influence on insulin action in the brain, empagliflozin treatment significantly improved the effect of the hormone on brain activity,"" said lead author PD Dr. Stephanie Kullmann, summarizing the results of the study. Empagliflozin administration also improved fasting glucose levels and decreased liver fat content. Although the SGLT2 inhibitor did not reduce weight, it did reduce body fat content.  ""Our studies confirm insulin resistance in the brain in people with prediabetes,"" said last author Professor Martin Heni of T bingen University Hospital, Germany. ""Treatment with empagliflozin was able to restore insulin sensitivity. These results position SGLT2 inhibitors as the first potential pharmacological approach to treat insulin resistance in the brain. The increased insulin sensitivity also contributes to improved body metabolism.  As a next step, the researchers plan to investigate whether the improved insulin action in the brain is also involved in the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart and kidneys.

American adults currently in their 40s, 50s and early 60s have more symptoms of depression and worse memory recall than older Americans did when they were the same age. This pattern was found in Australian middle-aged adults but not in those living in Germany, South Korea or Mexico.Years of education was associated with better mental health in midlife, but the strength of this buffering effect has waned for Americans currently in their 40s, 50s and 60s relative to older American generations and to middle-aged adults in Australia, Germany, South Korea and Mexico.This work was published on Dec. 16 in American Psychologist. The protective effect of education is waning in the U.S. People born in the 1950s and 1960s who have a college education report more depressive symptoms and have poorer memory and overall health than both older American adults and their same-age peers in other countries with similar economic structures to the U.S.,  said Frank Infurna, associate professor of psychology at ASU and lead author on the study.The study used datasets from the U.S., Australia, Germany, South Korea and Mexico that contain information about the physical and mental health of middle-aged adults over time. For example, participating adults in the U.S. completed an interview every two years that included questions about their social networks and mental and physical health.The physical health of adults in their 40s and early 50s improved over time in all five countries included in the study. American adults born in the 1950s and 1960s have been healthier in midlife than people born in the 1930s and 1940s were when they were in their 40s and 50s. In the U.S., this health improvement dissipates by the late 50s and early 60s.Unlike physical health, the mental health of adults in midlife varied widely across the countries. Middle-aged adults living in Germany, South Korea and Mexico reported improved mental health in recent decades. In the U.S. and Australia, adults currently in midlife reported more depressive symptoms than their older peers. They also reported worse memory.In general, education protects people from experiencing symptoms of depression or having memory difficulties later in life. But college-educated American adults born in the 1950s and 1960s reported worse memory recall than their older, also college-educated, peers. This pattern did not exist in any of the other studied countries. While the future of American middle-aged adults might not look that bright, we can look to other countries to see what works for overall success in midlife,  Infurna said.  Other countries have more accessible health care systems and social safety nets like paid family leave, subsidized child care, and paid work and vacation leave. These differences can help support adults in midlife, who are often juggling working, parenting and caregiving, and suggest ways the U.S. can make things better. Infurna and his collaborators are currently working on additional studies of cross-cultural differences in midlife in pursuit of the goal of finding ways to improve the lives of middle-aged adults in the U.S.Reference: Historical change in midlife health, well-being, and despair: Cross-cultural and socioeconomic comparisons. - PsycNET.

It turns out there is a neurochemical explanation for why looking at mom or dad actually helps kiddos pay better attention.In a paper published Dec. 17 in the journal Science Advances, authors from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (also referred to as UT Health San Antonio) report that norepinephrine, a fundamental chemical for brain performance, is locally regulated in a brain region called the visual cortex. Before our study, research suggested the possibility of local regulation of norepinephrine release, but it had never been directly demonstrated,  said study senior author Martin Paukert, MD, assistant professor of cellular and integrative physiology at UT Health San Antonio. The Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. and Helen C. Kleberg Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) supported this work, which included Shawn R. Gray, PhD, and Liang Ye, MD, from the Paukert lab and collaborator Jing Yong Ye, PhD, from the biomedical engineering department at The University of Texas at San Antonio.Disease states in which norepinephrine is known to be altered include substance use disorders, Alzheimer s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In some substance use, Alzheimer s and ADHD, the release of norepinephrine is reduced, resulting in lower attention. In other substance use and PTSD, the level is too high.The team s findings also extend to cells called astrocytes that function as helper cells in the brain and central nervous system. When a person makes a movement, such as turning the head to listen to a parent, and that is combined with visual stimulation, then more norepinephrine is released where visual information is processed,  Dr. Paukert said.  Our second finding, also important, is that astrocytes can reliably detect the rate of norepinephrine release. They are sensitive to it, in other words. Astrocytes alter their response accordingly, which is expected to change brain performance. Understanding norepinephrine release, its local regulation and the astrocyte response may represent a mechanism by which one could enhance sensory-specific attention,  Dr. Paukert said. Research will continue in that direction.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials. Note: material may have been edited for length and content.

Fish show gregarious behaviour and cluster in shoals which helps them to acquire food and for protection against predators,  said project leader Professor Ivan Nagelkerken from the University of Adelaide s Environment Institute and Southern Seas Ecology Laboratories. Many gregarious tropical species are shifting poleward under current ocean warming and interacting in new ways with fish in more temperate areas. Under controlled laboratory conditions the researchers evaluated how species interacted and behaved in new ways with changing temperature and acidification.The rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is driving up ocean surface temperatures and causing ocean acidification. Although warming and acidification are different phenomena, they interact to the detriment of marine ecosystems. We found that tropical and temperate fish species tend to move to the right when coordinating together in a shoal especially when spooked by a predator, but this bias significantly diminished under ocean acidification,  said University of Adelaide PhD student Angus Mitchell who performed the experiments. Mixed shoals of tropical and temperate species became less cohesive under future climate conditions and showed slower escape responses from potential threats. Professor David Booth from the University of Technology, Sydney collaborated on the study. Our findings highlight the direct effect of climate stressors on fish behaviour and the interplay with the indirect effects of new species interactions,  he said.The team of researchers published their findings in the journal Global Change Biology. Strong shoal cohesion and coordinated movement affect the survival of a species: whether to acquire food or evade predators,  said Professor Nagelkerken. If the ability for fish to work together is detrimentally affected it could determine the survival of particular species in the oceans of the future. Tropical species may initially fare poorly when moving into new temperate areas. Reference: Mitchell A, Booth DJ, Nagelkerken I.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/one-algorithm-to-rule-decision-making-357012,One Algorithm To Rule Decision Making Researchers have employed virtual reality to decode the algorithm that animals use when deciding where to go among many options   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An international team led by researchers from the University of Konstanz and Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany have employed virtual reality to decode the algorithm that animals use when deciding where to go among many options. Published today in PNAS, the study reveals that animals cope with environmental complexity by reducing the world into a series of sequential two-choice (binary) decisions - a strategy that results in highly effective decision-making no matter how many options there are. The study offers the first evidence yet of a common algorithm that governs decision-making across species and suggests that fundamental geometric principles can explain how, and why, animals move the way they do. For most animals, life is about deciding where to go. Running, swimming, or flying through the world, animals are constantly making decisions while on the move-decisions that allow them to choose where to eat, where to hide, and with whom to associate. Breakthroughs in neurobiology over the past decades, including those awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Medicine, have pieced together a picture of how animals represent spatially-distributed options. Now, an international team of researchers have applied this neurobiological knowledge to understand how animals choose among options scattered in space. Animals  neural representations of options inevitably change as they move through space,  says Vivek Hari Sridhar, first author on the study and a post-doc at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (MPI-AB) in Konstanz.  We show that considering this in our understanding of spatial decision-making reveals new and fundamental geometric principles that were, until now, overlooked. Biologists, engineers, and physicists from Germany, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and E tv s Lor nd University in Hungary collaborated on the study. Drawing inspiration from neurobiology, physics and animal behavior, the interdisciplinary team constructed a computational model of decision-making in the brain. The model took features of how the brain represents options in  space  - in this case direction to potential destinations - in order to understand how decisions are made on the move. Taking into account the interplay between movement and the neural dynamics was key,  says Sridhar, who conducted his work as a PhD student in the Department of Collective Behaviour at the University of Konstanz and MPI-AB.  It allowed us to gain a new perspective about how the brain makes decisions. The resulting model predicted that the brain spontaneously breaks down decisions among multiple options to a series of two-choice decisions until only one option - the one ultimately selected -remains.  This was found to result in animals exhibiting a series of abrupt changes in direction, each associated with the exclusion of one of the remaining options. Each change of direction was a result of sudden changes in neural dynamics - a property scientists call a  bifurcation  - at very specific geometrical relationships between the animal and the remaining options.The algorithm was found to be so robust that the researchers predicted, not only would this  bifurcation  process result in highly accurate decisions, but also that it could be  universal . By overlaying many trajectories of their simulated animals, they found a branching structure that should, they expected, also be apparent if they overlaid many trajectories taken by real animals making spatial decisions.The team used immersive virtual reality to test their theoretical predictions in flying, walking, and swimming animals - the fruit fly, desert locust, and zebrafish, respectively. This technology allowed the scientists to place the animals in open, photorealistic environments while simultaneously having precise measurements of the animals  movements during decision-making.  All species were found to exhibit exactly the same bifurcations as had been predicted. It is often thought that animals first decide where to go and then they move to the target,  says Sridhar.  But our findings show that the interplay between movement and the changing neural representation of options considerably impacts how decisions are made. What is so exciting about these findings is that this response yields extremely effective decision-making in complex and diverse ecological contexts.  The scientists also found that the same geometric principles likely apply to spatial decision-making by animal collectives, such as mobile herds or flocks.Iain Couzin, senior author and co-Director of the Cluster of Excellence  Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour  at the University of Konstanz and Director at the MPI-AB says:  It is remarkable to see such a beautiful process underlying decision-making across vast scales of biological organization, from neural dynamics to individual decisions, and from individual decisions to collective movement. This is transforming our understanding of how animals make sense of their rich and complex world.Reference: Sridhar VH, Li L, Gorbonos D, et al.

The lesions can damage this white matter and lead to cognitive deficits. Now, researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology and colleagues not only provide an explanation for the location of these lesions but also how they develop in the first place.The work, led by Johannes Weickenmeier, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stevens, highlights the importance of viewing the brain as more than neural circuitry that underpins how thoughts are formed, and memories created. It s also a physical object that s prone to glitches and mechanical failures.  The brain is susceptible to wear and tear in vulnerable areas,  Weickenmeier said.  Especially in an aging brain, we need to look at its biomechanical properties to better understand how things can start to go wrong. These lesions   known as deep and periventricular white matter hyperintensities because they show up as bright white patches on MRI scans   are poorly understood. But they are not uncommon: most people have some by the time they reach their 60s, and changes only increase with age. The more lesions that accumulate and the faster they grow, the more prone we become to cognitive impairments ranging from memory problems to motor disorders. Using MRI scans from eight healthy subjects, Weickenmeier worked with Valery Visser, now a doctorate student at the University of Zurich, and Henry Rusinek, a radiologist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, to develop an individualized computer model of each subject s brain. The team mapped the strain placed on ventricular walls, the linings of fluid-filled chambers deep in the brain, as waves of pressure pulse through the subject s cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF. They found that hyperintensities tend to occur near areas that must stretch more to accommodate pressure changes of the circulating CSF because, as such areas wear thin, CSF can leak into the brain and cause lesions.  The cell wall that lines the ventricles wears out over time, like a balloon that s repeatedly blown up and deflated,  said Weickenmeier.  And the stresses aren t uniform   they re defined by the geometry of the ventricle, so we can predict where these failures will occur.  The model provides a simple, physics-based explanation for the locations of these lesions, revealing that mechanical loads  must be a major contributor to the onset of disease,  said Weickenmeier. The team s research, published recently in Scientific Reports, used 2D imaging showing a cross-section of the brain, but Weickenmeier s team has since expanded its research to a full 3D model of the brain. Next, Weickenmeier hopes to use advanced MRI technologies developed at Stevens to study the movement of the ventricle wall directly.In the long term, the team s findings might enable the development of new treatments for lesions. Ordinarily, pharmaceutical treatments struggle to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach affected areas, but the new research suggests that it might be possible to channel drugs to lesions directly through leaks in the ventricular wall.  That s still a long way off, and we didn t study it directly,  Weickenmeier cautioned.  But it s an intriguing possibility. The broader takeaway from the team s research, explained Weickenmeier, is that the brain s aging process is mediated by physical processes, including the pressure of circulating blood and CSF. That underscores the need for healthy behaviors   such as getting enough exercise and avoiding harmful substances   that can reduce those strains on the brain.Reference: Visser VL, Rusinek H, Weickenmeier J.

Understanding this scenario and how the brain processes stimuli like speech, language, and music has been the research focus of Edmund Lalor, Ph.D., associate professor of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Recently, his lab found a new clue into how the brain is able to unpack this information and intentionally hear one speaker, while weaning out or ignoring a different speaker. The brain is actually taking an extra step to understand the words coming from the speaker being listened to, and not taking that step with the other words swirling around the conversation.  Our findings suggest that the acoustics of both the attended story and the unattended or ignored story are processed similarly,  said Lalor.  But we found there was a clear distinction between what happened next in the brain. For this study, recently published in The Journal of Neuroscience, participants simultaneously listened to two stories, but were asked to focus their attention on only one. Using EEG brainwave recordings, the researchers found the story that participants were instructed to pay attention to was converted into linguistic units known as phonemes   these are units of sound that can distinguish one word from another   while the other story was not.  That conversion is the first step towards understanding the attended story,  Lalor said.  Sounds need to be recognized as corresponding to specific linguistic categories like phonemes and syllables, so that we can ultimately determine what words are being spoken   even if they sound different -- for example, spoken by people with different accents or different voice pitches.  Co-authors on this paper include Rochester graduate student Farhin Ahmed, and Emily Teoh of Trinity College, University of Dublin. The research was funded by the Science Foundation of Ireland, Irish Research Council Government of Ireland, Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience Pilot Program, and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Receiving this prize is a great honor in two ways. First, it is generally very nice to be recognized by one's peers for having produced valuable and impactful work. This community is made up of neuroscientists and engineers, so to be recognized by them is very gratifying,  Lalor said.  And, second, it is a great honor to be connected to Misha Mashowald - who was a pioneer in the field of neuromorphic engineering and who passed away far too young. This work is a continuation of a 2015 study lead by Lalor that was published in the journal Cerebral Cortex. That research was recently awarded the 2021 Misha Mahowald Prize for Neuromorphic Engineering for its impact on technology aimed at helping disabled humans improve sensory and motor interaction with the world, like developing better wearable devices, e.g. hearing aids. The research originated at the 2012 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Cognition Workshop and led to the multi-partner institution Cognitively Controlled Hearing Aid project funded by the European Union, which successfully demonstrated a real-time Auditory Attention Decoding system. John Foxe, Ph.D., director of the Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience was a co-author on this study that showed it was possible to use EEG brainwave signals to determine who a person was paying attention to in a multi-speaker environment. It was novel work in that it went beyond the standard approach of looking at effects on average brain signals.  Our research showed that   almost in real time   we could decode signals to accurately figure out who you were paying attention to,  said Lalor. Reference: Teoh ES, Ahmed F, Lalor EC.

Nevertheless, their working memory is limited by similar mechanisms.The working memory is the brain s ability to process information for a short period of time in a retrievable state. It is essential for performing complex cognitive tasks, such as thinking, planning, following instructions or solving problems. A team of researchers from Ruhr-Universit t Bochum (RUB) has now succeeded in investigating this special area of memory in birds in more detail and in comparing it to data storage in the mammalian brain. The scientists found that birds and monkeys   despite their different brain architecture   share the same central mechanisms and limits of working memory.The researchers from the Neural Basis of Learning department at RUB have published the results in the journal eLife on 3 December 2021. The capacity of working memory is limited. Humans can only take in about four items of information simultaneously   and it was precisely this limitation that made the Bochum researchers curious.  There are various theories about how limitation occurs in the brain and what role the network of neurons plays in this,  describes first author Lukas Hahn.  However, the existing models are based exclusively on studies in humans and other primates. We wanted to complement these with our expertise. Hahn, who works at the Faculty of Psychology in the department of Professor Jonas Rose, specialises in researching the neuronal basis of cognition in the avian brain.  The working memory of some birds, such as crows, has a capacity similar to that of humans, although their brain architecture is very different from that of mammals,  says Jonas Rose, head of the Neural Basis of Learning department at RUB.  We wanted to know: How can brains with such clear structural differences produce working memories with similar capacities?  To do this, the Bochum scientists observed crows at the Faculty of Psychology in Bochum. They tested the birds  working memory with an exercise originally developed for macaque monkeys.  We taught the crows to look at a screen and memorise a different number of coloured squares there,  explains Hahn.  After a pause with one second of black screen, we presented them the squares on the screen again, but slightly different. The birds were now tasked with figuring out which square had changed. While the crows performed the task, the scientists recorded neuron activity in an area of the brain corresponding to the prefrontal cortex   the central hub of cognition in mammals.  The studies showed that the neurons in the crows  brains responded to the changing colours in virtually the same way as the neurons in monkeys,  analyses Rose. Moreover, the scientists noticed that increasing the number of items the crows had to remember altered the amount of information individual neurons encoded to the same degree that had been previously observed in monkeys. Lukas Hahn:  The similarities between the distantly related bird and mammalian species confirm pre-existing core ideas about the limits of working memory. Moreover, they suggest that birds and apes share the same core mechanisms and limits of working memory despite their different brain architecture.  And Hahn already has ideas for a follow-up project in mind, namely investigating how different regions of the birds  brains process working memory signals with each other.  That would be an exciting future question to uncover more neural bases of cognition in the avian brain. Reference:Hahn LA, Balakhonov D, Fongaro E, Nieder A, Rose J.

Led by the University of Plymouth and published in the journal Science Advances, the study shows that credit assignment-related activity in the lateral prefrontal area of the brain, which supports adaptive behaviours, can be safely and quickly disrupted with TUS.After stimulating this brain area, the animals in the study became more exploratory in their decisions. As a consequence of the ultrasound neuromodulation, behaviour was no longer guided by choice value   meaning that they could not understand that some choices would cause better outcomes   and decision-making was less adaptive in the task.The study also showed that this process remained intact if another brain region (also part of the prefrontal cortex) was stimulated; showing for the first time how task-related brain modulation is specific to stimulation of areas that mediate a certain cognitive process.The work was co-led by the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at the University of Oxford, and co-authored by Radboud University, Netherlands; PSL Research University, Paris, France; P le Hospitalo-Universitaire, Paris, France; the University of Paris; and the University of Lyon, France.First author, Dr Elsa Fouragnan   UKRI Future Leader Fellow at the University of Plymouth   said:  The brain is like a mosaic   there are multiple parts doing different things. Each part may be linked to a certain behaviour. The challenge is first to know whether this behaviour is causally linked to a certain brain region. Only brain stimulation allows you to answer this question. The second challenge is that if you disrupt or modulate one part, then it can affect several others, so we need to understand how brain areas work together, and how they affect each other if one is stimulated or disrupted. The really interesting finding in this study is not only discovering where certain decision making activities take place, but also how neuromodulation can change these and associated behaviours. We hope that this can pave the way to new studies in humans, particularly in patients experiencing mental health issues. Reference: Folloni D, Fouragnan E, Wittmann MK, et al.

Without a video recording to settle the dispute, it s pretty hard to know who has the real memory and who has an adapted version.Perhaps it s no big deal to  misremember  like this in a social setting, but it s quite another in a courtroom or classroom. It turns out that human memory can be edited on the fly, creating memories that are nowhere near set in stone. A team of researchers has figured out how that happens and proved it by making people misremember. I think a lot of people have the misconception that memory works like a video camera: We record something and then we can play it back,  said Allie Sinclair, a PhD candidate in Duke s Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, who started the research as an undergraduate at the University of Toronto.Alas, it s not that simple or reliable.  When you recall a memory, your brain reconstructs that experience and sometimes, it edits the memory in the process,  Sinclair said.Memory editing is mostly a good thing, as it enables us to learn from our mistakes and integrate new information with old experiences. But the ability to edit leaves open the possibility of creating false memories as well.For this study, which was conducted with colleagues at the University of Toronto, two dozen study participants were shown 70 short, unique video clips.  People genuinely seem to like this task, it s like a movie-fest,  Sinclair said. The following day, they were slid into the MRI tube to watch the videos again, but this time, half of the video clips were interrupted suddenly and without warning at the critical moment of the narrative, such as when the baseball batter was swinging at the pitch. Surprise really engages your whole brain and activates some neuromodulatory systems, especially acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine,  Sinclair said.  When something surprising happens, you're going to have a release of these neurotransmitters, and you're going to remember that event really strongly. On the third day, participants were interviewed in great detail to try to recall as much of the videos as they could.  A couple of people were incredibly detailed and super accurate, but a couple of people had an insane number of false memories,  Sinclair said.  It was hard to keep a straight face. What the researchers saw in the MRI images is that surprise changed the role of the hippocampus, a brain region important for creating, retrieving, and editing memories. After unsurprising videos, the hippocampus seemed to be in  preserving mode,  strengthening memories. But after surprising videos, the hippocampus switched into  updating mode,  getting ready to edit memories. Surprise disrupted the stability of patterns in the hippocampus, showing this mode switch. More pattern disruption led to more false memories, and people were more likely to have false memories for the surprising videos that had been interrupted.The rewriting of memories wasn t entirely random however, Sinclair said. It seemed to happen between  semantically related  videos. For example, the baseball video might contaminate the memory of another sports-related clip. When there are videos that are related to each other, that's where these new pieces of information are coming from,  Sinclair said.  There were occasional examples where somebody was clearly taking an element from one specific video and sticking it into another video. The finding throws more doubt onto the way crime witnesses recall events and faces -- showing them photos of things they haven't witnessed is a bad idea -- but it also opens an opportunity to understand learning better, Sinclair said. Since surprise helps things stick, providing immediate feedback on wrong answers on a quiz would be helpful, as would the practice of asking students to try to predict an answer before providing them with the real one. If we try to lead them to make active predictions, and then we give them surprising feedback, I think they would be more likely to learn from that feedback and really make it stick in memory,  she said.Reference: Sinclair AH, Manalili GM, Brunec IK, Adcock RA, Barense MD.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/observing-cancer-cells-potential-to-metastasize-in-the-body-356998,Observing Cancer Cells  Potential To Metastasize in the Body Researchers have observed that cells that complete a phenotypic change  called epithelial to mesenchymal transition  can significantly increase the likelihood that a cancerous tumor will metastasize  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. When cancer cells metastasize, they morph, becoming missile-shaped in order to penetrate into other tissues throughout the body.In fact, to travel throughout the body, metastatic cancer cells must change their phenotypes their physical characteristics. This change allows stationary, epithelial cells which compose the barriers of our organs and our skin, to morph into mesenchymal cells, or the cells that develop into connective tissue, blood vessels and lymphatic tissue.Researchers have observed that cells that complete this transition, called epithelial to mesenchymal transition, or EMT, can significantly increase the likelihood that a cancerous tumor will metastasize.Currently, the way scientists screen and identify these cells is by observing them while fixed on microscope slides. But the standard studies looking at cells immobilized on microscope slides cannot reveal their shape shifting, no more than pinned butterfly collections can reveal their flight pattern, University of Michigan researchers write.Now, the U-M researchers have developed a method to evaluate the cells while they are free to metamorphose, using a method called cell magneto-rotation as well as machine learning. Their results are published in the journal PLOS One. If a cancer cell is located somewhere in the body, in order to move to a different part of the body, it has to become shaped like a missile to penetrate tissue so as to move into the bloodstream, then to penetrate back out of the blood vein to a new location. This metastatic potential has to do with cell mobility, but cell mobility also depends on cell shape and the dynamics of the cell s changing shape,  said Raoul Kopelman, lead author and the Richard Smalley Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry, Physics, Applied Physics, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Biology.To be able to observe these cell dynamics, the U-M researchers need the cell to be freely floating, rather than fixed on a glass slide. So they used their previously developed method cell magneto-rotation as the basis to study these cell dynamics.Using this method and two well-known breast cancer cell lines that have different metastatic potential, Kopelman and colleagues load cancer cells into what s called a microfluidic cell slide, composed of thousands of compartments. Each of the compartments holds only a single cancer cell.Onto this slide, the researchers add a solution of commercially available magnetic nanoparticles. These nanoparticles enter the cancer cells, but don t cause harm to them. Then, a magnet rotates around the tray of cancer cells, which slowly rotates the cancer cells. The slow rotation does not affect the shape of the cell, but it does allow the cancer cell to shape-shift.As the cells rotate, they are able to change their morphology similar to the way they would in the body. While they change form, the researchers take fluorescent images of the cells. Then, they combine two algorithms object recognition and machine learning to identify each of the cells by its shape.First, the researchers found that the cells that had undergone EMT were found to be shaped quite differently from the control population, demonstrating a strong relationship between a cell s morphological and biological behaviors. This new machine learning-based method appears to have the potential to map and classify the morphodynamic distribution of a cell population, and thus to provide information on the degree of morphological plasticity of a tumor cell s population, and such plasticity often correlates with lethality,  Kopelman said.To analyze cells that go through significant changes in shape, the researchers forced a human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, to go through the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Using cell magneto-rotation, the researchers were able to identify not only the cells that underwent the transition, but also the presence of even more subsets of the original cells.Finally, they wanted to identify highly mobile cells within the population of breast cancer cells. They compared the images of these highly mobile cells to cells in the breast cancer lines that failed to migrate (using a standard test) and were able to distinguish the population of mobile cells from the general population of the breast cancer cells. What we hope is that this particular method will eventually be widely available and will give the treating doctor information on the aggressivity of the specific cancer,  Kopelman said.  What we need are newer, better, additional tests to give caregivers additional information. I hope this microfluidic device will eventually be a standard option for screening cancer cells.

It s been estimated that heavy metals like cadmium, mercury, and lead are naturally present in small quantities in a third of arable land around the world. Recent fires and local pollution can increase the levels of these metals, but most soils are still considered safe for human exposure. However, certain crops can accumulate heavy metals from the soil and store them in their leaves and stems. Cannabis, in particular, is a highly efficient accumulator of heavy metals; the plant has even been used to cleanse land with Chernobyl-like levels of radiation. Now, an international team of researchers have warned that this natural ability of marijuana's to absorb heavy metals could be putting cannabis consumers at risk. Published in Toxin Reviews, their paper reviewed 25 pre-existing studies of cannabis and heavy metals. It concluded that, while cannabis shows potential as a tool for soil remediation, its tendency to soak up heavy metals  does pose a threat to the consumer base.   Cannabis consumed in combustive form represents the greatest danger to human health, as analysis of heavy metals in the smoke of cannabis revealed the presence of selenium, mercury, cadmium, lead, chromium, nickel and arsenic,  Louis Bengyella, an assistant research professor of plant science at Pennsylvania State University and lead author of the review, said in a statement.  It is disturbing to realize that the cannabis products being used by consumers, especially cancer patients, may be causing unnecessary harm to their bodies.  The known health risks associated with arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and chromium. Image credit: Penn State University.pH, in particular, can a be good indicator of the heavy metals present in soil, according to the researchers. Mercury is known to accumulate more in the leaves (at around 0.015 parts per million, ppm) and roots (at around 0.038 ppm) of cannabis plants when grow in acid soil more than in basic soil.The researchers also went further and listed seven advanced recommendations that take into account laboratory research. According to this list, farmers should also: With these practices in place, cannabis crops will be less likely to soak up heavy metals and pose a health risk to consumers, say the researchers. The problem is at the level of the consumer who uses cannabis products, but the solution must come at the agricultural level,  said Bengyella.  We believe that is where we should hammer hard and solve the problem.  The presence of heavy metals in cannabis products has been a growing concern in the legal sector in recent years. Certain products have been recalled by state regulators due to unacceptable levels of cadmium, and recent research has shown that metals like chromium, copper, and lead can, over time, leach out from the hardware of vaping devices into cannabis vape liquids, and thus into the aerosols they produce. Most US states with legal access to cannabis only require certified labs to test for four heavy metals: lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. Speaking to Analytical Cannabis earlier this year, the heavy metals expert and cannabis industry advisor Rob Thomas outlined the current landscape of heavy metals regulations in the US cannabis sector.  The vast majority [of US states] just regulate the big four [cadmium, arsenic, lead, mercury]. There are a couple of states which throw in additional elements, like my state of Maryland, which also regulates selenium, silver, barium, and chromium, while New York includes nickel, chromium, antimony, zinc, and copper. But there s no momentum to increase that list.   The only side of it which is gaining attention is regulating cannabis vaping devices, which is completely different because the vaping liquids are corroding internal metallic components, which has nothing to do with what elemental contaminants are actually in the cannabis product being vaped.  Come January 1, 2022, all cannabis labs operating in the state of Colorado will be required to test cannabis vapor for heavy metals  a first for US states with legal access to cannabis. Speaking to Analytical Cannabis earlier this year, Kyle Boyar, vice chair of the American Chemical Society s Cannabis Chemistry Subdivision [CANN],praised the initiative of Colorado cannabis regulators, but expressed concern that state labs were being asked to test cannabis vapor when no standard method for doing so exists.  It s a great idea and I think it s very important that we do this,  Boyar said.  I mean, people are using this [cannabis] as medicine   they re already immunocompromised, many of them   so we really should be doing this.   But, if you have no protocol established and you don t have validated methods, then you re really asking them to do something that s really not going to give you repeatable results. And that s what we re hoping to get towards, this consistency from lab to lab. ","Published: December 17, 2021"

CVD disproportionally affects the Black community, but this disparity could be addressed by increasing adherence to protocols for taking potentially life-saving medications.The fully virtual trial will initially enroll 42 participants and incorporate smart tech-enabled prescription bottles, which will collect data on the dose and timing of when cholesterol-lowering medication and statins are taken orally. The data will prompt text messages to remind or encourage users to adhere to their medication regimen. Cardiovascular disease is a major driver of death, particularly among people in the Black community. Understanding how to promote adherence to life-saving medications is one of the best ways we have to shrink that disparity,  said Mark Butler, PhD, an assistant investigator in the Institute of Health System Science and principal investigator on the new trial.  With the support of TD Bank and colleagues across the health system, we hope to determine the best intervention strategies to help people stick to their prescribed treatments and improve their cardiovascular health. ""To improve healthcare outcomes for all, we need to identify innovative solutions that address the inequities that currently exist,"" said Emmet Conlon, Head of Healthcare at TD Bank. ""We know cardiovascular disease impacts the Black community differently. We hope that through this investment we can help identify ways to address inequities and improve health outcomes for vulnerable populations.""The trial's primary goal is to increase medication adherence by at least 20 percent using text-message-delivered interventions to reduce CVD disparities. Additionally, the team will collect data on the ideal  intervention dose    the most beneficial frequency of text messages needed to meaningfully increase medication adherence. The trial s text message cues will use a multi-behavioral change technique (BCT) intervention, which incorporates feedback on behavior, monitoring, goal-setting, action planning and prompts to encourage positive health behavior. For example, a participant may receive the text message  Did you take your medication as prescribed today?  requiring a response of  Yes  or  No,  ideally prompting a positive behavior. This grant from TD Bank supports Northwell s Outpacing the Impossible campaign, a $1 billion comprehensive fundraising effort to fuel innovation to advance health care and support Northwell s promise to the people it serves. The campaign   which supports capital projects, improves hospitals and clinical programs, advances research and funds endowment for teaching and research initiatives   was publicly launched in October 2018 and to date has raised more than $890 million.""Through the TD Ready Commitment, the Bank's corporate citizenship platform, we make community investments that support the changes necessary to help create a more inclusive and sustainable future,"" said Shelley Sylva, Head of U.S. Corporate Citizenship at TD Bank. ""But we can't create that more sustainable, inclusive future without addressing the racial disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. That is why I am so thrilled to support this new, innovative research that will help identify ways to make sure that vulnerable communities aren't being left behind when it comes to getting the care they need."" Closing health disparity gaps will increase the equity and quality of healthcare for our communities,  said Kevin J. Tracey, MD, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes and the Karches Family Distinguished Chair in Medical Research.  This support from the TD Bank will enable Dr. Butler to shed new light on technologies to influence behavioral interventions for cardiovascular disease. The Institute of Health System Science, led by Karina Davidson, PhD, the Donald and Barbara Zucker Professor in Health Outcomes, is a multidisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians whose research efforts are centered on developing evidence-based interventions often using new technologies to improve health outcomes for individuals, organizations and communities.Most recently, the Institute of Health System Science announced the hiring of Felicia Hill-Briggs, PhD to help spearhead and expand disease prevention research. Dr. Hill-Briggs was named the Simons Distinguished Chair in Clinical Research in October.

This deterioration leads to a dysfunction in the activity of the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain that is involved in cognition.A study conducted at the Centre for Psychiatric Neuroscience of the Lausanne University (UNIL) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), and supported by the National Centre of Competences in Research Synapsy (Synapsy), has shown, in an animal model, that the cellular mechanism for recycling mitochondria is deficient in parvalbumin neurons.The study   published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry  investigated the underlying biochemical mechanisms, pinpointing two key molecules, miR-137 and COX6A2, that can be detected in blood. When used as biomarkers in patients diagnosed with psychosis, they allow to determine two distinct clinical sub-groups with different severity of symptoms, of cognitive deficits and functioning in everyday life. This discovery represents a major breakthrough for stratifying individuals suffering from schizophrenia, whose heterogeneity of symptoms currently restricts diagnosis and treatment.Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder whose clinical manifestations are extremely heterogeneous, which makes diagnosis difficult, and suggests that several neurobiological mechanisms are involved. Patient stratification, based on reliable biomarkers, would allow to better target available treatment options. To this end, Kim Do's group, researcher at UNIL/CHUV Centre for Psychiatric Neuroscience, in collaboration with Philippe Conus, director of the CHUV Service of General Psychiatry, carried out a translational study in patients and experimental model, focusing on the mitochondria of the parvalbumin neurons. Mitochondria are organelles responsible for producing the energy cells need to function normally. They use oxygen to do this, releasing highly toxic molecules called ""free radicals. These have to be eliminated to avoid irremediable damage by oxidation, i.e. oxidative stress. The antioxidant system takes on this task. The brain, an important producer of free radicals, is very sensitive to deregulations of the antioxidant system. ""We know that an essential antioxidant produced by the human body, called glutathione, is deficient in schizophrenic patients"", explains Kim Do. ""This deficiency and the resulting imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants (called redox dysregulation) lead, among other consequences, to an alteration of parvalbumin neurons, a type of neurons that is directly involved in all cognitive functions"".To conduct its studies, Professor Do s group works with an animal model of schizophrenia, in which the level of cerebral glutathione is lowered. ""This animal model is not designed to mimic a human disease in all its complexity, but to reproduce a typical abnormality and investigate its consequences."" Thanks to this animal model, it has been possible to observe that impaired mitochondria accumulate in parvalbumin neurons in the prefrontal cortex. ""Normally, they re eliminated or recycled, so that the ""cleaning system"" is no longer functional"" adds In s Khadimallah, a research fellow at Professor Do's laboratory and first author of the article published in Molecular Psychiatry.Mitochondria are generally able to eliminate their damaged parts by splitting, using a mechanism called mitophagy. This process involves a series of olecules whose production is controlled by miR137, a microRNA that plays a key role in their regulation. In s Khadimallah, in collaboration with her colleagues, succeeded in demonstrating that the level of miR-137 was very high in the model, as was oxidative stress. In parallel, an element of cellular respiration expressed specifically by parvalbumin neurons, the COX6A2 molecule is decreased. ""In other words, the mitochondria of parvalbumin neurons are dysfunctional following the increase in oxidative stress, and it can be shown through analyzing the levels of miR-137 and COX6A2 in the blood"". In their attempts to intervene directly on the free radicals produced by mitochondria, the neuroscientists showed, in the animal model, that the alterations of these two molecules, miR137 and COX6A2, can be completely corrected by an antioxidant compound that specifically targets mitochondria, called MitoQ. The research team was able to demonstrate that treatment with MitoQ also increases the survival and functionality of parvalbumin neurons in the prefrontal cortex. ""Given these promising results, the same compound will be tested in humans as an additional treatment in the early phase of the disease. It s an important step forward!"" says In s Khadimallah with a smile. By analysing the blood of patients diagnosed with psychosis, Do's group was able to determine the levels of miR137 and COX6A2 in the brain. Using these two molecules as biomarkers, they succeeded in demonstrating that among the great heterogeneity of schizophrenia patients there are two major and distinct groups, those with and those without mitochondrial impairments. In addition, the mitochondrial abnormalities are associated with cognitive impairments and the corresponding clinical symptoms: loss of autonomy and reduced social skills. ""Patients suffering from a mitochondrial deficiency have more severe clinical symptoms than others"", explains In s Khadimallah.  The study thus revealed two biomarkers that would make it possible to accurately select patients who are likely to benefit from a treatment targeting the deregulation of cerebral mitochondria. ""Our work paves the way for a precise diagnosis and an early, individualised treatment for people with a high clinical risk"", concludes Kim Do.Reference:  Khadimallah I, Jenni R, Cabungcal JH, et al.

This is only possible because of the enormous diversity of different cell types in the brain, each with a very specific function. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, together with an international team, investigated how this diversity arises. They established a method to analyze the developmental relationships of cell types in the mouse brain. Their results show that similarities in cell types are not a measure for the degree of relationship: Cells of similar cell types are often unrelated. Conversely, cells of very different types can share the same origin.Our body consists of hundreds of cell types, each with a very specific function. These cells can differ greatly in their properties   which can be clearly seen by comparing, for example, a blood cell to a skin cell. Nevertheless, each cell carries identical genetic information. The diversity is possible because cells do not use all of this information. Each cell type only activates the genes that it actually requires. This subset is then translated into RNA and proteins, resulting in a very specific cell type.The fate of most cells is determined during development. The process when unspecialized cells mature into specific cell types is called differentiation. Without differentiation, a fertilized egg cell could not give rise to an organism with different tissue types. Initially, the egg cell is capable of forming any cell type. In its descendant cells, this ability gradually decreases, so that towards the end of embryonic development, cells are usually only able to differentiate into one specific cell type. A particularly large variety of cell types is found in the brain, a majority of which are glial cells and neurons. These can be further divided into various specialized cell types: There are over 100 different types just for inhibitory neurons. They originate from neural progenitor cells that divide several times at the beginning of development. Later, their daughter cells give rise to the different cell types.An unresolved question is still how this enormous diversity of cell types arises from undifferentiated progenitor cells within just a few weeks in humans or days in mouse. An international team led by Christian Mayer investigated the mechanisms that give rise to cell diversity in the mouse brain. The researchers were particularly interested whether different cell types can originate from a single progenitor cell, and at what time point during development the fate of the neurons becomes determined. The scientists developed a new technique to label progenitor cells. To do so, they created millions of artificial DNA sequences, so-called barcodes. By inserting one of the barcodes in each cell, thousands of progenitor cells were uniquely marked   similar to the barcodes we know used to scan consumer goods. When a labeled cell divided, it passed the barcode onto its daughter cells, making it possible to identify which cells descended from each other. The researchers combined this method with single-cell RNA sequencing, which identifies all active genes in a cell. Based on this information, they were able to classify the barcode-marked cells into different cell types.By combining the two methods, the scientists showed that cell types and similarities between them cannot be used to make assumptions about developmental relationships: contrary to what is generally thought, cells of a similar cell type often cannot be traced back to a common origin in development. This means that unrelated progenitor cells can give rise to similar cell types (convergence). The scientists were also able to demonstrate the opposite scenario in inhibitory neurons: even different cell types in different brain structures can originate from the same progenitor cell (divergence). In this case, the progenitor cell seems to determine the neuron s fate   differentiation thus begins at the level of progenitor cells, and not later due to external signals. Accordingly, one progenitor cell can give rise to various neuronal cell types, and surprisingly until late in development   a time point when it was assumed that this potential no longer existed.The scientists expect that, based on these results, neurodevelopmental disorders will be better understood in the future. For example, examining the developmental relationships of cells could provide information about why certain groups of neurons are affected by genetic mutations that cause neurological and psychiatric illnesses. In addition, the novel method can be extended to any other tissue type, thus opening up an enormous spectrum of possible applications.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Studying how fat, or adipose, tissue functions in the body is critical for understanding obesity and other issues, yet structural differences in fat cells and their distribution throughout the body make doing so challenging. Fat cells are different from other cells in that they lack unique cell surface receptors and only account for a minority of the cells within fat tissue,  said Steven Romanelli, Ph.D., a former member in the laboratory of Ormand MacDougald, Ph.D., in the Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology.In a new paper published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Romanelli, MacDougald and their colleagues describe a breakthrough using CRISPR-Cas9, a tool that has transformed molecular biological research, but whose use in the study of adipose tissue had been elusive. The biggest challenge in terms of adipose research to date has been that if you want to study a gene s function, you have to commit a considerable amount of time, resources and money into developing a transgenic mouse,  said Romanelli. The traditional way of developing mouse models involves breeding mice with a desired mutation to delete or introduce certain genes of interest, which Romanelli says can take more than a year and tens of thousands of dollars.CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized this process. It s a gene editing technique comprised of an enzyme called Cas9 which can break strands of DNA and a piece of RNA that guides the Cas9 enzyme to a specific site in the genome for editing. This tool is packaged into a non-harmful virus for delivery to the cells being studied. The tool has been successfully used to study heart, liver, neurons, and skin cells to name a few, but never a certain type of adipose cells known as brown fat.Using the technique, the team was able to successfully target brown fat, a specialized adipose tissue used to generate heat and protect core body temperature. What we ve been able to do is take that whole process and distill it into anywhere from two weeks to a month to generate a transgenic mouse, reducing the cost to less than $2,000. Not only does it reduce time and cost, it democratizes the research so that any lab that is familiar with molecular biology techniques can adopt this method and do it themselves,  said Romanelli.They were also able to use this method to delete multiple genes simultaneously, a fact that could help researchers better understand important molecular pathways. Using their adeno-associated virus CRISPR-Cas9 components, they were able to knockout the UCP1 gene that defines brown adipose and enables it to generate heat, in adult mice. They observed that the knockout mice were able to adapt to the loss of the gene and maintain their body temperature in cold conditions, hinting at other pathways involved in temperature homeostasis.Romanelli says these early results are exploratory, but the technique represents an important step forward in studying fat.Reference: Romanelli SM, Lewis KT, Nishii A, et al.

A new study between Northwestern Medicine, Pennsylvania State University and other collaborating universities has found collegiate football athletes with a decade or more of experience with the sport have related abnormalities in inflammation, energy production and coordination that are apparent before the football season and across the season. The abnormalities are related to routine repetitive head impacts from tackling and blocking. Most head trauma studies tend to focus on injury being severe enough to cause a clinical concussion, as opposed to assessing the routine effect of repeated tackles or blows to the head over a season. These findings argue that impact sport athletes, regardless of history of concussion, have chronic problems. These problems were found in measures that show abnormal regulation of inflammation, less coordinated movement and abnormalities in how cells produce energy. These three measures are significantly related to each other before the football season and to changes observed across the football season. They were also related to the number of head impacts a player received over the season. These findings support over a decade of reports about the negative effects of repetitive head impacts along with studies of animal brain injury,  said co-senior author Dr. Hans Breiter, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  At this point, it appears the canary is dead in the coal mine.   This problem affects much of youth and professional impact sports in the U.S., along with training of U.S. military personnel,  said co-senior author Dr. Semyon Slobounov, professor of neurosurgery at Penn State College of Medicine. The study was published Dec. 15 in iScience.This study used measures previously found to be increased in football players before the season began and at a level similar to what is observed in individuals coming to emergency rooms with a concussion. These measures have been associated with inflammation regulation and were increased over the course of the football season. In this study, these regulatory measures of inflammation were linked with measures of energy production and coordination.The football players  coordination   measured as accuracy maintaining balance, speed at correcting balance and ability to remember movements   related to measures indicative of energy production issues and inflammation regulation. Football athletes are successful, in part, due to their abilities to recover from collisions, quickly change direction or foot placement and remember how to carry out various types of plays on the field. Before and across the season, the higher the regulatory measures of inflammation were, the lower the coordination measures were.The study also showed abnormalities in energy production, resulting in decreased energy. These abnormalities linked abnormal inflammation regulation with reduced coordination. They also showed relationships with measured head impacts.  A lack of energy can have significant consequences, especially in regard to brain function, raising questions of the long-term consequences  said co-lead author Sumra Bari, a postdoctoral fellow at the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern. She and colleagues suspect that damage to energy producing components of cells   mitochondria   are from the repetitive head impacts that these players sustain each season. In the brain, mitochondria number in the millions for each neuron (where neurons are the cells that some say resemble computers) and are fundamental for producing the energy needed for brain neurons to function. How the study workedTo perform this study, 23 athletes from a collegiate football team were enrolled who had been playing football for an average of 11 years. The athletes participated in a full season of competitive collegiate play. Nine of them had experienced one to two concussions in prior seasons. Blood was collected and coordination was tested both before and after the football season. The coordination tests were designed to assess balance and to test their ability to remember a virtual pathway   collectively referred to as  coordination.  In addition, head impacts were recorded at all practices across the season using sensors which were attached to the players  helmets. Future research should expand to a larger cohort of athletes to confirm the findings, scientists said.  Ultimately, the goal is to develop preventative interventions that minimize abnormal changes in the brain that have been observed in studies of contact sport athletes time and time again,  said lead author Nicole Vike, a postdoctoral fellow at the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern. Collectively, we need to use interdisciplinary approaches, like those used here, to better quantify the unseen damage of contact sports.  A good portion of research on head impacts and brain injuries to football athletes has utilized imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging to uncover changes in brain structure and function. But that is a costly diagnostic tool. It is critical to better understand how changes in simple blood measures can quantify brain abnormalities, the scientists said. In their research, they developed a statistical method to better understand relationships between blood measures, coordination and head impacts. This method can be extended for use in other interdisciplinary human and animal studies.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

By comparing the development of both sets of organoids, they discovered that a reduced expression of two genes in the cells stymies early development and causes a shortage of brain cells in organoids grown from patient stem cells. This discovery fills an important gap in scientists  understanding of schizophrenia,  said senior author Dr. Dilek Colak, assistant professor of neuroscience at the Feil Family Brain and Mind Institute and the Center for Neurogenetics at Weill Cornell Medicine. Symptoms of schizophrenia typically develop in adulthood, but postmortem studies of the brains of people with the disease found enlarged cavities called ventricles and differences in the cortical layers that likely occurred early in life. There were hints schizophrenia started during early development, but we didn t have proof,  Dr. Colak said.By growing organoids from stem cells collected from up to 21 human stem cell donors, the team, led by first author Dr. Michael Notaras, a former NHMRC CJ Martin Fellow in Dr. Colak s lab, was able to grow brain tissue with each patient s exact genetic make-up. Then, they used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in individual cells in patient s tissue and in tissue grown from people without schizophrenia.  We found a common pathology among all the patients with schizophrenia despite each of the patients having distinct disease presentations,  Dr. Colak said.Schizophrenia patient samples had reduced expression of two genes essential for brain development, a regulator of gene expression called BRN2 and a cell growth promoter called pleiotrophin. This led to reduced new brain cell production and increased brain cell death. Replacing the missing BRN2 in the cells restored brain cell production, while adding pleiotrophin reduced brain cell death. If more studies confirm these results, it could lead to the development of targeted therapies that help correct these genetic differences in specific brain cell types. We ve made a fundamental discovery providing what we think is the first evidence in human tissue that multiple cell-specific mechanisms exist and likely contribute to risk of schizophrenia,  said Dr. Notaras.  This forces us, as a field, to reconsider when disease truly begins and how we should think about developing the next generation of schizophrenia therapeutics.""Dr. Colak and her colleagues are currently using the mini-brains to start to tease out the role of individual cell types and to better understand how genetic factors may interact with the environment to cause schizophrenia. They are focusing on the role of endothelial cells, cells that typically line the blood vessels and release important immune molecules called cytokines. The mini-brain s grown from patients with schizophrenia had an excess of early endothelial-related cells, which could lead to an excessive immune response to infection. This may explain the link between maternal infections during pregnancy and schizophrenia seen in mouse studies,  Dr. Colak said.In addition to helping scientists better understand schizophrenia, Dr. Colak said she thinks that mini-brains grown from patient s stem cells may be a useful tool for studying other brain diseases. The technique could be used to study the early life pathology of late-onset neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer s disease or Huntington disease,  Dr. Colak said.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

The poet described one popular take on the world s end before shifting to its apocalyptic opposite, writing,  some say in ice.  But the relationship between fire and ice, in terms of Earth s climate, is not quite as  either or  as Frost depicted. In the case of a study presented today at the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting in New Orleans, that relationship is more  give and take.  The team of researchers behind the recent study describe a link between dwindling sea ice and worsening wildfires in the western United States. As sea ice melts from July to October, sunlight warms the increasingly iceless, surrounding area. This ultimately brings heat and fire-favorable conditions to distant states like California, Washington, and Oregon later in autumn and early winter.  The researchers describe this relationship its existence previously known, but its underlying mechanism now described for the first time as similarly influential as climate patterns like the El Ni o-Southern Oscillation.  It s not a perfect analogy, but teleconnections like this are a bit like the butterfly effect,  said Hailong Wang, an Earth scientist at the Department of Energy s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and coauthor of the new study. He references the popular feature of chaos theory where a butterfly s flapping wings are thought to influence the formation of a distant tornado.  Climate conditions in one part of the world can, over time, influence climate outcomes from thousands of kilometers away,  said Wang.  In our case, we find the Arctic region and the western United States are connected by this relationship. Regional land and sea surface warming caused by sea ice loss distantly triggers hotter and drier conditions in the West later in the year.  Wang will present his findings virtually at an AGU press conference that explores wildfire in a changing climate today, Thursday, Dec. 16, at 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.

Scientists have long recognized that a single reference genome cannot represent human diversity and that using it introduces a pervasive bias into these studies. Now, they finally have a practical alternative.In a paper published in Science, researchers at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute have introduced a new tool, called Giraffe, that can efficiently map new genome sequences to a  pangenome  representing many diverse human genome sequences. They show that this approach allows a more comprehensive characterization of genetic variations and can improve the genomic analyses used by a wide range of researchers and clinicians. We ve been working toward this for years, and now for the first time we have something practical that works fast and works better than the single reference genome,  said corresponding author Benedict Paten, associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and associate director of the Genomics Institute.  It s important for the future of biomedicine that genomics helps everyone equally, so we need tools that account for the diversity of human populations and are not biased. All humans have the same genes, but there are many variations in the exact sequences of the genes meaning the sequence of DNA subunits (abbreviated A, C, T, G) that spell out the genetic code as well as in the vast stretches of the genome outside of the protein-coding genes.

The laboratory results, published online ahead of print today in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), reveals that a breakthrough infection generates a robust immune response against the delta variant. Authors say the findings suggest the immune response is likely to be highly effective against other variants as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate. The study is the first to use live SARS-CoV-2 variants to measure cross-neutralization of blood serum from breakthrough cases.   You can t get a better immune response than this,  said senior author Fikadu Tafesse, Ph.D., assistant professor of molecular microbiology and immunology in the OHSU School of Medicine.  These vaccines are very effective against severe disease. Our study suggests that individuals who are vaccinated and then exposed to a breakthrough infection have super immunity.  The study found that antibodies measured in blood samples of breakthrough cases were both more abundant and much more effective   as much as 1,000% more effective   than antibodies generated two weeks following the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The study suggests each exposure following vaccination actually serves to strengthen immune response to subsequent exposures even to new variants of the virus.   I think this speaks to an eventual end game,  said co-author Marcel Curlin, M.D., associate professor of medicine (infectious diseases) in the OHSU School of Medicine who also serves as medical director of OHSU Occupational Health.  It doesn t mean we re at the end of the pandemic, but it points to where we re likely to land: Once you re vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, you re probably going to be reasonably well-protected from future variants.  Our study implies that the long-term outcome is going to be a tapering-off of the severity of the worldwide epidemic.  Vaccine immunity is currently undergoing a real-world test against the new omicron variant.  We have not examined the omicron variant specifically, but based on the results of this study we would anticipate that breakthrough infections from the omicron variant will generate a similarly strong immune response among vaccinated people,  Tafesse said. The study compared blood samples collected from a total of 52 people, all employees of OHSU who were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and subsequently enrolled in the study. A total of 26 people were identified through OHSU Occupational Health testing as having mild breakthrough infections following vaccination. Among the sequence-confirmed breakthrough cases, 10 involved the highly contagious delta variant, nine were non-delta and seven were unknown variants. Working in a Biosafety Level 3 lab, researchers then measured immune response to live virus exposed to blood sampled from people with breakthrough cases and compared it with the immune response to the control group. They found the breakthrough cases generated more antibodies at baseline, and they found that those antibodies were substantially better at neutralizing the live virus. With as many as one in five eligible Oregonians still vulnerable to infection   and vaccination rates even lower elsewhere in the country and around the world   the new study underscores the fact that vaccination remains the key to ending the pandemic.  The key is to get vaccinated,  Curlin said.  You ve got to have a foundation of protection. ReferenceBates TA, McBride SK, Winders B, et al.

So argue physician-scientists Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Jeffery K. Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., and David M. Morens, M.D., of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, in a new commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine.The authors call for an international collaborative effort to extensively sample coronaviruses from bats as well as wild and farmed animals to help understand the full  universe  of existing and emerging coronaviruses. Such studies could, they say, provide early warning about coronaviruses poised to cause outbreaks in humans. They write that carefully controlled human challenge trials, in which volunteers are exposed to coronaviruses, could yield a fuller understanding of coronavirus disease processes and inform vaccine design.  Despite the availability of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines, it remains unknown whether and how permanent immunity can be achieved, the NIAID authors note. They say SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will probably continue to circulate indefinitely in periodic outbreaks, and animal coronaviruses of unknown transmissibility and lethality may emerge at any time. Therefore, we must greatly accelerate our efforts in coronavirus vaccinology, they write. The authors outline the features of an ideal universal coronavirus vaccine that would provide durable protection from most or all coronaviruses for individuals of all ages and communities at large. To achieve this goal, fundamental questions about the nature of coronavirus protective immunity must be addressed, including what vaccine approaches best elicit rapid responses (antibodies, for example) and lasting immune  memory  responses that could defend against newly emergent coronaviruses.The still-raging COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the ever-present threat from new coronaviruses, necessitates the expeditious development of safe and broadly protective coronavirus vaccines. This is a challenge that we must now fully commit ourselves to addressing, the authors conclude.Reference: Morens DM, Taubenberger JK, Fauci AS. Universal coronavirus vaccines   an urgent need.

The study focused on proteins called reaction centers in a bacterium called Rhodobacter sphaeroides that help transport electrons in its cell membrane during the first steps of photosynthesis. Although these proteins, which reside in the cell membrane, have been studied for decades, many details of how they work remain unclear. To try to fill in some of those details, Stanford University's Jared Weaver, a graduate student in chemist Steven Boxer's laboratory, worked with fellow Stanford chemist Chi-Yun Lin and Washington University researchers Kaitlyn Fairies, Dewey Holten, and Chris Kirmaier, who have been studying R. sphaeroides reaction centers for over a decade. Their apporach was to replace part of the protein with amino acids   protein building blocks   that do not naturally appear in that part of the protein structure. The results could help researchers better understand how the electron-transporting protein works under normal operation.  As part of those investigations, Weaver teamed up with Irimpan Mathews, a staff scientist at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. There, the pair worked to crystallize the modified photosynthetic proteins and study them with X-ray macromolecular crystallography at one of SSRL's beamlines.   Unfortunately, nothing Weaver and Mathews tried seemed to work. They realized that the samples might be getting damaged when they cooled them down to the normal temperature used for X-ray crystallography studies   around 100 Kelvin or -280 degrees Fahrenheit. With that in mind, Mathews proposed turning to another SSRL scientist, Silvia Russi, who has been developing alternative methods at SSRL that enable studying samples at closer to room temperature, without any freezing at all. Russi's method works by optimizing the humidity in a sample to improve X-ray diffraction power   and hence data-gathering ability   at much warmer temperatures. In this case the team turned to the method simply to get data, but there is another benefit that many researchers find attractive: By operating at near room temperatures, researchers can get data on proteins in a more physiologically relevant context.  By combining room-temperature crystallography with spectroscopy and other techniques, Weaver said, the team was able to get a closer look at how bacterial reaction centers shuttled electrons around during the first steps of photosynthesis. Surprisingly, while seemingly drastic changes to the active site of those proteins affected how well they operated, the drop in efficiency wasn't nearly as big as expected. Taken together, Weaver said, the results yielded new insight into the mechanism of electron transfer early in the process of photosynthesis and showed that reaction centers are ""remarkably robust,"" Weaver said.ReferenceWeaver JB, Lin CY, Faries KM, et al.

This finding stems from the largest global analysis of its kind, conducted by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) as part of the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network. Particulate matter is one of the most dangerous air pollutants - a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid droplets which can be directly emitted from natural sources, such as forest fires, or when gases emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles react in the air. PM2.5 is airborne particulate matter smaller than 2.5  m in diameter. It is usually believed the black carbon part of PM2.5 (mainly stemming from motorised vehicles) was the most harmful one. However, the team s analysis of data in 210 cities across 16 countries from 1999-2017 found human health risks from air pollution vary depending on the proportion of different components in PM2.5. One of the most dangerous components is ammonium (NH4+), originating mostly from fertiliser use and livestock. The risk of excess mortality from PM2.5 roughly increased from 0.6% to 1% when the proportion of ammonium increased from 1% to 20% in the mix1. Cities with a larger concentration of ammonium in the mix, including Japanese cities Aikita, Aomori, Sendai, and Canadian cities London Ontario and Sarnia were associated with higher health risks. Specific action aimed at the agricultural and farming sectors may speed up the reduction of the negative health impacts of air pollution. Dr Pierre Masselot, Research Fellow at LSHTM and study lead, said:  We know black carbon found in fine particulate matter is a major public health issue. However, less is known about ammonium, which is created by chemical reaction of ammonia in the atmosphere and originates mainly from agricultural and farming practices. By using applied advanced statistical techniques to disentangle the relative effect of each component, we have revealed, surprisingly, that ammonium maybe more dangerous than other known PM2.5 components.  Particulate matter is a major environmental risk factor to which the Global Burden of Diseases attributed between 4.1 and 5 million deaths worldwide in 2017.Evidence on short-term associations between exposure to fine particulate matter and total and cause-specific mortality are well established,although the risk varies across locations. To help reveal why this variation occurs, the study explores the role of the main chemical components of PM2.5 in this heterogeneity. The team analysed the main components of PM2.5 including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, organic carbon, mineral dust and sea salt, and combined this with information on people s age, GDP, poverty rate, temperature and green space, including trees in streets and gardens. Highly advanced statistical methods were used to model specific health effects across multiple locations. The health risks associated to PM2.5 were found not to depend on the black carbon and organic carbon proportion and there was uncertainty about the role of sulfate. Health risks associated with PM2.5 were estimated to be lower in countries where nitrates were high in the concentration mix, such as UK, Germany and Scandinavia. Dr Antonio Gasparrini, Professor of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at LSHTM and senior author of the study, said:  The results from this study are important for future policies on air pollution. Identifying the most hazardous emission through state-of-the art modelling can help reveal which regions of the world to focus efforts on and how.  Some PM is naturally present in the atmosphere, whereas others come from anthropogenic activities. Our work highlights the importance of ammonium as a harmful pollutant and specific strategies, such as increasing support for the agricultural sector to reduce emissions, could be vital for public health. However, we must remember that all these chemicals are hazardous. Reducing levels of air pollution across all sectors will improve health.

However, a large new study from Chalmers and Uppsala University does not show a relationship between high intake of gluten and increased IBS symptoms. The researchers did find that a certain type of carbohydrate called  fodmaps  can aggravate intestinal problems, however, the overall results indicate that they also have less influence than previously thought. IBS is a very complex disease involving many factors, but our results indicate that the effects of specific diets are not as great as previously thought,  explains Elise Nordin, PhD student in Food Science at Chalmers and lead author of the scientific article, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) affects around three to five percent of the world's population, and involves symptoms such as stomach pain, diarrhoea and constipation. In the new study, which included 110 people with IBS, the researchers examined how people were affected by serving them rice puddings prepared in different ways. One variety was rich in gluten while the other contained large amounts of carbohydrate of the  fodmap  variety   that is, fermentable carbohydrates, including certain chains of fructose and lactose. Many foods are rich in fodmaps, including dairy products, types of bread and certain fruits and vegetables. In addition to the specially prepared rice puddings, the researchers also served a neutral one that served as a placebo.","Published: December 17, 2021"

The shark VNARs were able to neutralize WIV1-CoV, a coronavirus that is capable of infecting human cells but currently circulates only in bats, where SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, likely originated.Developing treatments for such animal-borne viruses ahead of time can prove useful if those viruses make the jump to people. The big issue is there are a number of coronaviruses that are poised for emergence in humans,  says Aaron LeBeau, a University of Wisconsin Madison professor of pathology who helped lead the study.  What we re doing is preparing an arsenal of shark VNAR therapeutics that could be used down the road for future SARS outbreaks. It s a kind of insurance against the future. LeBeau and his lab collaborated with researchers at the University of Minnesota and Elasmogen, a biomedical company in Scotland that is developing therapeutic VNARs. The team published its findings in Nature Communications.The anti-SARS-CoV-2 VNARs were isolated from Elasmogen s large synthetic VNAR libraries. One-tenth the size of human antibodies, the shark VNARs can bind to infectious proteins in unique ways that bolster their ability to halt infection. These small antibody-like proteins can get into nooks and crannies that human antibodies cannot access,  says LeBeau.  They can form these very unique geometries. This allows them to recognize structures in proteins that our human antibodies cannot. The researchers tested the shark VNARs against both infectious SARS-CoV-2 and a  pseudotype,  a version of the virus that can t replicate in cells. They identified three candidate VNARs from a pool of billions that effectively stopped the virus from infecting human cells. The three shark VNARs were also effective against SARS-CoV-1, which caused the first SARS outbreak in 2003.One VNAR, named 3B4, attached strongly to a groove on the viral spike protein near where the virus binds to human cells and appears to block this attachment process. This groove is very similar among genetically diverse coronaviruses, which even allows 3B4 to effectively neutralize the MERS virus, a distant cousin of the SARS viruses.The ability to bind such conserved regions across diverse coronaviruses makes 3B4 an attractive candidate to fight viruses that have yet to infect people. The 3B4 binding site is also not changed in prominent variations of SARS-CoV-2, such as the delta variant. This research was conducted before the omicron variant was discovered, but initial models suggest the VNAR would remain effective against this new version, LeBeau says.   What we re doing is preparing an arsenal of shark VNAR therapeutics that could be used down the road for future SARS outbreaks. It s a kind of insurance against the future.  Aaron LeBeau The second-most-powerful shark VNAR, 2C02, seems to lock the spike protein into an inactive form. However, this VNAR s binding site is altered in some SARS-CoV-2 variants, which likely decreases its potency. What is exciting is that these new potential drug molecules against SARS-CoV-2 differ in their mechanism of action compared to other biologics and antibodies targeting this virus,  says Caroline Barelle, CEO of Elasmogen.  It is another great example of how Elasmogen can effectively deliver potent therapeutic molecules. Future therapies would likely include a cocktail of multiple shark VNARs to maximize their effectiveness against diverse and mutating viruses. This new class of drug is cheaper and easier to manufacture than human antibodies, and can be delivered into the body through various routes, but has yet to be tested in humans. LeBeau is also studying the ability of shark VNARs to help in the treatment and diagnosis of cancers.Vaccines form the bedrock of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and future coronaviruses. But some people, such as those with compromised immune systems, do not respond as well to vaccination and may benefit from other treatments like antibodies   which makes developing these treatments an ongoing priority.Reference: Ubah OC, Lake EW, Gunaratne GS, et al.

Although most people want to see climate change slowed down, many do not behave in an appropriately sustainable way. Researchers at the University of Bern have now used brain stimulation to demonstrate that the ability to mentalise with the future victims of climate change encourages sustainable behaviour. Global climate change may be the biggest challenge faced by humanity today. Despite decades of warnings and political resolutions, however, sustainability remains a long way from being achieved.  The fact that people aren t acting in a more climate friendly way isn t because we know too little about this critical situation, though.  explains Daria Knoch, Professor for Social Neuroscience at the University of Bern. To find out more about the reasons that prevent us from acting sustainably, Daria Knoch and her team have conducted a neuroscientific study. The findings have just been published in the renowned international journal Cortex.While some effects of global warming are already visible today, those affected more strongly will be people in the future who we do not know.  It is precisely our inability to mentalise with these strangers that discourages climate-friendly action,  says Daria Knoch, commenting on the findings of the new study that she carried out with her research group in the  Social Neuro Lab  at the University of Bern. During the study, participants received stimulation to a part of their brain which plays an important role for taking the perspective of others. This stimulation led to more sustainable behaviour.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/what-happens-when-you-cant-gesture-when-speaking-356942,What Happens When You Can t Gesture When Speaking   A team of Spanish and Italian researchers discover what happens when we do not use our hands to explain something ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. We all tend to gesture when we speak. We make hand gestures whether we are explaining something to someone at home or on the phone, without anyone seeing us. We do so consciously for some pre-defined purpose, and even unconsciously.Theoretical models for the production of speech and gestures have proposed that gestures help to plan and conceptualize what we mean, regardless of whether the listener can see us or not. But the exact relationship between speech and gesture is not yet fully known. Since gestures are so ubiquitous when we speak, what if speakers are prevented from making gestures when they speak? Does the inability to gesture affect speech in any way? Does speech become less fluent or less emphatic?These are some of the questions that researchers at the Department of Linguistic and Literary Studies (DiSLL) of the University of Padua in Italy, together with the Prosody Study Group (GrEP) at the UPF Department of Translation and Language Sciences, led by ICREA professor Pilar Prieto have recently attempted to answer by publishing the results of the study in the journal Speech Communication. In our research, we were interested in studying the gesturing that accompanies speech, particularly the gestures that people make with their hands when speaking , comments Alice Cravotta, principal investigator of the study who did part of her doctoral thesis during an Erasmus stay at the UPF laboratory.  We wanted to understand the importance of these gestures for communication and saw that they needed investigating with very important variables for the study of prosody (the branch of linguistics that analyses elements of oral expression such as pitch, tone and intonation) .The general belief is that gestures help us to be clearer. Cravotta gives us an example:  Imagine you have your hands tied behind your back and you have to give instructions on how to get to a place. We think it s a little harder than explaining it with your hands free. To find out, we hypothesize that restraining people from making gestures would affect their ability to speak, to remember or retrieve the right words at the right time, to plan what they want to say, and to put the right emphasis on what they are saying .The researchers recruited 20 female volunteers between the ages of 20 and 30.  The reason for studying this only with women was to standardize voice study acoustic variables, but clearly the same study can be conducted with a mixed group , Cravotta explains.The researcher showed a comic strip to the participants and then asked them to describe it to another person. Under the control condition they were simply asked to explain the comic strips without any specific instructions on gestures and under the experimental condition they were asked to put their hands under their legs as they described it, so that they could not make hand gestures. They video-recorded all the interviews and analysed their discourse in audio, studying variables such as the number of words, the speed of speech (syllables per second), the length of each narrative (in seconds), the pauses, self-corrections, repetitions, insertions, or interruptions, and finally the tone and intensity of the voice.  We found that restraining gestures did not affect the fluency or acoustic characteristics of speech or the production of speech, which other studies have also found , Cravotta  explains.  This is surprising since some studies have shown that when the production of gestures is encouraged, however, it helps people in lots of ways such as learning, solving problems (mathematical), improving memory, and so on .However, when analysing the data eliminating the group of participants that least gesticulated under the control condition, the researchers found that under the experimental condition where gesture production was prevented, participants produced speech with different prosodic features from natural speech with gestures.  We saw that it can have different effects depending on the extent to which these people resort to gestures when they speak. If people gesture less under normal conditions, they need fewer gestures to communicate properly , she adds.The next step is to study in greater depth the individual differences in the ways people use gestures.  There is no doubt that there are cultural differences in the use of gestures, some people gesticulate more than others and even many vary depending on the attitude of the speaker and the context. Many studies agree on the key importance of gestures in general and how strong the connection is between speech and gestures both cognitively and linguistically. Studying the extent to which this applies to individuals with different dispositions and cognitive characteristics serves to better understand the underlying mechanisms and causes of this complex interaction .Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Fish swimming upriver, crabs scuttling sideways, and even humans hanging a left while looking to the right contend with similar challenges. How the brain calculates an animal s direction of travel when the head is pointing one way and the body is moving in another is a mystery in neuroscience.   A new study makes significant headway on solving this mystery by reporting that the fly brain has a set of neurons that signal the direction in which the body is traveling, regardless of the direction in which the head is pointing. The findings, published in Nature, also describe in detail how the fly s brain calculates this signal from more basic sensory inputs.   Not only do these neurons signal the fly s direction of travel, but they do also so in a world-centered reference frame,  says Rockefeller neuroscientist Gaby Maimon. What s remarkable, adds first author Cheng Lyu, a graduate student in the Maimon lab, is that these insects are transforming body-referenced sensory inputs into a world-referenced signal, allowing the fly to know that it is traveling, for instance, 90 degrees to the right of the sun or northward.This article has been republished from the following materials.

So claims a University of California, Riverside, study performed on fruit flies.The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, offers a better understanding of neurophysiological plasticity of the taste system in flies.To maintain ideal health, animals require a balanced diet with optimum amounts of different nutrients. Macronutrients like carbohydrates and proteins are essential; indeed, an unbalanced intake of these nutrients can be detrimental to health. Flies require macronutrients such as sugars and amino acids for survival. They use the gustatory system, the sensory system responsible for the perception of taste, to sense these nutrients and begin feeding.In their experiments in the lab, the researchers Anindya Ganguly and Manali Dey, led by Anupama Dahanukar, fed adult flies different diets: a balanced diet, a sugar-reduced and protein-enriched diet, and a sugar-enriched and protein-depleted diet. They ensured that all three diets were similar in total calorie content and tested the flies daily for a week to examine modifications in their food choice and taste sensitivity. The researchers report that diet affects dopamine and insulin signaling in the brain, which, in turn, affects the flies  peripheral sensory response, which is comprised of neurons directly involved in detecting external stimuli. This response then influences what the flies eat next. We found diet changed the flies  taste preference,  said Dahanukar, an associate professor of molecular, cell and systems biology.  For a diet with excess protein at the expense of carbohydrates, the flies  taste sensitivity changed so that they mounted a compensatory behavioral response in the short term to eat more carbohydrates and less protein in order to regain a balanced diet. What this may mean for other animals, including humans, is that conserved signaling pathways could play a role in mounting similar diet-induced changes in taste. Individuals on a high sugar diet could see a dampening of sugar taste, making sugars less palatable at least for the short term. Similarly, a low protein diet would enhance umami taste, increasing the value of protein-rich foods to be consumed next. Changes in gene expression appear to be involved,  said Ganguly, a former graduate student at UC Riverside and now a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara.  We see these changes in flies based on dietary exposure for just a day or two. Interestingly, when the flies that were fed unbalanced diets were returned to a balanced diet, their taste sensitivity returned to baseline levels, suggesting that changes in taste preference are reversible.  Our work shows that imbalances in diet affect your taste preferences in a way that help you in the short term at least,  said Dey, a graduate student in Dahanukar s lab.  They help you change your taste so that you prefer foods that benefit you, foods that would help you achieve metabolic homeostasis again. Dahanukar cautioned, however, that long term effects on consumption may be more complex. For example, research by other scientists has shown that while flies raised on a high sugar diet saw their sugar response decrease in the short term, flies maintained on that diet consumed more of that food in the long term.Dahanukar, Ganguly, and Dey were joined in the study by Christi Scott and Vi-Khoi Duong. Scott is a former graduate student and postdoctoral researcher at UCR. She helped analyze transcriptome data. Duong is a former undergraduate student who did his honors thesis in Dahanukar s lab.

A research team at Heidelberg University and the Sorbonne University in Paris (France) made the discovery in mice treated with cocaine. The researchers led by Prof. Dr Hilmar Bading (Heidelberg) and Prof. Dr Peter Vanhoutte (Paris) demonstrated that the protein Npas4 regulates the structure and function of nerve cells that control addiction behaviour in mice. If the quantity of Npas4 was reduced in an experiment, the animals  response to cocaine was much weaker. In the animal model, Npas4 acts as a molecular regulator for the sensitivity to drugs of abuse. We hope that the results of our research lead to a better understanding of addiction in humans and will contribute to new therapeutic approaches,  states lead author Thomas Lissek. The physician and scientist is pursuing doctoral research on molecular signalling mechanisms linking neuronal activity to gene transcription at the Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences (IZN) at Heidelberg University. According to the researcher, the current findings also underpin the existence of a biological basis for addiction behaviour, much like for diabetes or cardiovascular disease.The protein Npas4 acts as a so-called transcription factor.  We can view Npas4 as a conductor who coordinates which and how many other molecules are produced in a cell,  explains Thomas Lissek. The target molecules of Npas4 primarily regulate the electrical activity patterns and the structure of nerve cells and influence the number of contact points between them. When the researchers reduced the amount of Npas4, the contacts between the nerve cells diminished. The mice subsequently exhibited a weaker response to cocaine than with a higher amount of Npas4.The current findings from the Heidelberg and Paris scientists also demonstrate that Npas4 is governed by a special regulation mechanism. The protein can be induced only by stimuli that cause the calcium concentration in the nucleus of nerve cells to increase. For instance, the activation of dopamine receptors   a much-discussed mechanism in the development of addiction   does not contribute to increasing the amount of Npas4. The teams of Hilmar Bading and Peter Vanhoutte were also able to confirm this characteristic in human stem cell-derived neurons.The unusual regulation mechanism of Npas4 is interesting for both basic biological research as well as the development of therapies to treat addiction.  Npas4 and its associated signalling pathway in the control of addiction behaviour are promising therapeutic approaches,  explains Prof. Bading, Director of the Department of Neurobiology at the IZN.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

For example, you might be listening to someone talk in a meeting or class and your mind wanders to your dinner plans. Notably, research suggests that 30% to 50% of our daily thoughts are spent on this kind of mind wandering, and that excessive mind wandering can lead to many negative outcomes like poorer performance on standardized tests and poorer recall of information. While zoning out for a few minutes during a meeting may not hurt, it can impact you negatively if it goes on for long periods of time,  says Lynley Turkelson, a University of Cincinnati doctoral student and lead author of a new study on mindfulness and mind wandering published in the Journal of Cognitive Enhancement. When distracting thoughts or feelings come up, mindfulness helps us gently set them aside and refocus on what is right in front of us,  says Turkelson.Methods of practicing mindfulness vary but include practices such as breathwork and meditation.For example, Turkelson says, one can practice mindfulness by paying attention to the experience of eating a favorite food:  You may start by noticing the smell of the food before you eat it, what it feels like as you bite into it, how it feels in your mouth, and the taste. Or perhaps you pay attention to the flow of breath in and out of your lungs or on the sensations you experience in various parts of the body.  For the study, Turkelson, a doctoral student and fellow in UC s Department of Psychology, and co-author Quintino Mano, PhD, a UC associate professor of psychology, conducted a systematic review of research that looks at the relationship between mindfulness and mind wandering.  What they found is that while mindfulness   the ability to intentionally focus attention on the present moment   can be effective for reducing mind wandering, results do differ depending on the research methodology. For instance, people are sometimes unaware when they are distracted, so asking them to report their own mind wandering is not reliable. The study results show it's better to measure mind wandering in other ways, such as using computer-based testing.   During COVID, people are facing even more distractions than normal, so it is important to find research-based ways to decrease mind wandering and improve attention,  says Turkelson.Turkelson says that their systematic review looks at the research on this topic and synthesizes the results so that researchers know how consistent these findings are, as well as what still needs to be studied to improve our understanding of how mindfulness helps with mind wandering.

However, the health effects of these compounds, and how readily they migrate into the environment, are largely unknown. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology Letters have detected a broad range of emerging synthetic antioxidants, called hindered phenol and sulfur antioxidants, in dust from electronic waste (e-waste) recycling workshops, possibly posing risks for the workers inside. Previous studies revealed widespread environmental pollution and human exposure to a class of compounds called low-molecular weight synthetic phenolic antioxidants. In lab experiments, some of these compounds were toxic to rodents or human cells. Recently, manufacturers introduced a class of high-molecular weight synthetic phenolic antioxidants, also known as hindered phenol antioxidants (HPAs), with improved performance and slower migration from products. In addition to HPAs, compounds called sulfur antioxidants (SAs) are often added to rubber and plastic polymers as  helper  antioxidants. The toxicological effects and environmental occurrence of most of these new compounds are unknown. Therefore, Lixi Zeng and colleagues wanted to investigate the occurrence of emerging HPAs and SAs in dust from e-waste recycling centers   workshops where large amounts of discarded electronics, such as laptop computers, cell phones, tablets, wires and cables are dismantled and processed.In August 2020, the researchers collected 45 dust samples from three categories of e-waste recycling workshops in an industrial park in Yichun City, China: wire and cable dismantling, electronic plastic processing, and general e-waste dismantling. Then, they used liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to screen for 18 emerging HPAs and 6 emerging SAs. All 24 compounds were detected in the dust: 22 for the first time, and some at relatively high levels compared with other e-waste pollutants. Although dust concentrations of SAs were similar for the different categories of workshops, centers that dismantled wires and cables and processed electronic plastics had significantly higher levels of dust HPAs than those that dismantled general e-wastes. Given the ubiquitous occurrence of emerging HPAs and SAs in e-waste dust, further research is needed on their environmental behaviors, fates, toxicities and risks, the researchers say.ReferenceZhu C, Pan Z, Du B, et al.

The breakthrough, co-funded by the charity Brain Tumour Research, is significant because, if further research is conclusive, the anti-retroviral drugs could be prescribed for patients diagnosed with meningioma and acoustic neuroma brain tumours (also known as schwannoma).More effective approaches are urgently needed as there are very few treatment options for these tumour types which frequently return following surgery and radiotherapy. Meningioma is the most common form of primary brain tumour. Mostly low-grade, it can become cancerous over time, and develops from cells located in the meninges which protect the brain and spinal cord. Acoustic neuroma is a different type of low-grade, or non-cancerous brain tumour, which develops in nerve-protecting cells called Schwann cells. Both tumours may occur spontaneously, usually in adulthood, or in the hereditary disease Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) in childhood/early adolescence.Researchers at the Brain Tumour Research Centre at the University of Plymouth have shown previously that a tumour suppressor, named Merlin, contributes to the development of meningioma, acoustic neuroma and ependymoma tumours. It can also contribute to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Tumour suppressor genes play important roles in normal cells by controlling division or repairing errors in DNA. However, when tumour suppressors do not work properly or are absent, cells can grow out of control, leading to cancer. In this latest study Dr Sylwia Ammoun, Senior Research Fellow, and her collaborator, Dr Robert Belshaw investigated the role that specific sections of our DNA play in tumour development. Named  endogenous retrovirus HERV-K , these sections of DNA are relics of ancient infections that affected our primate ancestors, which have become stable elements of human DNA.Hugh Adams, spokesperson for Brain Tumour Research, said:  Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer yet historically just 1% of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease.Brain Tumour Research funds sustainable research at dedicated centres in the UK. It also campaigns for the Government and the larger cancer charities to invest more in research into brain tumours in order to speed up new treatments for patients and, ultimately, to find a cure. The charity is calling for a national annual spend of  35 million in order to improve survival rates and patient outcomes in line with other cancers such as breast cancer and leukaemia and is also campaigning for greater repurposing of drugs.Reference: Maze EA, Agit B, Reeves S, et al.

We conducted a previous study that showed the high effectiveness of the 2-dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, but as the delta variant became predominant in early summer of 2021, questions arose about effectiveness against variants,  said the lead author of the study, Katia Bruxvoort, PhD, an adjunct investigator with the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation. This study confirmed effectiveness against all variants during the study period, although we did find a drop in effectiveness over time against delta infection, from 94% effectiveness in the first 2 months after vaccination to 80% effectiveness after 6 months. Protection against hospitalization due to the delta variant remained high at 98% effectiveness. At Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, molecular diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is free for members who request it regardless of whether they have COVID-19 symptoms. Testing also is done prior to hospital admission and many medical procedures. Beginning in March 2021, Kaiser Permanente in Southern California began sending positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic people to a contracted laboratory for whole genome sequencing.This study, funded by Moderna, included 8,153 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with specimens collected from March 1 to July 27, 2021. Among them, 91.3% were unvaccinated, 1.4% had received 1 dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and 7.3% had received 2 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Variants were identified for 5,186 of those samples; 39.4% were delta, 27.7% alpha, 11.4% epsilon, 6.9% gamma, 2.2% iota, 1.4% mu, and 11.1% other variants. At the time of this study, the omicron variant had not yet been detected in the Southern California region.The researchers compared people who tested positive with those who tested negative. Researchers found:   While this study provides reassuring evidence of the effectiveness of 2 doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 infection and hospitalization due to variants including delta, it also has implications for booster shots,  said the study s senior author, Hung Fu Tseng, PhD, a researcher with the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation.

These classic spirits have a long history, and surprisingly, many decisions about their processing are still subjectively determined. Now, researchers in ACS Food Science & Technology report that measuring the liquor s conductivity could give a more objective assessment, and they also found a way to make the process more energy-efficient.For hundreds of years, apples have been a good base for liquors, such as Calvados in France and applejack in the U.S., because they re full of sugar and desirable flavors. As the mashed fruit ferments, alcohol evolves along with additional flavor compounds, which add to the complex taste of the final liquor. Distilling the fermented apples with heat concentrates the alcohol and removes unpleasant fermentation byproducts, such as carboxylic acids that can impart unclean, rancid, cheesy and sweaty flavors. Most producers use batch columns to make apple spirits because it provides a clean-tasting, high-alcohol distillate in a large volume. But the exact time to stop the distillation process   and achieve the most flavorful liquor   has been uncertain. Previously, Andreas Liebminger and colleagues showed that a rapid increase in apricot brandy distillate s conductivity reliably indicates the ideal time to stop the distillation. So, the researchers wanted to see if this would also hold for apple liquors.The researchers crushed and fermented apples into a mash, which they distilled in a German-style batch column still. As the mash was heated, they continuously monitored the conductivity of the distillates and measured the levels of nine carboxylic acids. They found that as the conductivity rose, so did the levels of the bad-tasting carboxylic acids. In additional tests to find a more energy-efficient distillation strategy, they noted that heating up the mash too quickly produced a distillate with lower conductivity and fewer of the unwanted flavor compounds, but it smelled bland. In contrast, raising the temperature of the still s cooling tower produced a liquor with a good aroma intensity, while also reducing the carboxylic acid levels. By keeping the cooling tower a few degrees warmer, the researchers didn t expend as much energy overall compared to the conventional approach. The researchers say that monitoring the conductivity in the distillates afforded them a simple way to identify the best conditions for producing apple spirits with the most desirable quality and taste.Reference: Liebminger A, Philipp C, Sari S, Holstein M, Dietrich V, Goessinger M.

The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine(link is external and opens in a new window) with John F. Tisdale, MD, senior investigator at the NIH s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, as corresponding author.The single-dose therapy, tested on 35 adults and adolescents with sickle cell disease, essentially corrected the shape of the patient s red blood cells, but also completely eliminated episodes of severe pain, caused when rigid, crescent-shaped red blood cells clump together and block blood vessels. The painful episodes often result in widespread organ damage. Such episodes are a frequent cause of emergency department visits and hospitalizations and lead to early death. You cannot overstate the potential impact of this new therapy,  says Markus Y. Mapara, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and a co-author of the study.  People with sickle cell disease live in constant fear of the next pain crisis. This treatment could give people with this disease their life back. We hope this therapy will also be successful in younger patients so they can grow up without experiencing pain crises and live longer. Sickle cell disease is caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. Normal red blood cells are shaped like donuts, but in sickle cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to stiffen and adopt a spiky, sickle-like shape. The disease is estimated to affect 100,000 people in the United States and is more common among Black Americans. Sickle cell disease can be cured with a donor bone marrow transplant but use of this therapy has the best chance of success in patients who have a closely matched sibling donor, which is only a minority of patients.With the new gene therapy, called LentiGlobin, blood-forming stem cells are collected from the patient s blood. Harmless lentiviruses are then used to deliver a modified copy of the beta-globin gene into the stem cells. When the cells are later reinfused into the patient, they take up residence in the bone marrow and start making healthy new red blood cells.In the clinical trial the therapy completely eliminated severe pain crises in the months following infusion (follow-up ranged from 4 to 38 months) the longest period in which a gene therapy for sickle cell disease has been studied. The effects have been sustained throughout the trial period, which suggests that the results may be durable,  says Mapara, who is director of the Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian.Because LentiGlobin uses a patient s own stem cells, there s no risk of rejection, a common complication of conventional bone marrow transplants, Mapara adds.One limitation of the gene therapy is that patients must first be treated with high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate old stem cells and make room for the modified stem cells, a process known as conditioning. Chemotherapy can be toxic and is associated with a small risk of cancer. Two patients in the trial developed leukemia, which the researchers suspect was related to the chemotherapy, not to LentiGlobin treatment.Researchers are currently working on less toxic approaches to conditioning the bone marrow before gene therapy.  The eventual goal will be to give this treatment as early as possible, well before patients develop organ damage and other complications of sickle cell disease,  says Mapara.  But before we can do this, we need to find a safer alternative to chemotherapy for conditioning strategies, such as antibodies. Columbia University Irving Medical Center is one of the few centers in the world participating in gene therapy clinical trials for sickle cell disease. In addition, investigators at Columbia are hoping to identify strategies to make gene therapies for sickle cell disease financially attainable.Reference: Kanter J, Walters MC, Krishnamurti L, et al.

During the study, conducted over 15 years, scientists intentionally added a traceable form of mercury to a lake and its watershed.  They discovered that the new mercury they added quickly built up in fish populations, and then declined almost as quickly once they stopped additions. Notably, the fish populations were able to recover from mercury much quicker than previously understood, which suggests that curbing mercury pollution through policy initiatives now will have a rapid and tangible benefit regarding the quality of fish we consume. The findings provide indisputable, science-based support for necessary regulations on mercury emissions that have been undermined in recent years, especially in the USA. They also support the efficacy of existing and new policies around that globe that seek to curb how much mercury ends up in our environment.  Showing that reducing mercury inputs to a lake will lower mercury concentrations in fish sounds simple,  said Dr. Paul Blanchfield of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Queens University and a lead investigator of the Mercury Experiment to Assess Atmospheric Loading in Canada and the United States (METAALICUS).   But it required a dedicated team effort, including academic, government and NGO researchers from across North America, during the 15-year whole-ecosystem study to arrive at this conclusion.  The team applied about one teaspoon of a special form of mercury to a lake and its watershed, at a cost of over one million CAD. They were able to measure this mercury as methylmercury in the ecosystem and to track its rapid decline in fish once they stopped adding it to the environment. Methylmercury is a much more toxic form of mercury that accumulates to high concentrations in many freshwater fishes leading to many adverse, and even life-threatening, symptoms in humans. The study was carried out at IISD Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA) in Ontario, Canada, which is one of the only facilities in the world where lakes and their watersheds can be experimentally manipulated to determine the many ways in which humans are impacting lakes.   Whole-ecosystem experiments are incredibly powerful because they examine the effects of a single factor at a time and provide solutions to globally-important issues in a real-world setting,  said Dr. Carol Kelly, who has spent decades conducting research on the experimental lakes.   Part of that real-world setting was working with natural fish populations. Studying fish only in laboratories was not revealing the full story, said Lee Hrenchuk, a Biologist with IISD-ELA. Individual fish retain mercury they have previously accumulated for a long time, and so it could be assumed that decreasing mercury input to a lake might not be very beneficial. However, we discovered that the hatching of new fish into a lower mercury environment was sufficient to lower the mercury level of the population as a whole in a short period of time"". The near-term value of reducing mercury inputs to freshwater lakes was not a sure thing, because large masses of old mercury always exist in lakes from decades past,  said Mr. Reed Harris, of Reed Harris Environmental, one of the founders of the study.   So, it was critical for the experiment that isotopic form of mercury we added could be distinguished from older mercury in the ecosystem. As new mercury inputs to the experimental lake were increased and then decreased in a controlled manner, the methylmercury in the lake water, surface sediments, invertebrates and fish both increased and decreased quickly. This was true whether the mercury rained directly onto the lake surface or entered the lake from the surrounding watershed in streams. While mercury exported to lakes from their watersheds may not decline exactly in step with lowering atmospheric deposition rates, this experiment clearly demonstrates that any reduction in the amount of mercury entering lakes will have immediate benefits to fish consumers, said Dr. John Rudd, former Chief Scientist at the Experimental Lakes Area and a principal investigator on the study.   Fish is a high-quality protein that is beneficial to many people, providing that it is low in methylmercury. Reference: Blanchfield PJ, Rudd JWM, Hrenchuk LE, et al.

A new study has found how a small difference in the RNA sequence can allow the viral RNA to be packaged for replication, creating potential targets for future HIV treatments. The study, published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that HIV chooses its viral RNA genome   the  source code  that it injects into healthy human cells to infect them   based on functions attributable to just two nucleotides.   It s just this two-nucleotide difference that makes such a dramatic effect,  said Karin Musier-Forsyth, senior author of the study, Ohio Eminent Scholar and a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at The Ohio State University.  If we can prevent it from packaging its own genome, we can prevent it from spreading inside the body.  The study s authors, who also include researchers from the National Cancer Institute, hoped to answer a long-standing question in HIV biology research: How does the virus know to package its specific viral RNA to be copied in human cells? Just like we need a genome encoded by DNA, viruses have their own genomic DNA or RNA   in the case of HIV it s RNA   and they have to package their genomic RNA and that s what this whole study is about,  she said.  It s an essential step for how we understand the replication of the virus.  RNA is a string of nucleotides, and it is present in some form or another in all living things, including viruses. In HIV, it carries the genetic information that allows the virus to copy itself inside a host   the human body. HIV RNA comprises about 9,800 nucleotides.  We have lots of types of RNA in our cells as humans, including messenger RNA (mRNA), which is very abundant   and which everyone has heard about now, thanks to COVID-19,  Musier-Forsyth said.  But the viral genome from HIV is made in small amounts, and it is very selectively packaged as genomic RNA, in addition to serving as mRNA to make viral proteins. How does the virus find this genomic RNA to package and not just package any old RNA in our cells?  Researchers believed if they could find an answer to that question, they might eventually be able to develop drugs that could block the virus from replicating and stop it from infecting healthy human cells. The researchers examined the structures of two nearly identical HIV RNA strings and found that the virus used a two-nucleotide difference on the very end of the RNA strings to distinguish between genomic RNA and viral mRNA. One, they found, was more efficient at being packaged as a genome than the other due to the conformations, or structures, that it formed. The findings could have implications for future HIV treatments that target RNA and would be different from current HIV treatments, which primarily target viral proteins. New HIV drugs based on this discovery are likely years away, but Musier-Forsyth said this finding is an important scientific step. Now that we understand more about the structure of the RNA, we could develop therapeutics, whether they be small molecules or other new nucleic acid therapeutics, that could lock the RNA into a conformation that wouldn t be packaged. If it can t package its genome then it can t replicate,  Musier-Forsyth said.ReferenceNikolaitchik OA, Liu S, Kitzrow JP, et al.

So, like molecular sculptors, they take an initial rough match, cut away some of its chemical parts and replace them with other parts to shape an  optimized  molecule that better binds to the protein target, neutralizing it or turning it against the disease.This process   done mostly manually in the lab   usually requires significant resources over years of trial and error, and even then it often fails to produce a useful drug. However, new chemical and computer technologies are poised to change the game.Drawing from a pool of hundreds of thousands of chemical building blocks called synthons, chemists first learned how to use simple and reliable reactions to  click  together two or three synthons at a time to create many billions of molecules of any shape and chemical characteristic. This allowed them to then create virtual catalogs of  readily available for synthesis  compounds   which chemists call  REAL Space    that are highly likely to include molecules that have a much better initial fit to the protein target.However, searching for a good initial fit in libraries of this enormous size creates a problem of its own: Making all of the molecules and testing their fit to the target in the real world would require every chemist in the world to work several lifetimes. Even using modern computational tools to comb through the virtual pile of molecules, now at about 20 billion and rapidly growing, is extremely cumbersome and expensive, creating a new and significant bottleneck for drug discovery.Enter Vsevolod  Seva  Katritch, associate professor of quantitative and computational biology and chemistry at USC Dornsife and the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience.Katritch leads a group of researchers that developed a new screening approach that bypasses the library size problem by never having to build the full library. Instead, they work directly with the synthons, the virtual building blocks of the REAL Space library, to efficiently puzzle together the best molecules that fit the target.

The scientists, from the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health, published their findings today in Nature Communications. This stem-cell-derived model of dry AMD is a game-changer. Scientists have struggled to unravel this incredibly complex disease, and this model could prove to be invaluable for understanding the causes of AMD and discovering new therapies,  said Michael F. Chiang M.D., director of the NEI.This is among the first studies to show that it s possible to develop a dish-based model that replicates the characteristics (phenotype) of a complex disease, as opposed to a disease caused by a single mutation. The causes of AMD involve a yet-to-be-understood combination of genetic factors, aging, and behavior-related risk factors such as smoking and diet.The researchers used the model to screen drugs to see if they may slow or halt disease progression. Two drugs prevented the model from developing key phenotypes: the accumulation of drusen, lipid-rich deposits in the retina, and the atrophy, or shrinkage, of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. RPE is a layer of tissue that nourishes the retina s light-sensing photoreceptors. In AMD, RPE cells shrink and die. Loss of RPE leads to the death of photoreceptors and in turn, to loss of vision.Led by Kapil Bharti, Ph.D., who directs the NEI Ocular and Stem Cell Translational Research Section, and Ruchi Sharma, Ph.D., a staff scientist in the lab and lead author of the paper, the investigators developed the model using stem cell-derived mature RPE cells. Bharti s group initially developed the cells using skin fibroblasts or blood samples donated from AMD patients. In Bharti s laboratory, the fibroblasts or blood cells were programmed to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and then programmed again to become RPE cells.Importantly, the findings shed light on how genetic variants affect AMD development.Previous genetic studies had shown that some AMD patients have variants in genes responsible for regulating the alternate complement pathway, a key part of the immune system. However, it was unclear how the genetic variants led to disease.One hypothesis was that patients with such variants lacked the ability to regulate the alternate complement pathway once it had become activated, resulting in the formation of anaphylatoxins, a type of protein that mediates inflammation, among other biological functions.To test this hypothesis, the researchers exposed 10 iPSC-derived RPE cell lines involving different genetic variants to anaphylatoxins from human serum. They predicted that such a stress challenge would act as a surrogate for age-induced increases in alternate complement pathway that had been observed in the eyes of patients with AMD.iPSC-derived RPE exposed to activated human serum developed key disease phenotypes: the formation of drusen, and RPE atrophy, which is associated with advanced disease stages. While signs of disease progression occurred among all 10 types of iPSC-derived RPE cells used in the study, they were worse in the iPSC-derived RPE from patients with high-risk variants in the alternate complement pathway, compared to those with low-risk variants, which gave the researchers a way to discern specific effects of genotype on disease characteristics.Using the model, they screened more than 1,200 drugs from a library of pharmacological agents that had been tested for a range of other conditions.The screen flagged two drugs for their ability to inhibit RPE atrophy and drusen formation: A protease inhibitor called aminocaproic acid, which likely directly blocks the complement pathway outside cells and a second agent (L745), which stops complement induced inflammation inside the cell indirectly via inactivation of the dopamine pathway.Of the two, L745 looks most promising and biologically interesting, according to Bharti. The drug was developed by Merck & Co. and was originally tested for treating schizophrenia.As an extension of the current work, Bharti lab helped generate iPSCs from participants in a large NEI supported clinical study known as AREDS2. We grew 65 iPSC-derived RPE lines and they are now being shared with the research community to create models for AMD research,  Bharti said.  This paper provides a framework to develop such models and thus has broad implications for the AMD research community. The AREDS2 iPSC-derived RPE cells are available through a repository managed by the New York Stem Cell Foundation.

The underground nature of each drug s development and distribution makes its international popularity hard to track. Now, using wastewater from the days near the 2021 New Year holiday, researchers in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology Letters report an increased international usage of some synthetic drugs, including eutylone and 3-methylmethcathinone (3-MMC) compared to the previous year.New synthetic drugs, also known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), include drugs made in clandestine labs without consistent methods or ingredients, as well as pharmaceuticals that are diverted into the illegal NPS market. Abuse of these substances can lead to overdose and death. NPS are tracked by forensic toxicologists, drug enforcement authorities and public health officials, but their global pervasiveness is still elusive because each agency obtains and stores their information in different ways, and not every user or dealer is identified. In contrast, wastewater epidemiology   a comprehensive survey of community-level drug consumption or disease presence   can provide widespread, consistent and near real-time information. And because everyone goes to the restroom at some point, all users are monitored with this analysis. Previously, Richard Bade, Cobus Gerber and colleagues used this technique to find out how popular various NPS were during the 2019-2020 New Year period in eight countries. However, with the regular variability of NPS distribution and the COVID-19 pandemic s restrictions, the researchers wanted to track which drugs were prevalent during the more recent New Year holiday, adding additional sites and countries. In the days surrounding Jan. 1, 2021, the researchers collected raw wastewater samples from 25 treatment plants in 10 countries across Asia, Oceana, Europe and North America. With liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, they searched for 27 unmetabolized NPS. Eleven of these compounds were detected, with only one site in Fiji having no measurable amount for any of the substances. The team found that most of the compounds were synthetic cathinones, also known as  bath salts.  Within this class of NPS, methcathinone, eutylone and 3-MMC were detected most often and had the highest per capita levels in wastewater. However, methcathinone also can result from the degradation of two legal decongestants, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, so the researchers were hesitant to link it only to illicit drug consumption. Finally, when the researchers compared the 2020-2021 New Year period to the prior year s holiday, eutylone and 3-MMC had an increased international presence. They report that 3-MMC was found for the first time in New Zealand, despite international travel restrictions. By expanding the number of sites and countries investigated, the researchers say they have provided new insights into the constantly shifting global NPS consumption patterns.ReferenceBade R, White JM, Ghetia M, et al.

One of the main limitations to CAR T-cell therapy is the temporary side effects that it causes: high fevers, low blood pressure, and other signs of what is known as the  cytokine release syndrome,  said Maus. In severe cases, patients experiencing cytokine release syndrome may require intensive care, she added.Interferon gamma (IFN ) is a cytokine produced by CAR T cells that initiates the cellular events that lead to cytokine release syndrome, but its contribution to the antitumor effects of CAR T-cell therapy remained unclear.  We ve generally thought that this cytokine is part of how CAR T cells work. We wanted to ask the question, is this cytokine really necessary for the antitumor effect [of CAR T cells] in blood cancers? Or, if we block it or knock it out do we still get antitumor effects, and would we expect there to be less cytokine release syndrome?  Maus explained.Using in vitro and in vivo models of blood cancers, Maus and colleagues demonstrated that suppressing IFN , either by blocking its function or deleting it from CAR T cells, had no observable adverse impact on the antitumor effects of CAR T cells. In contrast, suppression of IFN  appeared to prevent the activation of macrophages and other immune cells that help drive cytokine release syndrome. Deletion of IFN  led to a greater reduction in macrophage activation than current clinical approaches. Together, this implies that we can separate toxicity from efficacy,  Maus summarized.  It may be possible that blocking or knocking out this cytokine from CAR T cells could prevent or treat cytokine release syndrome, while still preserving the antitumor effects [of CAR T-cell therapy]. This could make CAR T cells an easier and more accessible therapy for patients.  Maus noted that additional research will be needed to understand the role of IFN  for the treatment of solid tumors.Reference: Bailey SR, Vatsa S, Larson RC, et al.

Epithelial cells are a type of cell that occur in layers that line most surfaces of our body. These epithelial cells can recognize and extrude neighboring precancerous cells from the epithelium; this extrusion process is called cell competition. This form of immune-like surveillance has garnered attention in recent years based on its potential for future immune-like therapeutic targets for cancer preventive treatment. However, it is still unknown what kind of ligand-receptor interactions are involved in the recognition of precancerous cells by normal epithelial cells. Recently, a group of scientists have successfully solved this research question and have published their findings in Nature Immunology.Speaking about the premise of their study, Professor Takeshi Maruyama, an Associate Professor at the Waseda Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University, who led the research group, says,  During the process of cell competition, normal epithelial cells can be primed by contact with precancerous cells. However, it was previously unclear how neighboring normal epithelial cells recognize precancerous cells to eliminate them. In this work, the researchers identified a plasma membrane protein, Canis suboptimal alteration recognizing protein (Canis AltR) in non-transformed canine epithelial cells, the function of which was unknown, as a recognizing protein for cell competition. In humans, the protein most similar to AltR is leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3 (LILRB3). AltR/LILRB3 interacts with major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) that is expressed on precancerous epithelial cells.MHC class I-AltR/LILRB3 interaction causes the activation of AltR/LILRB3, which triggers an intracellular SHP2 ROCK2 (Src homology-2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 Rho-associated protein kinase 2) pathway. This SHP2 ROCK2 pathway leads to the  accumulation of cytoskeletal components,  which generates a mechanical force to extrude precancerous cells, in the normal epithelial cells at the boundary with precancerous cells. Finally, normal epithelial cells push the precancerous cells out of the epithelium to eliminate them from the body.Interestingly, this molecular mechanism occurs independently of natural killer or CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses.  Our study describes a new immune-like mechanism by non-immune epithelial cells to suppress tumorigenesis, says Maruyama.The researchers hope that these significant findings can be applied to real life cancer treatment. Maruyama adds,  The recombinant MHC-I- 3 protein used in this study enhances the elimination of precancerous cells and suppresses the formation of tumors and precancerous lesions. We hope that this biomolecule would contribute to a therapeutic candidate for cancer prevention by the elimination of precancerous cells. This study advances us closer to more effective cancer treatments in the future, bringing hope to the fight against this devastating disease.Reference: Ayukawa S, Kamoshita N, Nakayama J, et al.

They found a combination of two preparations to be much more effective than treatment with just one of the two active substances. They have published their findings today in the medical journal Pharmaceutics.A combination of an active substance based on rapamycin and a peptide coupled with the radionuclide lutetium can effectively inhibit tumour growth. This is the key result of a study conducted by researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute working with colleagues at the University of Basel and ETH Zurich. The study builds on previous radiopharmaceutical research undertaken at PSI.To treat tumours with radiopharmaceuticals, the researchers couple radionuclides with certain molecules that dock to tumour cells particularly well and are then absorbed by these cells. In this particular case they use mini-gastrin combined with the radionuclide lutetium-177. The radioactive mini-gastrin docks to a specific receptor located on the surface of the cancer cell s membrane, from where the drug is transported inside the cell.The problem is that part of the radiopharmaceutical which docks onto the receptor has been developed from gastrin, a natural substance found in the human body. It is usually responsible for releasing stomach acid to aid the digestion of food. Healthy gastric cells therefore also produce the receptor, so the radiopharmaceutical docks onto them as well. The healthy stomach cells also absorb the drug, so may be damaged as well.Manipulating tumour cellsMichal Grzmil, a cancer biologist at the PSI Centre for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, explains:  The idea behind the new combination therapy is that the rapamycin-based substance only manipulates the cancer cells so they produce more receptor molecules and thus absorb greater amounts of the radionuclide.  The aim is to ensure that the dosage of the radiopharmaceutical absorbed via the stomach does not produce excessive side effects.Having docked onto the cancer cell, the radiation from the lutetium destroys the cells  DNA, in the best-case scenario killing off the cells and having a therapeutic effect on the tumour.Although this type of therapy is already used in practice, this new discovery significantly improves its effectiveness. During their research, scientists discovered that when using a combination of the active substance rapamycin and the radiopharmaceutical, the level of radiation entering the tumour is much higher, while the level in the stomach stays the same.  We have determined that this enables us to inhibit tumour growth by roughly half compared with administering rapamycin on its own,  says Martin B h , leader of the Pharmacology Group at the PSI Centre for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences.

One-carbon metabolism plays a key role in the production of, e.g., neurotransmitters. This type of knowledge concerning metabolism in relation to psychiatric disorders may eventually help in diagnosis and lead to better targeted and personalized treatments. The results were published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the Journal of Affective Disorders Reports. The diagnosis of psychiatric disorders relies on discussion and the observations of psychiatrists. In the future, metabolomic analysis could be an alternative method to separate diagnoses with often overlapping diagnostic criteria. In addition, the appropriate medical treatment is often only found after considerable trial and error. If metabolomic knowledge was more precise and we could determine more specifically how disorders are reflected in the metabolome, we might be able to use blood samples and metabolomic analysis to target appropriate medication right at the beginning of the treatment,  says Early Stage Researcher Karoliina Kurkinen from the University of Eastern Finland.The study was conducted on 76 young psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with episodic or chronic depression. Blood samples were analyzed to identify metabolites related to the chronicity of depression. When the metabolism of episodically depressed patients was compared with chronically depressed patients, differences in one-carbon and energy metabolism related metabolites were found. As the cohort was small, background factors, such as living habits, may have affected the results. Thus, these findings are considered preliminary, and research needs to be continued with a larger cohort to draw any stronger conclusions. These metabolomic studies require large study groups so that background factors can be controlled for, and actual changes become observable. Of course, the fact that so many factors, such as nutrition, sleep, and exercise, affect the metabolome does not make this task easy. However, in a large enough cohort, the core alterations can be recognized. The most interesting part of this study has been the possibility to explore the possible mechanisms leading to the chronicity of depression based on these preliminary results. The next step would be to repeat this study but with a much larger cohort and with healthy controls,  Kurkinen says.Reference: Kurkinen K, K rkk inen O, Lehto SM, et al.

Now, researchers reporting in ACS Chemical Neuroscience have shown that, at least in the test tube, the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein interacts with a neuronal protein called  -synuclein and speeds the formation of amyloid fibrils, pathological protein bundles that have been implicated in Parkinson s disease.In addition to respiratory symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological problems, such as loss of smell, headaches and  brain fog.  However, whether these symptoms are caused by the virus entering the brain, or whether the symptoms are instead caused by chemical signals released in the brain by the immune system in response to the virus, is still controversial. In Parkinson s disease, a protein called  -synuclein forms abnormal amyloid fibrils, leading to the death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Interestingly, loss of smell is a common premotor symptom in Parkinson s disease. This fact, as well as case reports of Parkinson s in COVID-19 patients, made Christian Blum, Mireille Claessens and colleagues wonder whether protein components of SARS-CoV-2 could trigger the aggregation of  -synuclein into amyloid. They chose to study the two most abundant proteins of the virus: the spike (S-) protein that helps SARS-CoV-2 enter cells, and the nucleocapsid (N-) protein that encapsulates the RNA genome inside the virus.In test tube experiments, the researchers used a fluorescent probe that binds amyloid fibrils to show that, in the absence of the coronavirus proteins,  -synuclein required more than 240 hours to aggregate into fibrils. Adding the S-protein had no effect, but the N-protein decreased the aggregation time to less than 24 hours. In other experiments, the team showed that the N- and  -synuclein proteins interact directly, in part through their opposite electrostatic charges, with at least 3 4 copies of  -synuclein bound to each N-protein. Next, the researchers injected N-protein and fluorescently labeled  -synuclein into a cell model of Parkinson s disease, using a similar concentration of N-protein as would be expected inside a SARS-CoV-2-infected cell. Compared to control cells with only  -synuclein injected, about twice as many cells died upon injection of both proteins. Also, the distribution of  -synuclein was altered in cells co-injected with both proteins, and elongated structures were observed, although the researchers could not confirm that they were amyloid. It s unknown whether these interactions also occur within neurons of the human brain, but if so, they could help explain the possible link between COVID-19 infection and Parkinson s disease, the researchers say.Reference: Semerdzhiev SA, Fakhree MAA, Segers-Nolten I, Blum C, Claessens MMAE.

When RIPK3 activates MLKL, it triggers a type of inflammatory cell death called necroptosis that kills the cell and alerts the immune system that it is under attack. However, when uncontrolled, necroptosis has been linked to human inflammatory diseases.The findings will help scientists discover drugs that can target and suppress cell death by necroptosis, which could lead to new treatments for a range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, renal injury and diabetes.The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, was led by WEHI researchers Yanxiang Meng, Dr Katherine Davies, Associate Professor Peter Czabotar and Associate Professor James Murphy. The discovery is the latest in an almost 15-year-long journey to understand necroptosis for treating disease.WEHI researchers have visualised the structures of human cell death protein RIPK3 alone, and RIPK3 bound to MLKL in a dormant state. It is the first time these cell death proteins in humans have been visualised alone and in complex, giving scientists a visual understanding of what triggers the dormant complex to activate and kill cells.

New report calls for clearer definition to inform research and improve treatment.A group of mental health experts from research, industry, regulatory bodies and with lived experience have proposed new agreed criteria to define the type of depression that current medications and therapies cannot treat effectively. The report aims to provide consistent definitions for future research, and especially for designing clinical trials for new medications, with the aim of helping to develop more tailored and effective treatments for people experiencing this difficult condition.Published in Molecular Psychiatry, the report used a well-known method to gain consensus, the Delphi Method, which collected and summarised the views of over 60 experts in the field of depression. The report was led by researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) King s College London and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affects up to 30 per cent of adults with major depressive disorder, which is a clinical condition characterised by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest experienced by around 230 million people worldwide.The term TRD is used to describe those people who have not responded to  adequate  antidepressant treatments, but there is a lack of consensus around the concept and what is understood by  adequate  treatments.The authors found that there is variation around how TRD is defined, and that only about a third of studies in TRD enrol participants who met the most common definition of having experienced at least two failures with antidepressant approaches. In addition, only one in five studies enrol participants who met the additional criteria of adequate dose and duration of medications, according to the report. This questions the applicability of the results from research to the real-world and potentially hinders progress in the development of novel treatments.  First author Dr Luca Sforzini from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King s College London said:  So far there has been confusion about what is meant by treatment-resistant depression in research, practice and regulation, and the lack of a shared understanding is creating a barrier to effectively assessing current and future treatments. To address this, the report convened a range of experts to provide an agreed definition that we hope can support and accelerate much-needed progress in this field and enable the development of effective new approaches to treatment, eventually helping people with depression. The report brought together a group of international experts including those with lived experience, clinicians, academics, researchers, employees of pharmaceutical companies and regulatory bodies representatives. Using a Delphi-method-based consensus approach, the report formulated agreed definitions of TRD and a set of recommendations on researching unmet needs and designing clinical trials.Co-authors from the European Medicines Agency, Florence Butlen-Ducuing and Andrew Thomson, said:  Many antidepressants are available but there are still patients who are responding only partially or are resistant to treatments. As Scientific Officers of the European Medicines Agency, we welcome work that can improve our understanding of treatment-resistant depression and partially responsive depression and guide better clinical trials to try and address this unmet medical need. The report strongly recommended that a clearer definition of TRD should be adopted: this would classify people as having TRD when they experience a minimal reduction in symptoms (by 25% or less) after the use of at least two antidepressants. They also suggested making a distinction between TRD and partially responsive depression (PRD), where people with PRD show a reduction of between 25 to 50% in symptoms to at least one antidepressant. This differentiation between these levels of treatment resistance will be useful to identify who will be appropriate for certain trials and eventually for treatments, according to the authors.Co-author Fanni-Laura M ntyl  who has experience of living with depression said:  Personally, as a patient with a very difficult and lengthy path with the recovery from major depressive disorder, I feel a clearer definition between partially responsive depression and treatment-resistant depression would be very beneficial; as well as a more patient-centric and personalised approach to the treatment. In the case of TRD, the study also called for greater clarity around timing, so that only those with a lack of treatment response falling within the current episode of depression are diagnosed with TRD.  Alongside this, the authors agreed that the TRD definition should be as inclusive as possible in terms of other types of treatments, so that it does not exclude people who have failed psychotherapy or some brain stimulation techniques.Lead author, Professor Carmine Pariante from the IoPPN and theme lead for affective disorders at the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre said:  This is a very exciting time for research and practice around treatment-resistant depression, with a number of innovative new approaches on the horizon such as psychedelics, anti-inflammatory medications and brain stimulation techniques. We hope our report will pave the way for the acceptance and implementation of a standard definition to ensure these new therapies work effectively in patients who are not currently helped by available antidepressants. The authors also discussed the assessment of depression and called for more standardisation and shared practice in this area in terms of which instruments are used to provide a diagnosis or assess change in depressive symptoms. They agreed that the collection of biological data, such as blood samples and brain scans, should be done consistently with the aim of identifying possible markers or measures that could identify people with different forms of depression that may respond to different types of treatment.Reference:  This article has been republished from materials provided by King's College London.

The study, published in the prestigious British Journal of Nutrition, shows that low vitamin B12 status is linked to depressive symptoms, but shows that folate is not associated with depression. The findings reveal pertinent information for older adults, public health and policymakers to better understand how to identify risk and adopt protective measures to enhance health outcomes for persons aged 50 and over.The study uses data from TILDA, and examines participants aged 50 years and over who were assessed at Wave 1 of the study and who provided measurement of plasma folate and plasma B12 and screening for depression. Researchers observed that those with deficient-low B12 status had a 51% increased likelihood of developing depressive symptoms over 4 years. Key Findings of the study    Dr Eamon Laird, lead author of the study said: This study is highly relevant given the high prevalence of incident depression in older adults living in Ireland, and especially following evidence to show that one in eight older adults report high levels of low B12 deficiency rates. There is a growing momentum to introduce a mandatory food fortification policy of B-vitamins in Europe and the UK, especially since mandatory food fortification with folic acid in the US has showed positive results, with folate deficiency or low status rates of just 1.2% in those aged 60 years and older. Our findings should provide further reassurance for policy makers to show that a food fortification policy could offer a potential means to aid the prevention of depressive symptoms in older adults and benefit overall health through the enrichment of food such as breakfast cereals with B12 vitamins and folate.   Professor Rose Anne Kenny, Principal Investigator of TILDA said: TILDA is exceptional in the breadth of rich data available from its longitudinal dataset, which offers a unique opportunity to conduct strong evidence-based research and spot important changes in a group over time. A major strength of this study is that it is based on a large, nationally representative sample of older adults in Ireland, observed over four years.   Moreover, researchers examined a well-characterised group and included a wide range of confounding factors including chronic disease, medications, lifestyle factors and other nutrient blood biomarkers to reveal robust findings. Given the rise in loneliness and depression in older adults after the onset of COVID-19 restrictions, this study highlights the importance of increasing B12 intake or supplementation to help mitigate against potential risk factors of depression in older adults.

Plus, they are difficult to scale up and customize to a specific target.Thomas Anthopoulos and coworkers used solid-state metal oxide transistors with a tunable surface chemistry and exceptional operating characteristics to design a biosensor that had a unique tri-channel configuration. This configuration comprises a central sensing channel flanked by two conventional channels.The team had unexpectedly discovered that an analyte droplet located outside the conventional channel area still triggered some response in a typical metal oxide transistor-based sensor. This inspired them to design the tri-channel device, explains Yen-Hung Lin, who co-led the study.The researchers successively layered indium oxide and zinc oxide solutions on a support to form a so-called semiconducting heterojunction. Next, they manufactured the electrodes on the heterojunction before depositing another zinc oxide layer on the electron transporting interface. They sequentially anchored a target-specific receptor molecule to modulate the selectivity and butyric acid to prevent direct contact between the sensing channel and the fluids used to disperse the analytes to this top layer. We were absolutely thrilled to see the enhanced performance when we first used this design to sense the presence of DNA,  Anthopoulos says.In addition to detecting various types of DNA and the biotin-binding protein avidin at extremely low concentrations, the biosensor showed ultrasensitivity to the COVID-19 spike protein when target-specific antibody acceptors were immobilized to its surface.  We did anticipate extreme sensitivity but were not sure whether the analyte receptor interactions would be strong enough to be sensed with high fidelity. It turned out that it was,  he adds.The team now plans to build a portable system that could simultaneously test for a variety of pathogens.  Our platform is ideal for developing sensor arrays featuring different types of receptors to detect multiple analytes in a single biosample,  Anthopoulos says.Reference: Lin YH, Han Y, Sharma A, et al.

However, there are many difficulties in reliable monitoring, especially for N2O, as the concentration of N2O in atmospheric is only a few hundred parts per billion. However, the compatibility precision recommended by World Meteorological Organization (WMO)is much lower. Therefore, a solution that can offer more precise monitoring is needed. Recently, a research team led by Professor GAO Xiaoming of Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) developed a dual gas sensor with high precision and low drift to measure atmospheric N2O and CO. Related findings were published in Sensors and Actuators B: ChemicalIn this research, researchers designed an improved White Cell to obtain long optical path length (76 m) at a short base length (34.5 cm). The radio frequency noise was equipped to low optical fringes. Combined with an Interband Cascade Laser (ICL), they got a high precision spectrometer for atmospheric greenhouse gases N2O and CO.With this spectrometer, researchers can test micro-daily-drift (less than 1.5 part per trillion). The precisions of N2O and CO reached 0.065 part per billion and 0.133 part per billion, respectively, which successfully met the requirement of WMO.This work provides a potentially valuable laser spectrometer for highly precise measurement of greenhouse gases, which is of great significance to the monitoring and suppression of global warming.Reference: Shao L, Chen J, Wang K, et al.

The new copper product is the result of a collaborative research project with RMIT University and Australia s national science agency, CSIRO, with findings just published in Biomaterials. Copper has long been used to fight different strains of bacteria, including the commonly found golden staph, because the ions released from the metal s surface are toxic to bacterial cells.  But this process is slow when standard copper is used, as RMIT University s Distinguished Professor Ma Qian explained, and significant efforts are underway by researchers worldwide to speed it up.  A standard copper surface will kill about 97% of golden staph within four hours,  Qian said.  Incredibly, when we placed golden staph bacteria on our specially-designed copper surface, it destroyed more than 99.99% of the cells in just two minutes.   So not only is it more effective, it s 120 times faster.  Importantly, said Qian, these results were achieved without the assistance of any drug.   Our copper structure has shown itself to be remarkably potent for such a common material,  he said.   The team believes there could be a huge range of applications for the new material once further developed, including antimicrobial doorhandles and other touch surfaces in schools, hospitals, homes and public transport, as well as filters in antimicrobial respirators or air ventilation systems, and in face masks.  The team is now looking to investigate the enhanced copper s effectiveness against SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including assessing 3D-printed samples.  Other studies suggest copper may be highly effective against the virus, leading the US Environmental Protection Agency to officially approve copper surfaces for antiviral uses earlier this year.

An international team of researchers explored how focusing either on the short- or long-term warming effects of methane can affect climate mitigation policies and dietary transitions in agriculture.Unlike the other main greenhouse gases (GHG) and particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) has a short atmospheric life (around 10 years). Its warming effect is significant in the short term but diminishes in the long term. Depending on the time scale considered, methane s contribution to agricultural emissions and climate change may vary substantially. This has important implications in the design of global climate change mitigation policies for agriculture.Based on projections from three agricultural economic models, the study just published in the journal Nature Food shows how different valuations of methane, reflecting either a short- or long-term focus, may affect the cost-effectiveness of mitigation policies and the benefits of low-meat diets.Conventionally, the climate impact of a certain sector is evaluated through its annual greenhouse gas emissions, typically using the Global Warming Potential over a 100 year period metric   GWP100     which estimates the change in atmospheric energy balance resulting from a particular type of GHG emission. However, as GHG emissions are reported as CO2-equivalents (which is a very stable GHG), GWP100 can fail to capture how the relative impacts of different gases change over time.The short-lived character of methane emissions has been arguably overlooked in most assessments of emission reductions required from the agricultural sector to achieve climate targets. The authors explored how different valuations of methane affect the ranking of mitigation policies in agriculture and, consequently, the sector s contribution to global warming. The study highlights the importance of methane abatement options to slow down the contribution of agriculture to global warming. Given the short atmospheric lifetime of methane, which not only delivers climate effects on a relatively short time horizon, but also  contributes to climate change, this makes it an interesting and essential element in agricultural mitigation policy design,  explains study coauthor Stefan Frank, a researcher in the IIASA Integrated Biosphere Futures Research Group.The findings indicate that mitigation policies focused on methane s short-term impact lead to greater emission reductions and the authors highlight that focusing specifically on the short-term effects of methane will lead to larger reductions of emissions compared to policies that do not consider methane s short-liveness. Such stringent mitigation policies can even result in methane s contribution to climate change dropping below current levels (since the warming effect of methane disappears). In this respect, decreasing methane emissions have the same overall effect as CO2 uptake or carbon capture and storage technologies.The authors further highlight that the impact of low animal protein diets as a mitigation option strongly depends on the context in which it is occurring. If mitigation policies base themselves on metrics that reflect methane s long-term behavior (resulting in a lower relative valuation), methane emission intensity is not as greatly reduced by technical measures. Then, low meat diets appear as a more effective option to reduce emissions. If policies are less strict, reductions in meat consumption and consequently production in developed economies could therefore become an especially powerful mitigation mechanism. The methane specificities   by which we mean a significant warming effect and related mitigation potential in the short term and the  climate neutrality  of a stable level of emissions in the long term   deserve distinct treatment in climate mitigation policies. This has been also recognized in the Global Methane Pledge, announced by the US and the EU and supported by more than 100 countries, which represents a commitment to reduce particularly global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030,  says coauthor Petr Havlik, who leads the Integrated Biosphere Futures Research Group at IIASA.A combination of innovative production-side policy measures worldwide and dietary changes in countries with high calorie consumption per capita could achieve the most substantial emission reduction levels, helping to significantly reverse the contribution of agriculture to global warming.Reference: P rez-Dom nguez I, del Prado A, Mittenzwei K, et al.

These drugs aim to block the cancer-causing proteins that trigger out-of-control cell growth while sparing healthy tissues. But some patients are not eligible for these treatments because they have cancer-promoting mutations that are believed to cause resistance to these drugs.Now, Salk Assistant Professor and physician-scientist Edward Stites has used computer modeling and cell studies to discover that more patients may be helped by a common class of targeted therapies than previously thought. The findings were published December 14, 2021, in Cell Reports. Colorectal cancer patients who have tried all of the standard treatment options but still seen their cancer progress are in need of new options. Our study suggests that one already available targeted therapy could benefit up to 12,000 additional colon cancer patients every year,  says Stites, the paper s senior author.  Our findings are pre-clinical, and we hope this research will motivate clinicians to develop clinical trials that further examine our results. Stites was interested in examining drugs that target a protein called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). EGFR is known to drive a subset of a number of different cancer types, including lung cancer and colorectal cancer.In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cetuximab, the first drug to block EGFR activity in colorectal cancer. Since then, other drugs that target EGFR also have received approval. But from the early development of these drugs, doctors believed that patients with a mutation in any one of the family of proteins known as RAS would not respond to EGFR drugs. Therefore, whenever molecular testing of a patient s tumor revealed a RAS mutation, the patient was not offered these targeted therapies.Earlier research by the Stites lab suggested that not all RAS mutations act in the same manner, and was able to explain one well-known, but poorly understood, exception to the rule. In the new study, the team combined computational and experimental approaches to use this new explanation to find more RAS mutations that should not cause resistance to the EGFR drugs.The researchers used cells from cancers that were identical except for specific RAS mutations. This allowed them to compare how each specific mutation influenced the response to EGFR-inhibiting drugs. They found that some RAS mutations did not prevent the drugs from working. These experiments also allowed them to validate their computational studies, which helps establish how new computational methods could contribute to improving treatment options for cancer patients.The investigators also examined how well different RAS mutants bound to another protein, called NF1. Stites  previous mathematical models hinted that NF1 could play a key role in the cells  response to targeted drugs. In their new studies they revealed that the RAS mutants that do not bind NF1 well retain sensitivity to EGFR drugs, while the RAS mutants that bind NF1 well are resistant to EGFR drugs. This relationship to EGFR drugs was not originally apparent, but the computational modeling was able to uncover it from within the available and varied data.Ultimately, the investigators identified 10 distinct RAS mutations that do not preclude the use of EGFR inhibitors. Many of the drugs that would work for these mutations are already approved by the FDA for other uses, which means that doctors could start prescribing them for their patients  off label  even before clinical trials are conducted.Stites, who holds the Hearst Foundation Developmental Chair, stresses that this study also helps to validate the mathematical and computational methods developed by his team.  Models can solve scientific problems that traditional methods cannot,  he says.  We hope that future clinical trials will help identify the magnitude of benefit as well as whether all the RAS mutations we identified are equally sensitive to the EGFR-inhibiting drugs and how other mutations in addition to RAS may influence the strength of the response.

Therefore, meat eaters can change their preferences when given enough vegetarian options to choose from, yet a large proportion of these options are needed to change fixed habits for consuming meat. This new research involving Dr Beth Parkin at the University of Westminster and Dr Sophie Attwood from the World Resources Institute suggests that the food sector can have a significant impact in promoting sustainable food choices. The researchers argue that this can be achieved by changing how the choice is presented to the consumer without the need to consciously persuade individuals of the benefits of pro-environmental diets.  During the study, the researchers assessed how increasing the availability of vegetarian food in relation to meat impacts the choice of people who usually eat meat. These types of interventions are known as  nudges , as they explore ways in which a decision can be designed to influence a desired behaviour.The study randomised participants to menus that contained different ratios of meat and vegetarian dishes to determine exactly how much meat availability is needed to promote sustainable choices. It is thought that availability may have increased vegetarian food choice by implicitly suggesting behavioural norms or by providing consumers with a wider range of desirable options.  The meat and dairy industries are large polluters accounting for approximately 25% of global emissions and if left unchallenged, the impact of the food system alone would prevent us from reaching targets laid out by the Paris agreement. Incremental changes to our diet can have a big impact on carbon emissions when applied at a large scale, resulting in a significant reduction in domestic GHG emissions. Dr Beth Parkin, lead author of the study from The University of Westminster, said:  This intervention shows the potential that the food service sector has in creating large scale shifts to encourage meat eaters to change their preferences.The findings provide practical instruction on what percentage of their food offerings should be vegetarian if they are to succeed in encouraging sustainable eating behaviours. If the food service industry are to decrease their carbon footprint, they need to act by providing far more plant-based items than currently on offer. ReferenceParkin BL, Attwood S.

The NTU Singapore-developed zinc batteries are made up of electrodes (through which the electrical current leaves or enters the battery) screen-printed on to both sides of a piece of cellulose paper that has been reinforced with hydrogel. Once the battery has been expended, it can be buried in soil, where it breaks down completely within a month. In a proof-of-concept experiment described in scientific journal Advanced Science, the NTU team demonstrated how a 4cm x 4cm square of printed paper battery could power a small electric fan for at least 45 minutes. Bending or twisting the battery did not interrupt the power supply. In another experiment using a 4cm x 4cm battery to power an LED, the scientists showed that despite cutting away parts of the paper battery, the LED remained lit, indicating that cutting does not affect the functionality of the battery. The scientists think their printed battery could be integrated into flexible electronics such as foldable smart phones that are already on the market, or biomedical sensors for health monitoring. Professor Fan Hongjin from the NTU School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences and the study s co-lead author, said:  Traditional batteries come in a variety of models and sizes, and choosing the right type for your device could be a cumbersome process. Through our study, we showed a simpler, cheaper way of manufacturing batteries, by developing a single large piece of battery that can be cut to desired shapes and sizes without loss of efficiency. These features make our paper batteries ideal for integration in the sorts of flexible electronics that are gradually being developed.  Assistant Professor Lee Seok Woo from the NTU School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the study s co-lead author, said:  We believe the paper battery we have developed could potentially help with the electronic waste problem, given that our printed paper battery is non-toxic and does not require aluminium or plastic casings to encapsulate the battery components. Avoiding the packaging layers also enables our battery to store a higher amount of energy, and thus power, within a smaller system.  The development of printed paper zinc batteries by the NTU research team, which also includes research fellows Dr Yang Peihua and Dr Li Jia, is in line with the NTU 2025 vision and the University s Sustainability Manifesto, which aspire to develop sustainable solutions to address some of humanity s pressing grand challenges.Fabricating  sandwich-style  batteries Batteries power devices through an electrochemical reaction, which produces electrical energy.The internal workings of a battery are usually housed within a metal or plastic case. Inside this case are the cathode and anode   these are electrodes where the electrochemical reactions occur. A separator added between the cathode and anode creates a barrier and prevents the electrodes from touching while allowing electrical charge to flow freely between them, avoiding short circuits. Also inside the battery is a medium known as the electrolyte, which allows the electric charge to flow between the cathode and anode. To develop a thinner, lighter prototype with no packaging required, the NTU scientists adopted a  sandwich design  for their batteries   the electrodes are like the bread slices, and the cellulose paper that the electrodes are printed on is like the sandwich filling. The fabrication process starts with reinforcing cellulose paper with hydrogel to fill up the fibre gaps found naturally in cellulose. This forms a dense separator that effectively prevents the mixing of the electrodes, which are formulated as  electrode inks  and screen-printed onto both sides of the hydrogel-reinforced cellulose paper. The anode ink is mainly made up of zinc and carbon black (a conductive type of carbon). As for the cathode ink, the scientists developed one type with manganese and another with nickel as a proof-of-concept, though the research team said that other metals could possibly be used. After the electrodes are printed, the battery is immersed in an electrolyte. A layer of gold thin foil is then coated on the electrodes to increase the conductivity of the battery. The final product is about 0.4mm thick   about the thickness of two strands of human hair.  An eco-friendly alternative With hydrogel and cellulose naturally broken down by bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms, the battery can simply be buried in soil at the end of its life span where it breaks down in a matter of weeks, making it a fully biodegradable product. To demonstrate the paper battery s biodegradability, the NTU scientists buried it in the soil of a rooftop garden on the NTU campus. The hydrogel-reinforced cellulose paper started fracturing after two weeks, and degraded completely within a month. Prof Fan said:  When decomposition happens, the electrode materials are released into the environment. The nickel or manganese used in the cathodes will remain in their oxide or hydroxide forms, which are close to the form of natural minerals. The zinc found in the anode will be naturally oxidised to form a non-toxic hydroxide. This points to the battery s potential as a more sustainable alternative to current batteries.  Going forward, the NTU team hopes to demonstrate the complete integration of the printed paper battery to other printed electronics, electronic skins, as well as energy storage systems deployed in the environment.ReferenceLi PYJ, Lee SW, Fan HJ.

In a new study, University of Pittsburgh researchers simulated an attack that falsified mammogram images, fooling both an AI breast cancer diagnosis model and human breast imaging radiologist experts.The study, published today in Nature Communications, brings attention to a potential safety issue for medical AI known as  adversarial attacks,  which seek to alter images or other inputs to make models arrive at incorrect conclusions. What we want to show with this study is that this type of attack is possible, and it could lead AI models to make the wrong diagnosis   which is a big patient safety issue,  said senior author Shandong Wu, Ph.D., associate professor of radiology, biomedical informatics and bioengineering at Pitt.  By understanding how AI models behave under adversarial attacks in medical contexts, we can start thinking about ways to make these models safer and more robust. AI-based image recognition technology for cancer detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, and several breast cancer models have U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. According to Wu, these tools can rapidly screen mammogram images and identify those most likely to be cancerous, helping radiologists be more efficient and accurate.But such technologies are also at risk from cyberthreats, such as adversarial attacks. Potential motivations for such attacks include insurance fraud from health care providers looking to boost revenue or companies trying to adjust clinical trial outcomes in their favor. Adversarial attacks on medical images range from tiny manipulations that change the AI s decision, but are imperceptible to the human eye, to more sophisticated versions that target sensitive contents of the image, such as cancerous regions  making them more likely to fool a human.To understand how AI would behave under this more complex type of adversarial attack, Wu and his team used mammogram images to develop a model for detecting breast cancer. First, the researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to distinguish cancerous and benign cases with more than 80% accuracy. Next, they developed a so-called  generative adversarial network  (GAN)   a computer program that generates false images by inserting or removing cancerous regions from negative or positive images, respectively, and then they tested how the model classified these adversarial images.Of 44 positive images made to look negative by the GAN, 42 were classified as negative by the model, and of 319 negative images made to look positive, 209 were classified as positive. In all, the model was fooled by 69.1% of the fake images.In the second part of the experiment, the researchers asked five human radiologists to distinguish whether mammogram images were real or fake. The experts accurately identified the images  authenticity with accuracy of between 29% and 71%, depending on the individual. Certain fake images that fool AI may be easily spotted by radiologists. However, many of the adversarial images in this study not only fooled the model, but they also fooled experienced human readers,  said Wu, who is also the director of the Intelligent Computing for Clinical Imaging Lab and the Pittsburgh Center for AI Innovation in Medical Imaging.  Such attacks could potentially be very harmful to patients if they lead to an incorrect cancer diagnosis. According to Wu, the next step is developing ways to make AI models more robust to adversarial attacks. One direction that we are exploring is  adversarial training  for the AI model,  he explained.  This involves pre-generating adversarial images and teaching the model that these images are manipulated. With the prospect of AI being introduced to medical infrastructure, Wu said that cybersecurity education is also important to ensure that hospital technology systems and personnel are aware of potential threats and have technical solutions to protect patient data and block malware. We hope that this research gets people thinking about medical AI model safety and what we can do to defend against potential attacks, ensuring AI systems function safely to improve patient care,  he added.Reference: Zhou Q, Zuley M, Guo Y, et al.

The research was published today in Lancet Oncology.Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The research study focused on a subset of colorectal cancer patients who carry a mutated gene called KRAS G12C, which is estimated to inflict about 4% of people with colorectal cancer tumors, said Marwan Fakih, M.D., lead study author and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at City of Hope. KRAS mutations have been linked to worse overall survival in colorectal cancer, partly because they are resistant to targeted therapies that inhibit the EGFR protein, a pathway that enables cancer cell growth. For this chemotherapy-resistant population, the study results exceeded the historic benefits linked to approved third- and fourth-line therapies for advanced colorectal cancer,  said Fakih, professor in City of Hope s Department of Medical Oncology & Therapeutics Research and the Judy & Bernard Briskin Distinguished Director of Clinical Research.  This Lancet Oncology study is a proof of principle that targeting KRAS G12C with a small molecule KRAS G12C inhibitor, sotorasib, can lead to tumor shrinkage and meaningful duration of disease control in a patient population that otherwise has very limited treatment options. While the response rate in the study did not meet expectations, the ongoing, single-arm Phase 2 CodeBreaK 100 trial showed an objective response rate of 9.7% among the 62 patients enrolled, with six patients achieving a partial response. Disease control (complete response, partial response or stable disease) was achieved in 82% of patients. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were four months and nearly 11 months, respectively.Patients had received a median of three prior treatment regimens of systemic anti-cancer therapy, with 73% of patients receiving three or more previous lines of treatment prior to participating in this study. Most treatment-related side effects were minor (grade 1-2) and included diarrhea and nausea. These data from the Phase 2 CodeBreaK 100 show encouraging clinical activity and a positive benefit-risk profile with sotorasib in advanced colorectal cancer in this heavily pretreated patient population, with the response rate exceeding the current standard of care therapies,  said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen.  Amgen remains deeply committed to bringing new treatment options to colorectal cancer patients who harbour the KRAS G12C mutation, and we believe the path forward is combination therapy, so we look forward to investigating sotorasib in combination with panitumumab in our Phase 3 trial. Currently, overall response rate for patients with recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer who take approved options, such as trifluridine and regorafenib, ranges from 1-4%, Fakih said. Their estimated median progression-free survival and overall survival range from two to three months and six to nine months, respectively. The CodeBreaK 100 data for this patient population demonstrates better response rate and longer survival than current approved medicines. We are now working on potentially improving the efficacy of sotorasib by combining it with panitumumab, therefore resulting in a more complete blockade of the EGFR pathway and improving oncological outcomes. We have recently reported the preliminary results of a sotorasib plus panitumumab combination therapy in KRAS G12C mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, which resulted in an overall response rate of 33% in patients who have never received sotorasib,  said Fakih.  We are looking forward to the launch and completion of a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial to test and potentially confirm the superiority of sotorasib and panitumumab over standard of care and to enable the approval of this combination in this patient population with unmet needs.

For generations, the vaccine has saved lives and prevented untold suffering. And yet TB still kills around 1.5 million people every year. The problem is that the BCG vaccine was the first and the last vaccine approved to prevent tuberculosis.""This vaccine is 100 years old. The first dose was given one hundred years ago this year,"" says La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) Research Assistant Professor Cecilia Lindestam Arlehamn, Ph.D. ""Technology has moved on since then, but not the tuberculosis vaccine, although there are many promising candidates in the pipeline.""Lindestam Arlehamn and her colleagues at LJI, Link ping University, Murdoch University and Vanderbilt University recently set out to finally uncover exactly how the BCG vaccine works. A better understanding of BCG vaccination could serve as a foundation for designing more effective TB vaccines.""About a quarter of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"" adds Lindestam Arlehamn. ""We have to do more.""The researchers wanted to know which kinds of immune cells respond to the BCG vaccine and ""remember"" the vaccine well enough to fight the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium that causes TB. Their findings, published in eBiomedicine, point to a particularly important subset of T cells called Th1* cells.These Th1* cells are a key marker in the body's ""immune signature"" following BCG vaccination. By looking at this immune signature, vaccine developers can make sure their TB vaccine candidates are enlisting the right kinds of immune cells.For the study, Lindestam Arlehamn and her colleagues followed a group of 17 adults in Sweden who had never received a BCG vaccine or contracted tuberculosis. The researchers took a blood sample before the participants received a BCG vaccine. The researchers took another sample eight months after vaccination. This time jump allowed the researchers to see which kinds of immune cells would remember the BCG vaccine and jump into action to help prevent tuberculosis.The researchers looked at the immune cells in these samples using tools such as flow cytometry, RNA sequencing and DNA methylome analysis. The Th1* cells stood out.After 100 years, the researchers had uncovered a clue to the very workings of BCG vaccination.The researchers also found more MAIT cells in the vaccinated participants. MAIT cells are important players in the intersection between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.This was not the first time TB researchers took note of Th1* cells and MAIT cells. These are the same cells shown to respond to natural Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Now Lindestam Arlehamn could see that Th1* and MAIT cells were key players after BCG vaccination as well.Going forward, scientists can compare the entire T cell repertoire, or TCR, described in this study to their own vaccine data. ""Now we can look at whether we want to trigger these immune cells using novel vaccines,"" says Lindestam Arlehamn. ""How can we get these immune cells to increase and do what they're born to do, so to speak?""Of course, the new study gives scientists just a snapshot of BCG vaccine responses. Lindestam Arlehamn says it will be important to compare the results to immune responses in younger subjects in different parts of the world. Kids typically have a better response to BCG vaccination which prevents more severe TB cases.""Kids have a different immune system. They're not as developed, and there are differences compared to adults,"" she says. ""So it would be interesting to look at the immune signature in kids.""Reference: Singhania A, Dubelko P, Kuan R, et al. CD4+CCR6+ T cells dominate the BCG-induced transcriptional signature.

The five-drug cocktail, along with a stem cell transplant, allowed people with ultra-high risk multiple myeloma to live longer before their disease progressed than those who received the standard of care.    The MUK Nine OPTIMUM  trial used a highly innovative methodology to open the door to the first tailored approach for people with the highest risk forms of myeloma   whose outcomes from treatment are currently poor.It is also the latest study to demonstrate the benefit of combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to combat cancer s ability to evolve and become resistant to treatment. A team at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and the Clinical Trials Research Unit at the University of Leeds adopted a new high-speed trial methodology   testing the five-drug combination against the findings of an earlier study, rather than against a control group, to obtain the results faster for the eventual benefit for patients.Their findings were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting on Sunday.All five drugs in the combination   bortezomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab, dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy   are individually licensed and in clinical use. That means the combination has the potential to receive streamlined approval and become available to patients relatively quickly.               Certain genetic changes can make multiple myeloma   a type of bone marrow cancer   more aggressive, less responsive to treatment and likely to relapse more quickly. So-called ultra-high-risk patients have particularly unfavourable genetic signatures and previous studies have suggested they are at very high risk of their disease relapsing within the first two years from diagnosis. In contrast, the majority of other patients now stay in remission for five years or longer. Currently, there is no tailored treatment approach for these high-risk patients, and their outcomes remain poor.The OPTIMUM trial involved 107 patients with ultra-high-risk myeloma recruited between 2017 and 2019. The results presented today compare survival outcomes from OPTIMUM patients, who received the new five-drug combination, with survival outcomes from patients in the Myeloma XI (MyXI) trial, who received carfilzomib, lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone.Patients from the OPTIMUM trial were more likely than MyXI patients to live for longer, during and after treatment, before seeing their disease progress and symptoms worsen. At 18 months, 82 per cent of OPTIMUM patients had stable disease unlikely to progress in the immediate future, compared with 67 per cent of MyXI patients.The new findings represent a significant advance for patients with high-risk myeloma and highlight the need to tailor therapy to the genetic make-up of each patient s cancer, which is currently not done routinely.         The study is an independent academic trial, but received funding from the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the drugs tested, Janssen and Bristol Myers Squibb, as well as support from the David Forbes-Nixon Foundation via Myeloma UK and from the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and the ICR. OPTIMUM is the first  digital comparator  trial for multiple myeloma. Digital comparator trials do not use a traditional control arm, and instead model comparators using data collected from other sources   in this case, another trial known as MyXI.This digital comparator trial provides a new framework to fast-track comparative evidence, helping scientists obtain answers faster for patients with high unmet clinical need.OPTIMUM is therefore a successful proof of principle study, supporting the use of digital comparator arm trials for clinical development. Researchers now hope regulatory and health technology assessment bodies such as MHRA and NICE will consider and review the data so that this new framework can be used more widely. Study leader Dr Martin Kaiser, Team Leader in Myeloma Molecular Therapy at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Haematologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said: We know that patients with multiple myeloma who have  ultra-high risk  genetic signatures have particularly aggressive cancers that fail to respond to standard treatment. In this study, we have identified a new five-drug combination that can keep myeloma at bay for longer in these patients. Our study shows the benefit of genetic testing in patients with myeloma to identify those at highest risk, since we now have a new and better treatment option for these people. All these drugs are already individually licensed and available so we know they are safe, and that means the new combination could potentially be made available for patients quickly. I hope the NHS will consider our data as soon as possible.  Professor Kristian Helin, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: Until now, patients with the highest risk forms of multiple myeloma have had no tailored treatment options, even though we know that they are likely to relapse on existing therapies. This study represents an important step forward, moving to more effective treatment of these patients. This exciting trial is also a first of its kind   using sophisticated statistical analysis to compare results with those from an earlier study rather than a control group. The new trial methodology has great potential to get much-needed new therapies to the clinic faster and it also lowers trial costs. Dr Sarah Brown, Director of Early Phase Clinical Trials at the Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds, said: We are really excited to see the positive results of this trial, and to be able to demonstrate how application of novel statistical methods can result in efficient trial design, conduct and dissemination. The study and the methodology used really has the potential to impact research widely.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

CB307 is described as an example of a potential  next generation  immunotherapy because it aims to activate the immune system in a new way   in contrast with checkpoint inhibitors, which have had spectacular success in some cancers but less in others, including prostate cancer.The new collaboration will include studies on patient-derived prostate cancer tissues to assess the influence of PSMA levels on CB307 activity and the impact of some standard-of-care and experimental therapeutics on PSMA levels. The researchers will also assess the co-localisation of PSMA and CD137 in tumour biopsies from prostate cancer patients.Professor Johann de Bono, Professor of Experimental Cancer Medicine at the ICR and honorary consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden, said: We are very pleased to have initiated this important work with the team at Crescendo. Next-generation immunotherapies could offer much-needed new treatment options to patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, as well as other common cancer types. We expect this collaboration to provide meaningful additional insights into the mechanisms and activity of CB307 in a variety of relevant settings. Dr Andrew Pierce, VP Translational Biology at Crescendo, said: The ICR is a world-renowned research institution, and we are very excited to have the opportunity to collaborate with Professor de Bono and his team to further explore the immunobiology of PSMA and CD137, including their co-localisation in tumour tissue. The results of these translational studies will be of great importance in understanding the profile of CB307, especially when placed alongside the clinical results as they continue to emerge from our ongoing clinical programme.  The ICR, alongside our hospital partner The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, hosts one of the world s leading prostate cancer research programmes. We also run about 50 first-in-human trials of novel drugs at any one time  in a range of cancer types   and sponsor later-stage drug trials.Recent highlights from our prostate cancer therapeutics programmes include the publication of preclinical research describing the effects of CCS1477, a novel p300/CBP inhibitor we are developing in collaboration with the company CellCentric, and the announcement of initial results from a phase III trial of 177Lu-PSMA-617, a lutetium-based radiopharmaceutical owned by Novartis.Current opportunities to collaborate with our researchers include the development of IL-23 inhibitors in prostate cancer.

Recently, Prof. Yuichi Oike and his team of scientists at Kumamoto University, Japan, have successfully developed a peptide vaccine that can alleviate conditions of dyslipidemia and proven its efficacy in mice. The new vaccine could become one of the most cost-effective treatments for obesity/cholesterol-related disorders like atherosclerosis and fatty liver disease.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is implicated in nearly 32% of all fatalities worldwide. Increased levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) characterize dyslipidemia, a major risk factor for CVD. These can hasten the progression of fatty liver disease, which can lead to liver cancer in the long run. With the global frequency of fatty liver disease on the rise, the market should soon be flooded with expensive drugs known as ""biopharmaceuticals"" that are currently under clinical trial. These drugs, however, will require long-term treatment which can be a big obstacle to global health-care coverage. Therefore, scientists are currently focusing their efforts on developing new therapeutic agents that are both effective and cost-efficient.In their new study, which was published in the Cell Reports Medicine, Professor Yuichi Oike and his team developed a novel peptide vaccine to tackle obesity-associated dyslipidemia and investigated its effects on obese mice models. The paper was published in Volume 2 Issue 11 of the journal on 16 November 2021.To develop the vaccine, they chose to target angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which has recently attracted attention in strategies aimed at decreasing LDL-C and TG levels in the blood. The results of the ANGPTL3 peptide vaccine were validated in their trials on mice, which confirmed efficacy for roughly 6 months with no reported toxicity, yielding evidence that the novel treatment is safe and without side effects.Peptide vaccines are well-known for being cheaper to manufacture than biopharmaceuticals, making them preferable in terms of medical economy. To meet this need, the team developed vaccines targeting three peptides (or short chains of amino acids) from ANGPTL3, namely, epitope 1 (E1), E2, and E3. The peptide vaccines were then injected into a mouse model of obesity-induced dyslipidemia. The researchers were thrilled to see that the E3 peptide vaccine effectively reduced dyslipidemia in the mice and produced antibodies that lasted 6 months.  The peptide vaccine selectively induces antibody-mediated immunity to produce neutralizing antibodies suppressing ANGPTL3 function , says Prof Oike.Because LDL-Cs easily get deposited in the walls of blood vessels and obstruct blood flow, they are commonly referred to as ""bad cholesterol"". This obstruction can cause atherosclerosis and result in heart failure. To see if their vaccine worked against this condition, the researchers administered E3 into familial severe hypercholesterolemia model mice with a high-cholesterol diet and discovered that it improved dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.When asked how this vaccine works and whether similar benefits will also be noticed in humans, Prof. Oike states, ""E3 vaccination in mice decreases circulating levels of LDL-C and TG in the blood. Since the mouse E3 sequence is identical to the corresponding human sequence, E3 could potentially be investigated in clinical studies .Prof. Oike and his colleagues believe that this vaccination will help patients in economically disadvantaged areas who require long-term therapy for dyslipidemia or related conditions. ""Expensive antibody treatments for dyslipidemia require monthly injections, whereas our vaccination is effective for up to 6 months"", he explains. ""The vaccine is projected to become one of the new economical therapy choices for dyslipidemia and dyslipidemia-related disorders"", he adds.The authors plan to conduct preclinical research to test the vaccine's efficacy and safety, as well as make improvements to prolong its effectiveness. Prof. Oike continues, ""We will modify the vaccine formulation and optimize the dosage and administration for clinical trials. Re-immunization every 5 or 6 months could maintain the therapeutic efficacy of the E3 vaccine therapy, and more investigation is necessary to see if a vaccination booster would extend its durability.""Reference: Fukami H, Morinaga J, Nakagami H, et al.

This precision mechanism sometimes fails, leading to more or less disabling malformations. By studying the Pitx1 gene, one of the genes involved in the construction of the lower limbs, a team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in Switzerland, has discovered how a small disturbance in the activation process of this gene is at the origin of clubfoot, a common foot malformation. Indeed, even a fully functional gene cannot act properly without one of its genetic switches. These short DNA sequences provide the signal for the transcription of DNA into RNA, and are essential for this mechanism. And when just one of these switches is missing, the proportion of cells where the gene is active decreases, preventing the lower limbs from being built properly. These results, that can be read in the journal Nature Communications, highlight the hitherto largely underestimated role of genetic switches in developmental disorders. During embryonic development, hundreds of genes must be precisely activated or repressed for organs to build properly. This control of activity is directed by short DNA sequences that, by binding certain proteins in the cell nucleus, act as true ON/OFF switches. ""When the switch is turned on, it initiates the transcription of a gene into RNA, which in turn is translated into a protein that can then perform a specific task,"" explains Guillaume Andrey, professor in the Department of Genetic and Developmental Medicine at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, who led this research. ""Without this, genes would be continuously switched on or off, and therefore unable to act selectively, in the right place and at the right time."" In general, each gene has several switches to ensure that the mechanism is robust. ""However, could the loss of one of these switches have consequences? This is what we wanted to test here by taking as a model the Pitx1 gene, whose role in the construction of the lower limbs is well known,"" says Raquel Rouco, a post-doctoral researcher in Guillaume Andrey's laboratory and co-first author of this study.

The standard treatment, among other recourses, includes administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). By inhibiting either of the enzymes (cyclooxygenase-1 or -2, also known as COX-1/COX-2) present in abundance at biological sites of inflammation, NSAIDs minimize pain and combat inflammation. But there s a flip side they can also cause serious side effects that result in heart failure, kidney malfunction, and stomach ulceration. It appears that to kill pain, we hurt our bodies.This is why, for some time, efforts have been directed at finding safer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. Most recently, a compound labeled AD732 has been synthesized, which shows promise in this direction. Now, in a new study published in the European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (paper made available online on November 21, 2021, and published in Volume 168 of the journal on January 1, 2022), researchers led by Dr. Kikuko Amagase from Ritsumeikan University, Japan, and Prof. Adnan A. Bekhit, from the University of Alexandria, Egypt, have explored the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of this compound in rat models. In a previous study, we synthesized this compound AD732. In this study, we compared it with two standard pharmaceutical drugs indomethacin, a prototype NSAID, and celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor. explains Dr. Amagase. We aimed to assess its efficacy and adverse effects while relieving both acute and chronic pains. The researchers tested AD732 s anti-inflammatory properties in rat models of paw edema and granuloma. They tested its analgesic properties in a rat model of hyperalgesia and with hot plate tests, where a rat is placed on a temperature-controlled heated plate and its responses are monitored for signs of pain. The results were encouraging. AD732 showed higher anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects than the standard agents, while showing no ulcerogenic effects and causing minimal harm to kidney function.Further, upon in vitro investigation of its mechanism of action, the scientists found that AD732 was a less potent inhibitor of COX-2 than celecoxib, which may indicate a lower potential for cardiovascular toxicity. Their inference is premised on prior studies, where highly potent COX-2 inhibitors have been noted to cause serious cardiac damage. For instance, rofecoxib (popularly known by the brand names  Vioxx,   Ceoxx,  and  Ceeoxx ), a selective COX-2 inhibitor, drew flak from the New England Journal of Medicine for significantly increasing the risk of heart attacks and was subsequently withdrawn from the market in 2004.But despite being a less selective inhibitor of COX-2, AD732 had proved very therapeutically effective, as previously mentioned, particularly in inhibiting rat paw edema. This seems, to an extent, to be counterintuitive. Dr. Bekhit muses, Our findings on AD732 s lower COX-2 inhibition could indicate that this is not the sole mechanism contributing to its anti-inflammatory actions. Further in-depth research is needed to determine its precise mechanism of action.Nevertheless, as Dr. Amagase explains, It may be concluded that compound AD732 appears to be a safer and more effective molecule with promising potential for the management of pain and inflammation, even in difficult diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease.  Perhaps, soon, we will be able to kill pain without hurting our bodies.Reference: Bekhit AA, Nasralla SN, El-Agroudy EJ, et al.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-platform-developed-to-screen-coronavirus-antiviral-compounds-356841,New Platform Developed To Screen Coronavirus Antiviral Compounds Researchers have developed a platform that can rapidly screen thousands of compounds to identify potential antiviral drugs to treat coronaviruses  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers investigating ways to develop a novel class of antiviral drugs to treat coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, have developed a platform that can rapidly screen thousands of compounds to identify potential candidates. The team, led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, used their new high-throughput platform to screen drug compounds that inhibit the macrodomain a protein fold that plays a critical role in the coronavirus life cycle.Prior studies suggest that some coronaviruses as well as alphaviruses largely lose their ability to replicate in cells and cause diseases in animals when their macrodomain s enzymatic activity is disrupted. In this study, researchers targeted the macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2 called Mac1.This is thought to be the first high-throughput system that can screen for compounds that block macrodomain activity. In a proof-of-principle demonstration, they used the screening platform to identify existing drugs that block the coronavirus Mac1 activity. The researchers then showed that one of these drugs did not disrupt the enzymatic activity of the human macrodomain that is most similar to Mac1. Compounds that affect human macrodomains would be more likely to cause unwanted side effects in patients.The new screening platform may enable the development of broad-spectrum drugs that treat existing coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially new coronaviruses that could emerge from animal reservoirs such as bats.The findings were published December 14 in the journal ACS Chemical Biology.  A viral-specific macrodomain inhibitor drug could be very useful in the treatment of COVID-19, MERS, and in a possible future pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus,  says study senior author Anthony K. L. Leung, PhD, associate professor in the Bloomberg School s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.  While developing new drugs takes time, our versatile screening platform gives us hope that we can one day find one. The researchers note that Mac1 is also a promising drug target because it is preserved in SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta and Omicron.Mac1 is found in SARS-CoV-2 on a protein called nsp3 (non-structural protein 3) and has a type of enzyme activity called ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity.In the study, Leung and colleagues developed a simple assay called ADPr-Glo that registers, with luminescence, the degree of enzymatic activity of a macrodomain. In the presence of compounds that inhibit the macrodomain, luminescence will be reduced. For this demonstration, they used the assay to rapidly screen two small libraries of existing drug compounds a total of 3,233 compounds for their ability to inhibit Mac1.The researchers also measured those Mac1-inhibiting compounds  ability to inhibit human MacroD2, an ADP-ribosylhydrolase enzyme that is the closest human counterpart to Mac1. MacroD2 mutation or deletion is implicated in cancer formation and neurological disorders. Since compounds that affect MacroD2 could cause unwanted side effects in patients, the aim was to demonstrate that this new method could identify compounds that inhibit Mac1 without affecting MacroD2.The experiments uncovered one existing drug, dasatinib, that does inhibit Mac1 with moderate potency, yet does not measurably inhibit the human MacroD2. Notably, it also inhibits Mac1 from another highly-pathogenic coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Dasatinib is a leukemia drug that was developed to target another class of enzymes and thus hits other targets in humans beyond Mac1. Dasatinib is known to be toxic to cells at the concentrations that inhibited Mac1. It would need modification to become an antiviral against coronavirus infections.Identifying this drug demonstrates that viral Mac1 s unique structure can be targeted by small-molecule drugs without affecting their closest human counterpart.  The ongoing pandemic has renewed urgency around identifying and developing antiviral treatments in the near term and for future pandemics. Earlier this year, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched an Antiviral Program for Pandemics to promote the development of new drugs to combat viruses with pandemic potential.The researchers plan to continue screening compounds to identify new Mac1 inhibitors.Study senior authors include Huijun Wei, PhD, director of Biochemistry and Assay Development at Johns Hopkins Drug Discovery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; and structural biologist J rgen Bosch, PhD, CEO of InterRayBio, LLC, a structure-based drug design company.

FiCAT technology is an important scientific breakthrough to overcome the current limitations of the technology used today for genome editing and gene therapy. Human genome engineering has significantly progressed in the last decade with the development of new editing tools, but there was still a technology gap that would allow therapeutic genes to be transferred efficiently with few size limitations , comments Dr. Marc G ell, supervisor of the study.In this work, the researchers develop an efficient and precise programmable gene writing technology based on the combination of modified proteins CRISPR-cas and piggy Bac transposase (PB), succeeding in inserting small and large fragments. Dr. Maria Pallar s, co-first author of the study explains that:  CRISPR stands out for its precision when editing small fragments. However, transposases allow us to insert large fragments but in an uncontrolled manner. We have combined the best of each technology .  In this way, FiCAT technology allows us to precisely insert large fragments of DNA into the genome. This means we can develop therapeutic solutions to diseases that currently have no treatment, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or some cases of hereditary blindness, in which the affected gene is large in size , asserts Dr. Avencia S nchez-Mej as, a senior researcher with the group and co-supervisor of the work. They tested the technology in human and mouse cell lines achieving efficiencies of 5 22% with minimal off-target insertions and have demonstrated on-target gene transfer in vivo in mouse liver and germline cells in mouse models. Lastly, they performed a directed evolution of FiCAT and further improved efficiency by 25-30%.  We have been progressively modifying enzymes so that they acquire the function we were looking for, selecting the ones that displayed a better function , details Dimitrije Ivan i , co-first author of the article.

However, adaptability decreases with age: as new connections between nerve cells in the brain form less easily, the brain's plasticity decreases. If there is an injury to the central nervous system such as after a stroke, the brain needs to compensate for this by reorganising itself. To do this, a dense network of molecules between the nerve cells   known as the extracellular matrix   must loosen. This is the job of a wide variety of enzymes that ultimately regulate how plastic or how stable the brain is. Researchers at the University of G ttingen studied what happens when certain enzymes are blocked in mice. Depending on whether the brain is healthy or diseased, the inhibition had opposite effects. The results were published in the Journal of Neuroscience.Learning and recovery from injuries depend on the plasticity of neuronal connections. Important for this are the macromolecules of the extracellular matrix, which are located between the nerve cells. When we grow up, the ""stability"" of this extracellular matrix increases, providing a scaffold for stabilising existing connections between the nerve cells, and consolidating what we have learned. If we experience something new, the extracellular matrix must be loosened to allow new connections to form. This relationship between stability and plasticity in the brain is regulated in the matrix with the help of enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which can  digest  the extracellular matrix and thus ""loosen"" it. A team from the University of G ttingen has now been able to show in a new study that blocking the matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9 can have opposing effects depending on whether the brain is sick or healthy.To measure neuronal plasticity, the scientists let adult mice see only through one eye for several days and recorded the resulting activity changes in the animals' visual cortex. In a first experiment, they examined the adaptability of the visual cortex of healthy mice in which the enzymes MMP2 and MMP9 were blocked (with SB3CT). As a result, neuronal plasticity was also blocked. In a second experiment, the team researched mice immediately after a stroke. It was already known that a stroke leads to a strong short-term increase in MMPs. In this case, the targeted, short-term inhibition of the enzymes MMP2 and MMP9 produced the opposite effect: the plasticity that had been greatly reduced by the stroke was restored, so blocking the enzymes MMP2 and MMP9 had a clear therapeutic effect.""What made the design of our study different from many previous studies, is that the 'matrix-degrading' enzymes were blocked only after the experimental stroke, which simulates treatment,"" says Professor Siegrid L wel from the Department of Systems Neuroscience at G ttingen University. ""We also show that the MMPs in the brain have to be very well monitored and precisely adjusted. Too low a level in the healthy brain prevents neuronal plasticity and too high a level   as after a stroke   also blocks neuronal plasticity.""The study is part of the DFG Collaborative Research Centre 889 ""Cellular Mechanisms of Sensory Processing"".Reference: Akol I, Kalogeraki E, Pielecka-Fortuna J, Fricke M, L wel S.

Its name is derived from the bubbling sound that occurs when the patient exhales into the device.The Bubbler not only reverse transcribes RNA from airborne virus particles into DNA to be tested via PCR but can also barcode that DNA, allowing samples to be linked directly to the patient they have come from and be used for sequencing. It can be used for simultaneous batches of pooled samples and provides additional information such as viral load and strain identity and eliminates the need for stabilizing a sample, potentially allowing the assay to be performed at home. Involvement of the lower respiratory tract is often a precursor to severe COVID-19, so there is an argument for a more direct sampling focused on exhaled breath,  explained lead investigator William G. Fairbrother, PhD, professor in the department of molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA.Virus detection by the Bubbler is similar to a hospital-swab PCR test; however, it is a better measure of risk of contagion as it detects airborne viral particles. Swab tests can return a positive result for months after infection as they detect viral RNA fragments in cells that persist in previously infected cells. The Bubbler can also be adapted for environmental sampling in hospitals, transportation hubs, and closed environments like offices, ships, and planes, the investigators report.Seventy patients treated in the Emergency Department of Rhode Island Hospital between May 2020 and January 2021 were screened. The study tested samples from three points in the respiratory tract. Tongue scrapes from the mouth (saliva/tongue scrapes) and from 15 seconds of exhaled breath collected in the Bubbler were compared to those from a conventional nasopharyngeal swab PCR test. The Bubbler is a glass tube with a glass pipette through which patients can exhale. The tube is filled with a reverse transcription reaction mixture and cold mineral oil.The study determined that SARS-CoV-2 can be readily detected in the breath and is more predictive of lower respiratory tract involvement. Viral RNA is more enriched in the breath relative to oral samples, while oral samples include cells involved with SARS-CoV-2 replication that breath samples do not. This suggests the viral signal detected in the Bubbler comes from active viral particles.  The Bubbler is more likely to be a better indicator of current infection than nasopharyngeal swabs,  said Dr. Fairbrother.  Another advantage is the barcoding, which enables high-throughput RNA virus testing at a fraction of the cost of conventional testing. The barcode returns a viral sequence that also supports strain identification, which may prove useful as more information is learned about transmissibility and possible strain-specific treatment decisions. The investigators also demonstrated how the Bubbler might be adapted to detect virus in airborne samples. To model the movement of droplets exhaled in human breath, three unique nucleic acid samples were added to three personal humidifiers at different locations at varied distances from the Bubbler in a room with high airflow and a room with low airflow. Although a detailed exploration of this application was beyond the scope of the study, the results demonstrate the potential to use aerosolized nucleic acids to quantitatively map airflow in indoor spaces, and to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the air. Such technology could be useful in restoring service to industries such as hotels, cruise ships, and casinos,  Dr. Fairbrother observed.  There is also an epidemiological benefit to routine testing of air at early warning sites such as transportation hubs and hospital emergency departments. Tests for COVID-19 usually use samples collected from the upper respiratory tract by saliva or nasopharyngeal swab. Positive samples contain active virus, but viral load in the upper respiratory tract is not correlated with symptoms in the lower respiratory tract, such as pneumonia.Reference: Duan C, Buerer L, Wang J, et al.

While studying M. xanthus mutants that overexpress two proteins the cells use to recognize close relatives, researchers from Rice University and the University of Wyoming discovered a previously unreported behavior: self-organization into circles a millimeter or more in diameter. The research is described in a study published online in the American Society for Microbiology s mSystems, and an image from the study will be featured in a forthcoming issue of the open-access journal.  When you overexpress that protein, you can see these circular aggregates emerge after four hours, and by 12 hours they take up the whole (petri dish),  said study co-author Oleg Igoshin, a professor of bioengineering at Rice and senior scientist at Rice's Center for Theoretical Biological Physics. Igoshin s research group and the Wyoming microbiology group led by co-author Daniel Wall collaborated for five years on the study, conducting dozens of laboratory and computational experiments to uncover the genetic mechanism of the circular swarms.M. xanthus prey on other bacteria. Lacking internal organs to digest their prey, they band together in familial packs to engulf and devour victims, which can include M. xanthus that aren t members of the family. About five years ago, Wall and study co-author Pengbo Cao, then a graduate student in his lab and now a postdoctoral research associate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, showed M. xanthus uses a surface receptor called TraA and a partner protein called TraB to recognize kin. When M. xanthus bumps into a close relative, the TraAB complex acts as a kind of glue, forming a sticky bond between the two. When M. xanthus runs into unrelated M. xanthus, TraAB helps poison non-kin. While investigating the mechanism of TraAB, Wall s team created several mutant strains, including some that overexpressed TraAB, making more of the protein than normal, and Cao noticed they had a tendency to form cell clusters within a few hours. While Wall s team followed up with microbiological experiments, Igoshin s group was asked if it could create a theoretical model that might explain the mystery.  What's interesting about our theory is that the only way we see these (circular aggregates) in our simulations is when we make the cells non-reversing,  Igoshin said.  In normal wild-type cells, they go back and forth, back and forth, like a commuter train. The head becomes the tail and the tail becomes the head. And they do it every eight minutes or so.  The model simulated M. xanthus behavior based on changes to TraAB and other signaling circuits and was developed by Igoshin and study co-authors Rajesh Balagam and Zhaoyang Zhang , who were then graduate students in his lab.  Our first idea was maybe they're so sticky, they just can't reverse,  Igoshin said.  So we tried to see if sticky cells that normally reverse would form circular aggregates. We added a very, very strong adhesion to our simulations, and nothing happened. They didn't make circles. However, if we instead inhibited the reversals the simulations worked. Circular aggregates emerged.  Follow-up experiments at Wyoming verified cells in the aggregates did not reverse, but that raised even more questions.  Somehow TraAB overexpression in aggregates prevented cells from reversing,  Igoshin said.  So this was very cool for us, because this is what our model predicted. But this was also a bit puzzling and completely unexpected. Because TraAB, as far as we knew, didn't have anything to do with reversal regulation. A few possible explanations were ruled out with follow-up experiments. Evidence suggested TraAB stickiness could be the key.  But how is it that adhesion suppresses the reversals?  Igoshin said.  Our idea was maybe there is some sort of contact-dependent signal between cells that suppresses the reversals. The cells are in dense groups and are in contact with others all the time, but those contacts are transient. But if TraAB overexpression really makes you sticky, your neighbor will remain your neighbor for longer, and that could trigger the signal that suppresses the reversals.  With those changes, the model began producing patterns very similar to what Wall s team was seeing in its experiments with engineered M. xanthus strains. To see if the model could predict a behavior that hadn t yet been seen in experiments, Igoshin s team simulated what would happen in mixed colonies of M. xanthus, including mixtures of two extra-sticky mutants that didn t recognize one another as kin. The model predicted they would form large rotating swarms containing mixtures of the two strains. The prediction was borne out in experiments by Wall s team, and the application of false color to microscopic images of the colonies revealed M. xanthus  pastiche of  The Starry Night. Our work highlights how a social bacterium, known for rich sources of therapeutic natural products and as crop biocontrol agents, serves as a powerful model for studying emergent behaviors that also exhibit artistic beauty,  Wall said.ReferenceBalagam R et al.

Early-stage lung cancer is mostly asymptomatic, and low-dose spiral CT imaging, the current method for detecting early lung cancer lesions, isn t feasible as a widespread screening test for the general population due to high cost and the radiation hazard of repeated screenings. A new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences provides proof-of-concept for the ability of a drop of blood to reveal lung cancer in asymptomatic patients. The study was co-led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH): Leo Cheng, PhD, associate biophysicist, in Pathology, Radiology, and the Athinsula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and David Christiani, MD, MPH, pulmonary and critical care physician. Our study demonstrates the potential for developing a sensitive screening tool for the early detection of lung cancer,  says Cheng.  The predictive model we constructed can identify which people may be harboring lung cancer. Individuals with suspicious findings would then be referred for further evaluation by imaging tests, such as low-dose CT, for a definitive diagnosis.  Cheng, Christiani, and their co-investigators built a lung-cancer predictive model based on metabolomics profiles in blood. Metabolomics analyzes cellular metabolite flows to decipher healthy and pathological states by studying the metabolome the dynamic biochemical suite found in all cells, fluids, and tissues of the body. The presence of lung cancer, with its altered physiology and pathology, can cause changes in the blood metabolites produced or consumed by cancer cells in the lungs. The researchers measured metabolomics profiles in blood using high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a tool that can examine an array of compounds within living cells by measuring the collective reactions of metabolites.The investigators screened tens of thousands of blood specimens stored in MGH s biobank and others and found 25 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with stored blood specimens obtained at the time of their diagnosis and at least six months prior to their diagnosis. They matched these patients with 25 healthy controls.The researchers first trained their statistical model to recognize lung cancer by measuring metabolomic profile values in blood samples obtained from patients at the time of their diagnosis and comparing them to blood samples from the healthy controls. They then validated their model using blood samples from the same patients obtained prior to their lung cancer diagnosis. Here the predictive model yielded values between the healthy controls and the patients at the time of their diagnosis.  This was very encouraging, because screening for early disease should detect changes in blood metabolomic profiles that are intermediate between healthy and disease states,  says Cheng. The investigators then tested their model with a different group of 54 patients with NSCLC using blood samples obtained before their cancer diagnosis, which confirmed that the model s predictions were accurate.Values from the predictive model measured from prior-to-diagnosis blood samples could also predict five-year survival for patients, which may be useful in guiding clinical strategies and treatment decisions. A previous study by the investigators showed the potential for magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomics to differentiate cancer types and stages of diseases. Larger studies are needed to validate the use of blood metabolomics models as NSCLC early screening tools in clinical practice.Next, the researchers will analyze metabolomic profiles of lung cancer s clinical characteristics to understand the entire metabolic spectrum of the disease, which may be useful in choosing targeted therapies. They have also measured metabolomics profiles of more than 400 patients with prostate cancer to create a model that will distinguish between indolent cancer, which needs to be monitored, and more aggressive cancer that requires immediate treatment. The investigators also plan to use the same technology to screen for Alzheimer disease using blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid.Reference: Schult TA, Lauer MJ, Berker Y, et al.

The technology, which is described in Nature Food, could help growers work out the best time to use fertiliser on their crops and how much is needed, considering factors like the weather and soil condition. This would reduce the expensive and environmentally damaging effects of overfertilising soil, which releases the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and can pollute soil and waterways. Overfertilisation has so far rendered 12 per cent of once-arable land worldwide unusable and the use of nitrogen-based fertiliser has risen by 600 per cent in the last 50 years. However, it is difficult for crop growers to precisely tailor their own fertiliser use: too much and they risk environmental damage and money wastage; too little and they risk poor crop yields. The researchers behind this new sensing technology say it could provide benefits for both the environment and growers. The sensor, named chemically functionalised paper-based electrical gas sensor (chemPEGS), measures levels of ammonium in soil   the compound that is converted to nitrites and nitrates by soil bacteria. Using a type of AI called machine learning, it combines this with weather data, time since fertilisation, pH, and soil conductivity measurements. It uses these data to predict how much total nitrogen the soil has now and how much it will have up to 12 days in the future, to predict the optimum time for fertilisation. The study identifies how this new low-cost solution could help growers yield maximum crops with minimal fertilisation, particularly for fertiliser-thirsty crops like wheat. The technology could simultaneously reduce growers  expenses and environmental harm from nitrogen-based fertilisers   the most widely used fertiliser type. Lead researcher Dr Max Grell, who co-developed the technology at Imperial College London s Department of Bioengineering, said:  It s difficult to overstate the problem of overfertilisation both environmentally and economically. Yields and resulting income are down year by year, and growers don t currently have the tools they need to combat this.  Our technology could help to tackle this problem by empowering growers to know how much ammonia and nitrate are currently in soil, and to predict how much there will be in the future based on weather conditions. This could let them fine-tune fertilisation to the specific needs of the soil and crops. Excess nitrogen fertiliser releases nitrous oxide into the air, a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide that contributes to the climate crisis. Excess fertiliser can also be washed by rain into waterways where it deprives aquatic life of oxygen, leading to algal blooms and reduced biodiversity. However it remains difficult to precisely tailor levels of fertilisation to soil and crop needs. Testing is rare and current ways to measure soil nitrogen involve sending soil samples to laboratories   a lengthy and expensive process whose results are of limited use by the time they reach the grower. This new low-cost approach could expedite the process of testing the soil. While chemPEGS only measures ammonium, the machine learning component allows it to predict current levels of nitrate and future levels of nitrate and ammonium in the soil. Senior author and principal investigator Dr Firat Guder, from Imperial s Department of Bioengineering, said:  Much of our food comes from soil - a non-renewable resource which we ll lose if we don t look after it. This, combined with nitrogen pollution from agriculture, presents a conundrum for the planet   one that we hope to help tackle with precision agriculture.  Our sensing technology can measure and predict soil nitrogen with enough accuracy to forecast the impact of weather on fertilisation planning, and tune timing for crop requirements, which we hope will help to reduce overfertilisation while improving crop yields and profits for growers.""    The researchers expect chemPEGS and associated AI technology, which are currently in prototype stage, to be available for commercialisation in three to five years with more testing and manufacturing standardisation.ReferenceGrell M, Barandun G, Asfour T, et al.

Limbird Chair in Pharmacology, James Maksymetz, a former graduate student in the Conn laboratory, and other collaborators at the Warren Center for Neuroscience Drug Discovery has identified a protein in the central nervous system, known as mGlu1, as a potential target for novel treatments of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia, which affects approximately 1 percent of the global population, has been historically difficult to treat. Current clinically approved antipsychotics are effective at reducing  positive symptoms  like hallucinations and delusions in some patients, but they fail to treat  negative symptoms,  such as social withdrawal, lack of motivation and cognitive deficits associated with the disease. The new research focused on identifying a new approach that would treat positive and negative symptoms, Maksymetz said. Schizophrenia is thought to occur when a region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex becomes abnormally active because interneurons, which connect neuron circuits or neuron groups, become dysfunctional and stop regulating neuronal activity. Conn s team sought to modulate the activity of those cells. After identifying mGlu1 an abbreviation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 as a potentially druggable target, they tested it with a compound that enhances its function: a positive allosteric modulator. The PAM was previously developed by Conn in close collaboration with other labs in the WCNDD, including those of Craig Lindsley, University Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacology, and Colleen Niswender, associate professor of pharmacology. Using this compound, they found that enhancing the activity of mGlu1 selectively increased the activity of specific inhibitory interneurons, restoring their ability to inhibit the neuronal circuits they control. Further, the researchers saw that by working with the PAM, symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia in human patients were reversed. These results suggest that using a PAM to enhance mGlu1 activity is an effective treatment for schizophrenia.","Published: December 14, 2021"

As such, the researchers say that both specialties might be unnecessarily put on a pedestal, and that phrases unrelated to careers such as  It s a walk in the park  might be more appropriate.To help settle the age-old argument of which phrase -  It s not brain surgery  or  It s not rocket science  - is most deserved, researchers compared the intelligence of 329 aerospace engineers and 72 neurosurgeons with 18,257 members of the general population. All participants completed a validated online test to measure six distinct aspects (domains) of cognition, spanning planning and reasoning, working memory, attention, and emotion processing abilities.Potentially influential factors, such as gender, handedness, and experience (years) in their specialty, were taken into account in the analysis.The results show that aerospace engineers and neurosurgeons were equally matched across most domains but differed in two respects: aerospace engineers showed better mental manipulation abilities, whereas neurosurgeons were better at semantic problem solving.When these scores were compared to the general population, aerospace engineers did not show significant differences in any domains. Neurosurgeons were able to solve problems faster than the general population but showed a slower memory recall speed.These results suggest that, despite the stereotypes depicted by the phrases  It s not rocket science  and  It s not brain surgery,  all three groups showed a wide range of cognitive abilities, explain the researchers.They acknowledge that this is an observational study that does not represent the global range of aerospace engineers and neurosurgeons. They say their results suggest that both neurosurgeons and aerospace engineers might be unnecessarily placed on a pedestal and that  It s a walk in the park  or another phrase unrelated to careers might be more appropriate.

Such systems could function, for example, inside the human body. The study was a collaboration between Yusuke Sato of Tohoku University and Masahiro Takinoue of the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), and the findings were published in the JACS Au.To make the capsules, the researchers first created two different types of DNA nanostructures. Each type was made using three single-stranded DNA molecules with sticky bits at their ends. Due to differences in their DNA sequences, only similar nanostructures stuck together when the two types were mixed.Sato and Takinoue then combined the nanostructures in solution with an oily mixture of charged and non-charged molecules. The mixture was first heated and then cooled, and finally examined under a microscope.The researchers found that water-in-oil droplets had formed, with the DNA nanostructures accumulating at the water-oil interface. The nanostructures came together in different kinds of patch-like patterns, depending on the concentration of each type relative to the other.The scientists also found that the DNA nanostructures agglomerated in a more homogeneous way when an extra X-shaped DNA nanostructure was added to the mix to connect the two types together.This worked just as well inside lipid vesicles as in water-in-oil droplets. Sato and Takinoue were also able to separate the DNA capsules from the droplets and vesicles without losing their capsule-like shapes. Finally, they were able to open the capsules and degrade them using specific enzymes.The findings demonstrate an approach for constructing and modifying DNA capsules that could have a variety of different functions and purposes. For example, they could be used to carry substances to specific target organs, releasing their cargo when exposed to certain enzymes. They could also be made mobile by using DNA nanostructures that can be manipulated to alter the shapes of the capsules. Or they could be modified with proteins or DNA-based molecular devices to make functional compartmental structures, like cellular membranes.""We believe that functional capsules made from DNA, like the ones we have designed, could provide a new approach for developing capsular structures for artificial cell studies and molecular robotics,"" say Sato and Takinoue.The team will next work on inserting different types of cargo into the capsules, including DNA information processors, and releasing them in response to specific stimuli.Reference: Sato Y, Takinoue M.

However, adaptability decreases with age: as new connections between nerve cells in the brain form less easily, the brain's plasticity decreases. If there is an injury to the central nervous system such as after a stroke, the brain needs to compensate for this by reorganising itself. To do this, a dense network of molecules between the nerve cells   known as the extracellular matrix   must loosen. This is the job of a wide variety of enzymes that ultimately regulate how plastic or how stable the brain is. Researchers at the University of G ttingen studied what happens when certain enzymes are blocked in mice. Depending on whether the brain is healthy or diseased, the inhibition had opposite effects. The results were published in the Journal of Neuroscience.Learning and recovery from injuries depend on the plasticity of neuronal connections. Important for this are the macromolecules of the extracellular matrix, which are located between the nerve cells. When we grow up, the ""stability"" of this extracellular matrix increases, providing a scaffold for stabilising existing connections between the nerve cells, and consolidating what we have learned. If we experience something new, the extracellular matrix must be loosened to allow new connections to form. This relationship between stability and plasticity in the brain is regulated in the matrix with the help of enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which can  digest  the extracellular matrix and thus ""loosen"" it. A team from the University of G ttingen has now been able to show in a new study that blocking the matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9 can have opposing effects depending on whether the brain is sick or healthy.To measure neuronal plasticity, the scientists let adult mice see only through one eye for several days and recorded the resulting activity changes in the animals' visual cortex. In a first experiment, they examined the adaptability of the visual cortex of healthy mice in which the enzymes MMP2 and MMP9 were blocked (with SB3CT). As a result, neuronal plasticity was also blocked. In a second experiment, the team researched mice immediately after a stroke. It was already known that a stroke leads to a strong short-term increase in MMPs. In this case, the targeted, short-term inhibition of the enzymes MMP2 and MMP9 produced the opposite effect: the plasticity that had been greatly reduced by the stroke was restored, so blocking the enzymes MMP2 and MMP9 had a clear therapeutic effect.""What made the design of our study different from many previous studies, is that the 'matrix-degrading' enzymes were blocked only after the experimental stroke, which simulates treatment,"" says Professor Siegrid L wel from the Department of Systems Neuroscience at G ttingen University. ""We also show that the MMPs in the brain have to be very well monitored and precisely adjusted. Too low a level in the healthy brain prevents neuronal plasticity and too high a level   as after a stroke   also blocks neuronal plasticity."" Reference: Brietzke S, Meyer ML.

We ve identified a number of biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer and potentially in a number of other disease states that are cargo in these supermeres,  said the paper s senior author, Robert Coffey, MD.  What is left to do now is to figure out how these things get released. Coffey, the Ingram Professor of Cancer Research and professor of Medicine and Cell & Developmental Biology, is internationally known for his studies of colorectal cancer. His team is currently exploring whether the detection and targeting of cancer-specific nanoparticles in the bloodstream could lead to earlier diagnoses and more effective treatment. In 2019 Dennis Jeppesen, PhD, a former research fellow in Coffey s lab who is now a research instructor in Medicine, used advanced techniques to isolate and analyze small membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles called  exosomes.  That year, using high-speed ultracentrifugation, another of Coffey s colleagues, Qin Zhang, PhD, research assistant professor of Medicine, devised a simple method to isolate a nanoparticle called an  exomere  that lacks a surface coat.In the current study, Zhang took the  supernatant,  or fluid that remains after the exomeres have been spun into a  pellet,  and spun the fluid faster and longer. The result was a pellet of nanoparticles isolated from the supernatant of the exomere spin which the researchers named supermeres.  They re also super-interesting,  Coffey quipped,  because they contain many cargo previously thought to be in exosomes. For one thing, supermeres carry most of the extracellular RNA released by cells and which is found in the bloodstream. Among other functional properties, cancer-derived supermeres can  transfer  drug resistance to tumor cells, perhaps via the RNA cargo they deliver, the researchers reported.Supermeres are important carriers of TGFBI, a protein that in established tumors promotes tumor progression. TGFBI thus may be a useful marker in liquid biopsies for patients with colorectal cancer, the researchers noted.They also carry ACE2, a cell-surface receptor that plays a role in cardiovascular disease and is the target of the COVID-19 virus. This raises the possibility that ACE2 carried by supermeres could serve as a  decoy  to bind the virus and prevent infection.Another potentially important cargo is APP, the amyloid-beta precursor protein implicated in the development of Alzheimer s disease. Supermeres can cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that their analysis could improve early diagnosis or possibly even targeted treatment of the disease. The identification of this rich plethora of bioactive molecules   raises interesting questions about the function of supermeres, and heightens interest in the potential of these particles as biomarkers for diseases,  researchers at the University of Notre Dame noted in a review published with the paper.Reference: Zhang Q, Jeppesen DK, Higginbotham JN, et al.

Yet, its application to living cells is fundamentally limited by the very rapid and unceasing movement of molecules that define its living state. What is more, the interaction of light with fluorescent probes that enables the observation of molecular processes causes their very destruction. Ultrarapid cryo-arrest of cells during live observation on a microscope, as developed in the Department of Systemic Cell Biology at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology in Dortmund, now circumvents these fundamental problems. The heart of the approach is the cooling of living cells with enormous speeds up to 200,000  C per second to -196  C. This enables an unprecedented preservation of cellular biomolecules in their natural arrangement at the moment of arrest. In this low temperature state, molecular movement and light-induced destruction is stopped, enabling the observation of molecular patterns of life that are otherwise invisible.The almost 100 trillion cells of our body are alive because they maintain themselves in a permanently active state by continuous energy consumption. The microscopic patterns that constitute a cell thereby originate from the ever-dynamic behavior of billions of nanometer-sized biomolecules, like proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and other molecules, that bustle around in a seemingly unorganized way. To observe how higher scale organization emerges from this incessant activity, biomolecular species can be selectively equipped with fluorescent probes. These fluorescent molecules are photon catalysts: they absorb high energy photons (e.g. blue light) and subsequently emit lower energy (red-shifted) photons. These photons can be imaged through a microscope to not only precisely localize the labeled biomolecules, but also report on local molecular reactions. However, light-induced destruction of the probes and blurring through the very vital molecular motion are two fundamental problems that hamper observations of how the molecular processes of life generate structure at the cellular scale.

According to findings reported in Nature Cancer in December, the cells remain quiet by secreting a type of collagen, called type III collagen, in the environment around themselves, and only turn malignant once the level of collagen tapers off. The researchers found that by enriching the environment around the cells with this collagen, they could force the cells to remain in a dormant state and prevent tumor recurrence. Our findings have potential clinical implications and may lead to a novel biomarker to predict tumor recurrences, as well as a therapeutic intervention to reduce local and distant relapses,  said senior author Jose Javier Bravo-Cordero, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology) at The Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai.  This intervention aimed at preventing the awakening of dormant cells has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to prevent metastatic outgrowth. As the biology of tumor dormancy gets uncovered and new specific drugs are developed, a combination of dormancy-inducing treatments with therapies that specifically target dormant cells will ultimately prevent local recurrence and metastasis and pave the way to cancer remission. Most cancer deaths are due to metastases, which can occur several years after a tumor is removed. Previous research has studied how dispersed tumor cells come out of dormancy; this new work showed how the cells remain dormant.The study used high-resolution imaging techniques, including intravital two-photon microscopy, a technology that allows the visualization of dormant cells in their environment in real time in a living animal. This technology allowed the researchers to track dormant tumor cells in mouse models using breast and head and neck cancer cell lines. By using this technology, the researchers were able to visualize the changes in the architecture of the extracellular matrix as tumor cells became dormant and how it changed when these cells awoke.In patient samples, the researchers showed that an abundance of the collagen could be used as a potential measurement to predict tumor recurrence and metastasis. In the mouse models, when scientists increased the amount of type III collagen around cancer cells that had left a tumor, cancer progression was interrupted and the disseminated cells were forced into a dormant state. Similar to wound treatment, in which collagen scaffolds have been proposed as a therapeutic alternative for complex skin wounds, this study suggest that by using strategies that aim to enrich the tumor microenvironment in type III collagen, metastasis may be prevented by activating tumor cell dormancy.Funding was provided by the National Cancer Institute, The Tisch Cancer Institute, and the Susan G. Komen Foundation.Reference: Di Martino JS, Nobre AR, Mondal C, et al. A tumor-derived type III collagen-rich ECM niche regulates tumor cell dormancy.

The research is published in leading soil science journal Geoderma . PhD student and lead author of the study Ruby Hume, developed this method as part of a Department of Primary Industries and Regions (PIRSA)-led and Grains Research and Development Corporation-funded project, exploring novel approaches to address the issue of sub-surface soil acidification in South Australia s cropping regions.  Soil acidity can be very damaging to crop production. Approximately 20 per cent of agricultural land in South Australia is affected by the problem, and this number is expected to double over the next few decades,  said Ms Hume.  While it is not a new problem in South Australia, we are now seeing acidity in regions where it has not been an issue previously, such as in the Mid-North and the Yorke Peninsula, and clay-rich soils in the South East.  Another big issue the researchers say is the development of acid layers below the soil surface, which are difficult to detect and treat. Lime (calcium carbonate) is typically applied on farms to treat soil acidity. To maximise its effectiveness, it is important to understand how the lime dissolves and moves through the soils. The new method to detect and measure carbonate in soils uses Mid Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. MIR spectroscopy is a relatively well-established tool in soil chemistry that measures the vibrations of molecular bonds within the soil when infrared light is shined on a sample.  With this technology we were able to detect very small amounts of lime that might get lost amongst the other information that is contained in the soil,  said Ms Hume.  It is a valuable tool as it is accurate, inexpensive and requires minimal sample preparation.  The next stages of this research involve applying the method to a number of field trials that have been established by Grain Research and Development Corporation s Acid Soils SA team . These trials which will be conducted with local farmers across multiple sites in South Australia will involve different liming treatments and incorporation methods that may improve the way farmers manage their soils in the future. Co-author and Principal PhD Supervisor Associate Professor Luke Mosley from the University of Adelaide s Environment Institute and School of Biological Sciences said:  We hope that we will be able to detect lime products through the soil profile and measure if and how these products are moving through the soil and treating the acidity effectivity.  The method is also potentially useful for soil carbon storage projects, which are increasingly being implemented in Australia and globally as a way to help mitigate climate change.  In future research Ms Hume plans to look at plant spectral responses to acidity and liming, and has been awarded an Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (APPF) postgraduate internship to explore this with a potted trial at the APPF s Smart House facility, beginning next year.ReferenceHume R et al.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/why-is-asthma-linked-to-a-lower-risk-of-brain-tumors-356782,Why Is Asthma Linked to a Lower Risk of Brain Tumors  People with asthma seem to be less likely to develop brain tumors than others  Researchers now believe they have discovered why  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. There s not much good that can be said about asthma, a breathing disease in which the airways become narrowed and inflamed. But there s this: People with asthma seem to be less likely to develop brain tumors than others. And now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis believe they have discovered why.It comes down to the behavior of T cells, a type of immune cell. When a person   or a mouse   develops asthma, their T cells become activated. In a new mouse study, researchers discovered that asthma causes the T cells to behave in a way that induces lung inflammation but prevents the growth of brain tumors. What s bad news for the airways may be good news for the brain.The findings, available online in Nature Communications, suggest that reprogramming T cells in brain tumor patients to act more like T cells in asthma patients could be a new approach to treating brain tumors. Of course, we re not going to start inducing asthma in anyone; asthma can be a lethal disease,  said senior author David H. Gutmann, MD, PhD, the Donald O. Schnuck Family Professor of Neurology.  But what if we could trick the T cells into thinking they re asthma T cells when they enter the brain, so they no longer support brain tumor formation and growth? These findings open the door to new kinds of therapies targeting T cells and their interactions with cells in the brain. The idea that people with inflammatory diseases, such as asthma or eczema, are less prone to developing brain tumors was first proposed more than 15 years ago, based on epidemiologic observations. But there was no obvious reason why the two very different kinds of diseases would be linked, and some scientists questioned whether the association was real.Gutmann is an expert on neurofibromatosis (NF), a set of complex genetic disorders that cause tumors to grow on nerves in the brain and throughout the body. Children with NF type 1 (NF1) can develop a kind of brain tumor known as an optic pathway glioma. These tumors grow within the optic nerves, which carries messages between the eyes and the brain. Gutmann, director of the Washington University NF Center, noted an inverse association between asthma and brain tumors among his patients more than five years ago but didn t know what to make of it. It wasn t until more recent studies from his lab began to reveal the crucial role that immune cells play in the development of optic pathway gliomas that he began to wonder whether immune cells could account for the association between asthma and brain tumors.Jit Chatterjee, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher and the paper s first author, took on the challenge of investigating the association. Working with co-author Michael J. Holtzman, MD, the Selma and Herman Seldin Professor of Medicine and director of the Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Chatterjee studied mice genetically modified to carry a mutation in their NF1 genes and form optic pathway gliomas by 3 months of age.Chatterjee exposed groups of mice to irritants that induce asthma at age 4 weeks to 6 weeks, and treated a control group with saltwater for comparison. Then, he checked for optic pathway gliomas at 3 months and 6 months of age. The mice with asthma did not form these brain tumors.Further experiments revealed that inducing asthma in tumor-prone mice changes the behavior of their T cells. After the mice developed asthma, their T cells began secreting a protein called decorin that is well-known to asthma researchers.In the airways, decorin is a problem. It acts on the tissues that line the airways and exacerbates asthma symptoms. But in the brain, Chatterjee and Gutmann discovered, decorin is beneficial. There, the protein acts on immune cells known as microglia and blocks their activation by interfering with the NFkappaB activation pathway. Activated microglia promote the growth and development of brain tumors.Treatment with either decorin or caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a compound that inhibits the NFkappaB activation pathway, protected mice with NF1 mutations from developing optic pathway gliomas. The findings suggest that blocking microglial activation may be a potentially useful therapeutic approach for brain tumors. The most exciting part of this is that it shows that there is a normal communication between T cells in the body and the cells in the brain that support optic pathway glioma formation and growth,  said Gutmann, who is also a professor of genetics, of neurosurgery and of pediatrics.  The next step for us is to see whether this is also true for other kinds of brain tumors. We re also investigating the role of eczema and early-childhood infections, because they both involve T cells. As we understand this communication between T cells and the cells that promote brain tumors better, we ll start finding more opportunities to develop clever therapeutics to intervene in the process.

It is the first thorough investigation of human interneuron development and has clarified important similarities and differences between human and mouse brain development.Understanding the mechanisms that control the generation of human cortical GABAergic interneurons has important implications for human health. Neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and schizophrenia are caused, at least in part, by genetic variation, as genetic changes result in increased susceptibility to these disorders by affecting how specific cell types develop.The investigators used [single cell RNA sequencing] to delineate the emergence of cell diversity in the ganglionic eminences   the region of origin of GABAergic interneurons. In doing so, they discovered remarkable consistency between the early developmental processes in the brains of mice and humans.The sequencing allowed Professor Oscar Marin of King s IoPPN and his colleagues to construct spatial and temporal maps of gene expression through the early second trimester of human development (equivalent to weeks 9-18 of the gestational period).The organisation and cellular architecture of the telencephalon, the largest and most developed part of the brain, is broadly conserved between mammals although both its size and complexity vary enormously between rodents and primates. Previous analyses have shown that the cells making up the cerebral cortex are relatively similar between mice and humans. However, extensive differences exist in the relative proportions, tissue distribution, and gene expression patterns of specific types of interneurons in the adult brains of mice and humans.Professor Marin, Head of Department of Developmental Neurobiology at King s IoPPN said,  Understanding the fundamental mechanisms controlling the development of the human brain is terribly exciting and will have an important impact in the way we think about neurodevelopmental disorders. This work elucidates the emergence of human GABAergic neurons and defines the commonalities and differences between us and rodents. Importantly, our work enables new levels of understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders. Many of these disorders have overlapping genetics and phenotypes and changes in striatal and cortical GABAergic neurons have been robustly documented in both autism and schizophrenia. The researchers now hope that this work will enable other research to link gene variation and cell types in neurodevelopmental disorders, resulting in new insights and new avenues for individualised therapies.Reference: Shi Y, Wang M, Mi D, et al.

In a new study, she and her colleagues found that intranasal vaccination provides broad-based protection against heterologous respiratory viruses in mice, while so-called systemic immunization, which uses an injection to elicit body-wide protection, did not.Their findings are published Dec. 10 in the journal Science Immunology. The best immune defense happens at the gate, guarding against viruses trying to enter,  said Iwasaki, senior author of the study.Mucous membranes contain their own immune defense system that combat air- or foodborne pathogens. When challenged, these barrier tissues produce B cells which in turn secrete immunoglobin A (IgA) antibodies. Unlike vaccines which elicit a system-wide immune response, IgA antibodies work locally on mucosal surfaces found in the nose, stomach, and lungs.While the protective role of IgA-producing cells had been well established in combatting intestinal pathogens, Iwasaki s lab wondered if triggering IgA response might also produce a localized immune response against respiratory viruses.Working with researchers at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, they tested a protein-based vaccine designed to jump start an IgA immune response, administering it to mice through injections, as is commonly done with systemic immunizations, and also intranasally. They then exposed mice to multiple strains of influenza viruses. They found that mice which had received vaccine intranasally were much better protected against the respiratory influenza than those that received injections. Nasal vaccines, but not the shot, also induced antibodies that protected the animals against a variety of flu strains, not just against the strain the vaccine was meant to protect against.The Yale team is currently testing nasal vaccine strains against COVID strains in animal models.While both vaccine injections and nasal vaccines increased levels of antibodies in the blood of mice, only the nasal vaccine enabled IgA secretion into the lungs, where respiratory viruses need to lodge to infect the host, Iwasaki said.If the nasal vaccines prove to be safe and efficient in humans, Iwasaki envisions them being used in conjunction with current vaccines and boosters that work system wide in order to add immune system reinforcements at the source of infection.Reference: Oh JE, Song E, Moriyama M, et al.

To determine how aggressive someone's cancer is, doctors look for abnormalities in slices of biopsied tissue on a slide. But this 2D method makes it hard to properly diagnose borderline cases.Now a team led by the University of Washington has developed a new, non-destructive method that images entire 3D biopsies instead of just a slice. In a proof-of-principle experiment, the researchers imaged 300 3D biopsies taken from 50 patients   six biopsies per patient   and had a computer use 3D and 2D results to predict the likelihood that a patient had aggressive cancer. The 3D features made it easier for the computer to identify the cases that were more likely to recur within five years.The team published these results Dec. 1 in Cancer Research.""We show for the first time that compared to traditional pathology   where a small fraction of each biopsy is examined in 2D on microscope slides   the ability to examine 100% of a biopsy in 3D is more informative and accurate,"" said senior author Jonathan Liu, a UW professor of mechanical engineering and of bioengineering. ""This is exciting because it is the first of hopefully many clinical studies that will demonstrate the value of non-destructive 3D pathology for clinical decision-making, such as determining which patients require aggressive treatments or which subsets of patients would respond best to certain drugs.""The researchers used prostate specimens from patients who underwent surgery more than 10 years ago, so the team knew each patient's outcome and could use that information to train a computer to predict those outcomes. In this study, half of the samples contained a more aggressive cancer.To create 3D samples, the researchers extracted  biopsy cores    cylindrically shaped plugs of tissue   from surgically removed prostates and then stained the biopsy cores to mimic the typical staining used in the 2D method. Then the team imaged each entire biopsy core using an open-top light-sheet microscope, which uses a sheet of light to optically  slice  through and image a tissue sample without destroying it.The 3D images provided more information than a 2D image   specifically, details about the complex tree-like structure of the glands throughout the tissue. These additional features increased the likelihood that the computer would correctly predict a cancer's aggressiveness.  The researchers used new AI methods, including deep-learning image transformation techniques, to help manage and interpret the large datasets this project generated.""Over the past decade or so, our lab has focused primarily on building optical imaging devices, including microscopes, for various clinical applications. However, we started to encounter the next big challenge toward clinical adoption: how to manage and interpret the massive datasets that we were acquiring from patient specimens,"" Liu said. ""This paper represents the first study in our lab to develop a novel computational pipeline to analyze our feature-rich datasets. As we continue to refine our imaging technologies and computational analysis methods, and as we perform larger clinical studies, we hope we can help transform the field of pathology to benefit many types of patients.""Reference: Xie W, Reder NP, Koyuncu CF, et al.

First developed in 2019, prime editing is a precise method of making a wide diversity of gene edits in human cells, including small substitutions, insertions, and deletions.In a study published today in Nature Biotechnology, the team describes twin prime editing (twinPE), a technique that makes two adjacent prime edits to introduce larger sequences of DNA at specific locations in the genome with few unwanted byproducts. With further development, the technology could potentially be used as a new form of gene therapy to insert therapeutic genes in a safe and highly targeted manner to replace mutated or missing genes.The researchers demonstrated the therapeutic potential of twinPE by editing, in human cells, a gene linked to Hunter syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. This disease is caused by an inversion of a specific 40,000 base pair long stretch of DNA. The team used twinPE to introduce an inversion of a similar length at the same site in the genome, showing how the method could be used to correct the disease-causing mutation. The team also used twin PE to precisely insert gene-sized DNA cargo of thousands of base pairs into therapeutically relevant sites in the genome.The approach addresses a limitation of the original prime editing system, which can edit only several dozen base pairs. However, the study or treatment of some genetic diseases could require larger edits. Like the original prime editing method, twinPE also does not completely sever the DNA double helix by cutting both strands simultaneously at the same location, which can induce poorly controlled editing outcomes and harmful chromosomal abnormalities. Inserting a healthy gene in a patient at a site of our choosing without generating double-strand breaks and mixtures of byproducts has been one of the longstanding challenges in gene editing,  said David Liu, senior author of the study, Richard Merkin Professor and director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies in Healthcare at the Broad Institute, professor at Harvard University, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. TwinPE could be a potentially safer and more precise way to insert whole genes of therapeutic interest into positions we specify, such as the location of the native gene in healthy individuals or  safe harbor  sites thought to minimize the risk of side-effects.  Prime editing, developed by Liu s lab, enables DNA substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and promises to correct the majority of known disease-causing genetic variations. Recent improvements to prime editing technology increased its efficiency, edging it closer to therapeutic applications. But editing sequences longer than 100 base pairs remained inefficient. Twin prime editing fills this gap. The system uses a prime editor protein and two prime editing guide RNAs, which guide the editing machinery and encode the edits. Each of the two guide RNAs direct the editing protein to make a single-stranded nick in the DNA at different targeted sites in the genome, avoiding the kind of double-strand break that creates unwanted byproducts in other methods. The system then synthesizes two new complementary DNA strands containing the desired sequence in between the two nicks. Using this approach, the team was able to insert, substitute, or delete sequences up to about 800 base pairs long.To edit even larger sequences, the researchers used their twin prime editing system to install  landing sites  in the genome for enzymes called site-specific recombinases, which catalyze the integration of DNA at specific sites in the genome. The team then treated the cells with a recombinase enzyme and introduced the long pieces of DNA they wanted to insert into the genome. Combining twinPE and recombinase enzymes allowed the scientists to edit sequences thousands of base pairs long   the length of entire genes.Liu and his team are now testing different recombinases that might make twinPE more efficient. They are also assessing twinPE s ability to install even longer genetic sequences. It s been a longstanding aspiration of many labs including ours to be able to advance gene therapy in the way that scientists have advanced gene editing over the past several years,  Liu said.  This study, together with other efforts of other scientists, could mark the beginnings of a new generation of gene therapy strategies, just as CRISPR nucleases, base editors, and prime editors represented the beginnings of a new generation of gene editing technologies.

We all know that exercise is good for us, but it also helps to prevent specific diseases. For example, it improves the ability of our muscles to absorb sugar from the blood following a meal,  said senior co-author Professor David James, ARC Laureate and Leonard P. Ullmann Chair of Metabolic Systems Biology at the Charles Perkins Centre and the University s Faculty of Medicine and Health and Faculty of Science. When this process fails, it is called  prediabetes    a risk factor for many diseases including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancers. Researchers don t know what causes prediabetes, but if they did, they could design drugs to treat this condition before it triggers disease. Opening protein  doors  Sugar absorption by muscle is carried out by a collection of molecular machines called proteins.This process begins with the binding of the small protein insulin to other proteins   receptors   on the surface of fat and muscle cells. This triggers a cascade of thousands of protein signals inside the cell   a process termed  phosphorylation . Ultimately these phosphorylation signals open protein  doors , bringing sugar into the cells.Currently we know that in prediabetes many of these signals are defective, but we don t know which ones are most important to fix.Elise Needham, PhD candidate at the University of Sydney and lead author of the study, said a key challenge has been in the complexity of phosphorylation.  Exercise involves thousands of changes to phosphorylation signals, and we do not know which are the most important for regulating the beneficial effects of exercise,  said Ms Needham. To tackle this challenge, we developed a method called  personalised phosphoproteomics . Using this approach, the team uncovered a new mechanism by which human muscle cells coordinate the response to exercise and insulin. Differences between individuals means that there is considerable biological variation in phosphorylation   like a molecular  fingerprint ,  said senior co-author Dr. Sean Humphrey, at the Charles Perkins Centre. This reduces the likelihood of identifying the most important responses. Instead of viewing this as an obstacle, we used it to our advantage .The researchers also believe the technology can help identify other important molecular switches. For example, in the future, personalised phosphoproteomics will enable the comparison of diseased cells with healthy cells, helping to uncover the causes of complex disease.Reference: Needham EJ, Hingst JR, Parker BL, et al.

A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. The findings are significant because the production of hydrogen is important for  many aspects of our life, such as fuel cells for cars and the manufacture of many useful chemicals such as ammonia,  said the OSU College of Engineering s Zhenxing Feng, a chemical engineering professor who led the research.  It s also used in the refining of metals, for producing man-made materials such as plastics and for a range of other purposes.  Producing hydrogen by splitting water via an electrochemical catalytic process is cleaner and more sustainable than the conventional method of deriving hydrogen from natural gas via a carbon-dioxide-producing process known as methane-steam reforming, Feng said. But the cost of the greener technique has been a barrier in the marketplace. The new findings, which describe ways to design catalysts that can greatly improve the efficiency of the clean hydrogen production process, were published in Science Advances and JACS Au. In facilitating reaction processes, catalysts often experience structural changes, Feng said. Sometimes the changes are reversible, other times irreversible, and irreversible restructuring is believed to degrade a catalyst s stability, leading to a loss of catalytic activity that lowers reaction efficiency. Feng, OSU Ph.D. student Maoyu Wang and collaborators studied the restructuring of catalysts in reaction and then manipulated their surface structure and composition at the atomic scale to achieve a highly efficient catalytic process for producing hydrogen. An active phase of a catalyst based on amorphous iridium hydroxide exhibited efficiency 150 times that of its original perovskite structure and close to three orders of magnitude better than the common commercial catalyst, iridium oxide. We found at least two groups of materials that undergo irreversible changes that turned out to be significantly better catalysts for hydrogen production,  Feng said.  This can help us produce hydrogen at $2 per kilogram and eventually $1 per kilogram. That s less expensive than the polluting process in current industries and will help achieve the United States  goal of zero emissions by 2030.  Feng notes that the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office has established benchmarks of technologies that can produce clean hydrogen at $2 per kilogram by 2025 and $1 per kilogram by 2030 as part of the Hydrogen Energy Earthshot target of cutting the cost of clean hydrogen by 80%, from $5 to $1 per kilogram, in one decade. The water electrolysis technology for clean hydrogen production that Feng s group is focused on uses electricity from renewable sources to split water to make clean hydrogen. However, the efficiency of water splitting is low, he said, mainly due to the high overpotential   the difference between the actual potential and the theoretical potential of an electrochemical reaction   of one key half-reaction in the process, the oxygen evolution reaction or OER. Catalysts are critical to promoting the water-splitting reaction by lowering the overpotential, and thus lowering the total cost for hydrogen production,  Feng said.  Our first study in JACS Au laid the foundation for us, and as demonstrated in our Science Advances article we now can better manipulate atoms on surface to design catalysts with the desired structure and composition.

While mostly found in tropical and subtropical regions, the parasite has recently been identified in Texas, Alabama, and the Appalachian Mountains region in the eastern and northeastern U.S. and caused reported deaths in 36 of 50 states over the years. Mortality from complications with hyperinfection is up to 87% of reported cases, according to a 2020 modeling study. Parasitic nematodes that infect humans, animals, and plants are an enormous health and economic burden on society. We think the pathway we discovered could serve as a universal target for all parasitic nematode species,  said Howard Hughes Medical Center Investigator David Mangelsdorf, Ph.D., Chair of Pharmacology at UT Southwestern.  This strategy could potentially offer a cure for the millions of people around the world who have strongyloidiasis   the disease caused by Strongyloides stercoralis  and points to a new way to fight many other parasitic nematode diseases. Researchers studying gerbils initially found that administering dafachronic acid in drinking water for two weeks reduced fecal S. stercoralis larval output by 90%. In animals that became hyperinfected, which dramatically increases mortality, treatment with ivermectin or dafachronic acid alone increased survival to about 25% and 70%, respectively. But when combined, survival climbed to about 85% and S. stercoralis infection ended, representing a potential cure, said co-author Steven A. Kliewer, Ph.D., Professor of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology at UT Southwestern.The two run the joint Mangelsdorf/Kliewer lab at UT Southwestern studying signal transduction pathways that offer new therapeutic potential for treating diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, and parasitism. The Mangelsdorf/Kliewer lab discovered the existence of a nuclear receptor pathway in parasitic nematodes and has shown that pharmacophores that target this pathway may represent a new class of anthelmintic agents.In this study published online in eLife, researchers targeted Strongyloides stercoralis, which can lead to a severe and potentially deadly hyperinfection syndrome for people who are immunocompromised, such as those taking glucocorticoids, a common steroid used to treat other medical conditions. Glucocorticoids were one of the first treatments used for severe COVID-19. WHO raised the concern that using steroids in countries where S. stercoralis is prevalent could set off a fatal hyperinfection in patients with chronic, subclinical strongyloidiasis. That possibility has elevated the urgency for finding new ways to treat the disease,  said Dr. Mangelsdorf, one of 25 members of the National Academy of Sciences at UT Southwestern.Drs. Mangelsdorf, Kliewer and colleagues looked for vulnerabilities in the larval stage of S. stercoralis  life cycle. By purifying extracts of S. stercoralis, the team discovered that the parasite synthesizes the hormone dafachronic acid, which acts by binding to a receptor called DAF-12. Further research identified the enzymatic pathway that S. stercoralis uses to generate the hormone and showed that the DAF-12 receptor acts as an on-off switch controlling larval development based on the availability of dafachronic acid. Importantly, when the hormone is present at the wrong time, the parasite is unable to develop into the infectious form and dies.Pure dafachronic acid in its present form may be unsuitable for treating humans because of its short half-life in the body, said Dr. Kliewer, also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. However, if chemistry techniques can be used to alter its structure, it could lead to a useful drug. Because all parasitic nematodes have a similar stage in their life cycles, he added, targeting this hormone and other points along the dafachronic acid pathway could eventually be used to treat diseases caused by other parasitic worms.Reference: Wang Z, Cheong MC, Tsien J, et al.

Indeed, a large quantity of lipids enables more gas to be produced: this is known as the methane potential, however too large a quantity can also inhibit the process. Organic waste is often very heterogeneous and of different origins (e.g., agriculture, food industry and canteens), which is why it needs to be characterised before being recovered. Currently, the lipid content of waste is measured by the Soxhlet method, which is based on a chemical extraction coupled with a separation of the different constituents of the waste in order to analyse them. However, this method is long, taking several hours per sample, and requires a highly polluting petroleum-based chemical solvent.INRAE researchers took an interest in applying NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), a non-invasive and non-destructive analysis technique where molecules in a sample, placed in a magnetic field and excited by a radiofrequency, emit a signal that allows them to be identified and quantified. NMR is already widely employed in the pharmaceutical and food industries, but until now has been little used to analyse waste. The research team focused on low-field NMR, which is less expensive and uses smaller, portable equipment. The researchers analysed 48 organic waste samples of different origins (for example agricultural waste, green waste, waste from collective catering facilities and private individuals). They used NMR coupled with chemometrics, a mathematical method that allows extracting as much information as possible from the emitted signal. These results were then compared with those obtained with the Soxhlet method. The study shows that NMR analysis coupled with chemometrics is highly predictive of the lipid content of organic waste. Not only does it avoid the need for a lengthy calibration procedure beforehand, but it is more accurate and has a better repeatability than the Soxhlet method. Above all, NMR analysis is much faster (less than one minute per sample) and environmentally friendly compared to the Soxhlet method. The scientists are now looking to improve the process, in particular by eliminating the waste drying step, in order to have an analysis technique that is transportable and directly applicable at anaerobic digestion sites.Reference: Picard S, Cambert M, Roger JM, et al.

New research from the University of Florida suggests that baby talk can have another, previously unknown benefit: helping babies learn to produce their own speech. By mimicking the sound of a smaller vocal tract, the researchers think, we're cluing babies in to how the words should sound coming out of their own mouths. ""It seems to stimulate motor production of speech, not just the perception of speech,"" said Matthew Masapollo, Ph.D., an assistant professor in UF's Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences and director of the UF Laboratory for the Study of Cognition, Action, and Perception of Speech in the College of Public Health and Health Professions. ""It's not just goo-goo ga-ga.""In the study, the researchers changed the frequency of sounds to mimic either an infant or adult vocal tract, then tested how infants reacted. Six- to eight-month-old babies  displayed a robust and distinct preference for speech with resonances specifying a vocal tract that is similar in size and length to their own,  they wrote.  Four- to six-month old babies didn t have that preference, suggesting that older babies  dawning ability to control their voices and make words out of babble could be what makes the infant-like sounds more appealing.Though baby talk may sound simple, it's accomplishing a lot, says coauthor Linda Polka, Ph.D., of McGill University.""We're trying to engage with the infant to show them something about speech production,"" she said. ""We're priming them to process their own voice.""While parents are sometimes discouraged from engaging in baby talk, Masapollo and Polka s research shows the patterns associated with that speaking style   which scientists call  infant-directed speech    could be a key component in helping babies make words.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

In particular, these platforms can include the cells of a patient, thus resulting in patient-specific discovery.As an example, even though sickle cell disease was first described in the early 1900s, the range of severity in the disease causes challenges when trying to treat patients. Since this disease is most prevalent among economically poor and underrepresented minorities, there has been a general lack of stimulus to discover new treatment strategies due to socioeconomic inequity, making it one of the most serious orphan conditions globally.Tanmay Mathur, doctoral student in Dr. Abhishek Jain s lab in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&M University, is developing personalized blood vessels to improve knowledge and derive treatments against the vascular dysfunction seen in sickle cell disease and other rare diseases of the blood and vessels.Current cells used in blood vessel models use induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), which are derived from a patient s endothelial cells. However, Mathur said these cells have limitations   they expire quickly and can t be stored for long periods of time.Mathur s research offers an alternative   blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs), which can be isolated from a patient s blood. All that is needed is 50 to 100 milliliters of blood. The equipment and the reagents involved are also very cheap and available in most clinical settings,  Mathur said.  These cells are progenitor endothelial cells, meaning they have high proliferation, so if you keep giving them the food they want, within a month, we will have enough cells so that we can successfully keep on subculturing them forever. However, the question is do BOECs work like IPSCs in the context of organ-on-chips, a microdevice that allows researchers to create these blood vessel models. That s a question Mathur recently answered in a paper published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. By combining the analytics of our vessel-chip with next-generation RNA sequencing, I was able to show that BOECs do not differ in any statistical way compared to the other cells,  Mathur said.  Not only can you do patient-specific studies with BOECs, you can also use these cells as alternatives to existing cells, because at the end of the day they are still primarily human cells. If there is a way for you to get patient-derived cells with the least effort possible, that's always the best way to move forward. Mathur s next step is to begin testing a larger cohort of blood samples with sickle cell disease and bring computation into the project through machine learning and artificial intelligence. By developing a chip model that can predict variables such as clotting time, inflammation and more, the algorithm can relate each patient s history and treatment to their disease status. Say I made a model on 100 patients,  Mathur said.  If you give me the 101st patient and I run the same methodology for those cells, my algorithm should be able to predict if that patient is a severe, moderate or mild sickle cell patient. It's of importance because the clinician wants to know what is the most effective short-term and long-term treatment strategies for the patient. Tanmay s work lays a foundation for what lies in the future of tissue engineering and organ-on-chip technology and the positive impact that these platforms can make in personalized medicine,  Jain said.Developing this algorithm will help reduce the guesswork clinicians have to do in creating treatment plans. Right now, we do not know how much of a drug to give to a mild patient. That's why we overcorrect or undercorrect for complications,  Mathur said.  Every drug will have certain side reactions, which you can only minimize. The best way to minimize is to tailor your therapy for each patient. I'm trying to minimize this iteration and minimize the cost as well as maximize the success of the therapy for the patient. Reference: Mathur T, Tronolone JJ, Jain A.

Personal care and beauty products contain several ingredients that often include a wide range of endocrine-disrupting chemicals like phthalates, parabens, phenols, parabens and toxic metals. These chemicals interact with hormone systems, influencing synthesis, regulation, transport, metabolism and hormone reception, which are all especially vulnerable during pregnancy. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Institutes of Health-funded study, published in Environmental Research, examined the association between personal care product use and the levels of sex steroid hormones, including estrogens and progesterone and thyroid hormones among pregnant women. The researchers also explored how demographic factors impact the use of certain personal care products. Researchers collected blood samples from 1,070 pregnant women between 18 and 40 years of age enrolled in the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort, an ongoing prospective birth study designed to examine environmental exposures in pregnant women and their children who live in the northern karst zone of Puerto Rico. As part of the study, participants underwent physical exams and completed a series of questionnaires providing their demographics, occupation, lifestyle and use of personal care products like fragrances, lotions, cosmetics, nail polish, shaving cream, mouthwash, shampoo and other hair products, such as bleach, relaxers and mousse. Participants also provided blood samples twice throughout their pregnancies, which were analyzed for nine sex steroid and thyroid hormones. The researchers found that the use of hair products, particularly hair dyes, bleach, relaxers and mousse are associated with lower levels of sex steroid hormones, which have a critical role maintaining pregnancy and fetal development. Disruptions of these hormones may contribute to adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes like growth restriction, preterm birth and low birth weight. Alterations in hormone levels, especially during pregnancy, can have vast consequences beyond health at birth including changes in infant and child growth, pubertal trajectories and may influence development of hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast, uterine and ovarian cancer,  says the study s lead author, Zorimar Rivera-N ez, an assistant professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health.  Additional research should address the public health impact of exposure to chemicals in hair products in pregnant populations.  The researchers also found that socioeconomic variables, such as income, education and employment status, influence the use of personal care products among pregnant women in Puerto Rico. For example, participants who reported a household income greater than $100,000 use personal care products more often than participants with lower household incomes. Additionally, employed participants reported using more cosmetics than those who were unemployed. Prior research has shown that non-pregnant populations have also reported associations between frequency of use and socioeconomic markers, such as household income and education,  Rivera-N ez said.  A strong culture of beauty influences Latina women, which may impact consistent use of cosmetics through pregnancy. This data is important because it will allow us to identify populations who are at an increased risk of chemical exposures associated with personal care product use.

This phenomenon, known as intratumor heterogeneity, is steadily gaining in significance within the field of cancer research. Cellular and molecular differences within the same tumor play an important role in many different cancers due to their implications for diagnosis and the use of targeted therapies. According to a recently published study by Charit , the MDC and the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), this also applies to neuroblastoma, a malignant solid tumor of the peripheral nervous system which is relatively common in children. Neuroblastomas develop from groups of unmature nerve cells mostly in the adrenal glands or along the spine, from where they expand into the abdominal cavity.Summarizing the researchers  key findings, the study s first author, Dr. Karin Schmelz of Charit s Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, says:  In our study, we were able to show that the genetic changes typically associated with neuroblastoma can both disappear and emerge over the course of the disease. These mutations are not evenly distributed throughout the tumor; rather, they occur in distinct sections or even in individual cells, giving the tumor a mosaic-like appearance. Cancer is driven by evolutionary processes,  says Dr. Roland Schwarz, Group Leader of the MDC s Evolutionary and Cancer Genomics research group  and one of the study s last authors, Cancer cells undergo constant genetic change; they are engaged in a fight for survival, including against other cancer cells. Each cancer has its own phylogenetic tree, which depicts the way in which a tumor evolves; some cancer cells become metastatic, while others develop treatment resistance.The researchers analyzed a total of 140 neuroblastoma samples. The biopsy samples were collected from 10 pediatric patients at various points during the clinical course and covered multiple tumor regions. Sample analysis involved the use of multiple modern sequencing techniques followed by computer-assisted evaluation.The researchers focused their analysis on the neuroblastoma-associated genes ALK, MYCN and FGFR1, which play an important role in both clinical course and treatment. According to their results, changes in the ALK and MYCN genes were not present continuously throughout the course of the disease, nor were they found in all tumor cells. Changes in the ALK and FGFR1 genes can offer useful treatment targets, particularly in relapsed patients. The researchers found that, in some patients, ALK mutations which were present at the time of diagnosis had disappeared by the time the tumor was surgically removed. Furthermore, changes in the FGFR1 gene were only found in distinct tumor regions. The researchers were also able to identify an instability in the number of gene copies present in neuroblastoma cells. In some cases, cancer cell clones showed early divergence from the primary tumor, breaking away to infiltrate other organs where they formed metastases.""The process of recording detailed spatial and temporal changes in the copy numbers of specific genes is extremely complex,  explains bioinformatics expert Dr. Schwarz. Notwithstanding these challenges, his research group developed an algorithm capable of producing a precise reconstruction of these copy numbers. In 2020, Dr. Schwarz and his international colleagues used this method to produce evidence of continuous structural evolution in a range of different cancers.  We have now been able to extend this to neuroblastoma, where we were able to show in detail how the cancer genome undergoes structural changes,  says Dr. Schwarz.Last author Prof. Dr. Angelika Eggert, Head of Charit s Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, explains:  We are now in a better position to understand how neuroblastoma cells behave. This knowledge is essential in relation to patients who suffer a recurrence of their disease because their treatment often requires the use of personalized and targeted therapies. When a tumor presents as genetically heterogeneous, targeted molecular therapy may well capture a majority of the abnormal tissue but, crucially, will not capture all of the affected cells. The cancer will then be able to regrow from those remaining cells. Explaining the significance of their research in light of existing knowledge, Prof. Eggert says:  Our findings have less relevance for neuroblastoma diagnosis and therapy selection. This is because diagnosis is already reliable, thanks to technologies that have undergone decades of testing, such as imaging, urine testing and single tissue biopsies, and because chemotherapy targeting fast-growing cells remains the treatment of choice for the primary tumor. However, if the disease recurs following treatment, targeted treatment options become particularly important. Treatment selection which is based on a single tissue biopsy from a single tumor region is unlikely to adequately address the tumor s genetic heterogeneity. When a relapse occurs, we should therefore consider using state-of-the-art sequencing techniques to analyze tumor tissue samples harvested from multiple regions. This would provide us with as much detail as possible about the disease, enabling us to further improve the decision-making process pertaining to the selection of personalized therapies. The researchers are now testing other methods in the hope of resolving some of the technical challenges which remain. These include the use of single-cell-based technologies and liquid biopsies, a new type of blood test which analyzes genetic information shed by tumors into the bloodstream. Using the analysis of multiple blood samples over the course of disease, these techniques will provide evidence of any genetic changes taking place   without the need for invasive surgical biopsies. Both of these techniques and their clinical application are undergoing intensive study at Charit , the Berlin Institute of Health at Charit  (BIH) and the MDC.Reference: Schmelz K, Toedling J, Huska M, et al.

Epimutations are molecular factors and processes around DNA that regulate genome activity, independent of DNA sequence.The discovery could advance treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, said Michael Skinner, the senior author on the paper. If we can identify these patients ten years earlier before the disease develops, it opens up a whole arena of preventative medicine that we did not have access to before,  said Skinner, a professor in WSU s School of Biological Sciences.Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 200,000 people in the U.S. each year with a higher prevalence in women than in men. While current drug treatments have limited efficacy in many patients who have already developed the disease, some studies have shown that treatments begun in early stages of the disease can cause remission of symptoms.Having biomarkers could allow treatment to begin even earlier before the first signs of it start, Skinner said.For the study, researchers collected buccal, or cheek, cells using a swab from two cohorts of women: a group of 26 Caucasian women from Spokane and a group of 23 African-American women from Los Angeles. In each group, about half of the women had rheumatoid arthritis with the other half serving as a control.Even though they are taken from the cheek, buccal cells allowed the researchers to conduct an epigenome-wide analysis. Translating literally as  above  the genome, an epigenome consists of chemical factors that can modify the genome and change its behavior. While not part of DNA itself, epimutations can still be passed down to subsequent generations.In this study, the researchers found epimutations in areas called DNA methylation regions, among the women in both groups who had rheumatoid arthritis. The study was designed to see if there were differences between racial groups since African Americans have shown some signs of increased prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis. However, while some differences were noted, the researchers found a large overlap in epimutations among women with rheumatoid arthritis of both races, meaning the identified biomarkers hold a strong signal for the disease. Surprisingly, most of the DNA methylation sites we found that were consistent among patients with the disease were associated with genes previously known to be involved in rheumatoid arthritis,  said Skinner. The findings add evidence that the disease is likely systemic, Skinner said, meaning it was found not just in immune system cells involved in rheumatoid arthritis development but in many different cells throughout the body.The research team also tested an immune-related monocyte cell type in blood samples from a portion of the women, but the buccal cells showed the epimutations as well, indicating that a relatively non-invasive diagnostic cheek swab test could be developed to screen for the disease.Reference: Craig G, Kenney H, Nilsson EE, Sadler-Riggleman I, Beck D, Skinner MK.

One approach to developing vaccines for these chronic infections has until now been aimed exclusively at what are known as the memory B cells, a specific type of immune cells. Researchers at the University of Basel now report that these cells need the help of other memory cells to effectively defend the body against chronic viruses. This is an important finding in vaccine design. An arsenal of immune cells defends the body against pathogens. During a viral infection, B cells produce antibodies that match the virus and deactivate it. Some of these B cells die off following infection or vaccination. However, some B cells remain in the body as memory cells in order to produce the right antibodies more quickly if a new infection with the same pathogen occurs. Vaccines aim, among other things, to trigger the development of these memory B cells. However, viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C virus overpower the memory B cells  defenses   an obstacle in the development of efficient vaccines. In order to overcome this barrier, the research team led by Dr. Daniel Pinschewer from the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Basel is investigating the interplay between immune cells in chronic viral infections.   One problem is that due to the constant presence of the pathogen and the associated inflammation, the memory B cells go into a sort of panic,  explains Pinschewer. They abandon their routine of proliferation and maturation, and switch to antibody production mode, soon after which they perish. There may now be a remedy for this problem, as the team reports in the specialist journal PNAS. ","Published: December 13, 2021"

During transcription, the first step in gene expression, RNAPs  read  DNA sequences and assemble messenger RNA (mRNA), which in turn serves as the template for the proteins necessary for life. The team comprising lead author Purba Chatterjee , a recent Illinois Physics Ph.D. graduate, now a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania; Illinois Physics Emeritus Research Professor Nigel Goldenfeld, now the Chancellor s Distinguished Professor of Physics at University of California San Diego; and Illinois Physics Professor Sangjin Kim introduces a new theoretical model elucidating how the mechanism of supercoiling in DNA underlies the collective dynamics of RNAPs that are concurrently translocating on the DNA for transcription. The RNAPs dynamics switch from cooperative to antagonistic mode, in response to the cell s needs.These findings were published on November 16, 2021,in the article  DNA Supercoiling Drives a Transition between Collective Modes of Gene Synthesis,  in the journal Physical Review Letters.During transcription, DNA supercoiling occurs when torsional stress is introduced by the unzipping of a portion of the helix into two strands, one of which will be transcribed. The researchers  work revealed for the first time two essential elements in modeling transcription under torsion: first, transcription factors that are well known to affect the rate at which RNAP initiate transcription can also control the propagation of DNA supercoils, and second, the number of RNAPs present affects the torsional stress experienced by individual RNAPs.Goldenfeld explains, ""Supercoiling is something familiar to anyone who has wrestled with a garden hose or, in times past, a telephone cord. Semi-rigid tubes or, in this case, helices are difficult to fold and they bend into localized tangles loops that can look like figure eights or worse. Biology battles with the same geometrical issues at the DNA molecular level within living cells. Once an RNAP initiates transcription, it translocates along the strand, assembling a complementary strand of mRNA. Additional RNAPs are recruited, each RNAP initiating mRNA synthesis along the same segment of DNA. The rate of the subsequent RNAP initiations is often controlled by transcription factor, a protein that binds to the DNA site at the location where RNAP initiates transcription.Previous experimental and theoretical studies have predicted that the speed at which RNAPs translocate along the DNA during transcription increases with the number of RNAPs actively transcribing the same sequence, but in 2019, Kim, et al. observed for the first time that the speed of RNAP translocation remains high as long as RNAPs initiate transcription at a rate above a certain threshold, regardless of the total number. Surprisingly, they found that the number of RNAPs affected the speed once the promoter is turned off that is when RNAPs stop initiating transcription. In the current work, the team describes how supercoiling underlies these collective effects.The scientists modelled the biological system in which multiple RNAPs are transcribing the same segment of DNA, with RNAP translocation speed subject to torques generated by DNA supercoiling. Chatterjee explains,  Our model introduces two important factors that have not been considered before for DNA supercoiling. First, the number of RNAPs is important. The more RNAPs there are, the harder it is for individual RNAPs to twist the DNA. This is because the mass of each RNAP as well as the mass of the mRNA being synthesized by each RNAP adds to the resistance of DNA to twisting. This is similar to the real-life observation that a thick, heavy rubber band is harder to twist than a thin, light one. Second, the binding and unbinding of transcription factors at the promoter the entry point for RNAPs is also important. Transcription factors not only prevent loading of RNAPs by blocking their site of entry to the DNA, but, being bulky molecules, they also prevent the relaxation of DNA supercoils. Imagine holding an overtwisted rubber band at both ends. When you let one end go, it immediately unfurls to reduce the stress. Similarly when transcription factor unbinds, the DNA supercoils that were constrained between the transcription factor and the closest RNAP to the promoter diffuse, and the DNA segment returns to its relaxed state. This relaxation assists the last loaded RNAP in its forward motion. With these two novel considerations, the researchers found that DNA supercoiling produced by RNAP motion can drive the two contrasting modes of RNAP group dynamics. Cooperative dynamics emerge under conditions favorable to transcription, when the promoter sequence at the start of the DNA segment is  turned on.  In this mode, the mechanics of supercoiling diffusion facilitate quicker transcription across the entire system, because each RNAP cancels its nearest neighbor s DNA supercoils effectively, leading to optimal high speeds for each.Kim adds,  Notably, the mechanics of supercoiling diffusion allow for the cancellation of supercoils for all RNAP densities, and hence the cooperative dynamics can be observed as long as the RNAP densities are over a certain threshold. Chatterjee explains,  Despite the cost associated with having many RNAPs on the gene, the collective mode enhances transcription speed. This is contingent on continuous loading of RNAPs, meaning there is an active promoter that is loading RNAPs onto the gene uninterrupted. The continuous loading of RNAPs takes place when the cell wants to make as many transcripts as possible. The cooperation between RNAPs during their translocation helps to accomplish the cell s need. A switch to antagonistic dynamics, on the other hand, slows translocation for all active RNAPs now, the multiple RNAPs transcribing a gene together actually impair each other s motion and transcription is soon shut down altogether. Kim adds,  Whereas, in the cooperative mode, having a neighbor leads to better cancellation of supercoils and helps to reduce the torsional stress on an RNAP such that it can move at the optimal speed, in the antagonistic mode, having a neighbor is devastating. In this collective mode, the presence of multiple RNAPs results in greater torsional stress and greater reduction in speed. This antagonistic mode takes place when the promoter is turned off the entry is blocked by a transcription factor in response to a signal to stop making transcripts. Chatterjee sums up,  Our theoretical model supports Sangjin s experimental observation and explains the finding from the physical perspective of DNA supercoiling. Goldenfeld adds,  Our modeling and Sangjin's ingenious experiments reveal how the molecular machines known as RNA polymerase essentially communicate and work cooperatively in the processes that ultimately lead to the manufacture of proteins. This exciting project would not have been possible without deep collaboration between theoretical modeling and experiment, and shows how collective phenomena, already well understood in statistical and condensed matter physics, also underpin the most fundamental aspects of biological gene expression.""Kim looks forward to continuing this line of research in the laboratory. There are a number of exciting future experiments to do,  she says.  We want to experimentally validate the two novel features introduced in the model by visualizing DNA supercoiling and measuring the DNA resisting torques directly. Specifically, we want to test the effect of transcription factors on transcription efficiency through the blocking of DNA supercoil diffusion and measure the effect of the presence of multiple RNAPs on the restoring torque experienced by an individual RNAP.

Scientists demonstrated these real-time detection tools in plants and anticipate their use in animals, bacteria and fungi with diverse applications for biotechnology, biosecurity, bioenergy and agriculture. The team described the successful development of the UV system in Horticulture Research and their proof-of-principle demonstration in ACS Synthetic Biology.CRISPR technologies have quickly become the primary tools of bioengineering, and new versions are continually in development. Identifying whether an organism has been modified by CRISPR technology was previously a complex and time-consuming process. Before this, the only way to tell if genome engineering occurred was to do a forensic analysis,  said Paul Abraham, a bioanalytical chemist and head of ORNL s Secure Ecosystem Engineering and Design Science Focus Area.  To be successful, you would need to know what the genome looked like before it was rewritten. We wanted to design a platform where we could proactively observe CRISPR activity. The research team developed an efficient self-detect solution that takes advantage of the way CRISPR works to trigger the technology to reveal itself. Under normal conditions, CRISPR works by connecting with a short RNA sequence, known as the guide RNA, as it leads CRISPR to a matching DNA sequence. When the target DNA is found, CRISPR modifies the DNA by acting like tiny molecular scissors to cut through one or both strands of DNA, depending on the type of CRISPR technology in use.Abraham likens their method to an alarm system with two components: a biosensor guide RNA that redirects CRISPR activity and a reporter protein that flags the activity. Researchers encode the two components into an organism s DNA to enable the monitoring system.With the self-detect system in place, the biosensor guide RNA intercepts CRISPR, preventing CRISPR from connecting with its original gene target and redirecting CRISPR to a specific DNA sequence that encodes for a nonfunctioning green fluorescent protein, or GFP. When CRISPR edits the sequence, it flips a switch that produces functioning GFP, which creates a green glow signaling CRISPR s presence.Because a microscope is required to see the glow from GFP, the researchers improved on their original method by replacing GFP with a similar reporter protein, called eYGFPuv, that is visible under the type of ultraviolet light commonly known as a black light.Reference: Yuan G, Hassan MdM, Yao T, et al.

For example, Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by a mutation in a single gene, and if researchers could go into specific cells and correct that defect, theoretically those cells could regain normal function.A major challenge, however, has been creating the right ""delivery vehicles"" that can carry genes and molecules into the cells that need treatment, while avoiding the cells that do not.Now, a team led by Caltech researchers has developed a gene-delivery system that can specifically target brain cells while avoiding the liver. This is important because a gene therapy intended to treat a disorder in the brain, for example, could also have the side effect of creating a toxic immune response in the liver, hence the desire to find delivery vehicles that only go to their intended target. The findings were shown in both mouse and marmoset models, an important step towards translating the technology into humans.A paper describing the new findings appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The research was led by Viviana Gradinaru (BS '05), professor of neuroscience and biological engineering, and director of the Center for Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience.The key to this technology is the use of adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs, which have long been considered promising candidates for use as delivery vehicles. Over millions of years of evolution, viruses have evolved efficient ways to gain access into human cells, and for decades researchers have been developing methods to harness viruses' Trojan-Horse-like abilities for human benefit.AAVs are made up of two major components: an outer shell, called a capsid, that is built from proteins; and the genetic material encased inside the capsid. To use recombinant AAVs for gene therapy, researchers remove the virus's genetic material from the capsid and replace it with the desired cargo, such as a particular gene or coding information for small therapeutic molecules.""Recombinant AAVs are stripped of the ability to replicate, which leaves a powerful tool that is biologically designed to gain entrance into cells,"" says graduate student David Goertsen, a co-first author on the paper. ""We can harness that natural biology to derive specialized tools for neuroscience research and gene therapy.""The shape and composition of the capsid is a critical part of how the AAV enters into a cell. Researchers in the Gradinaru lab have been working for almost a decade on engineering AAV capsids that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and to develop methods to select for and against certain traits, resulting in viral vectors more specific to certain cell types within the brain.In the new study, the team developed BBB-crossing capsids, with one in particular  AAV.CAP-B10 that is efficient at getting into brain cells, specifically neurons, while avoiding many systemic targets, including liver cells. Importantly, both neuronal specificity and decreased liver targeting was shown to occur not just in mice, a common research animal, but also in laboratory marmosets.""With these new capsids, the research community can now test multiple gene therapy strategies in rodents and marmosets and build up evidence necessary to take such strategies to the clinic,"" says Gradinaru. ""The neuronal tropism and decreased liver targeting we were able to engineer AAV capsids for are important features that could lead to safer and more effective treatment options for brain disorders.""The development of an AAV capsid variant that works well in non-human primates is a major step towards the translation of the technology for use in humans, as previous variants of AAV capsids have been unsuccessful in non-human primates. The Gradinaru lab's systematic in vivo approach, which uses a process called directed evolution to modify AAV capsids at multiple sites has been successful in producing variants that can cross the BBBs of different strains of mice and, as shown in this study, in marmosets.""Results from this research show that introducing diversity at multiple locations on the AAV capsid surface can increase transgene expression efficiency and neuronal specificity,"" says Gradinaru. ""The power of AAV engineering to confer novel tropisms and tissue specificity, as we show for the brain versus the liver, has broadened potential research and pre-clinical applications that could enable new therapeutic approaches for diseases of the brain.""Reference: Goertsen D, Flytzanis NC, Goeden N, et al.

University of Tsukuba researchers have found that only ten minutes of moderate-intensity running increases local blood flow to the various loci in the bilateral prefrontal cortex the part of the brain that plays an important role in controlling mood and executive functions. These findings may contribute to the development of a wider range of treatment recommendations to benefit mental health.There s clear evidence that physical activity has many benefits, such as the ability to improve mood, but in previous studies, cycling was often the form of exercise studied. Running, however, has always played an important role in the well-being of humans. The unique form and efficiency of human running, which includes the ability to sustain this form of exertion (i.e., by jogging as opposed to sprinting), and the evolutionary success of humans are closely linked.Despite this fact, researchers had not yet looked closely at the effects of running on brain regions that control mood and executive functions.  Given the extent of executive control required in coordinating balance, movement, and propulsion during running, it is logical that there would be increased neuronal activation in the prefrontal cortex and that other functions in this region would benefit from this increase in brain resources,  explains Professor Hideaki Soya.To test their hypothesis, the research team used the well-established Stroop Color Word Test and captured data on hemodynamic changes associated with brain activity while participants were engaged in each task. For example, in one task, incongruent information is shown, i.e., the word red is written in green, and the participant must name the color rather than read out the word. To do so, the brain must process both sets of information and inhibit the extraneous information. The Stroop interference effect was quantified by the difference in response times for this task and those for a simpler version of the task stating the names of color swatches.The results demonstrated that, after ten minutes of moderate-intensity running, there was a significant reduction in Stroop interference effect time. Furthermore, bilateral prefrontal activation had significantly increased during the Stroop task. After running, participants reported being in a better mood.  This was supported by findings of coincident activations in the prefrontal cortical regions involved in mood regulation,  first author Chorphaka Damrongthai adds.Given that many characteristics of the human prefrontal cortex are uniquely human, this study not only sheds light on the present benefits of running but also on the possible role that these benefits may have played in the evolutionary past of humans.Reference: Damrongthai C, Kuwamizu R, Suwabe K, et al.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor Bo Li, in collaboration with CSHL Adjunct Professor Z. Josh Huang, discovered a group of neurons in the mouse brain that influences the animal s motivation to perform tasks for rewards. Dialing up the activity of these neurons makes a mouse work faster or more vigorously up to a point. These neurons have a feature that prevents the mouse from becoming addicted to the reward. The findings may point to new therapeutic strategies for treating mental illnesses like depression that affect motivation in humans. The anterior insular cortex is a region of the brain that plays a critical role in motivation. A set of neurons that activate a gene called Fezf2(Fezf2 neurons) in this area are active when mice are doing both physical and cognitive tasks. Li and his lab hypothesized that these neurons do not affect the mouse s ability to do the task; rather, the brain cells influence the mouse s motivational drive. Mice were trained to lick a water bottle spout to receive a small sugar reward. When researchers dialed up the activity of these Fezf2 neurons, mice would lick more vigorously. If the neuron activity was dialed down, the mice would lick more slowly. The researchers saw a similar result in another experiment in which the mice ran on a wheel to receive a reward. The mice ran faster if the Fezf2 neurons were stimulated. The same effect occurred with other tasks.Li and his team were surprised to discover a feature that prevents the mice from becoming addicted to the tasks and their rewards. When mice drank their fill of sugar water and were satiated, they would not lick or run faster to get more sugar, even if the researchers dialed up the activity of the Fezf2 neurons.Finding a way to fine-tune the human equivalent of these neurons might help people struggling with motivation due to mental illnesses like depression.

The findings open the door for research into earlier treatment that could help slow down the onset of the condition the most common cause of sight loss in the western world.A research team led by the University of Southampton with colleagues at King s College London and Moorfields Eye Hospital looked at the records of over 30,000 patients who had retinal scans and genetic data stored in the UK Biobank. There are 34 known genetic risk factors for age related macular degeneration (AMD) and the scientists were able to compare the retinal measurements of those with the risk factors to those without.The findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, showed that the participants with healthy eyes and no history of AMD had thinner retinas if they carried the genes that put them at risk.Andrew Lotery, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Southampton, who led the study, along with Prof Pirro Hysi at King s College London and Mr Praveen Patel at Moorfields Eye Hospital, said,  At the moment most treatments for AMD only start when patients already have severe problems with their eyesight so it is really important that we understand more about what causes it. These results help us understand the very early stages of the disease, before it is clinically apparent. If we can intervene at an earlier stage, we are more likely to be able to preserve sight. Previous research has not fully explained which cells in the eye are affected by AMD first. Further examination of the retinal scans in biobank showed that the photoreceptors, which sense light in the eyes, were also thinner for patients with the genetic risk factors. The research team advise this gives them further understanding of the early stages and will help identify which cells should be targeted in further research.Whilst further trials will still be needed to identify treatment, being able to identify the signs of AMD earlier would allow individuals to make lifestyle changes that can put them at a higher risk of losing their vision earlier. Changing to a Mediterranean style diet, exercising more and stopping smoking can help prevent he progression of the disease,  Professor Lotery added.  These findings can also help us refine participants in future clinical trials so we can include patients who are most at risk,  he added.

But now, researchers from Japan have uncovered new information that challenges previous theories about the relationship between two elements of consciousness.In a study published this month in iScience, researchers from the University of Tsukuba have revealed that when the perception of bodily self-consciousness is distorted, the recovery of body ownership can be predicted by different kinds of memories.Bodily self-consciousness arises through a developmental process in which sensory information is integrated with mental representations of the body, and it has specifically been linked to the relationship between body ownership and agency (the sense of being able to control one s actions at will). However, little is known about the development of body ownership and agency, or how these are restored after injury, something the researchers at the University of Tsukuba aimed to address. Clarifying how temporal and dynamic aspects of bodily self-consciousness change over time is crucial for understanding how it is developed,  says main author of the study Professor Jun Izawa.  Specifically, the speed of adaptive recovery in task performance can illuminate the relationship between adaptive adjustments to memory and the recovery of various aspects of bodily self-consciousness. To examine this, the researchers decreased the perception of body ownership and agency by inducing a visual distortion while participants grasped an object in a virtual reality environment. They then observed how the participants adapted their movements to the distortion over a sequence of trials, to recover their ability to perform the grasping task.  We found that the recovery of body ownership was associated with a fast memory process, whereas that of agency was mainly associated with a slow memory process,  explains Professor Izawa.Thus, while body ownership and agency were restored simultaneously following exposure to the visuomotor distortion, this recovery appears to have been based on two different systems for updating memory, with distinct time courses. Our results challenge the conventional framework that proposes that body ownership and agency exist on different hierarchical levels of self-consciousness,  says Professor Izawa.  Instead, the perception of causality and hierarchy between these two elements may be an illusion resulting from the neural processing of parallel streams of information. Previous studies have indicated that body ownership and agency are distinct, and that they may by causally related. However, this new information indicates that the relationship between these two senses may not be so simple.

For some types of cancer, these discoveries have led to the development of drugs that target specific mutations.However, there are still many types of cancer for which no such targeted therapies are available. A team of researchers from MIT, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and other institutions is now examining whether another cell trait   RNA expression patterns   influences drug responses and can be used to identify treatments a tumor might be susceptible to.In a new study of pancreatic cancer cells, the researchers identified three prototypical RNA-expression states and uncovered differences in their susceptibility to a variety of cancer drugs. They also discovered that altering the tumor microenvironment can drive tumor cells from one state to another, potentially offering a way to make them more susceptible to a particular drug. What we show in this paper is that cancer cell state is plastic in response to the microenvironment and has a dramatic impact on drug sensitivity. This opens new frontiers for thinking about drug development and how to select drugs for individual patients,  says Alex Shalek, a core member of the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) at MIT, an associate professor of chemistry, and an extramural member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. He is also a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard and an institute member of the Broad Institute.Shalek and Brian Wolpin, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; William Hahn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber; and Andrew Aguirre, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber; are the senior authors of the study, which appears today in Cell.

This is the result of a study by the Biomarkers and Nutritional Food Metabolomics Research Group of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences of the University of Barcelona (UB) and the CIBER on Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES).The paper, published in the journal Molecular Nutrition and Food Research, is led by Cristina Andr s-Lacueva, professor at the Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences and head of the Biomarkers and Nutritional Metabolomics of Food Research Group of the UB and the Biomedical Research Network Center in Frailty and Healthy Aging (CIBERFES), which is also part of the Food Innovation Network of Catalonia (XIA).This European study, part of the Joint Programming Initiative ""A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life"" (JPI HDHL), was carried out over 12 years with the participation of 842 people aged over 65 in the Bordeaux and Dijon regions (France).Metabolomics to study the impact of diet on healthThe study analyses the relationship between the metabolism of dietary components, intestinal microbiota, endogenous metabolism and cognitive impairment. As Mireia Urp -Sard , from the Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Gastronomy and CIBERFES, notes, ""what we analysed in the cohorts under study is the modulating role of the diet in the risk of suffering cognitive impairment"". Urp -Sard  points out that ""the results show a significant association between these processes and certain metabolites"".The results reveal a protective association between metabolites derived from cocoa, coffee, mushrooms and red wine, microbial metabolism of polyphenol-rich foods (apple, cocoa, green tea, blueberries, oranges or pomegranates) and cognitive impairment in the elderly.The analysis of plasma samples indicated that some metabolites are related to the progression of cognitive impairment and dementia. As Professor Cristina Andr s-Lacueva explains, ""for example, 2-furoylglycine and 3-methylanthine, which are biomarkers of coffee and cocoa consumption, had a protective profile, while saccharin  derived from the consumption of artificial sweeteners  is associated with a damaging role"".Merc  Pall s, professor at the Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences and member of the Institute of Neurosciences (UBNeuro) of the UB, stresses that ""the study of the relationship between cognitive impairment, the metabolism of the microbiota and food and endogenous metabolism is essential to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies that help to take care of our cognitive health"".Dietary changes for a healthy cognitive agingTherefore, changes in lifestyle and diet are decisive as a strategy to prevent cognitive deterioration and its progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and other dementias. ""A higher intake of fruits, vegetables and plant-based foods provides polyphenols and other bioactive compounds that could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline due to ageing"", says Cristina Andr s-Lacueva.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

This finding translates to close to 10,000 thyroid cancers in the next 10 years,  Dr Laaksonen says.  Obesity explains 75 per cent of this burden in Australia. The main authority for cancer research, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, has concluded that body fatness is a causal risk factor of thyroid cancer.But Dr Laaksonen says this is the first time a study has evaluated the thyroid cancer burden attributable to current levels of overweight and obesity and compared this burden by sex.Thyroid cancer is one of the few cancers that is 2-3 times as common in women as in men, but Dr Laaksonen says the study found that the future thyroid cancer burden attributable to overweight/obese is higher for men compared with women.Being overweight or obese explains two in five thyroid cancers in men, and one in 10 thyroid cancers in women. It is still not well understood what causes the sex difference in overweight/obesity-related thyroid cancer risk,  Dr Laaksonen says. But our findings add evidence to the urgent need to halt and reverse the current global trend in weight gain, especially obesity and especially in men. Dr Laaksonen says while this study defines what is linked to one in five thyroid cancers in Australia, it s not well understood what explains the remainder. Other lifestyle factors do not appear to be implicated but ionizing radiation exposure, iodine deficiency and some genetic factors and family history are known to increase the thyroid cancer risk. Thyroid cancer is a bit like prostate cancer that its risk factors are not yet very well understood. The study findings were based on seven Australian cohort studies involving 370,000 participants, which enabled the evaluation of less common cancers such as thyroid cancer. We linked the data from these seven studies, which all ascertained the participants  Body Mass Index [BMI] at study baseline, with national cancer and death databases, which allowed us to estimate the strength of BMI-cancer and BMI-death associations during the follow-up,  Dr Laaksonen says. We estimated up-to-date prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Australian population from the latest National Health Survey from 2017-2018, and then combined the strength of association and exposure prevalence estimates to estimate population attributable fractions [PAF].The PAFs describe what fraction of future cancers at the population level is explained by current exposure. We did this by applying advanced PAF  methods which I developed. The advanced PAF methods allow for unbiased disease burden estimates, as well as  for the comparison of preventable disease burden by population subgroups in the study.  These methods require access to large cohort data,  Dr Laaksonen says.As prevalence of overweight/obesity is higher in men than women it adds to the sex difference in thyroid cancer burden. Finally, we multiplied the PAF estimates by the projected numbers of thyroid cancers in the next ten years (2021-2030) to get the absolute numbers of thyroid cancers that are expected to occur due to body fatness,  Dr Laaksonen says.The aim of the project, which was jointly funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Cancer Institute NSW, was to evaluate for the first time preventable future burden of cancer in Australia and its determinants.The team involved in this study includes collaborators and representatives of the seven cohort studies on which the study was based on.They are from various Australian universities, institutes and Cancer Councils.Dr Laaksonen has previously published findings on preventable lung, colorectal, breast, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, kidney, bladder and head and neck cancers.The data scientist is a member of an international team that has recently received a $550,000 grant from the World Cancer Research Fund to expand the cancer burden analyses internationally. This grant is a fantastic opportunity to use my methods to inform global cancer control.

Some species may help to combat colon cancer, while others could help treat or prevent infections such as C. difficile.One of the obstacles to developing these  living biotherapeutics  is that many of the species that could be beneficial are harmed by oxygen, making it difficult to manufacture, store, and deliver them. MIT chemical engineers have now shown that they can protect those bacteria with a coating that helps them to survive the manufacturing process.In a study appearing today in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the researchers showed they could use the coating on a strain of E. coli as well as another species that may aid in digestion of plant starches. The coating could be applied to many other species as well, they say. We believe this coating could be used to protect pretty much any microbe of interest,  says Ariel Furst, the Raymond and Helen St. Laurent Career Development Professor of Chemical Engineering and the senior author of the new study.

Global rice production is challenged now due to the negative environmental impact, water scarcity, labor shortage and slowing yield increases in many parts of the world,  said Shen Yuan, a postdoctoral research associate at Huazhong Agricultural University in China who spent two years as a visiting scholar at the University of Nebraska Lincoln.The challenge is producing more rice on existing cropland, and doing so while minimizing the environmental impact. New research led by Shaobing Peng, a professor of agronomy at Huazhong Agricultural University, and Patricio Grassini, associate professor of agronomy at Nebraska and co-leader of the Global Yield Gap Atlas, provides an analysis of roadmaps toward sustainable intensification for a larger global rice bowl. The research was published Dec. 9 in Nature Communications. Comparing rice cropping systems around the world in terms of productivity and efficiency in the use of applied inputs can help identify opportunities for improvement,  Grassini said.The global assessment was led by Huazhong Agricultural University and the University of Nebraska Lincoln, in collaboration with the University of California, Davis, and Texas A&M s AgriLife Research Center in the United States; the International Rice Research Institute; Africa Rice Center; Indonesian Center for Rice Research and Assessment Institute of Agricultural Technology in Indonesia; Federal University of Santa Maria and EMBRAPA Arroz e Feij o in Brazil; National Institute of Agricultural Research in Uruguay; and Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research and Indian Institute of Water Management in India. The study assessed rice yields and efficiency in the use of water, fertilizer, pesticides and labor across 32 rice cropping systems that accounted for half of global rice harvested area. This study is the most comprehensive global evaluation of production systems for a major staple crop that I am aware of, and it will set the standard for future global comparison of such systems,  said Kenneth G. Cassman, professor emeritus at Nebraska and a co-author of the paper.The good news, according to the study, is that there is still substantial room to increase rice production and reduce the negative environmental impact. Around two-thirds of the total rice area included in our study have yields that are below the yield that can be attained with good agronomic practices,  Yuan said.  Closing the existing yield gap requires better nutrient, pest, soil and water management, reduction of production risk and breeding programs that release rice cultivars with improved tolerance to evolving pests and diseases. Another important finding from the study is that food production and environmental goals do not conflict. We found that achieving high yields with small environmental impact per unit of production is possible,  Peng said.  Indeed, there is room for many rice systems to reduce the negative impact substantially while maintaining or even increasing rice yields. Producing more and minimizing the environmental footprint is an enormous challenge, Grassini said. Improved agronomic practices, complemented with proper institutions and policy, can help make rice cultivation more environmentally friendly,  Grassini said.  Our study marks a first step in identifying systems with the largest opportunities for increasing crop yields and resource-use efficiency, providing a blueprint to orient agricultural research and development programs at national to global scales.

If a pore size in a membrane is comparable to the size of atoms and molecules, they can either pass through the membrane or be rejected, allowing separation of gases according to their molecular diameters. Industrial gas separation technologies widely use this principle, often relying on polymer membranes with different porosity. There is always a trade-off between the accuracy of separation and its efficiency: the finer you adjust the pore sizes, the less gas flow such sieves allow. It has long been speculated that, using two-dimensional membranes similar in thickness to graphene, one can reach much better trade-offs than currently achievable because, unlike conventional membranes, atomically thin ones should allow easier gas flows for the same selectivity. Now a research team led by Professor Sir Andre Geim at The University of Manchester, in collaboration with scientists from Belgium and China, have used low-energy electrons to punch individual atomic-scale holes in suspended graphene. The holes came in sizes down to about two angstroms, smaller than even the smallest atoms such as helium and hydrogen. In December's issue of Nature Communications, the researchers report that they achieved practically perfect selectivity (better than 99.9%) for such gases as helium or hydrogen with respect to nitrogen, methane or xenon. Also, air molecules (oxygen and nitrogen) pass through the pores easily relative to carbon dioxide, which is >95% captured. The scientists point out that to make two-dimensional membranes practical, it is essential to find atomically thin materials with intrinsic pores, that is, pores within the crystal lattice itself.  Precision sieves for gases are certainly possible and, in fact, they are conceptually not dissimilar to those used to sieve sand and granular materials. However, to make this technology industrially relevant, we need membranes with densely spaced pores, not individual holes created in our study to prove the concept for the first time. Only then are the high flows required for industrial gas separation achievable,  says Dr Pengzhan Sun, a lead author of the paper. The research team now plans to search for such two-dimensional materials with large intrinsic pores to find those most promising for future gas separation technologies. Such materials do exist. For example, there are various graphynes, which are also atomically thin allotropes of carbon but not yet manufactured at scale. These look like graphene but have larger carbon rings, similar in size to the individual defects created and studied by the Manchester researchers. The right size may make graphynes perfectly suited for gas separation.ReferenceSun PZ, Yagmurcukardes M, Zhang R. et al. Exponentially selective molecular sieving through angstrom pores.

For example, if you allow your plaque to harden into dental calculus (also known as tartar), it could preserve the genetic material of your oral microbiome: the bacteria that call your mouth home.In a new study published in Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, a research team from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) investigated the teeth of 12 human skeletons from Edo-era Japan (1603 1867), collected in 1955 from a former graveyard in Tokyo. The goals of this study were to identify signs of periodontitis (commonly called gum disease) in these ancient skeletons, analyze the bacterial genomes preserved in the dental calculus, and compare the Edo-era oral microbiomes to their equivalents in modern samples.To investigate relationships between the identified bacteria and periodontitis, the researchers developed a new method to diagnose periodontal disease in ancient skeletons. Study first author Takahiko Shiba explains,  Previously, teeth would need to be extracted from the jawbone to determine the root length and quantify bone loss as an indicator of periodontal disease. However, with advancements in micro-computed tomography technology, we were able to accurately quantify bone loss without removing teeth from the skeletons. Unexpectedly, the researchers detected periodontal disease in 5 of the 12 Edo-era skeletons (42%), thus the prevalence of gum disease among individuals in the Edo era appears to have been similar to that in the modern era; 37.3% of Japanese people in their forties were found to suffer from gum disease in 2005. However, despite this similarity in the prevalence of periodontal disease, important differences were also identified between the bacterial genomes of the ancient dental calculus and those of modern Japanese samples. For example, a trio of bacterial species associated with severe periodontal disease known as the  red complex  was not found among these ancient bacterial genomes. Different bacterial species appear to be the main pathogens responsible for periodontal disease in Edo-era Tokyo.According to another corresponding author, Hiroaki Kobayashi,  The Edo era of Japan is noted for its strict isolationist foreign policy, with very little interaction between Japanese people and foreigners. This policy appeared to be reflected in the oral microbiomes we studied, which were distinct from modern and ancient Western counterparts. Thus, our study sheds new light on the evolution of the oral microbiome and on periodontal pathogenesis. Reference: Shiba T, Komatsu K, Sudo T, et al.

Today there are only medicines to treat the symptoms of Parkinson s   we hope to develop a drug that can return people to good health even before symptoms develop. Parkinson s disease is characterised by a specific protein in human cells  misfolding , where it becomes aggregated and malfunctions. The protein   alpha-synuclein ( S)   is abundant in all human brains. After misfolding, it accumulates in large masses, known as Lewy bodies. These masses consist of  S aggregates that are toxic to dopamine-producing brain cells, causing them to die. It is this drop in dopamine signalling that triggers the symptoms of Parkinson s, as the signals transmitting from the brain to the body become noisy, leading to the distinctive tremors seen in sufferers.Previous efforts to target and  detoxify   S-induced neurodegeneration have seen scientists analyse a vast library of peptides (short chains of amino acids   the building blocks of proteins) to find the best candidate for preventing  S misfolding. Of the 209,952 peptides screened in earlier work by scientists at Bath, peptide 4554W showed the most promise, inhibiting  S from aggregating into toxic disease forms in lab experiments, both in solutions and on live cells.In their latest work, this same group of scientists tweaked peptide 4554W to optimise its function. The new version of the molecule   4654W(N6A)   contains two modifications to the parental amino-acid sequence and has proven to be significantly more effective than its predecessor at reducing  S misfolding, aggregation and toxicity. However, even if the modified molecule continues to prove successful in lab experiments, a cure for the disease is still many years away.Dr Richard Meade, the study lead author, said:  Previous attempts to inhibit alpha synuclein aggregation with small molecule drugs have been unfruitful as they are too small to inhibit such large protein interactions. This is why peptides are a good option   they are big enough to prevent the protein from aggregating but small enough to be used as a drug. The effectiveness of the 4654W(N6A) peptide on alpha synuclein aggregation and cell survival in cultures is very exciting, as it highlights that we now know where to target on the alpha synuclein protein to supress its toxicity. Not only will this research lead to the development of new treatments to prevent the disease, but it is also uncovering fundamental mechanisms of the disease itself, furthering our understanding of why the protein misfolds in the first place. Professor Mason added:  Next, we ll be working to how we can take this peptide to clinic. We need to find ways to modify it further so it is more drug-like and can cross biological membranes and get into the cells of the brain. This may mean moving away from naturally occurring amino acids towards molecules that are made in the lab. This research also has implications for Alzheimer s disease, Type 2 diabetes and other serious human diseases where symptoms are triggered by protein misfolding.Dr Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer s Research UK, said:  Finding ways to stop alpha synuclein from becoming toxic and damaging brain cells could highlight a new pathway for future drugs to stop devastating diseases like Parkinson s and dementia with Lewy bodies. We re pleased to have supported this important work to develop a molecule that can stop alpha synuclein from misfolding. The molecule has been tested in cells in the laboratory and will need further development and testing before it can be made into a treatment. This process will take a number of years, but it is a promising discovery that could pave the way for a new drug in future. Currently there are no disease-modifying treatments available for Parkinson s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, which is why continued investment in research is so important for all those living with these diseases.

However, only about 20% of patients who received immune therapies   designed to enhance or override natural limitations on immune system response   saw sustained benefits from treatment.Now Yale scientists have helped identify crucial ways that immune system cells congregate and communicate with each other to identify and eradicate tumors, an insight that can help improve these outcomes.Writing in the journal Cell on Dec. 9, they report these findings might pave the way for new vaccines that may help increase survival rates in several forms of cancer.In recent years, scientists have found that patients who are most likely to survive lung cancer often develop lymph node-like structures around tumors. And like lymph nodes, these structures produce a host of immune system cells such as CD4 helper T cells, which identify tumors; B cells, which produce antibodies against the cancer; and CD8 killer T cells, which can attack cancer cells. The field has been trying to figure out how these mini-immune systems are set up in the tumor micro-environment and why do they correlate to great outcomes?  asked Nikhil Joshi, assistant professor of immunobiology and co-senior author of the paper.It turns out that these immune system cells communicate with each other. For the study, a team led by Joshi, Can Cui, a Ph.D. student and physician at Yale School of Medicine, and Joseph Craft, the Paul B. Beeson Professor of Medicine (rheumatology) and professor of immunobiology, analyzed tumor genetics of cancer survivors and then created mouse models with genetic characteristics similar to those survivors.Their analysis found that B cells actually do more than simply make antibodies against cancer.  In order to also unleash a robust response by CD8 killer T cells, the B cells must first interact with CD4 helper T cells in order to identify tumors to target. T cells and B cells need to talk to each other before tumors can be targeted,  Craft said.Several cancer vaccines are already under development designed to spur production of T cells which have taken up residence around several types of cancer, including melanoma and glioblastomas, as well as lung cancer. In fact, both BioNTech and Moderna   which during the COVID-19 pandemic helped develop vaccines to help the human body identify and fight the virus   were initially formed in part to develop cancer vaccines. The model is already in place,  Joshi said.Cui suggests that future cancer vaccines may be more effective if they can jumpstart both antibody-producing B cells and helper T cells to bolster a broader immune system response.Such vaccines could be used in conjunction with traditional immunotherapy treatments to increase survival rates of patients with several forms of cancer, the researchers said.Reference: Cui C, Wang J, Fagerberg E, et al.

Not necessarily because of omicron   scientists are still working that one out   but because there s more evidence than ever that COVID-19 is a seasonal disease.We know this intuitively. It s no surprise that moving indoors and closing windows bumps up transmission. But new analyses from University of Illinois researchers show that, underneath all the variants and waves, the disease has been cycling seasonally across the globe for nearly two years.More significantly, the researchers identify a molecular culprit for the virus s seasonal nature. The finding could help predict future mutations and potentially pave the way for new therapeutics or vaccines. Ours is the first proposal of a viral sensor that responds to external seasonal patterns of environment and physiology,  says Gustavo Caetano-Anoll s, professor in the Department of Crop Sciences and the C.R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the University of Illinois, and senior author on the Methods in Microbiology study.  The structure should now become a focus for prediction, mitigation, and informed public health decision-making. The structure, embedded within the N-terminal domain of the viral spike, falls into a broad category of proteins known as lectins. All organisms make lectins; the proteins recognize and bind to carbohydrates and shape adaptive and innate immune responses. They are also known to help viruses and other microbes attach to their host cells. But it was only recently that scientists discovered some lectins play a role in sensing temperature changes in the environment.  This is where coral reefs and COVID-19 collide.In 2019, scientists in China found that a type of lectin   galectin   was involved in recognition between photosynthetic dinoflagellates and coral polyps. But this recognition mechanism didn t work as well when water temperatures fell outside a narrow thermal band: 25-30 degrees Celsius. It was a first hint that galectins sense external temperatures and an explanation of coral bleaching, the devastating demise of coral reefs in warming waters.Hearing about this discovery, Caetano-Anoll s and his collaborators analyzed tens of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discovered a galectin-like structure on the spike protein. The researchers think galectin protein structures sense external conditions and, when it s not too hot or humid, trigger a conformational change in the spike protein of the virus, allowing viral RNA to enter host cells. Think of the spike as a little jar that has flaps on top to keep it closed. When temperature is high, the jar stays completely closed and cannot spill its infectious contents. But when its flaps recognize the host cell in the lung   under cool and dry conditions   the jar opens, releasing a fusion peptide that helps merge the virus and host membranes. This allows the virus to enter the cell and make more of its kind,  Caetano-Anoll s says.Viruses change constantly. When a particular part of the genome starts changing more rapidly, that s a signal the virus is exploring new and better ways to survive and spread inside its host. In other words, rapid mutation is the virus throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.Scientists expect these rapid mutations to arise in regions responsible for transmission, infectivity, and immune escape, because they re the most helpful to the virus. Since sensing the environment is so important to the virus, it made sense that the galectin-like structure of the spike should also be one of those regions and that its role would be related to virus infection. Remarkably, we find the galectin-like structure is a frequent target of mutations because it helps the virus evade or modulate the physiological responses of the host to further its spread and survival,  Caetano-Anoll s says.Tracking mutations in the galectin protein region led the researchers to identify a seasonal pattern across the globe. Focusing on genomic changes worldwide, they found bursts of rapid mutation occurring throughout 2020, often leading to new variants of concern. The bursts were firing in parts of the globe experiencing winter or in high elevation locations where weather remains cool year-round.  As for bursts during the summer, or in low-elevation tropical areas? They just weren t happening.Significantly, most of the seasonal bursts were occurring in the N-terminal region of the spike protein. That s where the galectin structure is located; more evidence of its importance to the virus. Tracking the prevalence of mutations in this structure along the onset of the pandemic resulted in the identification of a hemisphere-dependent seasonal pattern driven by mutational bursts. These bursts are now responsible for the rise of the Variant of Concern Delta and new viral variants in the making,  Caetano-Anoll s says.  Understanding how these processes of viral diversification occur is crucial for mitigations. Caetano-Anoll s  laboratory is now exploring the millions of viral sequences acquired worldwide to determine how genomic makeup is changing the behavior of the virus. They hope to further unravel the molecular underpinning of seasonality as COVID-19 becomes endemic.Reference: Caetano-Anoll s K, Hernandez N, Mughal F, Tomaszewski T, Caetano-Anoll s G.

This is known as biomass, in other words, plant and other vegetable remains, as well as animal or household waste, for example. According to experts, these bio-residues could become a viable alternative source of energy. In this way, the sustainable processing of biomass allows high value-added products to be obtained and has become a good alternative in energy production, in the context of an increasing world population and the progressive depletion of natural resources. These bio-residues are characterised by high humidity, which requires a drying pre-treatment process before they are processed using conventional thermal technologies (such as pyrolysis, gasification, or dry torrefaction).  This is not an economic option, as a significant amount of energy is used for the drying pre-treatment. In order to solve this, hydrothermal biomass carbonisation (HTC) could be an interesting technology that could be used to process this waste, as the drying pre-treatment is not needed,  explains Jes s G mez Hern ndez, from the UC3M s Department of Thermal and Fluids Engineering s Energy Systems Engineering research group. He is one of the authors of an article that was recently published in the scientific journal Renewable Energy, which details how HTC can be used in conjunction with a solar power facility to make the process more sustainable and extract energy from pine residues, corn stover, or rice husks, for example.  The products obtained could be applied to energy production processes, the improvement of soil substrates, supercapacitors, and bio-refineries to create a fossil-fuel-free economy, opening a technological path toward a circular economy,  say the authors of this paper. The HTC consists of a thermochemical treatment in order to process the biomass in a reactor with hot water (between 180 and 250 degrees) at a high pressure (from 10 to 40 bar) to obtain a high value-added product: hydrocarbon.  In other words, the natural process for the formation of coal from biomass is reproduced under laboratory conditions,  explains Jes s G mez Hern ndez. The main drawback is that HTC requires a lot of energy. It is at this point that researchers have introduced an innovation by using another renewable energy source: solar energy.  Our work analytically models an HTC process for twin-screw reactors coupled to a linear beam-down solar field (LBD) in order to be sustainable in terms of energy,  note the researchers. The system would operate roughly as follows: two sets of reflective mirrors redirect the solar rays to another secondary mirror that concentrates all the solar energy on the screw reactor, which is installed on the floor due to its weight. They have found that this could extract energy in a renewable and sustainable way from different lignocellulosic biomasses, the most abundant raw material for bio-fuel production available on Earth.ReferenceBriongos JV, Taramona S, G mez-Hern ndez J, Mulone V, Santana D.

The specific conditions for that have now been created and exploited by researchers at Martin Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry (IPB). Polyisoprene is the principal component of natural rubber and of many types of rubber also used in car tires, for example. Up until now, it has only been possible to degrade polyisoprene, with a composition similar to naturally occurring rubber. The present research could provide important insights toward a circular economy. The study appeared in the journal Green Chemistry.Natural rubber is used to make polyisoprene, which in turn enables the production of many types of rubbers and plastics. Polyisoprene is a long-chain molecule formed by linking hundreds or thousands of smaller isoprene molecules. ""Various bacteria are able to degrade natural polyisoprene with the help of enzymes,"" says MLU chemist Vico Adjedje. Enzymes are biomolecules that make chemical reactions possible in all living organisms - from simple single-celled organisms to humans. Since global demand for rubber products is greater than can be satisfied by existing stocks of natural rubber, the starting material is mainly produced by chemical synthesis. Natural and synthetic variants have similar properties, but exhibit a number of differences in the structure of the molecules of which they are composed. The research teams of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Binder at MLU and Jun.-Prof. Dr. Martin Weissenborn at IPB and MLU have now found a way to decompose artificially produced polyisoprene using the enzyme LCPK30. ""We are the first to have succeeded in getting the polyisoprene into a form that the enzyme can also work with,"" says Binder. In doing so, the researchers took inspiration from nature: ""Our assumption was that synthetic polyisoprene should be present in an emulsion so that the enzyme can work properly,"" Adjedje says.  Milk, which consists largely of water and fat, provides a typical example of an emulsion. It forms globules a few micrometers in size, and its fine distribution in water lets the milk seem cloudy. Just like fat, polyisoprene is virtually insoluble in water. Nature nevertheless manages to distribute it evenly in water: as milky-white latex milk, which is harvested on rubber plantations and processed into natural rubber. Inspired by this latex milk, the researchers succeeded in distributing synthetically produced polyisoprene evenly in water, using a specific solvent. The enzyme complied with the artificial emulsion and thus remained intact over the reaction time, breaking down the long molecular chains of the polyisoprene into much smaller fragments. The researchers' goal is to be able to break down other similar substances from car tires in the future. ""A lot happens to the starting material before it becomes a finished tire: the molecule chains are chemically cross-linked to change the mechanical properties. Plasticizers and antioxidants are added. The latter in particular present a problem for the enzyme because they attack its structure,"" says Adjedje. The results also provide important impetus toward a recycling economy. ""We could further process the degradation products into fine chemicals and fragrances - or reproduce new plastics,"" explains Binder. The researchers used LCPK30 as it occurs in nature. Weissenborn's research team is currently working on optimizing the enzyme so that it becomes less sensitive to solvents and triggers further reactions.ReferenceAdjedje VKB, Schell E, Wolf YL, Laub A, Weissenborn MJ, Binder WH.

RNA is used to copy genetic information contained in our hereditary material, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and then serves as a template for building proteins, the building blocks of life. Delivery of RNA into cells remains a major challenge for the development of novel therapies across a broad range of diseases. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden together with researchers from the global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca have investigated where and how mRNA is delivered inside the cell. They found that mRNA uses an unexpected entry door. Their results provide novel insights into the development of RNA therapeutics towards efficient delivery and lower dosages.DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains the genetic information required for the development and maintenance of life. This information is communicated by messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to make proteins. mRNA-based therapeutics have the potential to address unmet needs for a wide variety of diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. mRNA can be delivered to cells to trigger the production, degradation or modification of a target protein, something impossible with other approaches. A key challenge with this modality is being able to deliver the mRNA inside the cell so that it can be translated to make a protein. mRNA can be packed into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)   small bubbles of fat   that protect the mRNA and shuttle it into cells. However, this process is not simple, because the mRNA has to pass the membrane before it can reach its site of action in the cell interior, the cytoplasm.Researchers in the team of MPI-CBG director Marino Zerial are experts in visualizing the cellular entry routes of molecules in the cell, such as mRNA with high-resolution microscopes. They teamed up with scientists from AstraZeneca who provided the researchers with lipid nanoparticle prototypes that they had developed for therapeutic approaches to follow the mRNA inside the cell. The study is published in the Journal of Cell Biology. To be delivered, the mRNA must make a long journey. Enclosed in the fatty LNP bubble, it needs to get into the cell first,  explains Marino Zerial.  The LNPs arrive at the cell surface where they bind to receptors. They are then taken up into specialized membrane-enclosed compartments called endosomes. At this point, the mRNA is inside the cells but surrounded by two barriers, the fatty bubble and the endosome wall or more correctly, membrane. The challenge for the mRNA is to escape both barriers to reach the cytoplasm where it serves as a template to make proteins. We know that only a tiny fraction of RNA molecules are able to escape into the cytoplasm.  Internalized cargo molecules, like the LNPs, are first transported to ""early"" endosomes. These are logistic centres that distribute cargo molecules to various destinations in the cell. They either recycle molecules to the cell surface or degrade them in late endosomes and lysosomes. So far, people thought that the mRNA escapes from late endosomes exploiting their very acidic content.  With single molecule microscopy techniques"", explains Prasath Paramasivam, the first author of the study, ""we could visualize for the first time the mRNA in the LNP inside the endosomes of cells. We also captured the actual escape of the mRNA, which happened in the tubules of the recycling endosomes, which are only mildly acidic."" ""Our results imply that sending the LNP-mRNA to late endosomes is counterproductive for delivery and only increases cell toxicity."" says Zerial. These findings help understanding the mechanism of mRNA escape from endosomes in more detail.Marino Zerial summarizes:  The LNP delivery system for mRNA necessitates high doses due to the low endosomal escape efficiency. Knowing where the mRNA goes and how it can escape the endosomes allows us to develop better vehicles for more efficient delivery, at lower dosage. We can improve the mRNA delivery system so it can be used for therapeutic applications, for example cancer treatment. Reference: Paramasivam P, Franke C, St ter M, et al.

Rhesus macaques receiving a priming vaccine followed by multiple booster inoculations had a 79% lower per-exposure risk of infection by simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) compared to unvaccinated animals. The research was led by Paolo Lusso, M.D., Ph.D., of NIAID s Laboratory of Immunoregulation, in collaboration with other NIAID scientists, investigators from Moderna, Inc. and colleagues at other institutions. Despite nearly four decades of effort by the global research community, an effective vaccine to prevent HIV remains an elusive goal,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., chief of the Laboratory and a paper co-author.  This experimental mRNA vaccine combines several features that may overcome shortcomings of other experimental HIV vaccines and thus represents a promising approach. The experimental vaccine works like mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. However, instead of carrying mRNA instructions for the coronavirus spike protein, the vaccine delivers coded instructions for making two key HIV proteins, Env and Gag. Muscle cells in an inoculated animal assemble these two proteins to produce virus-like particles (VLPs) studded with numerous copies of Env on their surface. Although they cannot cause infection or disease because they lack the complete genetic code of HIV, these VLPs match whole, infectious HIV in terms of stimulating suitable immune responses.In studies with mice, two injections of the VLP-forming mRNA vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies in all animals, the investigators report. The Env proteins produced in the mice from the mRNA instructions closely resembled those in the whole virus, an improvement over previous experimental HIV vaccines.  The display of multiple copies of authentic HIV envelope protein on each VLP is one of the special features of our platform that closely mimics natural infection and may have played a role in eliciting the desired immune responses,  said Dr. Lusso.The team then tested the Env-Gag VLP mRNA vaccine in macaques. The details of the vaccine regimen differed among subgroups of vaccinated animals but involved priming the immune system with a vaccine modified to optimize antibody creation. The prime was followed by multiple booster inoculations delivered over the course of a year. The boost vaccines contained Gag mRNA and Env mRNA from two HIV clades other than the one used in the prime vaccine. The investigators used multiple virus variants to preferentially activate antibodies against the more conserved  shared  regions of the Env the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies rather than the more variable regions that differ in each virus strain.Although the doses of mRNA delivered were high, the vaccine was well tolerated and produced only mild, temporary adverse effects in the macaques, such as loss of appetite. By week 58, all vaccinated macaques had developed measurable levels of neutralizing antibodies directed against most strains in a test panel of 12 diverse HIV strains. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, the VLP mRNA vaccine also induced a robust helper T-cell response.Beginning at week 60, immunized animals and a control group of unimmunized macaques were exposed weekly, via the rectal mucosa, to SHIV. Because non-human primates are not susceptible to HIV-1, scientists use a chimeric SHIV in experimental settings because that virus replicates in macaques. After 13 weekly inoculations, two out of seven immunized macaques remained uninfected. The other immunized animals had an overall delay in infection, which occurred, on average, after eight weeks. In contrast, unimmunized animals became infected on average after three weeks. We are now refining our vaccine protocol to improve the quality and quantity of the VLPs produced. This may further increase vaccine efficacy and thus lower the number of prime and boost inoculations needed to produce a robust immune response. If confirmed safe and effective, we plan to conduct a Phase 1 trial of this vaccine platform in healthy adult volunteers,  said Dr. Lusso.Reference: Zhang P, Narayanan E, Liu Q, et al.

Using a proprietary on-kit amplification technique, a person s saliva can be self-administered or tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the point-of-care with sensitivity higher than current ART tests and close to that of laboratory-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.Dubbed the Parallel Amplified Saliva rapid POint-of-caRe Test (PASPORT), the technology produces results in minutes, without the need for additional equipment or specially-trained personnel. The invention was borne out of a research collaboration between Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and National Cancer Centre, Singapore (NCCS) collectively member institutes of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre and the National University of Singapore (NUS).With the impending availability of oral antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 could potentially be diagnosed and treated in the primary care setting in the future. A test that can be done on-site will enable doctors to diagnose COVID-19 accurately and prescribe the drugs appropriately. Moreover, with its anticipated low cost and ease of use as compared to PCR tests, PASPORT could aid Singapore and countries around the world in making early diagnosis of COVID-19 to initiate appropriate case management. Testing is an indispensable tool in the management of COVID-19 cases. Although PCR has been the gold standard, it requires trained personnel and laboratory infrastructure,  said lead inventor Dr Danny Jian Hang Tng, Medical Officer at the Department of Infectious Diseases, SGH, and an adjunct Research Fellow at Duke-NUS  Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Programme. Dr Tng, who graduated from Duke-NUS in 2019, added,  A reliable and painless saliva antigen test that is affordable and convenient to perform would encourage more to be tested, and more frequent testing. This may enable us to manage COVID-19 more effectively not only at the point of care, but also in settings such as airports, conventions and even at home. Unlike tests that use nasal or throat swabs, saliva-based tests are convenient and are more easily self-administered. But, until now, saliva tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have not been considered reliable enough to roll out at large scale. This is because the concentration of viral particles in saliva drops steeply after an individual eats or drinks. As a result, saliva antigen tests are usually only reliable when they are performed first thing in the morning, after an overnight fast and before breakfast or brushing teeth. This makes testing of saliva samples at other times of the day less reliable.The researchers remedied this by using a two-stage process. Like other ARTs, PASPORT uses nanoparticles to bind the virus. But uniquely, it also adds a second type of nanoparticle that binds the first set of nanoparticles to amplify the signal. This makes testing using PASPORT more sensitive at finding and flagging the virus, and allows it to be used at any time of the day its sensitivity is not compromised even after eating or drinking. Compared to other amplification techniques, PASPORT is able achieve detection even at much lower viral loads, enabling it to be extremely sensitive. In a clinical study involving over 100 participants conducted at SGH, PASPORT s sensitivity in detecting the virus was 97 per cent and its specificity, 90.6 per cent, compared to the gold standard PCR test.Professor Ooi Eng Eong, from the Duke-NUS EID Programme, who is one of the senior co-inventors, said,  Like COVID-19 vaccines, the availability of oral anitiviral drugs will be another game changer in our fight against COVID-19. But these drugs will need to be given as early as possible after illness onset for maximal benefit. A test that can be self-administered or used on-site at the primary care setting may mitigate the need for cases to be managed at the hospitals. Professor Soo Khee Chee, Benjamin Sheares Professor in Academic Medicine at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Oncology Academic Clinical Programme, a Senior Advisor to Duke-NUS, and a senior co-inventor, said,  Our invention ticks all the boxes for an ideal rapid test: ease of collection of saliva; highly accurate with very low false negative results, making it an invaluable screening tool; and can be done at any time of the day, making it possible to be used at point of care, with reliable authentication. With this, we hope that more people will do the test as a personal act of social responsibility before engaging, especially, in large-scale events or gatherings. Duke-NUS and SingHealth have filed intellectual property protection for the invention, and have entered into a license agreement with Digital Life Line Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based company. The inventors hope that through close collaboration with commercial partners, the product can be out in the market as soon as possible to serve healthcare needs in Singapore and beyond.Reference: Tng DJH, Yin BCY, Cao J, et al.

His first generation of cattle crosses between Holsteins and Sahiwals, a native Indian breed, seemed to carry the best traits of both: the Holsteins  high milk production, and the Sahiwals  disease resistance and extreme weather tolerance.But after a few generations, as the cattle carried more and more Holstein genetics, cows became sicker and sicker. They suffered from mastitis, parasitic infestations and other diseases that the Sahiwal had tolerated. Just 10 years after that first Holstein cross, the farm went bankrupt. This extreme focus on milk-production traits has had beneficial impacts, but it has had collateral damage as well,  said Selvaraj, associate professor of animal science at Cornell University.  Animal production is driven by industry, and industry is driven by profit. Many people are thinking two to three years ahead, not 20 years ahead. Today, Selvaraj is working to preserve the genetic diversity of fast-disappearing native cattle breeds via gene banking, and his lab has made a breakthrough that will enable long-term storage and reproduction of cattle stem cells   cells that could be used in the future to clone breeds that have gone extinct, or that have been so heavily crossed with other breeds that they ve lost their strongest traits.Their findings were reported in  Efficient Induction and Sustenance of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Bovine Somatic Cells,  published in Biology Open on Nov. 1. First authors are Viju Vijayan Pillai, a former doctoral student under Selvaraj and now a veterinary resident at Purdue University, and Prasanthi Koganti, a postdoctoral associate in Selvaraj s lab.Traditionally, farms kept a few high-performing bulls to impregnate their cows, swapping bulls with neighbors to prevent inbreeding. In the 1980s, though, most U.S. farmers moved to artificial insemination, drawn by not having to keep large, dangerous bulls, and by being able to choose the most genetically superior males from across the country. But everyone was looking for the same traits, and the result is that now, 99% of U.S. Holstein cattle are descended from just two bulls, both born in the 1960s.The problem is spreading across livestock worldwide: according to the United Nations, almost 100 livestock breeds went extinct between 2000 and 2014, and another 17% of global livestock breeds are at risk of extinction. That could have severe consequences as climate change increases temperatures, allows disease and insects to spread to new territories and makes traits like hardiness and disease resistance ever-more important. If a new disease or organism suddenly comes in and if the animals are extremely susceptible   and they are more or less homogeneous   then we have a very, very serious problem on our hands,  Selvaraj said.Similar to the Norwegian-led global seed bank, Selvaraj advocates for a global livestock stem-cell repository. The United Nations and the American Veterinary Medical Association are among those calling for a livestock genome bank. But preserving livestock genetics is much more complicated than seeds. Globally, 64 countries have established genome banks of some kind, including the U.S.; however, these banks are primarily composed of cryopreserved bull semen. This strategy is good, but stem cell preservation is much better, Selvaraj said. Stored semen is a finite resource, and it only provides half the genome: Semen would require cross-breeding with a living cow, while stem cells could be used to clone a preserved, pure-bred native breed.Previous efforts to generate cattle stem cells have had mixed results, because the science was fully based on mouse and human research, Selvaraj said. His team sequenced gene expressions in approximately 400 cattle blastocyst embryos. Using a systems biology approach, they identified the top pathways important for the process of stem cell self-renewal, and determined the conditions needed to prevent the stem cells from differentiating into other cell types.  Using stem cells, you can preserve the full genome and then regenerate the animal at any future point in time,  Selvaraj said.  Stem cells undergo self-renewal and are immortal, so you can use some and refreeze them. This provides an inexhaustible store that you can use into the future.

Traditional thermocatalytic hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene (HAE) requires high temperatures and high pressure, leading to excessive energy consumption. Besides, large amount of H2 consumption makes this process even more costly.Recently, a research group led by Prof. DENG Dehui from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) realized highly efficient electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene (E-HAE) under room temperature by directly using water as hydrogen source. The study was published in Nature Communications on Dec. 6. Compared with the thermocatalytic path, the new process developed by the researchers can directly take water as hydrogen source under ambient temperature and pressure, thereby avoiding the additional supply of hydrogen. In combination with renewable energy-based electricity, this process provides an environmentally-friendly, cheap, and efficient way for hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene.  The researchers optimized the Cu catalyst to expose more active facets, facilitating preferential adsorption and hydrogenation of acetylene against hydrogen adsorption and evolution. By using a microporous gas diffusion layer to promote mass transfer, they achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 83.2% for ethylene production. In-situ spectroscopic characterizations combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrated that electron transfer from the Cu surface to adsorbed acetylene promoted the adsorption and hydrogenation of the acetylene, while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitating ethylene desorption. This resulted in highly selective ethylene production via the electron-coupled proton transfer pathways. ""This process provides a green route for industrial production of C2H4 from C2H2 under mild conditions,"" said Prof. DENG.Reference: Wang S, Uwakwe K, Yu L. et al.

In this paper, Professor Roberto Mayor (UCL Cell & Developmental Biology) and colleagues show that an additional mechanism called durotaxis is also involved in driving direction migration of neural crest cells in vivo. Durotaxis is the process by which cells follow a gradient of mechanical stiffness, and their data show that the same migrating neural crest cells self-generate a stiffness gradient of front of them. In addition, they identify the mechanism by which chemotaxis synergizes with durotaxis to drive efficient directional cells migration.Co-author Dr Adam Shellard (UCL Cell & Developmental Biology) said,  this newly identified behaviour is likely to be found not only in the cells that form our face, but in the cells that forms all our organs, and could play a central role in the dissemination of cancer cells during metastasis which hijack the behaviour. Understanding how these cells move is an important step toward developing therapies for craniofacial malformations and cancer progression. Reference: Shellard A, Mayor R.

The investigators were able to link the two thanks to a decade-long effort made possible by the federally funded resource of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Breast Cancer Data set. The scientists found much agreement between genetic and pathologic classifications but developed a novel way to use data from both systems to arrive at a classification method that divides breast cancers into 12 distinct biological groups.The findings appeared December 8, 2021, in Cell Genomics. We ve known for a long time that breast cancer is not one disease, and now through years of molecular research, added to decades of pathology knowledge, we have begun to integrate the two into one language,  said Charles Perou, PhD, co-director of the UNC Lineberger Breast Cancer Research Program, the May Goldman Shaw Distinguished Professor of Molecular Oncology, and corresponding author of the research.  This should greatly aid future research efforts and enable faster translation of molecular findings into the pathology lab for clinical use. The World Health Organization has long classified breast tumors into multiple types based on a tumor cell s unique shape, structure and size. The most common type of breast cancer has been defined as invasive ductal breast carcinoma; it accounts for 70 percent to 80 percent of all breast cancers. While this predominant type of breast cancer was of interest to the researchers, it was the rarer types that held the most opportunity for new discoveries in this finding.TCGA s 10,000-plus tissue repository of 33 different types of cancer types allowed the investigators to explore the previously known, but rarer breast pathologies. However, obtaining a sufficient number of samples to adequately study rarer types and subtypes of cancer was a challenge. But the TCGA Breast Cancer team, led by Perou, was able to obtain enough samples for at least six rare breast cancer subtypes, each of which yielded interesting and unique molecular features.Of particular note were rare metaplastic carcinomas, a breast cancer subtype with a poor clinical prognosis. Through comparison to the entire TCGA set of 10,000 tumors, the researchers found that some metaplastic cancers were related closely to melanomas, which are aggressive skin cancers, and to sarcomas, which are typically found in bone and connective tissue. Our effort finishes all planned analyses on TCGA, which has been a major undertaking,  said Aatish Thennavan, a PhD graduate student in Perou s lab and first author of the article.  In our study, we validated our findings with other datasets that also had rarer subtypes. We would urge future studies to incorporate rarer subtypes so we can build on this foundational analysis.   For their next efforts, the researchers plan to delve deeper into the molecular features and cellular origins of metaplastic breast cancers. They are also interested in why some of the 12 biological groups show evidence of immune cells that are capable of infiltrating tumor cells, and why others tend not to have these immune infiltrates. This line of research has therapeutic implications as there are treatments that have been developed that target immune cells in breast cancers.Reference: Aatish Thennavan A, Beca F, Xia Y, et al.

An orangutan mother will stay in close contact with her baby for up to nine years longer than almost all mammals other than humans. Much like humans, orangutans rely on their mothers to learn life skills such as what to eat and where to find it before they finally reach independence almost a decade after birth. But unlike humans, orangutan mothers were not known to participate in their offspring s learning; behaving as passive role models rather than active teachers. That is, until a team of researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany, uncovered the first evidence yet of active involvement by orangutan mothers in their offspring s skill learning. When orangutan mothers are foraging, they tailor their behavior to match the age and abilities of their offspring, thereby helping their young to socially learn new skills. The study raises the possibility that orangutans perform teaching a behavior that s rare among animals and sheds light on the factors that led to the evolution of teaching in humans.The team studied how immature orangutans learn foraging skills. During the eight to nine year weaning period   one of the longest periods of nutritional dependency in any mammal immatures must learn how to recognize and process more than 200 food items, many of which require several steps before they can be eaten. Easy-to-eat flowers and leaves require no processing, for example, whereas bark must be loosened from the tree and scraped with the teeth to remove the nutritional parts. The most difficult foods require tools, such as sticks that are converted into brushes for excavating honey from bee hives.How they learn such complex foraging skills, according to previous studies, is by watching their mothers. Immatures will watch or  peer  at their mother when she is eating, especially when the food is hard to process. They will also beg or  solicit  food that the mother is eating, usually by attempting to grab the item out of her hands. But a mystery remained: why was the learning process one sided? It was puzzling that mothers always seemed so passive during these feeding interactions,  says Caroline Schuppli, from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, who led the study.  Mothers have so much time with their offspring, and maintain such a close connection, but they never appeared to be actively involved in the skill acquisition of their young.  The mystery was compounded by a lack of data.  Past studies had always examined skill learning from the point of view of the offspring,  says Schuppli,  so we didn t know the role of the role model.

The article, co-authored by researchers at Portland State University and the U.S. Geological Survey, monitored the clams in laboratory conditions over 90 days. During that time, they exposed clams to pesticides at concentrations that may occur in their natural estuarine ecosystems due to runoff from upstream applications. The researchers monitored the effects of the pesticides atrazine, hexazinone, indaziflam, and bifenthrin, individually and in combination, on the soft-shell clams' shell growth, condition, feeding rates, mortality, and contaminant uptake with collection periods occurring every thirty days of the study. The data indicate exposure to some chemicals caused a high mortality rate, both individually and in combination,  which was surprising due to the low concentrations we used in the study  said lead author Allie Tissot. Additionally, the research team found accumulation of the compounds in the tissue of the shellfish and reduced clam condition and feeding. According to the study's authors, the findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how pesticides used upstream of estuarine and marine ecosystems impact aquatic species and ecosystem health. Forest managers commonly use three of the pesticides examined in the study to control the expansion of unwanted species that threaten forest lands; some of these compounds are also used in farming Christmas trees and managing vegetation in public right-of-ways. Runoff and spray drift then transports the pesticides into waterways that carry them downstream, where it enters coastal transition zones.The study is novel in examining the effects of pesticide exposure over a long period and at environmentally relevant concentrations. According to Tissot,  studying the long-term effects of these compounds in combination and at levels that our lab has detected in coastal transition zone ecosystems is critical to our understanding of how forestry management practices may impact these culturally and economically important ecosystems. This is an important data gap to fill as research on these compounds' toxicity typically focuses on individual compound effects at high concentrations to determine lethality, which while necessary for understanding compound toxicity, can miss sub-lethal effects that can have long term impacts on these systems.

Cardiometabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease continue to increase in prevalence and together constitute the highest cause of mortality worldwide. Affected people often have to take multiple daily medications for months or even years.Researchers from the Bork group at EMBL Heidelberg, working together with a European consortium involving more than twenty European institutes, have now shown that many commonly used drugs have powerful effects on our gut microbes. These include drugs used to treat cardiometabolic disorders and antibiotics. The results were published in the journal Nature. The gut microbiome consists of billions of microorganisms essential to the body s normal functioning. We analysed the effects of 28 different drugs and several drug combinations,  explained Peer Bork, Director of Scientific Activities at EMBL Heidelberg,  Many drugs negatively impact the composition and state of the gut bacteria, but others, including aspirin, can have a positive influence on the gut microbiome. We found that drugs can have a more pronounced effect on the host microbiome than disease, diet, and smoking combined. While the negative and lasting impact of antibiotics on gut bacteria is already well-known, this study showed that such effects likely accumulate over time.  We found that the gut microbiome of patients taking multiple courses of antibiotics over five years became less healthy. That included signs indicating antimicrobial resistance,  said co-first author of the study Sofia Forslund, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Bork group and now group leader at the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), Berlin. We wanted to disentangle the effect that diseases have on host microbiomes from the effect of medications, particularly in patients taking more than one drug at the same time,  said co-first author Maria Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, group leader and former postdoc at EMBL Heidelberg.  Being part of the MetaCardis consortium enabled us to use multi-omics data from more than 2000 patients with cardiometabolic diseases,  she added. The large cohort also allowed the researchers to establish that the dosage of drugs prescribed also has a significant effect on the level of impact on the microbiome. We know that the microbiome can reflect the status of a patient s health and provide a range of biomarkers to assess the severity of diseases. What is often overlooked, however, is that the medication used to treat a disease also affects the state of the microbiome,  added Rima Chakaroun, one of the lead authors of the study and a clinician scientist at the University of Leipzig Medical Center. Dr Chakaroun is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Wallenberg Laboratory, University of Gothenburg.By developing a statistical approach that accounts for the effects of multiple confounding factors, the researchers could tease out the effects of drugs and disease separately.  We now have a robust methodological framework that makes it possible to get rid of many of the standard errors,  said Professor Bork.  That allowed us to show that medication can mask the signatures of disease and conceal potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. The researchers are hopeful that these results can provide knowledge that could potentially help in drug repurposing as well as in planning individualised treatment and prevention strategies.The study combined the insight, knowledge and approaches of experts in six countries.  It was very motivating to work with an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, bioinformaticians, and computational systems biologists to advance our understanding of molecular interactions in cardiometabolic disease,  said Dr Zimmermann-Kogadeeva.Reference: Forslund SK, Chakaroun R, Zimmermann-Kogadeeva M, et al.

Now, in work led by researchers at McGill University, there is evidence that a wide range of early onset psychiatric problems (from depression, anxiety and addictions to dyslexia, bulimia, and ADHD) may be largely due to the combination of just three factors. The first is biological in the form of individual variability in the brain s dopamine reward pathway. The second is social and points to the important role of early childhood neglect or abuse. And the third is psychological and relates to temperament, and particularly to tendencies toward impulsivity and difficulty controlling emotions. These findings have implications for understanding both the causes of a wide range of psychiatric disorders and the features worth targeting in early intervention efforts. Until recently, it was thought that psychiatric disorders reflected discrete disease entities, each with their own unique causes,  says Marco Leyton, the senior author on a recent study published in Neuropsychopharmacology and a professor in McGill s Department of Psychiatry and Senior Scientist at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.  The present research upends this idea, suggesting instead that most early onset disorders largely reflect differential expressions of a small number of biological, psychological and social factors.

The product is only authorized for those individuals who are not currently infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and who have not recently been exposed to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2. The authorization also requires that individuals either have:  One dose of Evusheld, administered as two separate consecutive intramuscular injections (one injection per monoclonal antibody, given in immediate succession), may be effective for pre-exposure prevention for six months. Evusheld is not authorized for individuals for the treatment of COVID-19 or for post-exposure prevention of COVID-19. Patients should talk with their health care provider to determine whether Evusheld is an appropriate pre-exposure prevention option for them.Pre-exposure prevention with Evusheld is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. The FDA has approved one vaccine and authorized others to prevent COVID-19 and serious clinical outcomes associated with a COVID-19 infection, including hospitalization and death. The FDA urges the public to get vaccinated if eligible. Learn more about FDA-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines.  Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are long-acting monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus  attachment and entry into human cells. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab bind to different, non-overlapping sites on the spike protein of the virus. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval. In determining whether to issue an EUA, the FDA evaluates the totality of available scientific evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product. Based on the FDA s review of the totality of the scientific evidence available, the agency has determined that it is reasonable to believe that Evusheld may be effective for use as pre-exposure prevention in certain adults and pediatric individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms). The agency has also determined that the known and potential benefits of Evusheld, when used consistent with the terms and conditions of the authorization, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. There are no adequate, approved and available alternatives to Evusheld for the pre-exposure prevention of COVID-19 in the authorized population. The primary data supporting this EUA for Evusheld are from PROVENT, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults greater than age 59 or with a prespecified chronic medical condition or at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for other reasons who had not received a COVID-19 vaccine and did not have a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the trial. The main outcome measured in the trial was whether a trial participant had a first case of COVID-19 after receiving Evusheld or placebo and before day 183 of the trial. In this trial, 3,441 people received Evusheld and 1,731 received a placebo. In the primary analysis, Evusheld recipients saw a 77% reduced risk of developing COVID-19 compared to those who received a placebo, a statistically significant difference. In additional analyses, the reduction in risk of developing COVID-19 was maintained for Evusheld recipients through six months. The safety and effectiveness of Evusheld for use in the pre-exposure prevention of COVID-19 continue to be evaluated.Under the EUA, fact sheets that provide important information about using Evusheld in pre-exposure prevention of COVID-19 as authorized must be made available to health care providers and to patients and caregivers. These fact sheets include dosing instructions, potential side effects and drug interactions.  Possible side effects of Evusheld include: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), bleeding at the injection site, headache, fatigue and cough.  Serious cardiac adverse events were infrequent in PROVENT. However, more trial participants had serious cardiac adverse events (such as myocardial infarction and heart failure) after receiving Evusheld compared to placebo. These participants all had risk factors for cardiac disease or a history of cardiovascular disease before participating in the clinical trial. It is not clear if Evusheld caused these cardiac adverse events. The FDA is working with sponsors of all currently authorized therapeutics to assess the activity against any global SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) of interest and is committed to communicating with the public as we learn more.The EUA was issued to AstraZeneca.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/long-held-belief-on-eye-immunity-turned-on-its-head-356650,Long Held Belief on Eye Immunity Turned on Its Head Immune cells could be doing much more than we think in protecting our eyes  previously thought to be immune privileged  researchers uncover new details  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. There s a lot that our eyes have to protect themselves from   dust and debris; viruses and bacteria; chemicals from things we use every day like soaps and lotions; ultraviolet radiation from the sun; and hours of looking at computer screens or devices. It might be surprising then to learn that parts of the eye that are central to vision   the lens, cornea and retina   are immune privileged, meaning they lack immune cells and the protection they offer. But then how do these critical tissues protect themselves? A few years ago, Sue Menko, PhD, professor of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology at Thomas Jefferson University and researchers in her lab were studying a mouse that was engineered to lack a key protein required for the perfectly clear structure of the lens. As they expected, without this protein, the lens was malformed. But to their surprise, they also observed immune cells in the lens trying to fix the damage. This was the first time immune cells had been found to be recruited to the lens, and it challenged decades of scientific dogma. Building on their evidence, last year the Menko lab, in a collaboration with Mary Ann Stepp s lab at George Washington University, found that when the cornea was wounded, immune cells travelled to the surface of the lens to protect from further damage.Now in a new study published in The FASEB Journal on Dec 7th, the researchers show that immune cells respond to the lens, not just following an acute injury in the eye, but also to long-lasting inflammation. In collaboration with Dr. Rachel Caspi s lab at the National Eye Institute and the Stepp lab, they studied a mouse model of uveitis, a form of eye inflammation triggered by infection or injury, and is considered to be an autoimmune disease like diabetes. Left untreated, uveitis can lead to a number of complications, including retinal scarring, glaucoma and cataracts of the lens. However, because the lens was thought for so long to have immune privilege, the role of immune cells in cataracts associated with uveitis has never been explored. Dr. Menko and her lab used high-resolution microscopy to look at the whole eye and the surface of the lens. The first thing the researchers wanted to know was, do immune cells interact with the lens in this experimental model of uveitis? They were shocked at what they saw.  In our previous study in which the cornea was wounded, we saw a small number of immune cells on the surface of the lens, acting almost like sentinels,  says Dr. Menko.  In this case, it was like a battering ram. There were dozens of immune cells, and different types of them, including T-cells and macrophages. It s clearly a robust immune response and could reflect in part that inflammation in uveitis is so severe.  The researchers then monitored this immune response to the lens over the course of 26 days, as inflammation sets in at day 14, reaches its peak at day 19 and begins to resolve by day 26. Using their high-powered microscopes, they observed different regions of the lens  surface. On either side of the lens are two fluid-filled chambers   the aqueous humor at the front of the eye between the lens and the cornea, and the vitreous humor at the back of the eye, separating the lens and the retina. In uveitis, one or both chambers become filled with immune cells. However, it s been thought that the lens is protected from these immune cells by the thick protein-rich layer that surrounds it, called the lens capsule. JodiRae DeDreu, a PhD student in Dr. Menko s lab at Jefferson and first author of the study, stained the lens with fluorescent markers to label a protein that makes up the capsule in red, immune cells in green and their nuclei in blue. She then captured high resolution images and used imaging software to create 3D renderings of the capsule to detect changes in its structure. The software allowed her to look at all three colors at the same time, remove one or two, or make one of the colors transparent.  When we look at the colors together, we see these blue dots, which are the nuclei of the immune cells, sticking out of the red surface of the lens capsule,  explainsDeDreu.  When you take away the blue nuclei, we see these deep pits or divots along the capsule. This is evidence that the immune cells are actually integrating into the lens capsule, which had never been shown before.  Not only do the number of divots increase over time from day 14 to day 19, but also become deeper, indicative of increasing invasion into the lens capsule as the disease progresses. Their collaborators in Dr. Stepp s lab confirmed this by using a scanning electron microscope, which can capture detailed changes on the surface of the lens capsule. They found many bumps, indicating regions where immune cells had become integrated within the lens capsule. This correlated with the fluorescent labeling results from the Menko lab. Immune cells are well-equipped to get to places where there might be damage or infection, secreting enzymes that break down tissues that are in the way. But are they able to get past the thick lens capsule? In a surprising finding, the researchers found that some immune cells were able to do so and actually infiltrate into the lens tissue.  Till now, the mechanisms for damage that happen in this region of the eye after uveitis have been poorly understood,  says Dr. Menko.  For the first time, we ve been able to provide evidence that immune cells could be driving this damage, particularly to the lens.  It also opens up possibilities of understanding lens pathology in other eye diseases like glaucoma. Interestingly, they also found that even after uveitis begins to resolve at day 26 and the majority of immune cells were gone, there were still some that remained integrated on the surface of the lens capsule and infiltrated into the lens tissue itself.  Why are these cells sticking around? Are they providing some continued surveillance, or could they predispose the eye to future inflammation?  asks Dr. Menko.  And what is the ultimate fate of these cells?  These questions form the foundation of future studies for the Menko lab, and the answers to them could reveal important new roles of immune cells in the eye. Importantly, their work thus far underscores that the presence of immune cells in the eye is much more complex than previously thought.Reference DeDreu JR et al.

And more options are almost certainly on the way. In a study reported in ACS Food Science & Technology, one team has developed a new combination of plant-based ingredients tailored for 3D printing meat alternatives. Their most successful recipes required an odd-sounding addition: cocoa butter, derived from cocoa beans of chocolate fame.From animal welfare to environmental sustainability, there are plenty of reasons people choose to avoid eating meat derived from animals. Many current meat alternatives rely on plant-based proteins, most often from soy and wheat, which can readily mimic the texture and nutritional value of the real thing. While 3D printing has already been tested for meat alternatives, none of the current formulations include proteins from these particular plants. So, Songbai Liu and Shanshan Wang wanted to figure out an approach to making a meat  dough  with soy and wheat protein that could be produced effectively with a 3D printer. The researchers tested soy and wheat proteins in formulations containing several other ingredients using a 3D printer. They evaluated their concoctions based on the accuracy with which the dough could be laid down by the printer and how well it held its form. They also examined its texture and microstructure. The experiments revealed the importance of several additional ingredients, including the emulsifier Tween-80 and sodium alginate to control the texture. Heat-sensitive cocoa butter turned out to be a particularly important ingredient, making the dough more fluid at warm temperatures for printing, but then hardening afterward at room temperature, allowing the dough to retain its printed shape. One drawback, however, is that people who cannot eat wheat gluten or soy because of allergies or celiac disease would not be able to partake of the new alternatives. To address this issue, the researchers attempted to replace the soy protein with that from peas, but the resulting dough was too soft for printing. Even so, these experiments have identified a new strategy for formulating meat alternatives using this versatile technology, according to the researchers.Reference Wang S, Liu S. 3D Printing of Soy Protein- and Gluten-Based Gels Facilitated by Thermosensitive Cocoa Butter in a Model Study.

A new pre-print study shared by Professor Alex Sigal s laboratory at the Africa Health Research Institute is the first scientific data to be published on Omicron. The research by Sigal and colleagues investigated whether the variant escapes neutralization triggered by the mRNA-based vaccine, BNT162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech). The team also explored whether Omicron neutralizes the ACE2 receptor to infect host cells. Let s break down the findings.  The individuals that had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection did so in the first wave of the pandemic in South Africa, during which the prominent form of the virus was D614G.Plasma samples were collected from each of the 12 participants.   Geometric mean titer (GMT) FRNT50 (inverse of the plasma dilution required for 50% reduction in infection foci number) was 1321 for D614G,  the authors write in the paper. These samples therefore had very strong neutralization capabilities against this variant of SARS-CoV-2.So what happens when the samples are tested against Omicron? GMT FRNT50 for the same samples was 32 for Omicron, a 41-fold decline,  the authors write.While this figure might seem frightening, the researchers emphasize that neutralization escape by Omicron was not incomplete; five of the participants that had been previously infected   in addition to being vaccinated   demonstrated seemingly high neutralization titers against Omicron.Sigal took to Twitter to express some relief that the data is  better than expected of Omicron .

Now Harvard Medical School and MIT researchers, working with mouse models, may have found the connection: When a mother experiences an infection during pregnancy and her immune system produces elevated levels of the molecule Interleukin-17a (IL-17a), that can not only alter brain development in her fetus, but also alter her microbiome such that after birth the newborn s immune system can become primed for future inflammatory attacks.In four studies beginning in 2016, study co-senior authors Gloria Choi of MIT and Jun Huh of Harvard have traced how elevated IL-17a during pregnancy acts on neural receptors in a specific region of the fetal brain to alter circuit development, leading to autism-like behavioral symptoms in mouse models. The new research published Dec. 7 in Immunity shows how IL-17a can act to also alter the trajectory of immune system development. We ve shown that IL-17a acting on the fetal brain can induce autism-like behavioral phenotypes such as social deficits,  said Choi, Mark Hyman Jr. Career Development Associate Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.  Now we are showing that the same IL-17a in mothers, through changes in the microbiome community, produces comorbid symptoms such as a primed immune system. The researchers caution that the study findings are yet to be confirmed in humans, but that they do offer a hint that central nervous and immune system problems in individuals with autism-spectrum disorders share an environmental driver: maternal infection during pregnancy. There has been no mechanistic understanding of why patients with a neurodevelopmental disorder have a dysregulated immune system,  said Huh, an Associate Professor of Immunology at Harvard Medical School.  We ve tied these fragmented links together. It may be that the reason is that they were exposed to this increase in inflammation during pregnancy. Eunha Kim and Donggi Paik of Huh s lab are the study s co-lead authors.The question then became how MIA moms have this postnatal effect on pups. Other studies have found that the maternal microbiome can influence the immune system development of offspring. To test whether that was the case in the MIA model, the researchers examined stool from MIA and control mice and found that the diversity of the microbial communities were significantly different.Then to determine whether these differences played a causal role, they raised a new set of female mice in a  germ-free  environment, meaning that they do not carry any microbes in or on their body. Then the scientists transplanted stool from MIA or control moms into these germ-free moms and bred them with males. Unlike with the controls, pups born to MIA-stool-transferred moms exhibited the intestinal inflammation. These results indicated that the altered microbiome of MIA moms leads to the immune priming of offspring. Among the notable differences the team measured in the intestinal inflammation response was an increase in IL-17a production by immune system T cells. IL-17a is the same cytokine whose levels are upregulated in MIA moms. When the scientists looked at T cells from MIA-microbiome-exposed offspring vs. control offspring they found that in MIA-offspring, CD4 T cells were more likely to differentiate into Th17 cells, which release IL-17a.That prompted them to look at potential differences in how the CD4 T cells of the different groups transcribe their genes. MIA-microbiome-exposed CD4 T cells exhibited higher expression of genes for T cell activation, suggesting they were more primed for T cell-dependent immune responses in response to infections. Thus, increase in IL-17a in moms during pregnancy leads to susceptibility to produce more IL-17a in offspring upon an immune challenge,  Choi said.Having established that the immune system of offspring can become mis-primed by exposure to the altered microbiome of a mother who was infected during pregnancy, the remaining question was how that microbiome becomes altered in the first place. Suspecting IL-17a, the team tested the effects of antibodies that block the cytokine. When they blocked IL-17a in moms prior to immune activation, their offspring did not exhibit the intestinal inflammation later in life. This also held true when the researchers repeated the experiment of transplanting MIA stool to germ-free moms, this time including stool from MIA-moms with IL-17a blockers. Again, blocking IL-17a amid maternal infection led to a microbiome that did not mis-prime the immune system of offspring. ","Published: December 8, 2021"

The study, published in eLife, paves the way for an understanding of the underlying neuronal mechanisms behind this efficiency and for the development of artificial intelligence systems based on similar principles.The brains of human beings at rest are supposed to use a fifth of the energy produced by their bodies, i.e., about 20 W of power. In fact, the cost would be much more if our brains were not equipped with an efficient coding mechanism that allows us to represent only the information which is really useful in the vast, ongoing stream of sensory stimuli. A new study conducted by SISSA and the University of Pennsylvania, published in eLife, shows the existence of similar efficient coding processes for visual stimuli in rodents. The results add support to the important efficient coding theory of sensory perception, and pave the way towards new experimental approaches for understanding underlying neuronal mechanisms and the development of new training protocols for artificial vision systems.In the early 60s, British scientist Horace Barlow proposed the efficient coding hypothesis.  According to this theory our brain can efficiently represent sensory information using a neural code that minimizes the number of impulses, and thus the energy, necessary to encode and transmit the information,  explains Davide Zoccolan, Director of the Visual Neuroscience Laboratory at the Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati   SISSA.  This happens in particular in the visual system, because of the decreasing number of neurons in the deeper areas of the cortex that reduces the representational capacity. According to information theory, which underpins the efficient coding hypothesis, an efficient sensory system should preferentially allocate computational resources to represent those statistical features of the environment that are more informative about its state. In the case of the visual system, this means encoding the most informative features of the natural images that surround us.Vijay Balasubramanian, a computational neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, has been working on this topic over the past decade:  We analyzed thousands of images of natural landscapes by transforming them into binary images, made up of black and white pixels, and decomposing them into different textures defined by specific statistics , says the researcher.  We noticed that different kinds of textures have different variability in nature and human subjects are better at recognizing those which vary the most. It is as if our brains assign resources where they are most necessary. Until now there was no proof that similarly efficient perceptions of visual textures occur in other species. In a new study, published in eLife, the teams of Zoccolan and Balasubramanian have established that the effect occurs in rodents.Riccardo Caramellino, first author of the study, together with Andrea Buccellato and Anna Carboncino, trained the animals to discriminate binary images made of random black and white pixels from textures created according to specific probabilistic criteria, as was previously done with human subjects. They then analyzed the results using a mathematical model of an  ideal observer  developed by Eugenio Piasini, co-first author of the paper. The scientists observed that rodents, like humans, are most sensitive to the textures that vary the most in nature. We have found, in rodents, a pattern of perceptual sensitivity for visual textures that is consistent with efficient coding and is the same as the one previously observed in humans, despite the phylogenetic distance between these species. This result suggests that efficient texture coding may be a universal principle in vision,  Zoccolan comments.  The visual system seems to adapt to the surrounding environment through a sort of passive exposure, becoming specialized in the recognition of signals which are more informative, thus allowing considerable saving of computational resources and energy. Our study paves the way for new experimental approaches to investigate the neuronal mechanisms behind this fundamental process. It also suggests new ways of training artificial vision systems, based on the same principle. Reference: Caramellino R, Piasini E, Buccellato A, Carboncino A, Balasubramanian V, Zoccolan D.

One part of the temporal lobe, called the dentate gyrus, has long been suspected to work as a gate   helping to manage brain activity by getting choosy about which patterns of brain cells are active and which are silenced. You can think of each pattern as representing one memory,  says Antoine Madar, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, who conducted the research while earning his doctorate at UW Madison in the lab of neuroscience Professor Matt Jones.  One pattern represents the first time you visited an art museum. Another, similar pattern is going to represent the second time you went to the museum. The unique features of each memory may be subtle   from the specific art you admired, different friends along for the experience or even the time of day   but they are important for guiding specific recollections. Researchers like Madar suspected the dentate gyrus helps to discriminate between similar memories, withholding all but the appropriate patterns to prevent confusion. In epilepsy, there is this huge rewiring of the dentate gyrus. Some cells die, some new neurons and new connections between neurons are added in the wrong places  Madar says.  It s a dramatic difference from a healthy dentate gyrus. This rewiring, along with molecular changes inside each cell, allows seizures to develop. But it s unclear what effect this reorganization of the dentate gyrus has on memory.With the help of UW Madison neurologists Bruce Hermann and Rama Maganti, the researchers studied patients in the UW School of Medicine and Public Health s Epilepsy Monitoring Unit, asking them to take image recognition tests. These tests revealed the trouble they had discriminating between similar memories relative to healthy people of similar age and gender.The researchers also studied a mouse model of epilepsy and tested their memory by releasing them repeatedly into an arena with a pair of identical objects. Each time a mouse returned to the arena, one of the objects had been moved to a different location. Normal mice noticed and acted like something was different. They spent extra time exploring the object that was in a new location,  says Jones, whose work is supported by the National Institutes of Health.  Mice with epilepsy explored, but they did not show a preference for any object; they behaved as if nothing had changed, confusing the new situation with their memory of the old one. Looking for the cause of that confusion, Madar examined brain tissue taken from the mice that had undergone memory testing. With a series of specific electrical pulses, he stimulated the nerve fibers that serve as inputs to the dentate gyrus and recorded the patterns of neuronal activity at the output of the dentate gate.In healthy mice, similar input patterns were transformed by the dentate gyrus network into easily distinguishable patterns of output activity. The input patterns simulated different but similar memories. In epileptic mice, that process was broken. A subset of the neurons was not doing its job to separate patterns. Instead of transmitting a single impulse from Madar s electrodes, the epileptic neurons would pass along bursts of pulses. We wonder if the same deficits in dentate gyrus function that cause memory problems are simultaneously causing susceptibility to these seizures,  Jones says.  That abnormal activity leads to over-excitation, and that s how seizures happen. The new study, which received support from the Madison-based Lily's Fund for Epilepsy Research, improves our understanding of the mechanisms of memory, linking the biological function of the dentate gyrus and the ability to avoid memory confusion. This could lead to better care for patients with epilepsy and similar disorders that feature memory impairments or seizures, especially if the new findings help researchers differentiate between brain cells that are damaged and those that retain normal function. Identifying markers to specifically target pathological neurons could allow treatment of both seizures and memory symptoms with fewer side effects than current anti-seizure drugs,  Madar says.Because memory problems often precede the seizure that leads to an epilepsy diagnosis, they could be used to diagnose patients earlier. Take a person who's had a head injury: They could evaluate their own memory regularly, using inexpensive and noninvasive computer-based tests like we used,  Jones says.  If they start showing progressive deficits, a clinician could propose treatment to make sure they never have a first seizure. Reference: Madar AD, Pfammatter JA, Bordenave J, et al.

The metal-organic framework, a mixture of metal (zinc) and carbonate ions, and a small organic molecule (an imidazole, a colourless solid compound that is soluble in water) not only keeps the payload attached to the antibody but can also acts as a reservoir of personalised therapeutics. This is a benefit with the potential to become a new medical tool to target specific diseases with customised drugs and optimised doses.The findings are now published in the world-leading journal Advanced Materials.Co-senior author Professor Christoph Hagemeyer, Head of the NanoBiotechnology Laboratory at the Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, says while more funding is needed to take the research into the next phase and to patients, the new method is cheaper, faster and more versatile than anything available currently.   The method offers the opportunity to personalise treatment and given the precision possible, may eventually change the current dosage needed for patients, resulting in fewer side effects and making treatments cheaper,  said Professor Hagemeyer.Co-first author Dr Karen Alt, Head of the Nano Theranostics Laboratory at the Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, says:  With just 0.01 per cent of chemotherapy currently reaching the cancer tissue, this revolutionary new method can boost the potency of the drugs reaching their target. With over 80 different monoclonal antibodies approved for clinical use, this approach has enormous potential to improve these antibodies for the targeted delivery of diagnostic agents and therapeutic drugs. The goal is that ultimately the clinical translation of this technology will improve the quality of life for patients suffering from serious diseases,  said Dr Alt.Reference: Alt K, Carraro F, Jap E, et al.

The study involved the use of mathematical models to untangle the complex genetic and molecular interactions that occur in the two types of breast cancer, but could be extended to find ways for treating many others. The study s findings were published in the journal Cancer Research.Basal-like tumours are the most aggressive type of breast cancer, with the worst prognosis. Chemotherapy is the only available treatment option, but patients experience high recurrence rates. On the other hand, luminal-A breast cancer responds well to drugs that specifically target a receptor on their cell surfaces, called estrogen receptor alpha (ER ).KAIST systems biologist Kwang-Hyun Cho and colleagues analyzed the complex molecular and genetic interactions of basal-like and luminal-A breast cancers to find out if there might be a way to switch the former to the latter and give patients a better chance to respond to treatment.To do this, they accessed large amounts of cancer and patient data to understand which genes and molecules are involved in the two types. They then input this data into a mathematical model that represents genes, proteins and molecules as dots and the interactions between them as lines. The model can be used to conduct simulations and see how interactions change when certain genes are turned on or off.  There have been a tremendous number of studies trying to find therapeutic targets for treating basal-like breast cancer patients,  says Cho.  But clinical trials have failed due to the complex and dynamic nature of cancer. To overcome this issue, we looked at breast cancer cells as a complex network system and implemented a systems biological approach to unravel the underlying mechanisms that would allow us to reprogram basal-like into luminal-A breast cancer cells.  Using this approach, followed by experimental validation on real breast cancer cells, the team found that turning off two key gene regulators, called BCL11A and HDAC1/2, switched a basal-like cancer signalling pathway into a different one used by luminal-A cancer cells. The switch reprograms the cancer cells and makes them more responsive to drugs that target ER  receptors. However, further tests will be needed to confirm that this also works in animal models and eventually humans. Our study demonstrates that the systems biological approach can be useful for identifying novel therapeutic targets,  says Cho.The researchers are now expanding its breast cancer network model to include all breast cancer subtypes. Their ultimate aim is to identify more drug targets and to understand the mechanisms that could drive drug-resistant cells to turn into drug-sensitive ones.

Only a limited number of biomarkers were found to be significantly upregulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, compared to patients with influenza. The presence of the IFI27 gene was a reliable prediction of severe lung inflammation,  Dr Tan said. Our multi-cohort follow up study, has shown that expression of the IFI27 biomarker in COVID-19 patients can predict disease progression and is strongly associated with disease severity .Associate Professor Melissa Davis said the discovery would pave the way for a diagnostic test to be developed, so patients who were at high-risk of severe COVID-19 could be triaged and treated early.  When a patient presents to a clinic, we could assess how severe their symptoms will become by measuring the IF127 levels in the blood   regardless of the symptoms they re presenting,  Associate Professor Davis said. Such early detection of high-risk patients will help improve patient triage; not only during the current pandemic, but potentially future viral pandemics as well.  Associate Professor Davis said the new Nanostring GeoMX technology and the analysis approaches developed by her team, had been crucial in better understanding how COVID-19 affects lung tissue. We used a technique called spatial transcriptomics, which enables us to add extra dimensions to the information we can gather from samples,  she said. It can account for location and tissue diversity in a way that is not possible with other technologies. In this case, it provides a deeper picture of cellular changes driven by viral infection. It allowed us to define the host response to the virus and the spatial relationships between the lung and virally infected cells. Reference: Kulasinghe A, Tan CW, Miggiolaro AFR dos S, et al.

The research  Pluripotent stem cells related to embryonic disc exhibit common self-renewal requirements in diverse livestock species has been published today in the journal Development and was funded by BBSRC, EU (ERC), MRC and Wellcome Trust.The chemically defined conditions are growth medium suitable for the in vitro cell culture of animal cells in which all of the chemical components are known. Standard cell culture media commonly consist of a basal medium supplemented with animal serum (such as fetal bovine serum, FBS) as a source of nutrients and other ill-defined factors. The technical disadvantages to using serum include its undefined nature, batch-to-batch variability in composition, and the risk of contamination so this new chemically defined approach provides greater consistency and safety, making it an ideal solution for manufacturing new lab grown food products.Professor Ramiro Alberio led the research and explains:  The ability to derive and maintain livestock stem cells under chemically defined conditions paves the way for the development of novel food products, such as cultured meat . The cell lines we developed are a step change from previous models as they have the unique ability to permanently grow to make muscle and fat. These novel cell lines can differentiate into multiple cell types, they can be genetically manipulated using Crispr/Cas9 gene editing tool and can be used as donors for nuclear transfer. This technology offers new opportunities for expanding research into gene editing animals to improve their productivity, and adaptation to to climate change and modifications of diets to reduce the environmental impact of livestock production. Professor Alberio adds:  Gene editing in this way makes modifications that could happen naturally over a long time but in a selective a rapid manner to customize specific traits. This can accelerate the pace of genetic selection of livestock and cultured meat to improve productivity and creation of healthier foods. With a growing population to feed in a changing climate finding reliable and sustainable food is vital. This research offers potential solutions that the food industry could use at scale.

Now, researchers from Japan have found a bacterial signature that marks the shift from healthy teeth and gums to periodontitis.In a study published in mSystems, researchers from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) have revealed that specific bacterial signatures differentiate healthy mouths from those with gingivitis and periodontitis.Periodontal disease is inflammation of the gums caused by infection with many different kinds of bacteria. The infection begins at the gum line and then makes its way down into the bones of the jaw, where it can cause permanent damage and tooth loss. Previous studies have explored the differences in bacterial communities in healthy mouths or those affected by gingivitis or periodontitis,  says lead author of the study Takashi Nemoto.  However, it was unclear how the metabolic activities of these communities changed during the progression from health to periodontitis, so we wanted to investigate the functional profiles of these communities. To do this, the researchers took plaque samples from three sites within the mouths of 21 patients with periodontal disease: from a healthy site, from a site showing gingivitis, and from a site with periodontitis. They then performed a specialized analysis called metatranscriptomic analysis to determine what functional substances the bacteria at these sites were producing, as well as a lineage analysis to determine what types of bacteria were present at these sites. The results showed clear differences in both bacterial community composition and functional profiles between health and diseased sites,  explains Takanori Iwata, senior author.  Importantly, we found that the transcriptional activity of taxa including Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium saphenum, Filifactor alocis, and Fretibacterium fastidiosum was higher than that of well-known periodontopathic bacteria (red complex; Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola) at diseased sites than at healthy sites, and as gingivitis progressed to periodontitis. These changes indicate that these taxa are associated with the progression of periodontal disease, and that dynamic changes occur in the oral microbiome as periodontal disease worsens. The changes that we observed in the transcriptional activity of these taxa with disease progression show that the shift from health to periodontitis is accompanied by changes in both the structure and the complexity of the bacterial network,  says Nemoto.Given that gingivitis is reversible, but periodontitis is not, the identification of key bacterial species and functions involved in the progression from a healthier state to a diseased state could help prevent permanent damage.Reference: Nemoto T, Shiba T, Komatsu K, et al.

A new study now demonstrates the therapeutic potential of an unusual class of immune proteins: miniature antibodies derived from llamas, called nanobodies. Rockefeller scientists Michael P. Rout and Brian T. Chait and their colleagues at the Seattle Children s Research Institute selected a repertoire of over one hundred nanobodies based on their potency and ability to target different parts of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.Produced by immunized llamas, the nanobodies were shown to neutralize the original coronavirus and several of its variants, including Delta, with high efficacy in lab tests. Studies to assess their potency against the new Omicron variant are underway.  The researchers hope that a nanobody combination could be developed into a COVID treatment that is effective against both current and future variants.   Based on the way our nanobodies bind to the virus, we are hopeful that many will remain effective, perhaps even against Omicron,  Rout says.  We should have those results soon.  The findings are published in the journal eLife.  The path to a new treatment  A human antibody is a chunky formation of two protein chains. But llamas, camels, and other species of the Camelidae family make antibodies consisting of only one protein.   To obtain the nanobodies, the researchers took blood samples from llamas who had received small doses of coronavirus proteins similar to a vaccine. They then sequenced the DNA corresponding to diverse nanobodies produced by the llamas  immune system and expressed these genes in bacteria to produce large amounts of the nanobodies for lab analysis. Nanobodies that showed desired properties were then selected and further tested to identify those most capable of neutralizing the virus. [Read more about the llamas that participated in the research]  The small size of nanobodies allows them to access hard-to-reach spots on the SARS-CoV-2 virus that larger antibodies may be unable to access. It also allows researchers to combine nanobodies capable of hitting different parts of the virus, minimizing its chances of escape.   One of the most amazing things we observed with the nanobodies is that they show extraordinary synergy,  Chait says.  The combined effect is much greater than the sum of its parts.  The researchers  next plan is to test the safety and efficacy of the nanobodies in animal studies.   Besides being small and nimble, nanobodies are also inexpensive to mass-produce in yeast or bacteria. Moreover, they are remarkably stable. The ability of these molecules to withstand high temperatures and long storage times means that they could be developed into a drug accessible in various settings worldwide.

While this technology is still exclusively applied in lab settings, it could be used both to edit and to track edited microbes within a natural community, such as in the gut or on the roots of a plant where hundreds or thousands of different microbes congregate. Such tracking becomes necessary as scientists talk about genetically altering microbial populations: inserting genes into microbes in the gut to fix digestive problems, for example, or altering the microbial environment of crops to make them more resilient to pests.Without a way to track the gene insertions   using a barcode, in this case   such inserted genes could end up anywhere, since microbes routinely share genes among themselves. Breaking and changing DNA within isolated microorganisms has been essential to understanding what that DNA does,  said UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow Benjamin Rubin.  This work helps bring that fundamental approach to microbial communities, which are much more representative of how these microbes live and function in nature. While the ability to  shotgun  edit many types of cells or microbes at once could be useful in current industry-scale systems   bioreactors for culturing cells in bulk, for example, the more immediate application may be as a tool in understanding the structure of complex communities of bacteria, archaea and fungi, and gene flow within these diverse populations. Eventually, we may be able to eliminate genes that cause sickness in your gut bacteria or make plants more efficient by engineering their microbial partners,  said postdoctoral fellow Brady Cress.  But likely, before we do that, this approach will give us a better understanding of how microbes function within a community. Rubin and Cress   both in the lab of CRISPR-Cas9 inventor Jennifer Doudna   and Spencer Diamond, a project scientist in the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI), are co-first authors of a paper describing the technique that appeared today (Dec. 6) in the journal Nature Microbiology.The researchers hope to employ the technique to understand artificial, simple communities, such as a plant and its associated microbiome, in a closed box. They can then manipulate community genes within this closed system and track the effect on their bar-coded microbes. These experiments are one aspect of a 10-year program funded by the Department of Energy called m-CAFEs, for Microbial Community Analysis and Functional Evaluation in Soils, which seeks to understand the response of a simple grass microbiome to external changes.

We found that virus was accurately detected by the rapid antigen test in 87% of patients with COVID-19 symptoms and in 71% of those who were asymptomatic   rates that surprised us because they were so high,  says study lead author Zishan Siddiqui, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  This is a significant finding because the rapid test offers a number of advantages over the PCR test, including time savings, both in sampling and processing; cost savings; and most importantly, ease of distribution and application   basically anywhere   which can help overcome COVID testing disparities in medically underserved communities. The first step for both the PCR and rapid antigen tests is obtaining a sample from a patient, either a nasal swab or a bit of saliva. The difference lies in how the sample is processed and analyzed. A PCR test takes a tiny bit of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material from a sample and reproduces it thousands of times so it can be more easily detected. A rapid antigen test uses laboratory-produced antibodies to seek out and latch onto proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the sample.The PCR test requires a skilled laboratory technician, special equipment and up to an hour or more to process. Additionally, testing on a massive scale can only be conducted at a large, centralized testing facility, such as a hospital laboratory.On the other hand, rapid antigen testing uses a premade kit with a reagent that contains antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2. The test can be conducted by anyone after brief training, can be administered anywhere and provides results in approximately 15 minutes.The question that the new study hoped to answer was which test could be most broadly, most quickly and most effectively applied to a large community such as Baltimore.To do this, the researchers administered both the rapid antigen and PCR detection methods to just over 6,000 people who came to the Baltimore field hospital for COVID testing between Dec. 23, 2020, and Jan. 11, 2021. Participants were screened for possible exposure to the coronavirus and COVID-19 symptoms. Staff members performing the tests were trained exactly the same and monitored during test administration to ensure quality control and reliable results. What we determined was that while the PCR test may be a better test from a clinical perspective   as it s basically 100% accurate at detecting SARS-CoV-2   the rapid antigen test appears to be better from a public health standpoint because of its ease of use, and the fact that it proved to have sufficient accuracy, specificity and reliability for detecting the coronavirus in a high-volume setting,  says study senior author James Ficke, M.D., professor of orthopaedic surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and co-director of the BCCFH for 16 months.  The field hospital was the perfect place to determine this because we could see how well both tests worked for a large number of people in a short amount of time. Operated since April 2020 as a collaboration between Johns Hopkins Medicine, the University of Maryland Medical System and the Maryland Department of Health, the BCCFH provided COVID-19 testing, monoclonal antibody infusion therapy and vaccinations to Baltimore-area residents, including those in medically underserved communities. The ability of the BCCFH to test people who would traditionally have had limited access to such procedures was critical for our study because it also enabled us to see if rapid antigen or PCR testing was the best means of tackling that disparity,  says Ficke.  That s important, because the more we can get tests out to all members of the community, the stronger our effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The study findings have been put to good use from the beginning, says Siddiqui. The accuracy of the rapid antigen test was mostly unknown when we started the study in December 2020,  says Siddiqui.  We shared our findings with the Maryland Department of Health and in scientific meetings a month later, and before the results of any similar studies were available. I believe this influenced the state s strategy on how best to use the rapid antigen tests available to them. What made this study so valuable, adds Ficke, were the  perfect location and team  conducting it   a field hospital that became one of the largest COVID testing sites in the nation and a solid partnership among Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland, the state of Maryland and the clinicians from the Greater Baltimore area who served there. Our successful program has shown that a health care system can provide an equitable response to COVID-19 because the rapid antigen test makes it possible to test all socioeconomic levels of a large population quickly and repeatedly   and this has become the model that the state of Maryland is actively putting into practice and other organizations are starting to follow,  he says.Siddiqui, Ficke and their colleagues are comparing rapid antigen and PCR testing in pediatric patients, with data collected on about 1,000 children so far. They hope to publish their findings early in 2022.In another study, the researchers plan to assess the accuracy of rapid antigen tests being marketed for home use.Reference: Siddiqui ZK, Chaudhary M, Robinson ML, et al.

A new study published in the Journal of Biological Rhythms demonstrates that antibody levels are higher when people receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the afternoon versus the morning.  Our observational study provides proof of concept that time of day affects immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, findings that may be relevant for optimizing the vaccine s efficacy,  said co-senior author Elizabeth Klerman, MD, PhD, research investigator, Division of Neurophysiology, Sleep Unit, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).Symptoms of some diseases and the action of numerous medications vary by time of day. People with lung diseases frequently have greater symptom severity and altered respiratory functiont certain times of the day, for example. A study of elderly men who received influenza vaccination showed that they had higher antibody titers when they received the vaccine in the morning compared with the afternoon.  Trials have shown that administering some chemotherapy agents at a specific time of day will effectively target cancer cells but limit toxicity to other cells,  says Klerman. The authors and others have proposed a role for circadian signaling in regulating SARS-CoV-2 immune responses and COVID-19 severity.The observational study evaluated antibody levels after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among 2,190 healthcare workers in the UK. As part of the UK s infection prevention program, blood samples were collected from asymptomatic hospital workers at the time of vaccination. The researchers created a model to investigate the effect on antibody levels based on time of day of vaccination, vaccine type (Pfizer mRNA vaccine or AstraZeneca adenoviral vaccine), age, sex, and the number of days post-vaccination.The researchers found that antibody responses were higher in general for everyone who was vaccinated later in the day. The antibody responses were also higher in those who received the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, in women, and in younger people, in addition to the effect of time of day of vaccination.The SARS-CoV-2 study contrasts with earlier studies in elderly men that reported higher anti-influenza titers in the morning. Potential reasons for the disparate findings:  The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and the influenza vaccine have different mechanisms of action from each other, and antibody response may vary greatly depending on whether the immune system recognizes the pathogen from earlier infections, such as influenza, or whether it is confronted by a novel virus,  says Klerman.A limitation of the study was the lack of data on participants  medical and medication history, their sleep and shift-work patterns, which can also influence vaccine responses. We need to replicate our findings and develop a better understanding of the underlying physiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the body s response to vaccination(s) before we can recommend that people who want an extra boost from the vaccine, such as older individuals or those who are immunocompromised, schedule their vaccine for the afternoon,  says Klerman.  This research is the first step in demonstrating the importance of time-of-day response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.  Klerman emphasizes that getting vaccinated, regardless of the time of day, is the most critical step in preventing COVID-19 infection.These data also highlight the importance of recording the time of vaccination or any intervention in clinical and research studies.  If preliminary data show a difference in efficacy and adverse effects from a drug or vaccine based on time of day, it would behoove drug companies to administer the drug at the optimal time, which would reduce the number of participants needed to get a statistically significant difference between drug and placebo,  Klerman says.Klerman and her colleagues are currently analyzing data on vaccine side effects from people vaccinated at Mass General Brigham facilities.  If antibody levels are higher when people receive the vaccine in the afternoon, we may see that side effects are also greater,  says Klerman. She also hopes to have the opportunity to reanalyze data from randomized controlled trials of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to determine whether the time of day participants received the vaccine affected efficacy.Reference: Wang W, Balfe P, Eyre DW, et al.

It sheds important light on the question,  How do you know you are remembering something from the past versus experiencing something new that you are trying to remember?  said Dr. Lega, a member of the Peter O Donnell Jr. Brain Institute.The most significant finding was that firing occurs with different timing relative to other brain activity when memories are being retrieved. This slight difference in timing, called  phase offset,  has not been reported in humans before. Together, these results explain how the brain can  re-experience  an event, but also keep track of whether the memory is something new or something previously encoded. This is some of the clearest evidence to date showing us how the human brain works in terms remembering old memories versus forming new memories,  Dr. Lega said.His study identified 103 memory-sensitive neurons in the brain s hippocampus and entorhinal cortex that increase their rate of activity when memory encoding is successful. The same pattern of activity returned when patients attempted to recall these same memories, especially highly detailed memories.This activity in the hippocampus may have relevance to schizophrenia because hippocampal dysfunction underlies schizophrenics  inability to decipher between memories and hallucinations or delusions. The neurons identified by Dr. Lega are an important piece of the puzzle for why this happens, said Carol Tamminga, M.D., Professor and Chair of Psychiatry and a national expert on schizophrenia. Hallucinations and delusions in people with a psychotic illness are actual memories, processed through neural memory systems like  normal  memories, even though they are corrupted. It would be important to understand how to use this  phase offset  mechanism to modify these corrupted memories,  Dr. Tamminga said.An opportunity to learn more about human memory arose from surgeries where electrodes that were implanted in epilepsy s patients  brains to map the patients  seizures could also be used to identify neurons involved in memory. In this study, 27 epilepsy patients who had the electrodes implanted at UT Southwestern and a Pennsylvania hospital participated in memory tasks to generate data for brain research.The data analysis does not conclusively prove, but adds new credibility to important memory model called Separate Phases at Encoding And Retrieval (SPEAR) that scientists developed from rodent studies. It s never been nailed down. It s one thing to have a model; it is another thing to show evidence that this is what s happening in humans,  Dr. Lega said.The SPEAR model, which predicts the  phase offset  reported in the study, was developed to explain how the brain can keep track of new-versus-old experiences when engaged in memory retrieval. Previously, the only evidence in support of SPEAR came from rodent models.Reference: Yoo HB, Umbach G, Lega B.

These so-called  epigenetic clocks  have proved to be better predictors of lifespan and health than chronological age.In a new study, Yale researchers used one such clock, appropriately named  GrimAge,  to ask two questions: How much does chronic stress accelerate that biological clock? And are there ways to slow it down and extend a healthy lifespan?According to their findings, published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, stress does indeed make life s clock tick faster   but that individuals can help manage the effects by strengthening their emotion regulation and self-control.Rajita Sinha, the Foundations Fund Professor of Psychiatry at Yale, a professor of neuroscience and professor at the Yale Child Study Center, and one of the authors of the study, has spent decades studying stress and the myriad and pernicious ways that it erodes our mental and physical health. Prolonged stress, for instance, increases the risk of heart disease, addiction, mood disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder, said Sinha, who is also director of the Yale Interdisciplinary Stress Center. It can influence metabolism, accelerating obesity-related disorders such as diabetes. Stress also saps our ability to regulate emotions and to think clearly.  A Yale team led by Sinha and Zachary Harvanek, a resident in the Yale Department of Psychiatry, decided to explore whether stress also accelerates aging in a relatively young and healthy population. Other co-authors included Ke Xu, an associate professor of psychiatry, and Nia Fogelman, an associate research scientist in psychiatry at Yale.For their study, they enrolled 444 people, ages 19 to 50, who provided blood samples used to evaluate the age-related chemical changes captured by GrimAge as well as other markers of health. The participants also answered questions designed to reveal stress levels and psychological resilience.Even after accounting for demographic and behavioral factors such as smoking, body mass index, race, and income, the researchers found that those who scored high on measures related to chronic stress exhibited accelerated aging markers and physiological changes such as increased insulin resistance.However, stress didn t affect everyone s health to the same degree. Subjects who scored high on two psychological resilience measures   emotion regulation and self-control   were more resilient to the effects of stress on aging and insulin resistance, respectively.  These results support the popular notion that stress makes us age faster,  Harvanek said,  but they also suggest a promising way to possibly minimize these adverse consequences of stress through strengthening emotion regulation and self-control. In other words, the more psychologically resilient the subject, the higher the likelihood they would live a longer and healthier life, he said. We all like to feel like we have some agency over our fate,  Sinha said.  So it is a cool thing to reinforce in people s minds that we should make an investment in our psychological health.

Though they form an active part of the soil food web by occupying lower trophic levels, little is known about their feeding habits. Usually, the feeding habits of soil mesofauna are deeply associated with litter decomposition, and, by extension, with terrestrial carbon cycling. Thus, exploration into the feeding habits and preferences of these minute creatures is essential.However, this kind of research is challenging. Firstly, tiny springtails, which live in the soil matrix, are extremely difficult to observe and study. Secondly, isolating springtail species from the rest of the diverse soil organisms is equally cumbersome. Finally, achieving a sizeable dry mass of springtails for subsequent chemical analysis is also quite challenging.Despite all these difficulties, a group of soil ecologists from Japan were able to apply a  radically new method to determine the feeding habits of springtails. The study led by Dr. Saori Fujii, who is a senior researcher at Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Tsukuba, employed radiocarbon analysis, which involved the use of carbon-14 (14C), to determine the diet age of isolated springtails. The group s findings have been published as a research article in Biology Letters.Speaking about the motivation behind their research, Dr. Fujii explains,  Springtails belong to the group of soil invertebrates that play fundamental roles in litter decomposition by consuming litter and microorganisms. They have important roles in the soil food web as potential preys and determine nutrient and carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Accurately assessing their diets, which is the source of carbon for most soil animals, is essential to pinpoint their functions in ecosystems. We thus went to great lengths to identify and capture springtails for the study.  Accordingly, the group s findings confirmed that springtails  diet is not as  black-and-white . Till date, springtails have been thought of as decomposers that depend mainly on detritus or dead organic matter. However, 14C analysis in this study showed that the food springtails consume is  younger  than any litter. This indicates that springtails rely more on living plants than litter for food. Further, some springtail predators exhibited a younger carbon age than the litter, indicating a non-negligible effect of the feeding habits of the preyed-upon collembolans on the entire soil food web. Interestingly, however, stable 15N isotope values suggested that edaphic species of springtails generally feed on mycorrhizae (fungal association on roots of some plants) to obtain root-derived carbon, rather than directly from the roots. In this regard, Dr. Takashi Haraguchi, who is also one of the lead researchers of this study, and is affiliated with Biodiversity Research Center, RIEAF-Osaka, says,  From the springtails  example, we figured out that the soil food web does not necessarily function as a  brown  food web, derived solely from detritus. Overall, the researchers agree that apart from identifying a novel method to determine feeding habits of enigmatic soil invertebrates, the study also helps to decipher the black box related to the hidden biodiversity and functional differentiation of organisms involved in litter decomposition. As Dr. Ichiro Tayasu of the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, a co-author of the study, concludes,  Our study also provides important clues regarding what determines carbon sequestration and emission, with respect to the soil food webs. This study provides a much-needed unconventional tool to unravel the intricacies of the warp and weft of food webs in nature and digs deeper into the mysterious lives of the denizens of the deep.

Many of these adaptations are mediated through two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) that coordinate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. In a new study reported in the Journal of Bacteriology, researchers at Illinois provide insight into the signal transduction mechanism utilized by the staphylococcal TCS ArlRS in response to host-imposed manganese and glucose starvation. Signal transduction systems, such as ArlRS, play critical roles in allowing pathogens to adapt to the ever-changing environment that pathogens encounter during infection and thus are critical contributors to disease,  said Thomas Kehl-Fie (MMG), an associate professor of microbiology and leader of the study.To limit S. aureus pathogenicity, the host sequesters essential nutrients a process called nutritional immunity such as manganese, zinc, and iron during infection. However, successful pathogens can circumvent this host defense and cause disease. The researchers zeroed in on one mechanism utilized by S. aureus to evade this host response that relies on the ArlRS two-component system, which comprises the histidine kinase ArlS and response regulator protein ArlR. We are particularly interested in elucidating how ArlR is activated, as this response regulator is implicated in the ability of S. aureus to both survive nutrient limitation and coordinate a response that attacks the host immune system,  said Kehl-Fie.   One of the interests of the Kehl-Fie lab is trying to understand how S. aureus resists nutritional immunity,  said Paola P rraga Sol rzano, PhD student in the Kehl-Fie lab and first author of the paper.  Since ArlR was suggested to be activated by other histidine kinases, we wanted to understand if ArlS was necessary for the response of ArlR to manganese and glucose-limited conditions. Although histidine kinases have specific interactions with their cognate response regulators, crosstalk can occur where histidine kinases can activate non-cognate response regulators. In other studies, a non-cognate histidine kinase was shown to activate ArlR, bringing the role of ArlS in resisting nutritional immunity into question.To determine if ArlS is necessary for activation of ArlR, a mutant strain lacking the arlS gene was assessed for their ability to grow and activate ArlR in manganese-starved conditions. These conditions were achieved using calprotectin, an immune effector that sequesters manganese away from pathogens like S. aureus. The study revealed that ArlS is necessary for activation of ArlR under these conditions, said P rraga Sol rzano.Because glucose is the preferred carbon source for S. aureus, P rraga Sol rzano evaluated the role of ArlS in glucose-starved conditions. While ArlR still had a level of activity in the absence of ArlS, ArlS was required for full activation in response to glucose limitation, said P rraga Sol rzano. We were able to understand how these signaling mechanisms work and how S. aureus coordinates responses to stressful conditions normally encountered during infection  said P rraga Sol rzano.  We determined that ArlS is important for the response of S. aureus to both manganese starvation and glucose limitation. Reference: P rraga Sol rzano PK, Shupe AC, Kehl-Fie TE.

Scientists have long been studying how the brain builds its representation of reality through sensory experiences, and how much each sense needs or is influenced by the others in this process.In a new study appearing in iScience, a group of researchers at IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca investigated how, and to what extent, vision influences the development of hearing. To do so, the researchers of Molecular Mind Lab at IMT School recruited for their experiment people with a normal sight and people blind from birth or who had lost sight later in life. The participants had to listen and discriminate different sets of  synthetic sounds , that is to say sounds ri-created on the base of the acoustical features of their natural counterparts. This particular method allowed researchers to control and manipulate all the desired characteristics of sounds, and at the same time realize the tests in conditions similar to the normal life, with participants listening to familiar sounds, such as rain, fire, clapping or typewriting. For the study, the participants listened different sounds, and made a series of choices. For example, they were asked to state which sound was different from the others in a set of acoustic samples, or to discriminate between sources.Contrary from what could be expected based on previous research, according to which hearing is strongly influenced by the lack of vision, congenitally blind people and normal sighted people were equally good at accomplishing these tasks. According to the researchers, this shows that basic auditory processes develop independently from sight; in other words, visual experience is not necessary for the brain to extract fundamental elements from auditory events. The only difference observed was between people blind from birth and people who became blind later in life. In this case, blind individuals had more difficulties in accomplishing the tasks of the experiment, and seem to use the acoustic information differently from sighted people and from congenitally blind. In particular, persons who lost sight later in life seem to process the auditory information  globally , and to pay less attention to details. The researchers are unsure of the cause of this altered processing, but suggest that it could represent a sort of adaptation to the new condition for people who have lost sight, to promptly recognize objects through sounds. Many studies have been conducted to assess the adaptations of the auditory system in case of blindness. This research is the first to combine computational methods allowing to engineer synthetic sounds matching real-world sounds, and thus to precisely control statistical properties of sensory input, with the study of individuals with typical and atypical sensory processing,  says Davide Bottari, researcher in neuroscience at the IMT School and first author of the paper.  The research also provided a novel approach to assess the degree of plasticity of specific computations performed by sensory systems."" Researchers suggest that while the study focused on the auditory domain, similar approaches could be employed for other sensory modalities.Reference:  This article has been republished from materials provided by the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca.

But: some species are a force to be reckoned with   for example, the Latrodectus spider, more commonly known as the Black Widow. It catches its prey by using venom   to be precise, latrotoxins (LaTXs), a subclass of neurotoxins, or nerve poisons. A bite from a Black Widow can be fatal for humans. The exact structure of the nerve poison was previously unclear, but Prof. Christos Gatsogiannis from the Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics at M nster University investigated the substance   not only because of its uniqueness, but also with a view to possible medical applications. Using cryo-EM, and in collaboration with Gatsogiannis  former colleagues at the Max Planck Institute in Dortmund and with researchers at Jacobs University Bremen, the team of M nster researchers succeeded in explaining the first structure of a latrotoxin. The team s findings have now been published in the Nature Communications journal.Neurotoxins are probably known to many non-specialists   in the form of botox, which is often used in cosmetic surgery. The Black Widow s poison, however, has anything but a  beautifying  effect: LaTX was developed by nature primarily in order to immobilise insects   or simply kill them straight off. In the process, the toxins dock onto specific receptors on the surface of nerve cells and cause neurotransmitters to be released, for example through a calcium channel. As a result of the constant inflow of calcium ions into the cell, transmitters are given off which lead to seizures.This mechanism is what distinguishes the latrotoxins from all other variants of the so-called pore-forming toxins.  Despite wide-ranging studies carried out over many years, we didn t know the structure of these toxins,  says Gatsogiannis.  For this reason weren t able to understand the precise active mechanism.  Help was provided in the form of cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM for short. By means of this three-dimensional method, biomolecules can now be  photographed  down to atomic resolution. In the process, the protein complexes in liquid ethane are frozen at minus 196 degrees, in milliseconds, into a thin layer of amorphous ice, a form of solid water. Hundreds and thousands of images are then captured which show different views of the proteins and, in this way, enable the structure of the neurotoxin to be recognised.Using cryo-EM, and in collaboration with researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Dortmund and at Jacobs University Bremen, the team of M nster researchers succeeded in explaining the first structure of a latrotoxin.  The general structure of LaTX is unique and is different in every possible way from all other known toxins,  says Gatsogiannis. The new insights are fundamental for understanding the molecular mechanism of the LaTX family, and they pave the way for possible medical applications   as well as for the development of an efficient antidote. In addition, these insights into insect-specific toxins might open up new opportunities for pesticides. For future research, however, it is essential to understand how exactly the toxin is inserted into the membrane, i.e. into the surface of the cell.  At the moment we are studying the structure of all members of the latrotoxin family   in particular how they exactly recognise the specific receptors on the surface of the cell, and how these sensors function,  Gatsogiannis explains.The biggest obstacle to these plans is the fact that cryo-EM is not yet available in the M nster area. Prof. Gatsogiannis and his team want to change this:  The practical importance for medical research is immense,  says Dr. Minghao Chen, the lead author of the study now published,  as  function  is directly linked to  structure  in a biological context. But the method is highly complex and requires an ultramodern infrastructure.  The research team plans to introduce this innovative method soon in M nster University s new research building, the Center for Soft Nanoscience (SoN).Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Professor John E. Moses and his team have paired a catalyst called  Barton s base  developed in the 1980s with a new family of chemical reactions. This powerful combination results in a chemical transformation that happens within minutes or even seconds. Their new chemistry can accelerate the generation of complex molecules needed for biomedical research, drug development, and materials science. Click chemistry enables chemical building blocks to be joined together quickly, reliably, and cleanly. A click reaction often requires a catalyst to jumpstart it. Barton s base is so powerful that Moses only needs a small trace of it to spark a reaction. Moses says,  Reducing the amount of catalyst needed for a reaction is cost-effective and beneficial to the environment.  The new reaction, called accelerated SuFEx click chemistry (ASCC), also allows multiple steps to be skipped in some synthetic pathways, including the synthesis and purification of intermediate molecules. Moses says,  Removing steps has a huge influence on the amount of waste generated from a reaction. The ASCC method will greatly enhance the  green credentials  of SuFEx click chemistry, especially when applied on an industrial scale. Moses feels a personal connection to Barton s base. He says,  Sir Derek Barton, who first prepared Barton s base in the 1980s, happens to be my academic grandfather.  Barton trained Moses  Ph.D. advisor Sir Jack E. Baldwin at the University of Oxford.

For about a decade, scientists and engineers have been developing sodium batteries, which replace both lithium and cobalt used in current lithium-ion batteries with cheaper, more environmentally friendly sodium. Unfortunately, in earlier sodium batteries, a component called the anode would tend to grow needle-like filaments called dendrites that can cause the battery to electrically short and even catch fire or explode. In one of two recent sodium battery advances from UT Austin, the new material solves the dendrite problem and recharges as quickly as a lithium-ion battery. The team published their results in the journal Advanced Materials.  We re essentially solving two problems at once,  said David Mitlin, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering s Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Research Laboratory who designed the new material.  Typically, the faster you charge, the more of these dendrites you grow. So if you suppress dendrite growth, you can charge and discharge faster, because all of a sudden it s safe.  Graeme Henkelman, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, used a computer model to explain, from a theoretical perspective, why the material has the unique properties it does.  This material is also exciting because the sodium metal anode theoretically has the highest energy density of any sodium anode,  Henkelman said. Demand is rising for stationary energy storage systems for homes and for smoothing out the ebb and flow of wind and solar energy on electric grids. At the same time, lithium mining has been criticized for its environmental impacts, including heavy groundwater use, soil and water pollution and carbon emissions. Lithium-ion batteries typically also use cobalt, which is expensive and mined mostly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it has significant impacts on human health and the environment. By comparison, sodium mining is cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Mitlin is bullish on the idea that this new innovation and others from UT Austin, including a new solid electrolyte that boosts energy storage, will mean sodium batteries may soon be able to fill the growing demand for stationary energy storage. When a rechargeable battery is being charged, ions (such as lithium or sodium) move from one component called the cathode to another called the anode. When the battery is being used to generate electricity, the ions move from the anode back to the cathode. The new anode material, called sodium antimony telluride intermetallic   Na metal composite (NST-Na), is made by rolling a thin sheet of sodium metal onto an antimony telluride powder, folding it over on itself, and repeating many times. Think of making a kind of layered pastry, like spanakopita,  Mitlin said. This process results in a very uniform distribution of sodium atoms that makes it less likely to form dendrites or surface corrosion than existing sodium metal anodes. That makes the battery more stable and allows faster charging, comparable to a lithium-ion battery s charge rate. It also has a higher energy capacity than existing sodium-ion batteries. Henkelman said that if the sodium atoms that carry a charge in a sodium battery bind more strongly to each other than they do to the anode, they tend to form instabilities, or clumps of sodium that attract more sodium atoms and eventually lead to dendrites. He used a computer simulation to reveal what happens when individual sodium atoms interact with the new composite material NST-Na.  In our calculations, this composite binds sodium a little more strongly than sodium binds itself, which is the ideal case for having the sodium atoms come down and evenly spread out on the surface and prevent these instabilities from forming,  Henkelman said.ReferenceWang Y, Dong H, Katyal N, et al.

It generates millions of different antibodies, which are selected to recognise the enemy and trigger the best possible immune response. Scientists use these antibodies to for therapeutic purposes to target proteins and disrupt their harmful. However, identifying the small molecules that will form the basis of the drug is a long and tedious process. Chemists at the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, have developed a technique inspired by the theory of Darwinian evolution: amplifying the best combinations and generating diversity allows biology to find solutions to new problems. They have created a new methodology that rapidly generates millions of combinations of small molecules through programmed assembly using DNA-pairing processes, finding the best possible combination to counter a target protein within two weeks. These results, published in the journal Nature Chemistry, will open up a new and untapped space for drug development.The way drugs work is based on the molecular recognition of a target protein involved in the disease, in order to disarm it. To do this, scientists use high-throughput screening to identify which molecule could become a drug, specifically targeting the protein of interest. Over the last ten years, the technique has been improved by encoding small molecules with DNA tags that simplify their identification, as DNA is easy to decode. ","Published: December 7, 2021"

However, their possible functions in cells have not been discovered.Now, researchers from the Molecular Science Research Hub at Imperial College London have observed a protein called Cockayne Syndrome B (CSB) preferentially interacting with one specific type of G-quadruplex. These special G-quadruplexes arise when distant parts of DNA interact, something that researchers thought was impossible to form within cells.Normally functioning CSB proteins do not cause any ill effects, but mutations of the gene that produce CSB protein can cause the fatal premature ageing disorder Cockayne Syndrome, which kills many sufferers before adulthood.The team found that CSB proteins with mutations that cause Cockayne Syndrome are no longer able to interact with the long-range G-quadruplexes. While we don t yet know why this might be, the team s results, published today in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, suggest that these long-range DNA G-quadruplexes are specifically linked with the functional role of CSB.Lead researcher Dr Marco Di Antonio, from the Department of Chemistry at Imperial, said:  Our genomic DNA is more than two metres long, but is compressed into a space only a few microns in diameter. It shouldn t therefore be a surprise that there are ways the long-range looped structures are leveraged to compress DNA in more complex interactions than we imagined. There is still so much we don t know about DNA, but our results show that how and where G-quadruplex structures form affects their function, making them more important biologically than previously thought. DNA strands are incredibly long and are wound in tight structures to fit inside our cells. Previously, researchers had assumed that G-quadruplexes form only from regions of DNA that sit next to each other. However, the team discovered G-quadruplexes that are formed from parts of the DNA strand that are spatially distant one from the other.It s these G-quadruplexes that specifically interact with the CSB protein. The team shows that CSB could potentially use the G-quadruplexes to link together distant portions of the DNA.Exactly what the interaction results in is yet to be determined, but previous independent research found that cells without CSB have difficulty processing the DNA around sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplexes.The Imperial team have now found that the mutated form of CSB that causes Cockayne Syndrome is specifically attracted to G-quadruplexes that link distant DNA portions. This could mean further study of the mutated CSB gene might reveal the specific biological function of these long-range DNA structures.Next, the researchers want to image the G-quadruplexes and the functional CSB gene bound together to determine exactly what the relationship does: whether the CSB helps the G-quadruplex hold the two distant regions of the DNA together, or whether CSB actually initiates the break-up of G-quadruplexes once they have completed their function, or a combination of both.First author of the study Denise Liano, from the Department of Chemistry at Imperial, said:  There is currently no cure for Cockayne Syndrome. But with further study into how G-quadruplexes and the gene behind Cockayne Syndrome interact we can learn details that will hopefully allow us to discover therapeutic tools, such as designer molecules that can regulate the interaction and fight back against the premature ageing caused by the disease.

Using these models, they have identified Lgr5-expressing tumour cells as the cancer stem cells responsible for driving gastric cancer growth and spread. These findings established Lgr5-expressing tumour cells as a potential therapeutic target, and could pave the way for developing more effective treatments against gastric cancer, one of the top 10 cancers in Singapore.[1]  The research was published in leading scientific journal Nature Cell Biology on 2 December 2021, led by IMCB in collaboration with researchers from A*STAR s Singapore Immunology Network and Genome Institute of Singapore, as well as the Cancer Research Institute of Kanazawa University, Duke-NUS Medical School, National University Health System, and Cancer Science Institute of Singapore at the National University of Singpaore (NUS).The research team identified a marker called Claudin18, that is only expressed on the epithelial lining of the stomach within the gut. Using this new marker, they generated mice producing a Cre enzyme exclusively in the stomach, which facilitated the introduction of cancer-causing mutations specifically within the stomach lining. In parallel, the team developed a transplantation model in which cultured gastric cancer cells are introduced into a healthy mouse stomach. They showed that the advanced cancers generated in these models accurately recapitulate the major disease stages from early tumour growth to invasion and metastasis to other organs including liver, lung and peritoneum, similar to human gastric cancers in their pathology and behaviour.The team also found out that by selectively eliminating a specific subset of the gastric tumours expressing the stem cell marker Lgr5, it effectively reduces the growth and spread of the cancers. These new models will help to decipher gastric cancer progression, identify new disease biomarkers to aid in diagnosis, and evaluate new gastric cancer drugs for more targeted treatment. It's a breakthrough for us to apply our new models of advanced human gastric cancer to identify the specific cells   Lgr5-expressing tumour cells   involved in cancer progression. The discovery of these cells is invaluable for understanding the spread and development of gastric cancers, as well as informing the development of more effective treatments in future,  said Professor Nick Barker, Research Director at A*STAR s IMCB and lead researcher of the study.Building on this work, the team will continue to evaluate the Lgr5-expressing tumour cancer stem cells as a therapeutic target by performing detailed expression analyses in comparison to healthy stem cells. They will also work on identifying changes in gene expression occuring during the various stages of cancer progression, using the models to identify key mechanisms that can be potentially targeted, and novel disease biomarkers for diagnostic applications.Reference: Fatehullah A, Terakado Y, Sagiraju S, et al.

Phages are major bacterial predators, through virus-host interactions with key bacterial populations in AS systems, they can influence the removal efficiency of pollutants. Phages of high specificity could be used to curb undesired bacteria, e.g., the undesired foaming-associated filamentous bacteria that could disrupt the removal efficiency of AS system. Clinically, phage therapy has been demonstrated by other research team as an effective way against the antibiotic resistant superbug Acinetobacter baumannii, and activated sludge in WWTPs is an important source for isolating phages for treating infections to save people s lives. The research team led by Professor Tong Zhang in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) recently applied a systematic metagenomic pipeline to retrieve a catalogue of around 50,000 phages from six WWTPs in Hong Kong. The study reveals the large and uncharacterised prokaryotic viral diversity in activated sludge, and largely expands the current AS prokaryotic virus catalogue to provide reference for utilising phage treatments to control undesired microorganisms in WWTPs. The findings have been published in leading science journal Nature Communications.  Professor Zhang said:  Prokaryotic viruses are so small that people overlooked the roles of them in WWTPs. By uncovering the extensive virus-host interactions in functional microorganisms in WWTPs, this study highlights the potential roles of phages in pollutant removal and environmental protection.  This is the first work globally to explore the connections between functional microorganisms in WWTPs and prokaryotic viruses. Future work will include analysing the dynamics of the phage community of AS in the long term and isolating phages to control undesired bacteria in WWTPs.

The method, which took four years to develop, could pave the way for new types of drugs. The study is published in Journal of the American Chemical Society. Glionitrin A and B are two molecules with properties that make them useful tools in drug development. However, researchers who want to use these molecules have faced an uphill battle for almost a decade. Glionitrin A and B are natural products, and are produced by a fungus found in extremely contaminated acidic wastewater from an abandoned South Korean mine. Since the fungus only creates the molecules when triggered by specific bacteria from the same sewage, it has proved difficult to produce them by fermentation.  We have been working on this problem for four years. Every time we thought we had a solution, the molecules revealed unexpected properties that sent us back to the drawing board , says Daniel Strand, chemistry researcher at Lund University.Despite the complex nature of the problem, the solution proved to be both simpler and more effective than the researchers thought. By developing a new so-called asymmetric organocatalytic reaction, Daniel Strand and his colleagues succeeded in forging the most inaccessible parts of the molecules.  Even when we thought the problem was finally solved, the molecule had one last surprise. It turned out that the real structure was the mirror image of what we initially thought was glionitrin A. So, all this time we and others had chased a molecule that was never there , says Daniel Strand.Complex natural products with unique properties such as glionitrin A and B are important tools in drug development. Glionitrin A has shown antibiotic properties against resistant bacteria, while glionitrin B makes cancer cells less prone to migrate. Being able to produce the molecules synthetically helps researchers not only understand how they work, but also improve their properties. There is a great need for new types of antibiotics, especially those that can contribute to the fight against resistant bacteria. We expect our results to inspire further developments in basic synthetic chemistry but also to be used in drug development , concludes Daniel Strand.Reference: Koning NR, Sundin AP, Strand D.

We started looking at this particular formulation and found that it was incredibly potent, better than almost anything else we had tried,  says Darrell Irvine, the Underwood-Prescott Professor with appointments in MIT s departments of Biological Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering; an associate director of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research; and a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard.The researchers now hope to incorporate the adjuvant into an HIV vaccine that is currently being tested in clinical trials, in hopes of improving its performance.Irvine and Shane Crotty, a professor at the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, are the senior authors of the study, which appears today in Science Immunology. The lead authors of the paper are Murillo Silva, a former MIT postdoc, and Yu Kato, a staff scientist at the La Jolla Institute. ","Published: December 7, 2021"

This has allowed them to create a disease map of genes involved in eye disorders across the different cell types, as well as the key switches which control cell specialisation of individual ocular tissues. The work would help to provide new insights about human eye diseases and age-related eye disorders, and potentially pave the way for regenerative medicine and cell replacement therapies for eye diseases.The research team, led by IMCB, consisted of researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), Mayo Clinic, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,University of Melbourne, and Shenzhen Eye Hospital.The human eye comprises different cell types from different developmental origins and functional roles. In order to decipher this diversity of cellular functions using single cell RNA sequencing, the research team catalogued over 50,000 cells in human and porcine eyes, and developed a cell atlas of these eyes that distinguishes individual cells by the activity of their genes.As certain eye disorders are associated with mutations in the human genes, the atlas which profiles disease-causing genes across all cell types of the eye, could aid understanding of how cell types are affected by such disorders. A map of cell surface proteins that can act as viral entry receptors in the human eye could shed light on how infections could travel through ocular route. The research showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the primary cell surface proteins responsible for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human, are expressed in the conjunctival cells of eye. Similar observations have been reported from different research groups, suggesting an infection from ocular route is likely. It is fascinating to observe the cross-talk of ocular cells through the interaction of signalling molecules with receptors. This will help us to understand how individual cell responds to external factors like injury,  said Mr Pradeep Gautam, PhD scholar at IMCB, A*STAR, who is the co-first author of the paper.Eye diseases such as glaucoma, which is the leading cause of blindness globally, is caused by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Using embryonic stem cells as a platform for differentiation, the research team generated RGC progenitor cells in culture and validated that a switch KLF7 could accelerate RGC generation, opening up opportunities for the cultivation of lab grown RGCs to replace damaged RGCs as a potential therapy. This study paves the way to create mature retinal ganglion cells in the lab, which could be harnessed for the development of new approaches to reverse vision loss that results from optic nerve degeneration, including glaucoma,  said Dr Jonathan Loh Yuin-Han, Research Director at A*STAR s IMCB and lead researcher of the study.Moving forward, the research team hopes to use RGCs for cell therapies in patients and is working further to validate the KLF7-derived RGCs for preclinical studies. With the understanding of key molecular switches and ability to engineer cell types in culture, lab grown cells provide a key to therapy.Reference: Gautam P, Hamashima K, Chen Y, et al.

Often, the top of the injury heals before the bottom, so the wound collapses in on itself. Over time, this can result in scar tissue and reduced skin function.In APL Bioengineering, by AIP Publishing, researchers from the University of Birmingham and University of Huddersfield developed an approach to print skin equivalents. The material may play a future role in facilitating the healing of chronic wounds.The technique is the first of its kind to simulate three layers of skin: the hypodermis, or fatty layer, the dermis, and the epidermis.   You effectively have three different cell types. They all grow at different speeds,  said author Alan Smith.  If you try to produce tri-layered structures, it can be very difficult to provide each of the requirements of each different layer. To solve this problem, the scientists used suspended layer additive manufacturing (SLAM). They created a gel-like material to support the skin equivalent, twisting and altering the structure of the gel as it formed to create a bed of particles that can then support a second phase of gel injection.During printing, the skin layers are deposited within the support gel, which holds everything in place. After printing, the team washed away the support material, leaving behind the layered skin equivalent.If the researchers moved a needle through the supporting gel, it repaired itself faster than other similar techniques. This results in higher resolution printing than previous methods and allows for the printing of complicated skin structures.The authors tested the skin substitute by cutting a hole in pig tissue and printing a skin equivalent to fill the hole. After culturing the model system for 14 days, they saw signs of wound repair. We used a stain that allowed us to quantify the integration we got between original material and tissue,  said author Liam Grover.  We were able to demonstrate some integration even after a short period of time. The team cannot assess chronic wound healing with the skin substitute because that process takes more time than their model allowed, which was only 14-21 days. However, their next step is to test longer, appropriate models for chronic deep wounds. The ultimate goal is to repair human skin and reduce scarring for all patient scenarios.Reference: Moakes RJA, Senior JJ, Robinson TE, et al.

The last major advance in our understanding of this condition arguably happened prior to the 21st century, with the identification of the role of the proteins tau and amyloid in the spread of Alzheimer s through the brain.Since then, numerous trials have been undertaken to test drugs based on the amyloid and tau hypotheses in patients with Alzheimer s disease. From the early 2000s until last year, all had failed. While the qualified approval of the anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody aducanumab provides some hope that research into Alzheimer s is at least aiming in the right direction, the immense cost and serial failure of prior trials have led to companies and academics examining alternative routes to drug development. One of these options is based on finding already-approved compounds that may be repurposed for Alzheimer s disease.Another significant factor is Viagra s somewhat specialized indication. Only 2% of people claiming for the drug were women, who make up the majority of the Alzheimer s disease patient population. Dr. Susan Kohlhaas, director of research at Alzheimer s Research UK, who was not involved in the study said in a press release:  While the researchers did look at the effect of sildenafil on females, there isn t enough information to be able to accurately draw conclusions about its effect in females.Kohlhaas also addressed the need for future experiments to back up the paper.  The researchers have conducted lab-based experiments to give an indication as to why the drug may impact diseases like Alzheimer s, but these early-stage experiments would need follow-up in more thorough tests,  she said.While Viagra s reputation might drive the study into the headlines, it is the computational repurposing approach the researchers adopted that may yet prove most significant to drug discovery   providing a cheaper and faster route to potential treatments.  Developing drugs for diseases like Alzheimer s, which attack the brain, is a costly process and can take many years. Being able to repurpose a drug already licensed for other health conditions could help speed up the drug discovery process and bring about life-changing dementia treatments sooner,  said Kohlhaas.Reference:  Fang, J, Zhang, P, Zhou, Y et al.

Through a series of reactions called the electron transport chain, electrons are passed along in a sort of cellular relay race, allowing the cell to create ATP, the molecule that gives our cells energy to complete their vital functions. At the end of this chain, two electrons remain, which are typically passed off to oxygen, the  terminal electron acceptor.  This completes the reaction and allows the process to continue with more electrons entering the electron transport chain.In the past, however, scientists have noticed that cells are able to maintain some functions of the electron transport chain, even in the absence of oxygen.  This indicated that mitochondria could actually have partial function, even when oxygen is not the electron acceptor,  said Whitehead Institute postdoctoral researcher Jessica Spinelli.  We wanted to understand, how does this work? How are mitochondria capable of maintaining these electron inputs when oxygen is not the terminal electron acceptor? In a paper published December 2 in the journal Science, Whitehead Institute scientists and collaborators led by Spinelli have found the answer to these questions. Their research shows that when cells are deprived of oxygen, another molecule called fumarate can step in and serve as a terminal electron acceptor to enable mitochondrial function in this environment. The research, which was completed in the laboratory of former Whitehead Member David Sabatini, answers a long-standing mystery in the field of cellular metabolism, and could potentially inform research into diseases that cause low oxygen levels in tissues, including ischemia, diabetes and cancer.

Now researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine have found that the process of packaging neurotransmitters may be responsible for this energy drain.In their study, reported Dec. 3 in Science Advances, they identified tiny capsules called synaptic vesicles as a major source of energy consumption in inactive neurons. Neurons use these vesicles as containers for their neurotransmitter molecules, which they fire from communications ports called synaptic terminals to signal to other neurons. Packing neurotransmitters into vesicles is a process that consumes chemical energy, and the researchers found that this process, energy-wise, is inherently leaky so leaky that it continues to consume significant energy even when the vesicles are filled and synaptic terminals are inactive. These findings help us understand better why the human brain is so vulnerable to the interruption or weakening of its fuel supply,  said senior author Dr. Timothy Ryan, a professor of biochemistry and of biochemistry in anesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine.The observation that the brain consumes a high amount of energy, even when relatively at rest, dates back several decades to studies of the brain s fuel use in comatose and vegetative states. Those studies found that even in these profoundly inactive states, the brain s consumption of glucose typically drops from normal by only about half which still leaves the brain as a high energy consumer relative to other organs. The sources of that resting energy drain have never been fully understood.Dr. Ryan and his laboratory have shown in recent years that neurons  synaptic terminals, bud-like growths from which they fire neurotransmitters, are major consumers of energy when active, and are very sensitive to any disruption of their fuel supply. In the new study they examined fuel use in synaptic terminals when inactive, and found that it is still high.This high resting fuel consumption, they discovered, is accounted for largely by the pool of vesicles at synaptic terminals. During synaptic inactivity, vesicles are fully loaded with thousands of neurotransmitters each, and are ready to launch these signal-carrying payloads across synapses to partner neurons.Why would a synaptic vesicle consume energy even when fully loaded? The researchers discovered that there is essentially a leakage of energy from the vesicle membrane, a  proton efflux,  such that a special  proton pump  enzyme in the vesicle has to keep working, and consuming fuel as it does so, even when the vesicle is already full of neurotransmitter molecules.The experiments pointed to proteins called transporters as the likely sources of this proton leakage. Transporters normally bring neurotransmitters into vesicles, changing shape to carry the neurotransmitter in, but allowing at the same time for a proton to escape as they do so. Dr. Ryan speculates that the energy threshold for this transporter shape-shift was set low by evolution to enable faster neurotransmitter reloading during synaptic activity, and thus faster thinking and action. The downside of a faster loading capability would be that even random thermal fluctuations could trigger the transporter shape-shift, causing this continual energy drain even when no neurotransmitter is being loaded,  he said.Although the leakage per vesicle would be tiny, there are at least hundreds of trillions of synaptic vesicles in the human brain, so the energy drain would really add up, Dr. Ryan said.The finding is a significant advance in understanding the basic biology of the brain. In addition, the vulnerability of the brain to the disruption of its fuel supply is a major problem in neurology, and metabolic deficiencies have been noted in a host of common brain diseases including Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease. This line of investigation ultimately could help solve important medical puzzles and suggest new treatments. If we had a way to safely lower this energy drain and thus slow brain metabolism, it could be very impactful clinically,  Dr. Ryan said.Reference: Pulido C, Ryan TA.

To date, most studies on food texture center on relating a food's overall composition to its mechanical properties. Our understanding of how microscopic structure and changes in the shape of food affect food texture, however, remains underdeveloped.Researchers from Denmark and Germany conducted a series of experiments relating food microstructure and rheology, the study of how soft solids and some liquids deform, to texture. In Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing, they used coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy to relate the molecular makeup of the fat in foods with the rheological and mechanical properties of the food.The foods in question: foie gras and p t .""Using soft matter physics tools and models, we connected structural information in the food across length scales,"" said author Thomas Vilgis. ""We joined microscopy and rheology to understand the mouthfeel of food from a gastrophysical standpoint.""Both deriving from duck livers, the two dishes are similar enough in overall structure, and their differing fat distribution provided a window into how fat affects texture.""There are further different interesting aspects that can be targeted to create new products with the same features as these products,"" said author Mathias P. Clausen. ""Can we create foie gras-like textures without animal cruelty? Can we create melting and creamy texture from different fat sources?""To answer these questions, the group turned to CARS microscopy, which uses lasers to vibrate chemical bonds in foods to tunable frequencies and cause them to emit light. The technique has been used for decades in other fields but, so far, has received relatively little use in food science.The fat in foie gras had arranged into an irregularly shaped, weakly linked fat network embedded in a protein matrix, which made its mouthfeel harder, more brittle, and more elastic than p t 's.The greater number of rounder and smoother fat particles and lack of an interconnected network were responsible for the p t 's softer texture.Clausen hopes their research stokes further interest in investigating which microscopic features of foods can be tweaked. The group looks to study other components of foods with advanced microscopy, such as protein arrangement, and see if they can use their findings to create foods that mimic the texture of foie gras.Reference: Via MA, Baechle M, Stephan A, Vilgis TA, Clausen MP.

Even though many people who become infected with Lassa virus are asymptomatic, one in five infections results in severe haemorrhagic disease, attacking vital organs like the liver, spleen, and kidneys.The World Health Organization (WHO) lists Lassa fever as a significant public health threat with high epidemic potential and no effective countermeasures. Lassa fever has no vaccine, and only one drug   a broad-spectrum antiviral called ribavirin, which has limited efficacy.Even though researchers are working on a vaccine, an effective antiviral is needed to reduce the number of severe cases and deaths. This is where structural biology can help.To understand the intricate mechanism of viral replication, structural biologists focus on a key component: the viral polymerase. In an infected cell, this enzyme replicates the virus s genetic information. The genome copies are then packaged into new virions, which escape the cell and can infect a new host. Determining the polymerase structure helps researchers to understand how a virus replicates, giving them important insight into how to design drugs that can stop the infection.Stephen Cusack, head of EMBL Grenoble, focuses his group s research on the polymerase of several human pathogenic viruses, particularly influenza virus. Because influenza and Lassa viruses are from the same family   both segmented negative-strand RNA viruses   Cusack s group started collaborating on Lassa virus several years ago with Maria Rosenthal and Stephan G nther from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM) in Hamburg. Stephen Cusack was at the forefront of research on influenza and ahead of the field with respect to bunyaviruses and arenaviruses,  said G nther, the head of the virology department at BNITM.  We thought it was excellent synergy because he already had a lot of technological knowledge we could transfer to the Lassa polymerase. The Lassa polymerase has characteristics that complicate the process of determining its structure, which Rosenthal, a BNITM structural biologist and group leader, had tried to obtain for several years.  After a long testing of other systems, I went to Grenoble to test the system developed by Imre Berger [an EMBL Grenoble alumnus], and applied by the Cusack group to influenza. We got very good expression of the protein,  Rosenthal said.The polymerase also has a peculiar architecture with a core and flexible outer components.  We call the Lassa virus polymerase an  octopus  because it s like it has arms floating around, which makes it very hard to catch in one position,  said Tomas Kouba, a postdoc in the Cusack Group.Macromolecular crystallography   an imaging technique commonly used in structural biology   couldn t be used to observe the Lassa polymerase, because the protein moved too much to capture all the arms. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offered the solution as it enables snapshots of the protein to be taken in different functional states.""We applied to Lassa the techniques that Kouba and Joanna Wandzik [a former EMBL PhD student] developed to visualise influenza polymerase in action,"" Cusack explained. "" We used cryo-EM facilities both in Grenoble and at the Centre for Structural Systems Biology [CSSB] at the University of Hamburg.   This collaboration between researchers from EMBL Grenoble, BNITM, and Kay Gr newald s lab at the CSSB resulted in a paper recently published in Nature Communications. It details nine structures of the Lassa viral polymerase in different functional configurations. When you observe this  octopus , you also want to see how it behaves, how it moves its arms to eat or catch something,  explained Kouba, one of the paper s three principal authors. The power of cryo-EM is that you take millions of pictures of the protein. Then you can sort them into several boxes: one box with an arm up, and then one box with the arm down,  Rosenthal added.  In the end, you have more highly resolved images of octopus arms in a variety of positions, so you can model them. These studies provide crucial insights into the Lassa virus, which has only four different viral proteins   very few compared to other viruses, such as herpes or SARS-CoV-2, which have dozens of components. The proteins make up for their small number by assuming multiple functions, like a Swiss Army knife. The researchers could, for example, visualise polymerase activity and propose how to block viral replication. ","Published: December 6, 2021"

The results, published on December 2 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, indicate that the brain s immune cells and their connection to our gut microbes may be an important target for preventing and treating dementia in human patients.The study builds off of previous research showing that perturbations to the gut microbiome, induced by treatment with antibiotics during early life, could reduce some of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer s disease (AD) in male, but not female, mice. Our past work has shown that if you give mice antibiotics beginning shortly after birth, you see a reduction of amyloid deposition specifically in male animals from this particular model of Alzheimer s disease,  said senior author Sangram Sisodia, PhD, Thomas A. Reynolds Sr. Family Professor of Neurobiology.  In parallel, in the past, we ve looked at the biology of microglia in the brain and find that in male animals, there are significant changes in the gene expression and morphologies of the cells. In this study, we decided to look at the microglia specifically in the context of this paradigm. The study was conducted using APPPS1-21 mice, a popular genetic model of AD. These animals develop pathologies associated with AD, including the amyloid plaques thought to play a central role in the neurodegenerative condition. In contrast to the past work, the new study entailed treating mice with antibiotics for just one week early in life. Even with such a short treatment, the researchers saw a dramatic reduction in in the levels of b-amyloid in the male brain at 9 weeks of age. Importantly, female mice showed no such differences.In addition, the research team, led by Hemraj Dodiya, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Sisodia lab, determined that the reduction in amyloid plaques was linked directly to the changes in the gut microbiome by conducting daily fecal matter transplants (FMT) on male mice that had been treated with antibiotics. Restoring the pre-antibiotic microbiome with FMT completely restored the b-amyloid plaques   it was as if the mice had never been exposed to antibiotics. What s more, the apparently  neuroprotective  microglia in antibiotics-treated male mice turned into  neurodegenerative -type microglia with FMT, as if they had never been exposed to antibiotics at all. Microglia have a memory,  said Sisodia.  We don t know exactly what this memory is, but we know that they can respond to a pathogen or perturbation by changing their shape and gene expression and they can sustain those changes for a long time. What we re seeing in this study is that after antibiotic treatment early in life, amyloid deposition is significantly reduced in males and not in females. And we see that the microglial transcriptome   their gene expression   is changed as well. But if you feed bacteria present in the feces from another untreated mouse to antibiotic-treated mice, you restore the pathology, as well as the microglial phenotype. The final question is, are the microglia responsible for the amyloidosis, and if so, how are the microglia doing this? To answer this question, the researchers gave the mice a drug called PLX5622, which kills microglia in the mouse brain, as well as some peripheral immune cells in the blood stream. They found that without microglia, the antibiotic treatment had no impact on the amyloidosis in the brain, indicating that the microglia are critical for mediating this effect. Really, this study shows us three key things,  said first author Dodiya.  The first is that we see these sex-specific changes in amyloidosis in the brain after early life perturbations in the gut microbiome. The second is that simply conducting a fecal matter transplant is enough to restore the amyloidosis after antibiotic treatment, and the third is that the microglia are an essential factor driving the microbiome-initiated changes. The research team is conducting further studies that more directly target microglia to ensure the effects of PLX5622 on innate immune cells throughout the body are not affecting amyloidosis in the brain. They hope to clarify what signals the gut is sending to the brain that lead to these changes in the microglia, and how that in turn leads to changes in the amyloid plaques.The team also is exploring the question of why these effects are only seen in male mice.  It s an astounding effect,  said Sisodia.  In females, the microglia don t seem to be affected at all by perturbations in the microbiome. Research in the past has shown that microglia from male and female animals are very different during development and during aging, but what are the contributing factors? It s likely to be an effect of sex hormones, but then what are the effects on the microbiome? Clarifying this question could be important for treating AD in human patients.  Women are at higher risk of Alzheimer s disease than men, and are usually diagnosed earlier,  said Sisodia.  If we understood what molecules are at play, maybe we could get a better handle on how to go about targeting this disease and why we see these differences between males and females.

The scientists believe this newly developed technology can speed up brain research and various neuroscience studies to uncover basic brain functions as well as the underpinnings of various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.A multidisciplinary team of researchers at KAIST, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, created a wireless ecosystem with its own wireless implantable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to enable high-throughput neuroscience experiments over the internet. This innovative technology could enable scientists to manipulate the brains of animals from anywhere around the world. The study was published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering on November 25. This novel technology is highly versatile and adaptive. It can remotely control numerous neural implants and laboratory tools in real-time or in a scheduled way without direct human interactions,  said Professor Jae-Woong Jeong of the School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST and a senior author of the study.  These wireless neural devices and equipment integrated with IoT technology have enormous potential for science and medicine. The wireless ecosystem only requires a mini-computer that can be purchased for under $45, which connects to the internet and communicates with wireless multifunctional brain probes or other types of conventional laboratory equipment using IoT control modules. By optimally integrating the versatility and modular construction of both unique IoT hardware and software within a single ecosystem, this wireless technology offers new applications that have not been demonstrated before by a single standalone technology. This includes, but is not limited to minimalistic hardware, global remote access, selective and scheduled experiments, customizable automation, and high-throughput scalability. As long as researchers have internet access, they are able to trigger, customize, stop, validate, and store the outcomes of large experiments at any time and from anywhere in the world. They can remotely perform large-scale neuroscience experiments in animals deployed in multiple countries,  said one of the lead authors, Dr. Raza Qazi, a researcher with KAIST and the University of Colorado, Boulder.  The low cost of this system allows it to be easily adopted and can further fuel innovation across many laboratories,  Dr. Qazi added.  One of the significant advantages of this IoT neurotechnology is its ability to be mass deployed across the globe due to its minimalistic hardware, low setup cost, ease of use, and customizable versatility. Scientists across the world can quickly implement this technology within their existing laboratories with minimal budget concerns to achieve globally remote access, scalable experimental automation, or both, thus potentially reducing the time needed to unravel various neuroscientific challenges such as those associated with intractable neurological conditions.Another senior author on the study, Professor Jordan McCall from the Department of Anesthesiology and Center for Clinical Pharmacology at Washington University in St. Louis, said this technology has the potential to change how basic neuroscience studies are performed.  One of the biggest limitations when trying to understand how the mammalian brain works is that we have to study these functions in unnatural conditions. This technology brings us one step closer to performing important studies without direct human interaction with the study subjects.  The ability to remotely schedule experiments moves toward automating these types of experiments. Dr. Kyle Parker, an instructor at Washington University in St. Louis and another lead author on the study added,  This experimental automation can potentially help us reduce the number of animals used in biomedical research by reducing the variability introduced by various experimenters. This is especially important given our moral imperative to seek research designs that enable this reduction. The researchers believe this wireless technology may open new opportunities for many applications including brain research, pharmaceuticals, and telemedicine to treat diseases in the brain and other organs remotely. This remote automation technology could become even more valuable when many labs need to shut down, such as during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The team, led by principal investigator Andrei Fedorov, published a recent study about the Platform in Lab on a Chip, a journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry.The work was supported mainly by two national research centers at Georgia Tech that are focused on developing cell therapy technology   the National Science Foundation Center for Cell Manufacturing Technologies and the Marcus Center for Therapeutic Cell Characterization and Manufacturing. There s a lot of excitement about these cell therapies because they really are remarkable,  said Fedorov, professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and a member of the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech.  They offer a complete cure. You had a disease, and now you don t. Advanced cell-based therapies currently provide treatment options when all others have run out. They ve been used to combat different forms of cancer, to reverse the course of genetic diseases, and to restore, maintain, or replace damaged organs.  The research is moving at a fast pace, with hundreds of new cell-based drug applications being currently being considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And making these drugs is a delicate balancing act. The biomanufacturing process requires control of product safety and therapeutic potency,  Fedorov said.  But there is a catch   it is very expensive. Fedorov and his team aim to provide insight into cell behavior and the biochemical information needed for process control.  The technology they developed may lower the cost of these revolutionary treatments, making them available for a broader population of patients.The price range for approved cell therapy products is $500,000 to $2 million per treatment, with production driving up the cost. You take a few cells that you ve extracted from a patient or a donor, then modify and grow what is considered enough, right now about a billion cells,  said Fedorov.After cells are harvested, they undergo numerous steps, including modification in a bioreactor, which typically takes about 14 days   an anxious two weeks for a patient who might be down to one last chance for an effective treatment. Often, these treatments are only approved for patients who are near terminally ill,  said Fedorov.  And the problem is, you don t really know if the cells have maintained their therapeutic potency. You re almost at the mercy of luck, because the ability to fully monitor a cell s state as it transitions through the entire process is lacking. The absence of suitable process analysis tools is the main bottleneck to mass-market entry for these therapeutics, Fedorov said, contributing to the high cost and representing a significant gap in the biomanufacturing process. So, he and his colleagues have developed a powerful new tool to fill that gap, and it s about the size of a thumbnail. ","Published: December 6, 2021"

These are found on our tongue, where they facilitate the taste perception of bitter tasting compounds. In addition, there are increasing findings that cells of extra-oral organs also have such receptors. Since we do not ""taste"" with these receptors expressed in non-gustatory tissues, the question arises as to what functions they fulfill there. Some of this is already known. For example, certain bitter taste receptors in gastric cells are involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion or play a role in the release of antimicrobial substances in cells of the intestinal and the respiratory tract.","Published: December 6, 2021"

However, the picture is turned upside down the second we find out where a fish comes from. A great many packages of sliced and vacuum-sealed smoked salmon find their way into Danish shopping carts every year. The vast majority of this smoked salmon is sourced from Norwegian aquaculture farms. In recent times however, conventionally farmed salmon from Norway has earned a questionable reputation and notoriety for containing pharmaceutical and chemical residues, as well as for polluting the marine environment and spreading disease to wild populations. However, according to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration salmon on the Danish market does not have a problem with unwanted chemicals, and it is very rare that the authorities find pharmaceutical residues. But it seems that our knowledge about production conditions plays a major role in how we perceive taste. A study by University of Copenhagen researchers drives the point home. In the study, 92 Danes were asked to taste samples of conventional, organic and wild-caught smoked salmon. The first round was a blind test in which test subjects were uninformed about what type of salmon they were tasting. In the second round, the subjects were informed. Following each round, the test subjects assessed their liking of the samples. ","Published: December 6, 2021"

Bisphenol A and 17 -Ethinylestradiol (EE2) are two common chemicals of this nature. BPA is an endocrine disruptor and is found in a lot of different plastics like water bottles and EE2, commonly found in birth control pills, enters into the ocean from human waste and wastewaters of manufacturing plants and hospitals.  In Indonesia, for example, there are beautiful coral reefs found below a lot of garbage, so anything that enters the water is affecting the fish,  said Jose Gonzalez, a former undergraduate researcher in the Rhodes group.  There have been previous studies that have established that these pollutants tend to feminize animals like freshwater fish, rats, mice, and even humans,  said Justin Rhodes (GNDP), a professor of psychology.  However, no one has studied their effects on a fish whose sex is totally determined by the environment.  A. ocellaris live in small groups with one alpha female, one beta male, and lower ranking non-reproductive males. Their sex is not genetically programmed and, instead, is dependent on environmental cues: A male transforms into a female if the female is removed from the group or if males are paired together.  We looked at these fish specifically because they can transition from male to female helping us understand how BPA and EE2 can affect reproduction,  said Sarah Craig, an undergraduate research assistant in the Rhodes group. The researchers paired sexually immature, male fish and fed them twice daily with normal food, food containing BPA, or EE2. There were 9 pairs of fish per group and they were monitored for six months. The amount of BPA and EE2 were determined based on the environmental concentrations of these chemicals. Since these fish are able to change their sex, we looked at different indicators such as behavior, gene expression in the brain, and hormone levels,  said Abigail Histed, an undergraduate research assistant in the Rhodes group.  Interestingly, other than behavior, we found a feminizing effect in all the other categories.  The researchers found that fish that were fed BPA had no testicular tissue, lower androgen levels, just like female fish, and increased expression of genes in the brain that are responsible for feminization. Surprisingly, although females tend to be more aggressive, BPA decreased aggression in these fish. In contrast, the effects of EE2 were similar, but less pronounced.  In nature, the females are very aggressive and do not tolerate the presence of other females,  Rhodes said.  We discovered that although BPA is feminizing the gonads, the fish are not that aggressive and can live with each other. These results suggest that the feminization in the brain occurs independently of gonadal hormones.  It is still unclear how BPA is exerting its effects. In other studies BPA was thought to bind to estrogen receptors. However, since EE2 is an estrogen mimic and had subtle effects, the researchers believe that BPA has other additional effects.  BPA could be affecting other hormone receptors or interfering with androgen signaling. It could be a mix of different effects and we don t know yet,  Rhodes said. The implications of the findings, however, are clear.  These fish can only change their sex from male to female. If BPA is turning them female in the wild, they can t go back to being a male and that can influence their population numbers,  Gonzalez said. The researchers are interested in investigating the effects of EE2 further. Specifically, they would like to use higher concentrations of EE2 because they are concerned that the administered levels were not high enough. They would also like to follow the fate of these fish for longer since the fish normally take more than six months to mature completely.  A longer time frame would be better to compare the degrees of feminization with BPA compared to natural feminization. Maybe they do eventually fight and kill each other and it s something we missed with a shorter time frame,  Rhodes said.ReferenceGonzalez JA, Histed AR, Nowak E, et al.

Their study was published in the journal Molecular Therapy. SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the salivary glands, and we know that when someone who is infected sneezes, coughs, or speaks some of that virus can be expelled and reach others,  says Daniell.  This gum offers an opportunity to neutralize the virus in the saliva, giving us a simple way to possibly cut down on a source of disease transmission. Vaccinations for COVID-19 have helped change the course of the pandemic but haven t stamped out transmission. Even people who are fully vaccinated can still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and, according to recent research, can carry a viral load similar to those who are unvaccinated.Prior to the pandemic, Daniell had been studying the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in the context of treating hypertension. His lab had grown this protein, as well as many others that may have therapeutic potential, using a patented plant-based production system. By bombarding plant material with the DNA of target proteins, they coax plant chloroplasts to take up the DNA and begin growing the proteins. The plant material, freeze-dried and ground-up, could be used as a means of delivering the protein. This system has the potential to avoid the usual obstacles to protein drug synthesis: namely, an expensive production and purification process.Daniell s past work on ACE2 proved fortuitous in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The receptor for ACE2 on human cells also happens to bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Other research groups have shown that injections of ACE2 can reduce viral load in people with severe infections.Meanwhile, another line of work by Daniell and Penn Dental Medicine colleague Hyun (Michel) Koo has involved research to develop a chewing gum infused with plant-grown proteins to disrupt dental plaque. Pairing his insights about ACE2 with this technology, Daniell wondered if such a gum, infused with plant-grown ACE2 proteins, could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity. To find out, he reached out to Ronald Collman at Penn Medicine, a virologist and pulmonary and critical care doctor whose team, since the early stages of the pandemic, had been collecting blood, nasal swabs, saliva, and other biospecimens from COVID patients for scientific research. Henry contacted me and asked if we had samples to test his approach, what kind of samples would be appropriate to test, and whether we could internally validate the level of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the saliva samples,  Collman says.  That led to a cross-school collaboration building on our microbiome studies. To test the chewing gum, the team grew ACE2 in plants, paired with another compound that enables the protein to cross mucosal barriers and facilitates binding, and incorporated the resulting plant material into cinnamon-flavored gum tablets. Incubating samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-positive patients with the gum, they showed that the ACE2 present could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 viruses.Those initial investigations were followed by others at The Wistar Institute and Penn Vet, in which viruses, less-pathogenic than SARS-CoV-2, were modified to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The scientists observed that the gum largely prevented the viruses or viral particles from entering cells, either by blocking the ACE2 receptor on the cells or by binding directly to the spike protein.Finally, the team exposed saliva samples from COVID-19 patients to the ACE2 gum and found that levels of viral RNA fell so dramatically to be almost undetectable.The research team is currently working toward obtaining permission to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate whether the approach is safe and effective when tested in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 . Henry s approach of making the proteins in plants and using them orally is inexpensive, hopefully scalable; it really is clever,  Collman says.Though the research is still in early stages of development, if the clinical trials prove the gum is safe and effective, it could be given to patients whose infection status is unknown or even for a dental check-ups when masks must be removed, to reduce the likelihood of passing the virus to caregivers. We are already using masks and other physical barriers to reduce the chance of transmission,  says Daniell.  This gum could be used as an additional tool in that fight.

The research focuses on corn a critically important crop around the world in an effort to create a cell-by-cell map of the plant s root system, which mediates drought stress and absorbs nutrients and fertilizer from the soil. We discovered how corn expands its cortex tissue, which makes up much of the crop s root system. Adding layers to the cortex tissue is a key evolutionary feature that generates ways for plants to tolerate drought and flooding and improve nutrient uptake,  said Kenneth Birnbaum, a professor in New York University s Department of Biology and Center for Genomics and Systems Biology and the senior author of the paper, which appears in the journal Science. These traits will be critical targets to allow plants to withstand global warming and reduce the carbon footprint of crops,  added Birnbaum, whose lab at NYU led the project in collaboration with researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Pennsylvania.To create a single-cell map of the corn root, the researchers first broke apart the root using cell-wall digesting enzymes to generate single, free-floating cells. New approaches then allowed them to analyze mRNA content of individual cells distinguishing molecular features that lead to specific types of specialized cells using miniaturized droplet-based single cell-sequencing techniques.They next mapped the cells back to their location in the corn root, akin to assembling a 10,000-piece jigsaw puzzle without a guide. To solve the puzzle, the researchers used fluorescent dyes that penetrated into root tissues at variable depths to label and isolate different layers, like separating the layers of an onion, giving them gene landmarks to map the single cells. This second layer of information essentially gave us the puzzle box that allowed us to precisely map cells to their appropriate location in order to recreate a 3D model of gene expression throughout the entire corn root,  said Carlos Ortiz Ramirez of the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology and UGA Laboratorio Nacional de Gen mica para la Biodiversidad in Mexico, who was the first author of the study.The new map of the corn root revealed previously undescribed cellular specialization in the cortex of the root. The cortex is particularly important because it comprises the bulk of the early corn root and has more than 10 layers. In addition, the cortex cellular subtypes are of critical importance for traits that help crop plants cope with environmental stressors. For example, the inner cortex layer is where symbiotic fungi exchange nutrients with the plant, and increased cooperation could help lessen the carbon footprint of agriculture. Middle layers of cortex create air tunnels that enable gas exchange during flooding, while on-demand expansion of the cortex can reduce water loss during drought stress. Using our 3D model of the corn root, we mapped out four distinct cortex layer signatures that could provide important genetic targets for further improvement in symbiosis, flooding, and drought,  said Ortiz Ramirez.Furthermore, the group found clues within the new map of the root about how corn could generate the extra layers of cortex. In particular, the key gene regulator known as SHORT ROOT (SHR), whose function is similar across different plants, was in an intriguing position that was different from other plants with just one layer of cortex.In Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant commonly used as a model organism in plant biology, SHR was one of the first transcription factors shown to move from cell to cell, allowing inner cell types to give instructions to middle layers to create a new tissue. That makes SHR a type of local organizer, directing root tissues to assemble around a core pattern. However, in corn, the single-cell map revealed that SHR was in a new position right next to the multiple layers of cortex, a convenient  jumping off  point to expand the multiple cortex layers. Indeed, the researchers tracked SHR protein movement and found that it was hypermobile, moving not just one layer but multiple layers through the cortex.Moreover, mutations that disturbed SHR function in both corn and the corn relative foxtail millet had a severely reduced number of cortex layers. This demonstrates how SHR kept its primary role in expanding tissue layers and generating new cell identities but switched its location to add new cell types that ultimately allow corn to cope with environmental stresses. Identifying SHR has a key regulator of cortex expansion is an important first step,  said Birnbaum.  Moving forward, tweaking these regulators could provide tools to alter the number of cortex layers or subtypes that could enhance their ability to withstand climate stressors like drought, or improve nitrogen uptake, allowing plants to use less fertilizer or grow in nutrient-poor soil.

Scientists at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, who led the research said this study is an important step forward in developing a better understanding of gynecologic cancers, as every tumor is a collection of different cells growing uncontrollably within its mass. Knowing how cell-to-cell variations affect the biological workings of the tumor is of utmost importance and can lead to new targets for therapeutic interventions.The findings appeared in print on December 2, 2021, in Molecular Cell. The standard of care for many gynecologic cancers is a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Despite these aggressive treatments, the majority of women with ovarian cancer experience a recurrence of their disease, highlighting the need to better understand the etiology of the disease in order to develop better targeted therapies,  said UNC Lineberger s Hector L. Franco, PhD, assistant professor of genetics in the UNC School of Medicine and corresponding author of this article.  To that end, with the improved resolution of the new single-cell sequencing technologies, we can now annotate specific genetic features of tumor cells that had been previously hidden from traditional sequencing technologies. Ovarian and endometrial cancer are the two most common gynecologic cancers in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates that more than 81,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian or endometrial cancer this year, and these two cancers collectively will cause an estimated more than 25,000 deaths. Franco and his colleagues used single-cell sequencing to measure the genetic and epigenetic states of more than 150,000 individual cells from 11 ovarian and endometrial tumor samples that were sequenced on the same day they were surgically removed from the patients. Epigenetics relate to a change in the chemical structure of DNA that does not change the DNA coding sequence; epigenetic changes can be as consequential as changes to DNA itself.  This dataset represents the largest collection of single-cell sequencing data in ovarian and endometrial cancer to date.The researchers said the benefits of their mapping will be manyfold: It should yield a much better understanding of the heterogeneity of cells within a single tumor as well as help build a new library of single-cell information, among other potential attributes. In the near future, I see personalized medicine becoming the standard of care. Each patient would get their tumor sequenced, and then treatment options would be tailored to the specifics of each individual tumor,  Franco said.  While this technology is not widely available in the clinic today, it is transformative in the sense that it increases our understanding of the disease. The researchers also determined that, within any given tumor, there can be two or three different types of cancer cells which are defined by distinct genetic profiles. This finding may complicate the treatment of cancer, because one tumor cell can show sensitivity to treatment while other cancer cells may not.The scientist s next step is to use single-cell sequencing technology to measure the genetics of ovarian and endometrial tumors after they have undergone chemotherapy. This will allow them to see which tumor cells are being effectively killed off by the chemotherapy, and which ones persist and become resistant. Additionally, the hope is to use this technology on tumors that have relapsed and metastasized; this should enhance the understanding of the molecular basis of what causes some tumors to become resistant and what causes some tumors to become metastatic, thereby pointing to potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.Franco said a serendipitous conversation in a hallway with Victoria Bae-Jump, MD, PhD, professor of gynecologic oncology and director of the UNC Lineberger Endometrial Cancer Center of Excellence, jumpstarted this research.  This finding would not have been possible without the collaboration with Dr. Bae-Jump and her guidance on the clinical interpretations of our findings, highlighting the importance of team science at UNC Lineberger,  he said.Reference: Regner MJ, Wisniewska K, Garcia-Recio S, et al.

We currently really have no rapid way of assessing variants, neither their presence in an individual, nor the ability of antibodies we possess to make a difference,  said Cameron Wolfe, associate professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine.  It's one of the lingering fears that, as we successfully vaccinate more and more people, a variant may emerge that more radically evades vaccine-induced antibody neutralization. And if that fear came true   if Omicron turned out to be a worst-case scenario   how would we know quickly enough? While developing a point-of-care test for COVID-19 antibodies and biomarkers, we realized there could be some benefit to being able to detect the ability of antibodies to neutralize specific variants, so we built a test around that idea,  said Ashutosh Chilkoti, the Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor and Chair of Biomedical Engineering at Duke.  It only took us a week or two to incorporate the Delta variant in our test, and it could easily be expanded to also include the Omicron variant. All we need is the spike protein of this variant, which many groups across the world   including our group at Duke  are feverishly working to produce. The researchers have dubbed their test the COVID-19 Variant Spike-ACE2-Competitive Antibody Neutralization assay, or CoVariant-SCAN for short. The test s technology hinges on a polymer brush coating that acts as a sort of non-stick coating to stop anything but the desired biomarkers from attaching to the test slide when wet. The high effectiveness of this non-stick shield makes the test incredibly sensitive to even low levels of its targets. The approach allows researchers to print different molecular traps on different areas of the slide to catch multiple biomarkers at once.In this application, researchers print fluorescent human ACE2 proteins the cellular targets of the virus s infamous spike protein on a slide. They also print spike proteins specific to each variant of COVID-19 at different specific locations. When the test is run, the ACE2 proteins detach from the slide and are caught by the spike proteins still attached to the slide, causing the slide to glow.But in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, the spike proteins are no longer able to grab on to the ACE2 proteins, making the slide glow less, indicating the effectiveness of the antibodies. By printing different variants of the COVID-19 spike protein on different portions of the slide, researchers can see how effective the antibodies are at preventing each variant from latching onto their human cellular target simultaneously.In the paper, the researchers tested the technology a number of different ways. They tried monoclonal antibodies either derived from real-life patients or from Regeneron s commercial prophylactic treatment. They also tested plasma taken from healthy vaccinated people and those currently infected with the virus. In all of our tests, the results largely mimicked what we ve been seeing in the literature,  said Jake Heggestad, a PhD student working in the Chilkoti lab.  And in this case, not finding anything new is a good sign, because it means our test is working just as well as the methods currently being used. While they produce similar results, the critical difference between the CoVariant-SCAN and current methods is the speed and ease with which it can produce results. Typical current approaches require isolating live virus and culturing cells, which can take 24 hours or more and requires a wide variety of safety precautions and specially trained technicians. The CoVariant-SCAN, in contrast, does not require live virus, is easy to use in most settings and takes less than an hour potentially just 15 minutes to produce accurate results.Moving forward, Heggestad and the Chilkoti lab are working to streamline the technique into a microfluidic chip that could be mass produced and report results with only a few drops of blood, plasma or other liquid sample containing antibodies. This approach has already been proven to work on a similar test that can distinguish COVID-19 from other coronaviruses. We would love to have real-time visibility of the emerging variants and understand who still has functional immunity,  Wolfe said.  Additionally, this hints that there might be a technique whereby you could quickly assess which synthetic monoclonal antibody might be best to administer to a patient with a particular emergent variant. Currently we really have no real-time way of knowing that, so we rely on epidemiological data that can track weeks behind. The reverse is also true,  Wolfe continued.  To be able to pre-screen an individual's antibodies and predict whether they were sufficiently protected against a particular variant they are perhaps about to run into while travelling, or that is emerging in their area. We have no way of doing that at the present time. But a test like the CoVariant-SCAN could make all of these scenarios possible. Reference: Heggestad JT, Britton RJ, Kinnamon DS, et al.

Tumors exhibiting such alterations usually have a poor outcome. Early detection can help to determine the most appropriate treatments. However, in many CLL cases genomic instability can occur without such detectable alterations.The authors were able to decode the tumor biology and translate the underlying information in a way that makes it possible to categorize tumors irrespective of detectable losses or mutations of tumor suppressor or DNA repair genes.The authors further discovered that genomically instable tumors do not just shut down DNA repair but they also show boosted and highly error-prone repair activity. This further increases accumulation rates of genomic alterations, accelerating the development of resistance. The findings also imply that preexisting latent genomic instability may reach critical levels during certain developmental steps of the B cell and precede the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.     This observation is very interesting as it highlights the importance of multiple pathogenic elements during malignant transformation and further evolution. Exploiting the weak spots in this cascade may provide additional opportunities for early detection or therapeutic intervention,  explains Dr. Johannes Bloehdorn, from the University of Ulm, and lead author of the study.Another major subgroup identified in this study, showing the lowest degree of genomic instability, exhibits characteristics observed during the process of metastasis in solid tumors, which were previously not known to build subgroup-specific functional networks in CLL.CLL cells can reach any part of the body via the bloodstream. Therefore, it appears redundant to develop mechanisms that enable the cell to break free from a tumor to search for a new niche for better survival, which is represented through the process of metastasis in solid tumors. These uncovered networks may increase the ability for the leukemia cells to exit the bloodstream and migrate to certain tissues to  take a rest . Several new targeted treatment approaches exactly address related mechanisms and the cells ability to migrate to or stay in lymphoid organs. When forced out of this pro-survival niche, cells slowly  starve  since being cut-off their lifeline,  says Dr. Bloehdorn.However, in contrast to the genomically instable subgroup, these CLL cells show a very high dependency on genomic integrity to retain full functionality of their signaling networks. Even after intensive chemotherapy (which aims to disrupt DNA integrity to kill the tumor cell), cases of this subgroup were clearly traceable through the specific gene expression signatures, which were used as an  identity code . These cases maintained the lowest frequency of critical chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations, which occur at higher frequency after chemotherapy. It appears to be elementary for tumor cells of this subgroup to be locked into a state where they can avert occurrence of DNA-damage and activation of associated repair-pathways. This finding also provides new perspectives on how treatment resistance can develop in CLL as the discovered subgroups point to highly different trajectories,  notes Dr. Bloehdorn.Future efforts will now focus on the mechanisms during early tumorigenesis, which promote genomic instability. This will help to better explain the underlying pathogenic processes and categorize tumors in an early stage. Reference: Bloehdorn J, Braun A, Taylor-Weiner A, et al.

For example, laboratory research into male or female reproduction requires only animals of the sex being studied. And in farming, only female animals are required for egg production and in dairy herds. This means it is common practice for animals of the unrequired sex to be culled after birth. The researchers  new method uses a two-part genetic system to inactivate embryos shortly after fertilisation, allowing only the desired sex to develop. Such a genetically-based method to control the sex of offspring could drastically reduce culling in both industries.The embryo selection is based on the fact that there are two elements of CRISPR-Cas9   the Cas9 enzyme that cuts the DNA, allowing scientists to alter specific regions, and the guide RNA which carries the Cas9 to the right location on the genome. The team placed one element of the system on the father s X or Y chromosome, meaning that it will only be inherited by female or male embryos respectively. The other element is contributed by the mother, and is inherited by all embryos. They targeted the Top1 gene, which is essential to DNA replication and repair. When an embryo formed from a sperm and egg, each containing one half of CRISPR-Cas9, the gene-editing was triggered in the embryo and it was not able to develop beyond a very early stage of around 16 to 32 cells. Using this method, the researchers were able to control, with 100% effect, the sex of a litter. To produce a male-only litter, the researchers edited the father s X chromosome, meaning only females inherited the deleterious mutation, and for a female-only litter, they edited the Y chromosome. Surprisingly, the method did not lead to a 50% decrease in the number of offspring produced, rather the litter sizes were between 61% - 72% of the control litters. The researchers suggest this is because animals such as mice produce more eggs than required during each ovarian cycle, allowing for a proportion of them to be lost during early development without reducing litter size. This means that in situations where one sex is needed, fewer breeding animals will be required in order to produce the same number of the desired sex of offspring.As the Top1 gene is well conserved across mammals, these results may also be applicable to other animals.Charlotte Douglas, first author and former PhD student and postdoctoral scientist at the Crick, says:  This method works as we split the genome editing process in half, between a male and female, and it is only when the two halves meet in an embryo through breeding, that it is activated. Embryos with both halves cannot develop beyond very early cell stages. We ve also shown this process works successfully in different combinations - introducing either the Cas9 or the guide RNA elements on to the mother s or father s chromosomes. As the offspring which survive only contain half of the CRISPR-Cas9 elements within their genome, this acts as a control preventing the sex-selection being passed down to further generations, unless they are selectively bred with an individual of the opposite sex containing the other half. This is different to genetic engineering through  gene-drive  methods, which seek to spread a genetic mutation widely amongst a population. There are also no harmful effects of the gene edit in the surviving offspring.James Turner, author and group leader of the Sex Chromosome Biology Laboratory at the Crick says:  This work could have immediate and valuable impact in scientific laboratories, as we ve shown how it is safe and effective in mice, a common mammal used in medical and scientific research. While a lot of research needs both sexes, there are areas of study where only one is needed. For example, when studying the reproductive system, sex-specific diseases, or certain hormones. Peter Ellis, author and senior lecturer in molecular genetics and reproduction at University of Kent, says:  The implications of this work are potentially far-reaching when it comes to improving animal welfare, but should be considered at ethical and regulatory levels.  In particular, before any potential use in agriculture, there would need to be extensive public conversation and debate, as well as changes to legislation. On the scientific side, there is also much work to be done over a number of years. Further research is needed, first to develop the particular gene editing toolkits for different species, and then to check they are safe and effective.

At any given moment, which scene you perceive depends on whether your brain is viewing the central vase shape to be the foreground or background of the picture.Now, Professor John Reynolds and Senior Postdoctoral Fellow Tom Franken have made headway into understanding how the brain decides which side of a visual border is a foreground object and which is background. The research, published on November 30, 2021 in the journal eLife, sheds light on how areas of the brain communicate to interpret sensory information and build a picture of the world around us. The way that the brain organizes and generates a representation of the outside world is still one of the biggest unknowns in neuroscience today,  says Reynolds, holder of the Fiona and Sanjay Jha Chair in Neuroscience.  Our research provides important insights into how the brain processes borders, which could lead to a better understanding of psychiatric conditions where perception is disrupted, such as in schizophrenia. When you view a scene in front of you, individual neurons in the brain s cortex each receive information about a minuscule region of the scene. Neurons receiving information from the border of an object thus have little initial context about which side is foreground. However, scientists previously discovered a set of cells that very quickly signal which side of the border belongs to the object (  border ownership ); after all, depth perception and the ability to pick out objects in front of you is critical to survival is that a curb or a shadow, a rock or a cave?Exactly how these neurons in the brain compute border ownership has been unclear. Some scientists hypothesized that as information from the eye passes through the brain, into successively more downstream (deeper) areas, additional computations occur in each area until your brain builds a model of the visual scene. This is called the  feedforward  pathway. But other scientists hypothesized the importance of the  feedback  pathway, in which downstream areas of the brain must first process information, and then send these clues back to neurons in upstream areas, to help them figure out border ownership.Reynolds and Franken set out to determine which hypothesis was correct. They used electrodes to record the activity of neurons in different layers of the brain s cortex as animals viewed an image of a square object on an otherwise blank background. The scientists first determined which particular neurons were processing information from a small part of the border that demarcates the square and the background; then they measured the timing of border ownership signals in these neurons and compared this for neurons in different layers. What we found is that the earliest signals on border ownership occur in neurons in the deep layers of the brain s cortex,  says Franken, who is a physician-scientist and supported by a K99 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institutes of Health.  This supports the importance of the feedback pathway for deciphering borders, because feedback connections arrive at and leave from neurons in deep layers. The researchers also observed that neurons stacked vertically in different layers in the cortex tended to share the same preference of border ownership. For example, certain columns of neurons preferred scenes where the left side of a border was the object, while other columns of neurons preferred scenes where the right side of a border was the object. Franken explains that these findings suggest that feedback might actually be organized in a systematic way, a promising avenue for further research. As we come to understand the architecture of the brain and how ensembles of neurons communicate with each other to build up our internal representation of the external world, we are better positioned to develop diagnostic tools and treatments for brain disorders in which these internal representations are distorted, such as schizophrenia,  says Franken.  The hallucinations and delusions associated with schizophrenia may be associated with the disruptions of feedforward-feedback loops. Next, Franken will follow up on these results with experiments to investigate how information conveyed by feedback contributes to the processing of borders.Reference: Franken TP, Reynolds JH.

How does the structure of the neurons change? Some pathological changes in the tissue are easy to identify using standard microscopy. For example, the protein deposits known as  plaques , which occur in Alzheimer's disease, can be seen with staining techniques. However, pathological changes can also be of a more subtle nature and easily missed unless there is a complete digitilisation and analysis of the three-dimensional structure. Researchers at the University of G ttingen and University Medical Center G ttingen have now found a new technique to measure and quantify neuronal tissue architecture in three dimensions and at high resolution, which enabled them to identify changes in neurons in Alzheimer s. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).The team developed a special X-ray imaging method that enabled them to detect a previously unknown transition in neuronal cell nuclei in tissue samples from the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients. The changes indicate altered activity of neurons. The scientists examined neuronal tissue from the hippocampus, a brain region where memories are transferred from short-term to long-term memory. Chemically fixed tissue samples just a few millimetres wide were first X-rayed using phase-contrast tomography. The researchers used a special phase-contrast tomograph, which the team, led by Professor Tim Salditt from the Institute of X-ray Physics at the University of G ttingen, has set up at the PETRA III storage ring at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY). The tomograph can be used to image tissue that only weakly absorbs X-rays, or not at all. This meant that large volumes of tissue could be recorded in their entirety, without damaging the samples and without time-consuming preparation.""To do this, the three-dimensional image from highly magnified projections must first be focused on the computer using special algorithms in order to obtain a three-dimensional image with pixel sizes in the range of one ten-thousandth of a millimetre,"" explains Marina Eckermann, first author of the paper. Using this ""digital twin"" of the sample, machine learning can then be used to identify neurons   excitable cells that use electrical impulses and chemical signals to send information between different areas of the brain. Using new mathematical methods from  optimal transport theory , developed by Professor Bernhard Schmitzer at the Institute of Computer Science at the University of G ttingen, the cell population of different individuals could be compared with each other without having to define which hypotheses were being used or whether the samples belonged to a particular patient group. The comparison of the structural features did not just refer to the average values of the corresponding neurons, but to every single one of the detected cells of each individual.""These new results show that in Alzheimer s disease, the cell nuclei in a subsection in the hippocampus change into being more compact and having more of a mixture of different structures,"" says Professor Tim Salditt from G ttingen University. ""This leads to a higher proportion of densely packed DNA in the cell nucleus and to DNA being read out less frequently. Whether the observed changes in the cell nucleus also play a causal role in development of the disease remains to be seen,"" explains Professor Christine Stadelmann-Nessler, Director of the Institute of Neuropathology at the University Medical Center G ttingen.Reference: Eckermann M, Schmitzer B, Meer F van der, et al.

The findings illustrate that discrete subcellular structures in the human organ of hearing, the cochlea, are involved in the variation of risk of age-related hearing loss in the population. The study is published in BMC Medicine.Hearing loss is a potentially debilitating condition that affects more than 1.23 billion people worldwide. The most common form of hearing loss, which represents 90% of all cases, is related to the degenerative effects of aging on hearing, i.e., age-related hearing loss or presbycusis. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of age-related hearing loss and individual variation in risk are poorly elucidated.In the current study, a unique collaboration was established between otologists and geneticists at Uppsala University, which allowed for functional follow-up studies of candidate genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using immunohistochemistry in the human cochlea. The cochlea, and in particular the hearing organ, the organ of Corti, is a highly vulnerable structure that is difficult to analyse since it is surrounded by the hardest bone in the body,  says Helge Rask-Andersen, MD and Senior Professor at the Department of Surgical Sciences.  We have been able to study some of the molecular components of human hearing that are critical for the conversion of sound to nerve electric impulses. Genetic variants at 67 genomic regions were found to contribute to increased risk of age-related hearing loss. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on hearing-related traits were performed in the UK Biobank, which has half a million participants from the United Kingdom. Genetic associations are difficult to interpret by themselves and follow-up experiments are often required before causal genes can be inferred. It is an amazing opportunity to be able to follow up our findings in human cochlear samples, since there are molecular differences between the hearing organ of humans and other mammals,  says Mathias Rask-Andersen, Associate Professor at the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology.Candidate proteins from GWAS were visualised with immunofluorescent antibodies and super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) by Dr Wei Liu, MD and Associate Professor at the Department of Surgical Sciences. Several proteins were observed within the spiral ganglion, which contains the neuronal cell bodies that innervate the hair cells in the organ of Corti and carry neuronal impulses to the brain via the cochlear nerve.The researchers could also visualise hearing loss-associated proteins in discrete subcellular domains in the hair cells for the first time in humans, such as TRIO and F-actin-binding protein (TRIOBP) in the hair tufts (stereocilia) and LIM domain only protein 7 (LMO7) in the cuticular plate, which is an actin-rich structure that anchors stereocilia to the cell body. The stereocilia are the microscopic or nano-sized  hairs  that protrude from the hair cells of the organ of Corti. They respond to mechanical vibrations from sounds that reach us and are transferred and amplified from the ear drum to the inner ear by the small middle ear bones.Taken together, the findings from the current study demonstrate that common genetic variations associated with age-related hearing loss affect the structures of the cochlea, in particular the neuronal processes of the spiral ganglion, but also structures directly involved in the transduction of mechanical stimuli to neuronal impulses. This knowledge may help to better understand the biological mechanisms that lead to age-related hearing loss and generate strategies for prevention such as novel pharmacological treatments.Reference: Liu W, Johansson  , Rask-Andersen H, Rask-Andersen M.

Mechanistically, we show that 4 -FlU is in a different class from molnupiravir that is currently considered for regulatory approval,  said Dr. Richard Plemper, Distinguished University Professor, director of the Center for Translational Antiviral Research at Georgia State and senior author of the study.  4 -FlU does not act as a mutagen but induces termination of the viral polymerase, aborting replication of the viral genome. There is an urgent need to expand the therapeutic arsenal against SARS-CoV-2 and 4 -FlU has strong developmental promise as a companion drug. In the study, 4 -FlU was tested against different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in ferrets, which have emerged as a leading model for drug testing, and against respiratory syncytial virus in mice. The researchers found that this drug potently blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication, including the gamma and delta variants in the ferret, and efficiently suppressed RSV burden in mouse lungs.

The study was published in the journal Infection and Immunity.  AB569 was patented in the United States in 2018 by Daniel Hassett, PhD, professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry and Microbiology at the UC College of Medicine. Hassett s research has found that AB569 kills virtually all pathogenic bacteria tested with no observed acquired resistance. These, including multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA), are some of the most serious pathogens according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exhibiting multidrug resistance and enhanced virulence properties. Multidrug resistant bacteria, often called  superbugs,  are an ever-burgeoning global health problem,  says Hassett.  As a result, there is a critical need to develop novel and effective antimicrobials for the prevention, treatment and eradication and healing of such wounds that are complicated by the most formidable pathogen of burn patients, known as MDR-PA. Injury severity is predominantly due to potentially lethal sepsis caused by MDR-PA. Hassett, who is the co-corresponding author on this study with Latha Satish, PhD, director of clinical lab operations at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center, says the research shows AB569 acts synergistically to kill all human burn wound strains of the pathogen in vitro.  AB569 not only kills the bug, it also enhances the wound-healing process,  says Hassett.  At the same time, AB569 topical application significantly increases the anti-inflammatory mediators...that allow improved epidermal restoration and the healing process to occur more rapidly and efficiently. AB569 was initially seen as a potential treatment for many antibiotic-resistant organisms that cause pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and many other opportunistic infections. In addition to tackling COPD and cystic fibrosis, AB569 may also be effective in addressing infections related to severe burns, urinary tract disorders, endocarditis and diabetes, said Hassett. This study provides solid foundational evidence that AB569 can be used topically to treat highly problematic dermal [injuries] including wound, burn, blast and likely diabetic infections in civilian and military populations and help relieve the economical burden that MDR organisms have on the global health care system,  says Hassett.Reference: Barry A, Panmanee W, Hassett DJ, Satish L.

Phycocyanin has a vibrant blue color,  said Alireza Abbaspourrad, the Youngkeun Joh Assistant Professor of Food Chemistry and Ingredient Technology in the Department of Food Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.  However, if you want to put phycocyanin into acidified beverages, the blue color fades quickly due to thermal treatment. The research,  Tuning C-Phycocyanin Photoactivity via pH-Mediated Assembly Disassembly,  was authored by Ying Li, a doctoral student in food science; Richard Gillilan, staff scientist at the Macromolecular X-ray science at the Cornell HighEnergy Synchrotron Source, or  MacCHESS ; and Abbaspourrad.Most food companies seeking blues in their food use synthetic food dye, Abbaspourrad said. Phycocyanin is a natural and more nutritional protein derived from algae, which is the main ingredient in spirulina, mostly sold in powder form at health food stores. The food scientists wanted to understand its color properties and how it worked.Food science, meet physics. The researchers partnered with the Macromolecular Diffraction Facility of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and used Size-Exclusion Chromatography coupled to Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SEC SAXS) on a beamline.Phycocyanin was placed into a biological fluid and brought to the MacCHESS laboratory. There, intense beamline X-rays were channeled into tiny drops of the fluid. The small-angle X-ray scattering showed that as pH levels, the molecular strands changed into different shapes, folds and assemblies. So as pH changes, the phycocyanin molecules form in different ways,  Li said.  If the pH goes up, the molecules come together and if the pH level goes down, the molecules disassemble. As we changed the environmental stimulus for the phycocyanin, the molecules modulate their behavior in terms of how they interact with light,  she said.  It's a relationship of the protein structure and the color stability. The acidity of the environment can essentially mediate an assembly-disassembly pathway, Abbaspourrad said.  Through the X-ray scattering we could see the proteins and see how their monomers are assembled together and how the oligomers disassemble,  he said.  That s the root cause for how the blue color fades. Reference: Li Y, Gillilan R, Abbaspourrad A. Tuning C-Phycocyanin photoactivity via pH-mediated assembly disassembly.

They believe this misplaced immunity could result in the release of antibodies against PF4, which bind to and activate platelets, causing them to cluster together and triggering blood clots in a very small number of people after the vaccine is administered.Their findings are published today in the international journal Science Advances. Professor Alan Parker, an expert in the use of adenoviruses for medical applications from Cardiff University s School of Medicine, said:  VITT only happens in extremely rare cases because a chain of complex events needs to take place to trigger this ultra-rare side effect. Our data confirms PF4 can bind to adenoviruses, an important step in unravelling the mechanism underlying VITT. Although very rare, it is critical we fully investigate vector-host interactions of the vaccine at a mechanistic level to help us understand both how the vaccine generates immunity   and how it may lead to any rare adverse events, such as VITT. Establishing a mechanism could help to prevent and treat this disorder. We hope our findings can be used to better understand the rare side effects of these new vaccines   and potentially to design new and improved vaccines to turn the tide on this global pandemic. Both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines use an adenovirus to carry spike proteins from the coronavirus into people to trigger a protective immune response.When both vaccines showed the ultra-rare side effect of VITT, scientists wondered whether the viral vector had some part to play. Another important clue was that neither the Moderna nor Pfizer vaccines, made from an entirely different technology called mRNA vaccines, showed this effect.The team used a technology called CryoEM to flash-freeze preparations of ChAdOx1, the adenovirus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine and bombard them with electrons to produce microscopic images of the vaccine components.They were then able to look in atomic level at the structure of the outer protein cage of the virus   the viral capsid   and other critical proteins that allow entry of the virus into the cell.In particular, the team detail the structure and receptor of ChAdOx1, which is adapted from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25   and how it interacts with PF4. They believe it is this specific interaction   and how it is then presented to the immune system   that could prompt the body s own defences to view it as foreign and release of antibodies against this self-protein.The research team used computational models, which the Singharoy group at ASU specialise in, to show that one of the ways the two molecules tightly bind is via electrostatic interactions.First author on the study Dr Alexander Baker, an Honorary Research Fellow at Cardiff University, said:  We found that ChAdOx1 has a strong negative charge. This means the viral vector can act like a magnet and attract proteins with the opposite, positive charge, like PF4. We then found that PF4 is just the right size and shape that when it gets close to ChAdOx1 it could bind in between the negatively charged parts of ChAdOx1 s surface, called hexons. The research team are hopeful that armed with a better understanding of what may be causing rare VITT they can provide further insights into how vaccines and other therapies, which rely on the same technology, might be altered in the development of the next generation vaccines and therapies. With a better understanding of the mechanism by which PF4 and adenoviruses interact there is an opportunity to engineer the capsid, or outer shell of the vaccine, to prevent this interaction occurring. Modifying ChAdOx1 to reduce electronegativity may reduce the chance of causing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome,  said Dr Baker.Reference: Baker Alexander T., Boyd Ryan J., Sarkar Daipayan, et al.

A group of Italian and American researchers led by Fabrizio d Adda di Fagagna now reports that the expression of the cell receptor for the virus, ACE2, which is essential for mediating cell entry of the virus, increases in the lungs of aging mice and humans. They further show that ACE2 expression increases upon telomere shortening or dysfunction   common hallmarks of aging   in cultured human cells and in mice. This increase depends on a DNA damage response elicited by dysfunctional telomeres. The findings published today by EMBO Reports provide one possible molecular explanation for the increased sensitivity of elderly people to SARS-CoV-2.The reasons for the higher probability of severe symptoms and death in the elderly in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. ACE2 expression has been positively related to patients  age, for example in the nasal epithelium, the first point of contact with SARS-CoV-2. Lower ACE2 expression in children relative to adults may explain why COVID-19 is less prevalent in children, and the expression and distribution of the ACE2 receptor may be relevant for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. The research findings now show that ACE2 protein expression is elevated in aging human and mouse lungs, including in alveolar epithelial type II cells (ATII). In the lungs, ACE2 is mostly found on the surface of ATII cells, and these cells are thus likely the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads via respiratory droplets and the lung is the first target organ of the virus. Indeed, pneumonia is the most common complication seen in COVID-19 patients, at an occurrence of 91%. In order to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the upregulation of ACE2 during aging, the researchers turned to in vitro and in vivo models that recapitulate some key aspects of aging. Aging is associated with telomere shortening and damage in a range of tissues in different species, including humans. Telomeres are the regions at the ends of linear chromosomes that are essential to protect chromosome ends from shortening during repeated cell replication cycles, which would result in the loss of crucial genetic information. When telomeres become critically short, they are sensed as DNA breaks and activate DNA damage response pathways. D Adda di Fagagna working at IFOM in Milan and CNR-IGM in Pavia and colleagues either inhibited the general DNA damage response by targeting ATM, a major enzyme of the DNA damage response pathway, or they inhibited the telomeric DNA damage response specifically using telomeric antisense oligonucleotides (tASO). Both approaches prevent ACE2 gene and protein upregulation following telomere damage in aging cultured cells and in mice. The group also used a cell culture model in which the DNA damage response is activated specifically at telomeres in the absence of telomere shortening, with the same results. These findings indicate that it is the DNA damage response activation, rather than telomeric shortening per se, that is responsible for ACE2 upregulation.  Understanding the mechanism of age susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is important for targeted therapeutic approaches, which might in principle include the use of tASO-mediated inhibition of the telomeric DNA damage response.ACE2 also has a role in the regulation of blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts and is expressed in other human tissues, for example the heart and kidney. The findings reported here may thus also have broader medical implications beyond COVID-19.However, further research is needed to establish whether reducing ACE2 expression has beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and on the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in in vivo models.  Further work also needs to be carried out to understand how DNA damage response signaling leads to increased Ace2 gene expression.Reference: DNA damage response at telomeres boosts the transcription of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 during aging.

Yet for those with persistent, developmental stuttering, there is new hope, thanks to groundbreaking research led by scientists at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and Wayne State University in Detroit.In two papers published Dec. 2, Jennifer  Piper  Below, PhD, and Shelly Jo Kraft, PhD, describe a  genetic architecture  for developmental stuttering and report the discovery of new genetic variations associated with the condition.The researchers believe that studies like these have the potential to identify therapeutic directions that could improve outcomes for people who stutter. It s clear that in populations, stuttering is polygenic, meaning that there are multiple different genetic factors contributing to and protecting people from risk,  said Below, associate professor of Medicine at VUMC.  That was something that had not been clearly shown before these studies. The papers, published in The American Journal of Human Genetics and Human Genetics and Genomics Advances, will not immediately change health outcomes for people who stutter. But they  open the floodgates for the kind of research that may one day lead to that,  Below said.The new revelations also will have a huge impact on people who stutter and on the parents of children affected by the condition, predicted Kraft, associate professor of Communication Sciences and Disorders and director of the Behavior, Speech & Genetics Lab at Wayne State University. It s a piece of themselves that they can then understand,  she said,  instead of living a lifetime of experiencing this difference in their speech and never knowing why.  Why me? Why did this happen?  Or for parents,  why did this happen to my child? Characterized by sound prolongations, repetitions and involuntary breaks of syllables and words, developmental stuttering occurs in more than 5% of children and 1% of adults worldwide. In addition to impacting their academic experiences, adolescents who stutter often experience higher incidence of bullying,  the researchers noted.  Stuttering can increase risk of unemployment and reduce perceived job performance, both of which contribute to reducing socioeconomic status. Kraft s interest in the genetics of developmental stuttering began 17 years ago, prior to entering the doctoral program in Speech Language Pathology and Human Genetics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.In 2010 she and Below met at the University of Chicago, where Kraft was a postdoctoral scholar and Below was a graduate student in Human Genetics.Over the years, and with the help of colleagues in Ireland, England, Israel, Sweden, Australia, and throughout the United States, Kraft collected blood and saliva samples for genetic studies from more than 1,800 people who stutter, including more than 250 families with three generations of stuttering.But while that effort, called the International Stuttering Project (www.theinternationalstutteringproject.com), identified new genetic variations, or variants, associated with developmental stuttering, it was not sufficiently  powered  to reveal the complexity of the condition. There simply were not enough people in the studies.That s where Below comes in. She utilized a key VUMC resource, BioVU, one of the world s largest repositories of human DNA linked to searchable, electronic health information. BioVU has enabled researchers to conduct GWAS, or genome-wide association studies, to probe the genetic underpinnings of a wide range of diseases.Stuttering, however, is a condition that is rarely mentioned or given a diagnostic code in the medical record. People aren t hospitalized for stuttering.  We had to come up with some clever new ways to try to capture that missing code,  Below said.From confirmed cases of developmental stuttering, the researchers constructed a  constellation  of diagnostic codes for other conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autoimmune reactions to infections that co-occur with stuttering more frequently than would be expected by chance.Then, using machine learning techniques, they created an artificial intelligence tool that used the presence of these  phenotypes  recorded in the electronic health record to predict those who were likely to stutter,  even in the absence of having a direct note about their stuttering in their medical record,  Below said.Supported by a $3.5 million, five-year grant awarded in 2018 by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, part of the National Institutes of Health, the researchers demonstrated that their stuttering prediction model positively predicted the presence of stuttering more than 80% of the time.The research also turned up a stuttering-related gene implicated in autism-spectrum disorder, as well as genetic variants that affect the regulation of sex hormones. The latter finding may help explain why boys are more likely to stutter, and why women who stutter are more likely to recover.Below said the biobank study would not have been possible were it not for the case studies compiled by Kraft and her colleagues, which confirmed that the  genetic architecture we re picking up in this large-scale biobank study actually is detecting risk factors for clinical stuttering. Some correlations between traits may be spurious, Below noted. But if the researchers establish genetic connections between stuttering and other traits such as ADHD, those findings could open up avenues for treating both conditions at the same time, Kraft said.Kraft and her colleagues are expanding their health inventories of people who stutter to capture more co-occurring conditions.  We can power these studies with electronic databases,  she said,  but we need people who stutter, who can give their individual stories and   the complexity of everything they are experiencing to validate the results.

Participants were most open to buying bunches containing imperfect carrots after being presented with both of those marketing messages promoting ugly carrots  personal and societal benefits. Either message alone was not effective at convincing consumers to buy misfit carrots.Findings also showed that respondents were willing to pay, with a small discount, for some level of mixed bunches containing both ugly and standard carrots, maxing out at 40% of misshapen carrots   a sign to regulators who set the tolerance level for cosmetic standards that such a practice could be profitable.One 2018 study in North Carolina suggested that about 41% of unharvested food is edible but unmarketable because of its appearance. The researchers are assessing ways to  win  with ugly foods in the marketplace by testing consumer acceptance of imperfect foods that don t come with a built-in discount   a tactic used by some brick-and-mortar and online retailers that hasn t had much staying power. Any time you codify that cosmetically imperfect produce is somehow lesser, you re stuck selling it for less and therefore you undermine the entire value chain,  said senior study author Brian Roe, professor in the Department of Agricultural, Environmental and Development Economics at The Ohio State University. We see that once you promote it as being more natural and as reducing wasted food, the discount is less than it otherwise would be   but there is also a cluster of folks who are actually willing to pay as much or more because they value reducing food waste and they value the fact that it s got just as much nutrition as standard produce. Roe conducted the study with Danyi Qi and Jerrod Penn of Louisiana State University and Ran Li, an Ohio State PhD student. The research is published online ahead of print in the Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services.The researchers surveyed 1,300 U.S. residents who shopped and cooked for their households. Participants in the online survey were randomly assigned to receive one or a combination of two marketing messages: ugly carrots  nutritional quality equals that of blemish-free produce, and there are social costs linked to throwing away food with cosmetic flaws.Participants also selected from images of their preferred 2-pound carrot bunches and price points, with six bunches   either with or without their greenery attached   containing 0% to 100% ugly carrots and prices ranging from $2.18 to $1.39 per pound. In another choice test, consumers could select from just two options, a bunch of all standard carrots or all imperfect carrots with or without green leaves attached, in a hypothetical purchase from either a farmers market or a conventional grocery store.Participants consistently disliked bunches that included any ugly carrots at all, and the amount they were willing to pay for any number of imperfect carrots was always lower than what they d pay for 100% standard carrots.But a top contender in terms of profitability for farmers did emerge from the analysis of participant responses: bunches containing 40% ugly carrots and 60% standard carrots with green leaves attached sold at farmers markets where consumers are exposed to the combined marketing messages. If you re at a farmers market, you re thinking more holistically, you re not thinking about cosmetic perfection. You expect things to be more  real,  Roe said.  So I think then people realize this is what we might expect if we re getting produce directly from a farmer   there s more room for imperfection because it s probably not interpreted as imperfection. It s interpreted as naturalness. The research team analyzed the tipping point in consumer willingness to pay that could make harvesting ugly carrots profitable   an important calculation for farmers who need a positive return on their investment into planting, picking and shipping their crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also has a say in the percentage of non-standard produce that can be sent to market   a limit that may need to be revisited, Roe said. We hope these findings will change the viewpoint of the industry. If you want to move into the ugly produce space, you probably need to rebrand it rather than locking in a discount and saying,  This is ugly food that should be worth less, so let s just lock it in as being an inferior good from the get-go,  he said.  There hasn t been a lot of rethinking of standards in light of food waste, so that would be one policy lever that could be re-examined to deal with food waste in the modern era.

Any machine learning algorithm that has been developed so far will have some uncertainty in its prediction,  Thiagarajan said.  There is little way to quantify those uncertainties.

In a report in Nature, researchers describe the development of a neural network that  hallucinates  proteins with new, stable structures.Proteins, which are string-like molecules found in every cell, spontaneously fold into intricate three-dimensional shapes. These folded shapes are key to nearly every biological process, including cellular development, DNA repair, and metabolism. But the complexity of protein shapes makes them difficult to study. Biochemists often use computers to predict how protein strings, or sequences, might fold. In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the accuracy of this work. For this project, we made up completely random protein sequences and introduced mutations into them until our neural network predicted that they would fold into stable structures,  said co-lead author Ivan Anishchenko,  He is an  acting instructor of biochemisty at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a researcher in David Baker s laboratory at the UW Medicine Institute for Protein Design. At no point did we guide the software toward a particular outcome,  Anishchenko said,   These new proteins are just what a computer dreams up. In the future, the team believes it should be possible to steer the artificial intelligence so that it generates new proteins with useful features. We d like to use deep learning to design proteins with function, including protein-based drugs, enzymes, you name it,  said co-lead author Sam Pellock, a postdoctoral scholar in the Baker lab.The research team, which included scientists from UW Medicine, Harvard University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), generated two thousand new protein sequences that were predicted to fold. Over 100 of these were produced in the laboratory and studied. Detailed analysis on three such proteins confirmed that the shapes predicted by the computer were indeed realized in the lab. Our NMR [nuclear magnetic resonance] studies, along with X-ray crystal structures determined by the University of Washington team, demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of protein designs created by the hallucination approach , said co-author Theresa Ramelot, a senior research scientist at RPI in Troy, New York.Gaetano Montelione, a co-author and professor of chemistry and chemical biology at RPI, noted.  The hallucination approach builds on observations we made together with the Baker lab revealing that protein structure prediction with deep learning can be quite accurate even for a single protein sequence with no natural relatives. The potential to hallucinate brand new proteins that bind particular biomolecules or form desired enzymatic active sites is very exciting . This approach greatly simplifies protein design,  said senior author David Baker, a professor of biochemistry at the UW School of Medicine who received a 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.  Before, to create a new protein with a particular shape, people first carefully studied related structures in nature to come up with a set of rules that were then applied in the design process. New sets of rules were needed for each new type of fold. Here, by using a deep-learning network that already captures general principles of protein structure, we eliminate the need for fold-specific rules and open up the possibility of focusing on just the functional parts of a protein directly. Exploring how to best use this strategy for specific applications is now an active area of research, and this is where I expect the next breakthroughs,  said Baker.Reference: Anishchenko I, Pellock SJ, Chidyausiku TM, et al.

MR1 is a protein sensor that takes cellular products generated during infections or disease and presents them for T cells to detect, thereby alerting the immune system.These gamma delta T cells play an understudied role within specific tissues around the body including the intestinal tract and may be an important factor in diseases that impact these tissues.The findings are published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The study was co-led by Dr Benjamin S. Gully and Dr Martin Davey with first author Mr Michael Rice from the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute. Mr Rice, a PhD student in the Rossjohn lab, says the more we understand how such cells recognise, interact with and even kill infected, diseased or cancerous cells, the greater informed we are when developing therapies and treatments for a range of conditions. Gamma delta T cells are key players in the immune response to infected and cancerous cells, yet we know very little about how they mediate these important functions,  said Mr Rice.By using a high-intensity X-ray beam at the Australian Synchrotron, the scientists were able to obtain a detailed 3D atomic model of how the gamma delta T cell receptor recognises MR1. What sets these cells apart from others seems to be the unusual ways in which they interact with MR1. This work further recasts our understanding of how T cell receptors can interact with specialised MHC-like molecules and represents a notable development for our understanding of T cell biology.Mr Rice stated:  By using high-resolution protein imaging and biochemical assays, we were able to identify key mechanisms that govern gamma delta T cell receptor recognition of MR1, a key sensor of bacterial infection.  Co-lead author Dr Gully said:  These cells have evaded characterisation for a long time, leading to many assumptions on how they become activated. Here we have shown that these gamma delta T cells can recognise MHC-like molecules in their own unique ways and in ways we could not have predicted. These results will now inform our attempts to understand the roles of these gamma delta T cells within the tissues in which they are found, and in deciphering their roles within disease. Dr Davey said:  These are important T cells that form a major component of the immune system within human tissues such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. With a greater understanding of how our immune system operates within these tissues, we can reveal crucial insight into disease. A better understanding of these tissue-specific T cells could reveal their power as a new line of immunotherapies for infection and cancer immunotherapy.

On top of your desk, there might be a laptop that is sitting to the left of a phone, which is in front of a computer monitor.Many deep learning models struggle to see the world this way because they don t understand the entangled relationships between individual objects. Without knowledge of these relationships, a robot designed to help someone in a kitchen would have difficulty following a command like  pick up the spatula that is to the left of the stove and place it on top of the cutting board. In an effort to solve this problem, MIT researchers have developed a model that understands the underlying relationships between objects in a scene. Their model represents individual relationships one at a time, then combines these representations to describe the overall scene. This enables the model to generate more accurate images from text descriptions, even when the scene includes several objects that are arranged in different relationships with one another.This work could be applied in situations where industrial robots must perform intricate, multistep manipulation tasks, like stacking items in a warehouse or assembling appliances. It also moves the field one step closer to enabling machines that can learn from and interact with their environments more like humans do. When I look at a table, I can t say that there is an object at XYZ location. Our minds don t work like that. In our minds, when we understand a scene, we really understand it based on the relationships between the objects. We think that by building a system that can understand the relationships between objects, we could use that system to more effectively manipulate and change our environments,  says Yilun Du, a PhD student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and co-lead author of the paper.Du wrote the paper with co-lead authors Shuang Li, a CSAIL PhD student, and Nan Liu, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; as well as Joshua B.

To conduct the study, the researchers first applied a manipulation to increase the release of dopamine from its endogenous pools within the lateral septum during social interaction, leading to an increase of aggressive behavior in the mice. But when they inhibited dopamine release, aggressive behavior ceased.""We reasoned that by identifying the dopamine receptor responsible, we could test drug treatments on aggression,"" said Rinki Saha, PhD, a post-doctoral research in neuroscience at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who co-led the study along with Darshini Mahadevia, PhD, also a post-doctoral research scientist at CUIMC.  ""Indeed, we found that blocking D2 receptor function in the lateral septum reduced aggression.  The lateral septum region of the brain is essential for regulating aggressive behavior. While it receives strong dopamine input, if and how these dopamine pathways influence neural circuits and behavior has largely been unknown.The researchers used optogenetics which employes light to stimulate or inhibit activity in neurons to learn how a specific dopamine pathway that targets the lateral septum influences neuronal communication and behavior in the mice. They found that when more dopamine was released, neurons in the lateral septum were inhibited and aggressive behavior was increased. When the pathway was blocked, aggressive behavior was reduced, demonstrating that dopamine release in the lateral septum is not only sufficient to trigger aggression, but also necessary for normal agonistic behavior. By discovering that dopamine regulates the activity of neurons in the lateral septum, we effectively link the classic septal-hypothalamic aggression axis with the clinically pertinent dopamine model of aggression,  said Mark Ansorge, assistant professor of clinical neurobiology (in psychiatry) and senior author of the study.  The principal role of the septal-hypothalamic pathway in aggression was identified almost a century ago, work for which Walter R. Hess received the 1949 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Ansorge said that in the clinic, dopamine-related drugs are used manage aggression, but how and where in the brain they act is not known. In particular, one theory posits that they work by inducing sedation. The researchers  findings now imply that blocking D2 receptors within the lateral septum can directly reduce aggression. Through this insight we hope to improve treatment approaches for pathological and displaced aggression, in order to help affected individuals and families with related brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, substance use disorders, and dementia.

The results suggest that countering the activity of these cells could be a new therapeutic approach for such conditions.The researchers, who reported their finding Dec. 1 in Nature, were studying a set of immune cells called group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which help the immune system tolerate beneficial microbes and suppress inflammation in the intestines and other organs throughout the body. They discovered a unique subset of these ILC3s that circulate in the bloodstream and can infiltrate the brain and, to their surprise, do not quench inflammation but instead ignite it.The scientists called this subset inflammatory ILC3s, and found them in the central nervous system of mice with a condition modeling MS. Instead of constraining the immune response, this subset of ILC3s spurred another group of immune cells called T cells to attack myelinated nerve fibers, leading to MS-like disease symptoms. The researchers detected similar inflammatory ILC3s in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. This work has the potential to inform our understanding of, and potential treatments for, a broad variety of conditions involving T-cell infiltration of the brain,  said senior author Dr. Gregory Sonnenberg, associate professor of microbiology and immunology in medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and a member of the Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Weill Cornell Medicine.MS affects more than two million people worldwide. Other conditions that feature chronic brain inflammation afflict tens of millions more and include Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases. There is also evidence that neuroinflammation develops naturally with aging and is a major factor in age-related cognitive decline, and more recently inflammatory T-cell responses in the brain have been linked to neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.The researchers have shown in recent work that ILC3s residing in the gut act as sentinels and immune regulators, suppressing inflammation including inflammatory T-cell activity and warding off cancer. In the new study, they examined the roles of ILC3s in the brain, and found, contrary to their expectation, that ILC3s are not normally present in the brain under healthy conditions but can infiltrate the brain from the bloodstream during inflammation. When they do infiltrate the central nervous system, they have pro-inflammatory rather than anti-inflammatory effects.The researchers showed with a mouse model of MS that these inflammatory ILC3s in the brain function as antigen-presenting cells: They display bits of myelin protein, the main ingredient in the insulating layer around nerve fibers, to T cells prompting them to attack myelin, causing the nerve damage that gives rise to disease signs. They found the inflammatory ILC3s in close association with T cells in regions of active inflammation and nerve damage in the mouse brains. The infiltration of these inflammatory ILC3s to the brains and spinal cords of mice coincides with the onset and peak of disease,  said first author John Benji Grigg, a Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences doctoral candidate in the Sonnenberg laboratory.  Further, our experimental data in mice demonstrate these immune cells play a key role in driving the pathogenesis of neuro-inflammation. The researchers discovered that they could prevent MS-like disease in the animals by removing from the ILC3s a key molecule called MHCII, which normally is used in the antigen-presenting process the removal essentially blocks the cells  ability to activate myelin-attacking T cells. Despite our very best disease-modifying therapies for MS, patients continue to progress, and since disease onset is early in life, they face the prospect of permanent physical and cognitive disability,  said co-author Dr. Tim Vartanian, professor of neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine, chief of the division of multiple sclerosis and neuro-immunology and a professor of neurology in the Department of Neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.  Identification of inflammatory ILC3s with antigen presentation capabilities in the central nervous system of people with MS offers a new strategic target to prevent nervous system injury. Finally, the researchers discovered that ILC3s that reside in other tissues in the body can be programmed, in effect, to counter the activity of brain-infiltrating T cells, preventing the MS-like condition disease in mice.This work was completed in close collaboration with Dr. Ari Waisman, director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, where the researchers built on prior research demonstrating that there are gut-resident ILC3s that display antigens to T cells in a slightly different way to promote T-cell inactivity, or  tolerance.  The researchers demonstrated that by experimentally exposing these tolerance-inducing intestinal ILC3s to myelin, they could block neuroinflammatory T-cell activity and the development of MS-like disease in the mice.The work therefore points to the possibility that MS and potentially many other inflammatory conditions could someday be treated either by directly inhibiting the activity of inflammatory ILC3s that infiltrate the brain, or by targeting self-antigens to the intestinal ILC3s that promote tolerance in other tissues, Dr. Sonnenberg said.Reference: Grigg JB, Shanmugavadivu A, Regen T, et al.

Reliance on the meaning of individual words instead of accurate grammar analysis allows for faster information processing, but sometimes causes misinterpretations. The study has been published by the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology.Psychologists and psycholinguists have been studying the phenomenon of communication misunderstandings since the 1970s. Thomas Erickson and Mark Mattson show that when asked  How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark?  many people mistakenly answer  Two  without noticing that the question itself is incorrect: it was Noah, not Moses, who took animals on the Ark. In 2003, Fernanda Ferreira demonstrated that the stimulus sentence  The dog was bitten by the man  was misinterpreted as  The dog bit the man  in 25% of cases, which means that people can ignore grammatical relations between words and interpret sentences based on word semantics and their knowledge of typical real-life situations. This type of information processing is called  good-enough language processing .However, very little is known about the influence of age on text processing: whether reliance on good-enough language processing increases with age and, consequently, with a richer linguistic and life experience. HSE researchers conducted an experiment to see how people of different ages use good-enough language processing while reading. A total of 349 people took part in the study, including adolescents aged 13 17, young adults aged 20 40, and older adults aged 55 and over.The participants were asked to read a set of stimuli sentences with subordinate participial clauses that cause numerous errors in comprehension, for instance:1) i , i (Misha met the firefighter s dentist, who filled teeth quickly and painlessly. While not obvious from the English translation, the endings of the instrumental case in the Russian original sentence signal that the participle   (who filled) agrees with the head noun   (dentist)).2) i, i (Misha met the dentist of the firefighter who had put out a fire in the warehouse. The past participle   (who had put out) agrees with the second noun   (firefighter) as they are both used in genitive case).3) i , i (Misha met the firefighter s dentist, who had put out a fire in the warehouse. Although grammatically correct, this Russian sentence reads as if the dentist, and not the firefighter, put out the fire because the noun   (dentist) and the dependent participle   (who had put out) have endings of the instrumental case).4) i, i (Misha met the dentist of the firefighter who filled teeth quickly and painlessly. Similarly to sentence 3 above, the grammatical structure of this sentence suggests that it is the firefighter, not the dentist, who fills teeth because both the noun   (firefighter) and the present participle   (who filled) are used in the Russian genitive case).While the participles of sentences 1 and 2 agree with the nouns both grammatically (syntactically) and logically (semantically), the participles of sentences 3 and 4 depend on one of the nouns grammatically (syntactically) and on the other noun logically (semantically). The answer of  firefighter  to the question  Who put out the fire?  after sentence 3 shows that the participants ignored the case ending, i.e. the syntactical relation, and their replies are based on the meanings of the words and the participants  knowledge of the world. This demonstrates that the participants use good-enough language processing.Both adolescents and young adults appear to use good-enough language processing actively in their speech perception: they gave the incorrect reply of  firefighter  to the question  Who put out the fire in the warehouse?  asked after sentence 3 (in 63 68% of responses). However, older adults replied incorrectly even more often (79% of responses). Good-enough language processing, therefore, is formed in adolescence and intensifies in older adults.According to the authors, this outcome may be due to the fact that the accumulation of world knowledge and language exposure in older adults creates stronger expectations about the content of messages and encourages older people to rely on these expectations rather than the information they actually perceive. It may also be due to an unconscious strategy to spare older adults  limited cognitive resources for other purposes (such as verbal working memory).The researchers also show that when respondents gave incorrect replies to the question asked after sentences 3 and 4 (which were difficult to understand), they had read those sentences faster. Anastasiya Lopukhina, author of the article and Research Fellow of the Centre for Language and Brain, HSE University, said, ""It appears that good-enough language processing enables us to process information a little faster. Although it may cause misunderstandings, it seems to be economical and less time-consuming.""Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

These findings, reported in the journal Cell, could help create new targets for drug development.Chromosomes are long, string-like structures made up of DNA, RNA and proteins. A chromosome must fold into a loop in order to fit into the nucleus of a cell. These loops bring together distant genetic material.  Genes and control elements sequences that regulate genes have to communicate with one another for the cell to work properly,  says the senior author of the paper, Jeannie Lee, MD, PhD, of the Department of Molecular Biology at MGH.  Chromosome looping is kind of like bringing people together in a conference room so they can talk to one another. These interactions within a chromosome loop regulate gene expression, that is, whether a gene is turned  on  and thus producing proteins or turned  off.  Chromosome loops are in constant flux, growing and contracting as they change their composition of genes in response to environmental stimuli and the body s developmental needs. Returning to the conference room metaphor, a protein called CTCF acts as a door, explains Lee, and it was already known that a chromosome loop may have multiple sets of double doors some open, some closed.  But what wasn t known is how these doors open and close,  explains Lee.  Who are the gatekeepers? The answer proved to be a surprise. Lee and her team discovered that a form of RNA known as Jpx is a gatekeeper that regulates the behavior of CTCF in chromosome looping. Jpx RNA was no stranger to Lee and her fellow investigators. Eight years ago, they showed that this noncoding form of RNA is a key player in the phenomenon known as X chromosome inactivation, which is essential for normal development in all female mammals, including humans. Jpx RNA helps count X chromosomes in female cells very early in development; if two are detected, one X chromosome is inactivated, or silenced. However, Lee s group, which included postdoctoral fellow Hyun Jung Oh, PhD, first author of the study, found that Jpx RNA also determines what combination of double doors are open at any given time by  evicting  CTCF from the chromatin (a substance within a chromosome).  Jpx regulates whether multiple doors are open or just one, as well as which panels of double doors are open, left or right,  says Lee.  By regulating that process, Jpx determines how big the chromatin loop is and, therefore, which genes around the loop are expressed. Jpx is the first form of RNA to be identified as playing a vital role in regulating the behavior of CTCF, but there will be many others, predicts Lee. That s exciting, she says, because there are probably 10 times more varieties of RNA than there are proteins. While Jpx regulates genes involved in early in the development of an embryo, other RNAs awaiting discovery may regulate the formation of chromosome loops that influence the risk for cancer, autoimmune disorders and other diseases, says Lee. Identifying these RNA could speed the development of effective new medications.Reference: Oh HJ, Aguilar R, Kesner B, et al.

And, the animals got much better sleep taking this compound compared to another drug often prescribed for dyskinesia. The results were published in the journal Experimental Neurology.Dyskinesia is a common side effect in patients with Parkinson s disease. It is not a symptom of the disease itself, but typically emerges about five years into taking levodopa, the leading medication used to restore balance, reduce shaking and manage other motor control issues patients experience. Levodopa is amazing, it works like magic, but it has side effects. If we can eliminate these side effects, it could change the life of patients with Parkinson s,  says Marcel Daadi, PhD, an associate professor at Texas Biomed and lead paper author.Designing drugs for Parkinson s and its side effects is notoriously difficult. This is in part due to the progressive nature of the disease as neurons deteriorate, and because it involves the neurotransmitter dopamine. There are five types of dopamine receptors, all with different functions, yet very similar structures. Finding a compound that only interacts with the desired receptor is a major challenge.To try to identify a compound that only binds to dopamine receptor #3 (D3), Daadi teamed up with Southwest Research Institute. SwRI s drug discovery software RhodiumTM identified PD13R as a likely candidate and predicted how it would bind to D3. Daadi reached out to medicinal chemists at Temple University to synthesize the compound, who are currently working on this class of compounds for their antipsychotic properties.Daadi and his team at Texas Biomed explored how well the compound targeted the D3 receptor compared to the other dopamine receptors in cell culture tests. They found it had a 1,486-times higher selectivity for D3 than for D2, which is the most similar in structure.The team then administered PD13R to the marmoset animal model of Parkinson s. Like human patients, the nonhuman primates developed dyskinesia after receiving levodopa. When treated with PD13R, dyskinesia dropped dramatically. We were very excited to see the robust antidyskinetic effect of the drug,  Daadi explains.The animals wore activity monitors, and with PD13R, their activity was low at night, when they normally sleep. In contrast, when given a different drug currently on the market for dyskinesia, their nighttime activity was significantly high, suggesting that PD13R may be a good treatment option without this side effect.Daadi and his team plan to continue with safety and efficacy studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before human clinical trials can begin.  I am very hopeful we can move this into Phase 1 clinical trials within two years,  Daadi says.Reference: Oh T, Daadi ES, Kim J, et al.

Emergency rations. And, just maybe, some future COVID-19 vaccines.Freeze-drying is a method for removing water from a product. First, you freeze the item you re trying to dehydrate, causing any water in it to become ice. Then, you remove the ice through a process called sublimation, in which ice turns directly into vapor under low pressure.In a new study, scientists report that they have successfully freeze-dried a liposome-based liquid vaccine formula that could be developed for potential use in COVID-19 vaccines.A vaccine that employs the freeze-dried liposomes is still a long way off. But if developed successfully, dehydrated doses could be shipped and stored at room temperature, eliminating logistical problems associated with some of the most popular existing vaccines for the disease.The findings will be published in Science Advances on Dec. 1, with University at Buffalo biomedical engineering researchers Jonathan Lovell and Moustafa Mabrouk as the senior and first authors, respectively. At the time we started this project, the first COVID-19 vaccines were just getting rolled out, and there was a lot of news about how they needed ultra-cold storage, and how that was a huge logistical challenge. Especially in low- and middle-income countries, it may not always be feasible to have that type of refrigeration infrastructure. So we started to look at whether we could make a thermostable COVID-19 vaccine using a liposome-based vaccine platform that we worked on previously,  says Lovell, PhD, SUNY Empire Innovation Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the UB School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB.The new study focuses on a liquid injection that consists of ingredients including water; specialized liposomes carrying a synthetically produced version of the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus; and a small amount of sugar, which helps to protect the formula during the freeze-drying process.The freeze-dried product looks a bit like cotton candy, mint green in color.  Upon dehydration, the formula was stable at elevated temperatures, and we showed that it can withstand room temperatures and even higher temperatures for at least a week,  says Mabrouk, a UB biomedical engineering PhD student.  After that, we reconstituted the formula by adding water. When we tested this in mice, it induced effective antibody responses and offered protection against the COVID-19 virus.

Nissly, Victoria S. Cavener, Nina R. Boyle, Ty A. Sornberger and Suresh V.

The liposomes were originally developed in Lovell s UB lab and have been licensed by the university to POP Biotechnologies, a startup company that Lovell co-founded. (Huang is also a POP Biotechnologies employee.)A COVID-19 vaccine candidate that relies on POP Biotechnologies  liposome-based vaccine delivery system is in human trials in South Korea. That vaccine candidate, called EuCorVac-19, is under development by POP Biotechnologies and South Korean biotech company EuBiologics. EuCorVac-19 has slightly different ingredients from the vaccine formula studied in the Science Advances paper.  We have not tested freeze-drying on the EuCorVac-19 vaccine,  Lovell says.  However, I think the data in this new study suggest that, in theory, the EuCorVac-19 formula may be amenable to this type of treatment to make it very thermostable, which would benefit any global deployment.

Called differentiation therapy, it amounted to a bona fide cure for many patients. The treatment works by triggering cells  stuck  with a cancerous identity to keep developing and maturing, giving rise to different, non-disease-causing types.Unfortunately, this treatment only works for a small subset of patients who have a particular subtype of the disease, called promyeloctic AML (APL).  For a long time, it was seen as kind of a one-off,  says M. Andr s Blanco, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.Now, Blanco and colleagues have identified a new approach to triggering differentiation in AML one with potential to treat a much wider array of AML patients.Their study, published in the journal Cancer Discovery, identifies an enzyme that regulates the process by which AML cells differentiate. In both cell lines and an animal model, the researchers found that inhibiting this enzyme, particularly in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, prompted AML cells to lose aspects of their identity associated with aggressive growth. The cells also began to exit the cell cycle, on the path toward maturing into a new cell type. AML typically has a poor prognosis, with five year survival below 50%,  says Blanco, senior and a co-corresponding author on the study.  If an approach like this, in combination with other therapies, could make the cancer less aggressive, that is notable and could help a lot of patients.

They used a technique called PEGylation to make the molecule, now called PEG-rCollinein-1, more stable in the organism and resistant to the immune system, obtaining a drug candidate to modulate blood clotting.An article reporting the results of the research has recently been published in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules. The technique is designed to keep the molecule in the bloodstream for longer, increasing the time between administrations if it becomes a medication. It also reduces degradation of the molecule by components of the human organism and enhances its functional properties,  said Ernesto Lopes Pinheiro J nior, first author of the article.Currently a researcher at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, Pinheiro-J nior conducted the study as part of his PhD research at the University of S o Paulo s Ribeir o Preto School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP-USP) in Brazil with a scholarship from FAPESP.PEGylation consists of binding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the molecule of interest, reducing interaction with the immune system, and preventing formation of aggregates that inhibit the efficacy of the molecule s action.  PEGylation is fairly common in the pharmaceutical industry. Nineteen drugs manufactured with the technique have been approved to date. This is the first time it s been used in an animal toxin in its recombinant form [produced in the laboratory by a genetically modified fungus],  said Eliane Candiani Arantes, a professor at FCFRP-USP and principal investigator for the study.

But new research reveals that this barrier method isn t the only way that antibodies disable viruses. An international team of researchers led by Penn State has discovered that antibodies also distort viruses, thereby preventing them from properly attaching to and entering cells. Everybody thinks of antibodies as binding to viruses and blocking them from entering cells   essentially locking them down,  said Ganesh Anand, associate professor of chemistry at Penn State.  But our research reveals for the first time that antibodies may also physically distort viruses, so they are unable to properly attach to and infect host cells. In their study, which published in the journal Cell, Anand and his colleagues investigated the interactions between human monoclonal antibody (HMAb) C10 and two disease-causing viruses: Zika and dengue. The HMAb C10 antibodies they used had previously been isolated from patients infected with dengue virus and also had been shown to neutralize Zika virus.The researchers used a combination of techniques, including cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the viruses and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) to understand their movement. Cryo-EM involves flash-freezing a solution containing molecules of interest and then targeting them with electrons to generate numerous images of individual molecules in different orientations,  explained Anand.  These images are then integrated into one snapshot of what the molecule looks like. The technique provides much more accurate pictures of molecules than other forms of microscopy. To document the effects of antibodies on Zika and dengue viruses, the team collected cryo-EM snapshots of the viruses under conditions of increasing concentrations of antibodies.In parallel, the team applied HDXMS, a technique in which molecules of interest   in this case Zika and dengue virus, along with HMAb C10 antibodies   are submerged in heavy water. Heavy water, Anand explained, has had its hydrogen atoms replaced with deuterium, hydrogen s heavier isotopic cousin. When you submerge a virus in heavy water, the hydrogen atoms on the surface of the virus exchange with deuterium,  he said.  You can then use mass spectrometry to measure the heaviness of the virus as a function of this deuterium exchange. By doing this, we observed that dengue virus, but not Zika virus, became heavier with deuterium as more antibodies were added to the solution. This suggests that for dengue virus, the antibodies are distorting the virus and allowing more deuterium to get in. It s as if the virus is getting squished and more surface area becomes exposed where hydrogen can be exchanged for deuterium. In contrast, Zika virus did not become heavier when placed in heavy water, suggesting that its surface, while fully occupied by antibodies, is not distorted by the antibodies.Anand explained that by combining cryo-EM and HDXMS, the team was able to get a comprehensive picture of what happens when antibodies attach to Zika and dengue viruses. It s like those cartoon flipbooks, where each page has a slightly different image, and when you flip through the book, you see a short movie,  he said.  Imagine a flipbook with drawings of a racehorse. Cryo-EM shows you what the racehorse looks like and HDXMS shows you how fast the racehorse is moving. You need both techniques to be able to describe a racehorse in motion. This complementary set of tools enabled us to understand how one type of antibody differentially affects two types of viruses. He noted that the fact that the more antibodies they added, the more distorted the dengue virus particles became, suggests that stoichiometry   the relationship between the quantities of the reactants and the products before, during and after a chemical reaction   matters.   It s not enough to just have antibodies present,  he said.  How much antibody you add determines the extent of neutralization. In fact, the team found that at saturating conditions, in which antibodies were added at high enough concentrations to fill all the available binding locations on the dengue viruses, 60% of the virus  surfaces became distorted. This distortion was enough to protect the cells from infection. If you have enough antibodies, they will distort the virus particle enough so that it s preemptively destabilized before it even reaches its target cells,  Anand said.Indeed, when the scientists incubated the antibody-bound dengue viruses with BHK-21 cells, a cell line from the kidneys of baby hamsters that is often used in viral infection research, they found that 50%-70% fewer cells were infected.Anand explained that with some viruses, including Zika, antibodies work by jamming the exits so the passenger cannot get out of the car. We have found a new mechanism in dengue virus whereby antibodies basically total the car so it cannot even travel to a cell,  he said.How are the antibodies distorting the dengue virus particles?Anand explained that contrary to the now-familiar SARS-CoV-2, which has spike proteins protruding in all directions, the surfaces of both Zika and dengue are smoother with peaks and valleys.Anand noted that for dengue virus, antibodies especially prefer binding the  peaks  known as five-fold vertices. Once all the proteins on the five-fold vertices have been bound, antibodies will turn to their second-favorite peaks   the three-fold vertices. Finally, they are left with only the two-fold vertices. Antibodies do not like two-fold vertices because they are very mobile and difficult to bind to,  said Anand.  We found that once the five- and three-fold vertices have been fully bound with antibodies, if we add more antibodies to the solution, the virus starts to shudder. There s this competition taking place between antibodies trying to get in and the virus trying to shake them off. As a result, these antibodies end up burrowing into the virus rather than binding onto the two-fold vertices, and we think it s this digging into the virus particle that causes the virus to shake and distort and ultimately become nonfunctional. What is the difference between Zika and dengue?Anand explained that Zika is a much more stable, less dynamic virus than dengue, which has a lot of moving parts. Dengue and Zika look similar but each one has a different give. Dengue may have evolved as a more mobile virus as a way of avoiding being caught by antibodies. Its moving parts confuse and throw off the immune system. Unfortunately for dengue, antibodies have evolved a way around this by burrowing into the virus and distorting it. It appears, he said, that the same type of antibody can neutralize Zika and dengue in two different ways   one where it binds to the virus and deactivates it, which is the traditional way we think about antibody activity, and the other where it burrows in and distorts the virus.What about other viruses?Anand said the distortion strategy his team discovered may be used by antibodies when they are confronted with other types of viruses as well. Dengue is just a model virus that we used in our experiments, but we think this preemptive destabilization strategy may be broadly applicable to any virus,  he said.  It may be that the antibodies first attempt to neutralize viruses through the barrier method and if they are unsuccessful, they resort to the distortion method. Are there any potential applications of the findings?The findings could be useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, Anand said.  HMAb C10 antibodies are specific to dengue and Zika viruses, and happen to be capable of neutralizing Zika and dengue viruses in two different ways,  he said.  But you could potentially design therapeutics with the same capabilities for treating other diseases, such as COVID-19. By creating a therapeutic with antibodies that can both block and distort viruses, we can possibly achieve greater neutralization. He added,  You don t want to wait for a virus to reach its target tissue, so if you can introduce such a therapeutic cocktail as a nasal spray where the virus first enters the body, you can prevent it from even entering the system. By doing this, you may even be able to use less antibody since our research shows that it takes less antibody to neutralize a virus through the distortion method. You can get better bang for the buck. Overall, Anand stressed that the importance of the study is that it reveals an entirely new strategy that some antibodies use to disable some viruses. Previously, all we knew about antibodies was that they bind and neutralize viruses,  he said.  Now we know that antibodies can neutralize viruses in at least two different ways, and perhaps even more. This research opens the door to a whole new avenue of exploration.

These types of injuries break the communication links between the brain and body, reducing movement and sensation, and in the worst cases, can lead to paralysis.Now, researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan have used a new technique to create 3D scaffolds that can guide regenerating neurons in the right direction. The scaffolds, which were described in the journal, Materials Science and Engineering: C, provide a proof-of-concept that researchers hope could one day could be used to design a structure to help re-connect injured neurons within the human spinal cord. Currently, regenerating inured neurons in the spinal cord is a real challenge,  said Professor Marco Terenzio, who leads the Molecular Neuroscience Unit at OIST. He explained that while peripheral nerves, like those in your fingers and legs, can heal themselves relatively easily, most of the neurons in the central nervous system, in the brain and spinal cord, don t have this level of regenerative potential. Only a few types of neurons in the spine have a limited ability to heal,  continued Prof. Terenzio.  And on top of that, the neurons may need to grow up to several millimeters, and there may be scar tissue in the way. So, we need to provide an artificial scaffold to give the neurons a helping hand and bridge the gap. When neurons repair themselves, this process doesn t occur in isolation. Instead, the neurons rely on an extracellular matrix   a fibrous structure that provides support and chemical cues for the neurons to correctly grow. But so far, technological limitations have prevented scaffolds that can accurately mimic the texture of the extracellular matrix from being manufactured on a large enough scale for spinal cord injury.In the study, the scientists turned to a state-of-the-art manufacturing technique, called 2-photon lithography, that gave them finer control over the complete structure compared to standard printing methods. It works a bit like 3D printing, but in reverse,  explained Prof. Terenzio.  Instead of building up by depositing material where it s needed, the structure is created by removing material. The researchers used computer software to first design scaffolds with grooves and indentations that promoted directional growth of neurons. Neurons typically grow radially, spreading out from a center point, Prof. Terenzio explained, but in injuries that sever a connection, growing in a straight line to bridge the two sides is more efficient.The researchers then built different scaffolds using a polymer called IP-Dip. This material hardens in response to light from a laser, which is fired at specific positions according to the schematic. The excess, non-hardened polymer was then washed away at the end to reveal the final structure.When the researchers studied the material properties of the scaffolds, they found that the hardened polymer was thermally and mechanically stable.The researchers also tested whether the structure was biocompatible, by growing cultured mouse neurons from the dorsal root ganglia   a cluster of neurons that lies close to the spinal cord and relay sensation to the brain. The team also tested the structure with mouse motor neurons, which are found in the spinal cord and are responsible for muscle contraction and consequent movement. Both neuronal types were able to attach and grow over the scaffolds.The researchers designed one of the scaffolds to be more porous, to encourage the neurons to grow into the structure, as well as over the top. We found that the neurons were able to penetrate all the layers of the scaffold, which was very exciting to see,  said Prof. Terenzio.  The next goal is to use this design as a template for developing future scaffolds that could be used for in vivo experiment in mice. The team are also planning to experiment with different materials and scaffold designs that could work better for other types of injuries.However, the researchers acknowledged, the technology is currently prohibitively expensive to most research labs, and the machine can take days to print scaffolds of sufficient size. The technology is still very much in its infancy, but we are hopefully that it will improve in cost and efficiency over time,  added Prof. Terenzio.  We were very fortunate to be able to gain access to this machine through the nanofabrication and mechanical engineering services of the OIST Engineering Section. Prof. Terenzio gave credit to the unique structure of OIST, which eschews departments in order to promote these kinds of multi-disciplinary collaborations.  It s truly a story in the spirit of OIST.

Almost everything we know about the brain s circadian clock comes from studies on night-active rodents such as rats and mice, which complicates translating this knowledge to human circadian rhythms,  said Casey Diekman, co-corresponding author of the study and mathematical biologist at New Jersey Institute of Technology.  This work is the first to describe the intricate electrical landscape of the SCN in a diurnal mammal, and it s highlighted notable differences from nocturnal animals that may be important in adapting clock neuron function to the specific biological demands of a day-active species. We found that the overall day/night pattern of SCN neuron activity in the diurnal rodent R. pumilio is similar to the pattern previously observed in night-active species,  said Beatriz Bano-Otalora, co-first author of the paper and a biologist working with the labs of Robert Lucas and Timothy Brown at the University of Manchester.  We ve also found unique features in how R. pumilio s SCN neurons behave that have never been observed before in nocturnal species.  The team found that like nocturnal rodents, R. pumilio s SCN neurons spontaneously fired at a higher rate during daytime hours than at night. This day/night rhythm in firing rate is the main signal the SCN sends to the rest of the brain to communicate the time of day.  However, when we injected currents to inhibit these neurons, some cells exhibited a pronounced delay before resuming to fire after inhibition was released,  explained Mino Belle, co-corresponding author of the paper and a biologist at the University of Exeter.  This delay-to-fire response is not present in the SCN of nocturnal rodents and may affect how R. pumilio clock neurons respond to inputs they receive from other cells. To learn more, the team combined the voltage traces recorded from the rodent s brain with a newly developed data assimilation algorithm. They built computational models simulating the complex interaction of voltage-gated ion channels that produce action potentials. The simulations showed that increased conductivity of a particular ion channel, the transient A- potassium channel, was responsible for the delay-to-fire response. The enhanced conductance of this potassium channel that our models pointed out could be advantageous for a diurnal species,  said the paper s co-first author Matthew Moye, a postdoctoral fellow at Merck & Co. who began developing the team s data assimilation algorithms as a Ph.D. student in NJIT s Department of Mathematical Sciences.  Wakefulness results in inhibitory behavioral feedback signals to the SCN, which in nocturnal animals helps keep SCN firing rates low at night. In diurnal animals, this nighttime inhibitory feedback is not present, so enhanced A-type conductance may be needed to silence the SCN at night and preserve the overall day/night firing pattern. The team s research follows separate findings from Diekman and colleagues at Northwestern University recently published Nov. 15 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which revealed the role of the gene Tango10 as a critical link between the circadian clock and the production of daily wake-up signals at the cellular level. Diekman says the same data assimilation method developed to study R. pumilio neurons was used to construct mathematical models from voltage traces of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, ultimately showing how Tango10 gene mutations contribute to disruptions in daily rhythms.  Now that we have this powerful tool for extracting information from voltage traces, we hope to continue collaborating with electrophysiology labs and apply data assimilation to recordings not just from circadian clock neurons, but also from neurons that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s and Huntington s,  Diekman said.Reference: Bano-Otalora B, Moye MJ, Brown T, Lucas RJ, Diekman CO, Belle MD.

Caffeine also improved participants  reaction times. A lot of what happens in our environment is moving like trying to cross a busy intersection as a pedestrian or finding something on a shelf as you re walking through the aisles of a grocery store, said Dr. Kristine Dalton of Waterloo s School of Optometry & Vision Science. Testing visual acuity under dynamic conditions can provide more information about our functional performance in these scenarios than traditional static visual acuity measurements alone. Visual acuity, also known as clarity of vision or sharpness of vision, refers to a person s ability to detect and recognize small details and can be measured under static (stationary) or dynamic (moving) conditions. While both static and dynamic visual acuity provide important information about how we interact with the world around us, dynamic visual acuity skills are especially important in the many daily activities in which we, or objects around us are moving.   While we already know that caffeine increases the velocity of rapid-eye movements, we wanted to further investigate how exactly caffeine enhances visual processing and facilitates the detection of moving visual stimuli by testing dynamic visual acuity,  said co-author Beatr z Redondo of the University of Granada s Department of Optics.On two separate days, half of the study s participants ingested a caffeine capsule (4mg/kg) while the other half ingested a placebo capsule. Using a computer-based test designed and validated at the University of Waterloo, each participant s dynamic visual acuity skills were measured before and 60 minutes after caffeine ingestion. Researchers found that participants who had ingested the caffeine capsules showed significantly greater accuracy and faster speed when identifying smaller moving stimuli, inferring caffeine positively influences participants  stimulus processing and decision-making. Eye movement velocity and contrast sensitivity, which are implicated in dynamic visual acuity performance, were also sensitive to caffeine intake. Our findings show that caffeine consumption can actually be helpful for a person s visual function by enhancing alertness and feelings of wakefulness,  Dalton said. This is especially true for those critical, everyday tasks, like driving, riding a bike or playing sports, that require us to attend to detailed information in moving objects when making decisions.

Sexual selection is selection arising from competition for mating partners and/or their reproductive cells (their eggs or sperm). For almost a century, researchers have thought that sexual selection is the ultimate selective force that generates the differences we see between male and female animals in terms of reproductive fitness and life history. Yet, little is known about how sexual selection combines with other environmental pressures to impact population demography and adaptive ability.Living organisms accumulate mutations throughout life   some of which help them become fitter for survival, and some of which provide no benefit and may even cause a disadvantage (called deleterious mutations). Sexual selection is thought to promote evolutionary adaptation if it gives rise to stronger net selection   that is, the total purifying selection against deleterious mutations   in males rather than females. This is because a population s productivity relies on females  ability to reproduce, so that stronger net selection on males allows a population to get rid of the deleterious mutations quickly and adapt to their environment with a lower cost to the population, which may eventually reduce the risk of extinction. Our knowledge on whether such stronger sexual selection on males translates into stronger net selection to females is still limited,  says first author Lennart Winkler, a PhD student at TU Dresden, Germany.  Previous studies have used the phenotypic variance of fitness to measure net selection, but its relevance has been questioned. An alternative measure is the organism s genetic variance of fitness. We used both measures to show whether net selection is generally stronger on males across a broad range of species. The team ran a systematic literature search and compiled 101 paired estimates of male and female genetic variances across 26 species for two important components of an organism s fitness: reproductive success and lifespan.They then tested whether the phenotypic variances were aligned to the genetic variances, and whether genetic variances show consistent sex differences. They predicted that males would show larger genetic variance in reproductive success but not in lifespan.They found that the phenotypic variance of lifespan but not of reproductive success predicted the genetic variance in either males or females. Importantly, however, the phenotypic variance of reproductive success was larger in males than females, and this translated into a male bias in genetic variance. This sex difference could be detected in polygamous but not monogamous species. By contrast, there were no consistent sex differences in phenotypic or genetic variance for lifespan. Our results have two major implications,  says senior author Tim Janicke, a researcher at the Centre d Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive in Montpellier, France.  First, phenotypic variance of reproductive success is a poor predictor of purifying selection against deleterious mutations. Second, our findings provide support for the prediction that net selection is generally stronger on males compared to females, which may not only bolster local adaptation but can also reduce the risk of extinction when populations face challenging environmental conditions. Therefore, our results support the idea that sexual selection can play a pivotal role in evolutionary rescue. Reference: Winkler L, Moiron M, Morrow EH, Janicke T.

We found 35 performance indicators that coaches considered important and at the top of the list were psychological attributes,  Rogers says. Coaches look for players who are competitive, have a strong work ethic, are excellent communicators, good teammates and can  read  the game. Being super fit is a given. It is the other traits that make a difference to the scoreboard. Game statistics are commonly used to recruit basketball players but by watching players on the court, and how they behave outside of it, coaches can pick up a lot of non-physical factors that indicate whether a player is likely to make the grade. Of the 35 performance indicators used by basketball coaches, 14 are psychological and four of these   attitude, coachability, competitiveness and work ethic   are considered more important than anything. Basketball players who are optimistic, easily taught and trained, and determined to be more successful and to work harder than others are favoured by coaches,  Rogers says.Coaches indicated that players who put themselves ahead of their team were not good picks.Mental toughness is also critical, because the ability to focus on every play, especially when tired, reflects on the scoreboard. Resilience, motivation, and good communication on the court are crucial in separating the  best from the rest  once players reach elite level, according to the coaches we surveyed. Interestingly, the least important indicators were physical fitness and movement skills. The study, published in Sports Medicine, is the first to examine key indicators for recruitment in basketball using a large international panel of elite countries from FIBA-ranked countries.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Their work also revealed a potential therapeutic target for the currently incurable and difficult to treat condition.Titled,  Altered H3 histone acetylation impairs high-fidelity DNA repair to promote cerebellar degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7,  the study was published today in Cell Reports. Our research delves into the mechanistic basis of the cerebellar neuron degeneration and death in SCA7, a specific SCA that causes impaired coordination, like difficulty with walking, talking and eye movement,  said corresponding author Albert La Spada, Distinguished Professor of pathology, neurology and biological chemistry in the UCI School of Medicine.  Through our efforts, we confirmed the connection between altered DNA repair and DNA damage, and also the importance of the activation of PARP1 enzymes that results. Previous research has shown that increased DNA damage can lead to the activation of PARP1 enzymes.  These enzymes serve to recruit the DNA repair machinery but can also promote cerebellar neuron dysfunction and death. Fortunately, PARP inhibitors already exist and could prove to be a promising potential new treatment. Perhaps more exciting is that the DNA damage and altered DNA repair found in SCA7, is also found in other SCAs. This could mean new therapeutics to treat the devastating effects of many of the forms of spinocerebellar ataxia might be possible,  said LaSpada.   Our next steps will be to test candidate PARP inhibitor drugs in mouse models of SCA7 as well as in neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells generated from human SCA7 human patients. SCA7, belongs to a disease category which includes spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington disease (HD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and five other forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 17).Each year, 15,000 - 20,000 Americans suffer from spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), a genetic dominantly inherited neurodegenerative condition, that frequently results in atrophy of the cerebellum and the loss of fine coordination of muscle movements leading to unsteady and clumsy motion, and other symptoms. SCAs can affect anyone of any age.  Currently, there are no known effective treatments or cures.Reference: Switonski PM, Delaney JR, Bartelt LC, et al.

In 2018, the world produced 360 million metric tonnes of plastics. Because of their low cost, durability and versatility, plastics are everywhere including in the environment and only 9 percent of the plastic ever generated has been recycled. The vast majority ends up in landfills, where its slow degradation allows it to accumulate, while pervasive microplastics have been found everywhere, from inside living bodies to the bottom of the ocean. At our current rate of plastic waste generation, increasing waste management capacity will not be sufficient to reach plastic pollution goals alone,  said Vikas Khanna, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Pittsburgh Swanson School of Engineering.  There is an urgent need to take actions like limiting global virgin plastic production from fossil fuels and designing products and packaging for recyclability. New research led by Khanna gives a bird s-eye view of the scale of plastic creation globally, tracing where it s produced, where it ends up, and its environmental impact. The researchers found the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of plastic in 2018 staggering: 170 million metric tonnes of primary plastics were traded globally in 2018, with associated greenhouse gas emissions accounting for 350 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent about the same amount produced by nations like Italy and France in a year.  And if anything, our estimation is on the lower end. Converting primary plastic resins into end use products will result in additional greenhouse gases and other emissions,  warned Khanna.The work was recently published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.  We know plastics are a problem, and we know keeping materials in a circular economy instead of the take-make-waste model we re used to is a great solution,  said Khanna.  But if we don t have an understanding of the current state of the system, then it s hard to put numbers to it and understand the scale. We wanted to understand how plastics are mobilized across geographical boundaries. Since international trade plays such a critical role in making material goods available, including plastics, the researchers applied network theory to data from the UN Comtrade Database to understand the role of individual countries, trade relationships between countries, and structural characteristics that governed these interactions. The global primary plastic trade network (GPPTN) that they created designated each country as a  node  in the network and a trade relationship between two countries as an  edge,  allowing them to determine the critical actors (countries) and who is making the biggest impact.The researchers examined 11 primary thermoplastic resins that make up the majority of plastic products. They found that a majority of the most influential nodes in the model are exporting more plastics than they import: Saudi Arabia is the leading exporter, followed by the U.S., South Korea, Germany and Belgium.The top five importers of primary plastic resins are China, Germany, the U.S., Italy and India.In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions, the energy expended in the GPPTN is estimated to be the equivalent of 1.5 trillion barrels of crude oil, 230 billion cubic meters of natural gas, or 407 metric tonnes of coal. The carbon embedded in the model is estimated to be the carbon equivalent of 118 million metric tonnes of natural gas or 109 million metric tonnes of petroleum. The results are particularly important and timely, especially in light of the recent discussions during Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow and the importance of understanding where emissions are coming from in key sectors,  said co-author Melissa Bilec, Co-director of Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation and William Kepler Whiteford Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  The collaboration with Dr. Khanna and his lab allows us to learn new systems-level modeling techniques as we converge towards understanding solutions to our complex challenges.  This paper,  Quantifying Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Embodied in Global Primary Plastic Trade Network,  (DOI: 10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c05236) is supported by the NSF convergence research project on the circular economy, which is led by Bilec.Using more recycled plastics instead of creating new resins that eventually make their way to landfills would be substantially better for the environment; however, financial and behavioral barriers both need to be addressed before a true circular economy for plastics can become a reality. Even though emerging chemical recycling techniques promise to recover more material in an economically and environmentally sound way, we need to make it so that using recycled materials is as cost-effective as using virgin plastic resins,  said Khanna.  Our next step is to understand the interaction between the GPPTN and the plastic waste trade network to identify the opportunities where investment could encourage a circular plastics economy.

Imagine that same gene occurred in every major cancer, including breast, prostate, lung, liver and colon. Imagine that the gene is not essential for healthy activity, so you could attack it with few or no negative side effects.Cancer biologist Yibin Kang has spent more than 15 years investigating a little-known but deadly gene called MTDH, or metadherin, which enables cancer in two important ways   and which he can now disable, in mice and in human tissue, with a targeted experimental treatment that will be ready for human trials in a few years. His work appears in two papers in today s issue of Nature Cancer. You can t find a drug target better than this: MTDH is important for most major human cancers, not important for normal cells, and it can be eliminated with no obvious side effects,  said Kang, Princeton s Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Professor of Molecular Biology and one of the principal investigators of the Princeton Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. In the two papers we are publishing back-to-back today, we identify a compound, show it is effective against cancer, and show that it is very, very effective when combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy,  said Kang.  Even though metastatic cancers are scary, by figuring out how they work   figuring out their dependency on certain key pathways like MTDH  we can attack them and make them susceptible to treatment. For years, Kang has focused on metastasis   the term for cancer s ability to spread from one place to another in the body   because he knows that metastasis makes cancer deadly. While 99% of breast cancer patients survive five years after diagnosis, only 29% do if the cancer has metastasized, according to current numbers from the National Cancer Institute. Metastatic breast cancer causes more than 40,000 deaths every year in the U.S., and the patients do not respond well to standard treatments, such as chemotherapies, targeted therapies and immunotherapies,  said Minhong Shen, an associate research scholar in Kang s lab and the first author on both papers. Our work identified a series of chemical compounds that could significantly enhance the chemotherapy and immunotherapy response rates in metastatic breast cancer mouse models. These compounds have great therapeutic potential. Yibin Kang and his team found a key to unlock a possible solution to the challenge of cancer metastasis, the primary cause of death due to cancer, said Chi Van Dang, the scientific director of Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. His team was also able to devise a small, drug-like molecule to neutralize this deadly property of cancer. Though this was achieved in preclinical studies, I personally hope that their strategy will one day alter the lives of cancer patients. Kang holds the same hope.  While a lot of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer will be essentially cured with surgery and treatment, for some, maybe five, 10, 15, 20 years later, they ll have a recurrence, often as metastatic relapse,  Kang said.  It s a time bomb. And for scientists, it s a puzzle. Why do you have two patients who present with the same early-stage cancer but whose outcomes are very different?""","Published: December 1, 2021"

People recovering from heart damage often face a long and tricky journey. Healing is challenging because of the constant movement tissues must withstand as the heart beats. The same is true for vocal cords. Until now there was no injectable material strong enough for the job,  says Guangyu Bao, a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McGill University.The team, led by Professor Luc Mongeau and Assistant Professor Jianyu Li, developed a new injectable hydrogel for wound repair. The hydrogel is a type of biomaterial that provides room for cells to live and grow. Once injected into the body, the biomaterial forms a stable, porous structure allowing live cells to grow or pass through to repair the injured organs. The results are promising, and we hope that one day the new hydrogel will be used as an implant to restore the voice of people with damaged vocal cords, for example laryngeal cancer survivors,  says Guangyu Bao.

Studies in mice showed that eliminating this protein entirely or using drugs to block its function reduced physical changes in the brain associated with the disease and improved memory. Drug therapy that aims to block ENSA activity could be a more effective treatment than what is currently available, as well as being cheaper. This study was published in the scientific journal Molecular Psychiatry.The hallmark of Alzheimer s disease in the brain is the accumulation of amyloid   peptide (A ). For years, researchers have been trying to determine how and why this happens. Takaomi Saido and his team at RIKEN CBS have developed a mouse model of the disease that shows both A  accumulation and memory deficits similar to what is seen in humans. Using this model mouse, they have already discovered a series of events in the brain that lead to the formation of A  plaques. Key among them is reduced levels of the enzyme neprilysin, which itself is caused by reduced levels of the hormone somatostatin. Levels of both neprilysin and somatostatin go down as we age, which can explain why Alzheimer s disease usually strikes older people.The new study focused on treating Alzheimer s disease in mice by figuring out how somatostatin controls neprilysin levels in the brain. According to first author Naoto Watamura,  the first step in this process was actually the most difficult because we had to develop an in vitro system that could screen for neprilsyin regulators in conditioned medium generated by hippocampal neurons.  Once they accomplished this, they were able to identify ENSA as the regulator. Testing showed that ENSA reduced neprilysin activity and that it rose to abnormally high levels in the brains of mice that lacked somatostatin. This means that somatostatin normally keeps ENSA in check, which in turn keeps neprilsyin levels high, allowing A  to be destroyed before it accumulates.Next the team focused on ENSA in living animals. Using CRISPR technology, they created ENSA knockout mice and then bred them with the Alzheimer s disease model mice. A  accumulation in these new mice was much lower than in the original model mice, indicating that abnormally high levels of ENSA could be an as yet unidentified symptom or biomarker of Alzheimer s disease. This was confirmed when the researchers detected high level of ENSA in the model mice and in the brains of people with Alzheimer s disease.What exactly is ENSA doing in the brain? Tests showed that ENSA blocks a potassium channel in the hippocampus, a part of the brain needed for making and recalling memories.  Because we got the same results from blocking the KATP channel as we did from the ENSA knockout mice,  says Watamura,  we reasoned that helping the channel stay open would combat the excess ENSA that we observed in Alzheimer s disease.  To test this theory, the researchers fed the model mice with diazoxide   a drug that activates the KATP channel   and tested their memory. They found that while the untreated Alzheimer s disease model mice exhibited their characteristically poor memory, the treated model mice performed just as well as normal mice. A look at the brains of the treated mice showed that they lacked the hallmark A  plaques. Our findings point directly to a potential way of preventing and treating Alzheimer s disease,  says Watamura.  On top of that, compared with A -targeting immunotherapy, such as the drug aducanumab, which was recently approved by the FDA, synthetic agonists for the KATP channel are less expensive and would be more acceptable to aging societies around the world.

Physicians at the Center for Precision Surgery in the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania led one of the largest clinical trial site in the country for the drug, in a partnership with the Indiana-based On Target Laboratories. The approach brings fresh hope to patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer, about half of whom experience a recurrence of their disease after initial treatment. Penn investigators have pioneered targeted technologies for lung, brain, and urinary tract cancers.Only 20 percent of ovarian cancers are found early, as there are often no symptoms   or they may mimic other common bladder, bowel, or gastrointestinal issues   and there is no screening test like those for breast and cervical cancer. By the time most women receive their diagnosis, the disease has advanced, which can include spread to intra-abdominal organs. Most patients then require surgery   also called cytoreduction, or debulking surgery   in an effort to remove tumors, as well as receiving chemotherapy. Lighting up cancer, which helps to identify lesions that may be difficult to find especially in the presence of scar tissue or other organ damage enables more complete identification and surgical removal of cancer that could have otherwise been missed,  said Janos L. Tanyi, MD, PhD, an Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Perelman School of Medicine at Penn and Principal Investigator at Penn s clinical trial site for Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.  This FDA approval offers promise in improving outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer who face a high risk of recurrence after their initial treatment. In the randomized, multi-center Phase 3 study, nearly 27 percent of the 134 adult women who received the diagnostic agent Cytalux   which is administered intravenously prior to surgery   and were evaluated under both normal and fluorescent light had at least one cancerous lesion detected that was not discovered by standard inspections through sight or touch during surgery.By using the new technology to illuminate tumors, surgeons have a guide that allows them to go beyond what they can otherwise see with the naked eye or feel, particularly when lesions are small. This provides not only greater precision in the removal of cancer lesions but also spares healthy tissue. The newly approved dye also helps surgeons to find cancerous lymph nodes.Sunil Singhal, MD, Director of the Center for Precision Surgery at the Abramson Cancer Center and William Maul Measey Professor in Surgical Research, began searching more than a decade ago for a targeted method to  visualize rogue cancer cells, beyond what surgeons could see with the naked eye or feel with the fingers. The answer would arrive from his studies into tumor permeability and small molecule retention. What separates this agent from the prior art was the ability to selectively target cancer cells with a fluorescent contrast agent.  Dr. Singhal went on to explore this hypothesis in clinical studies involving more than 1,000 patients at Penn since 2012. His studies with Cytalux were initiated with preclinical studies before proceeding to humans.  Ultimately, Penn and the Center for Precision Surgery was the leader for the Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.  This investigational series may now constitute the largest clinical experience with intraoperative molecular imaging with targeted fluorochromes in the world. By using a fluorescent dye that binds to cancer cells, making them glow during surgery, surgeons can identify and resect as much of a patient s tumors as possible and improve prognosis,  Singhal said.  At every step in their treatment, we want to help offer patients the very best possible outcomes, and this approach is an important step toward greater precision during surgery for an array of different cancers.

Such oncolytic viruses as they are known, have a remarkable ability to target and destroy cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells untouched.  The field of oncolytic virotherapy today is advancing rapidly as clinical trial data accumulates and regulatory approvals continue to accrue,  McFadden says.Rahman is a researcher in the Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy at Arizona State University. McFadden, a pioneer in the field of oncolytic viruses, directs the Center.Viral universe By a wide margin, viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth, easily outnumbering all other life forms combined, though they inhabit a shadowy world somewhere between living and inanimate matter.Viruses infect every form of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi. While they are notorious for causing serious illness, they also play vital roles in evolving ecosystems  phenomena scientists are only beginning to appreciate.Viruses can roughly be broken down into  specialists , which are selective in the particular organisms they infect, and  generalists,  which are more promiscuous about the species they target and invade. Oncolytic viruses lean toward the specialist category. While showing little to no danger for normal mammalian cells, they can be fierce assassins of the malignant cells associated with cancer.Cancer remains a leading killer globally and is anticipated to cause 1.9 million cases and 608,570 fatalities in 2021 in the US alone, according to the American Cancer Society. The discovery of cancer-killing or oncolytic viruses has opened a new door to cancer therapies that may fulfil the elusive goal of eradicating cancer while leaving healthy cells and tissues unharmed.

A specific subset of these tumours is very aggressive and difficult to treat. Researchers worldwide are therefore trying to find an Achilles' heel of the disease.Around 50 percent of high-risk neuroblastomas attribute their malignancy to a protein called MYCN. The substance stimulates the activity of certain genes in the cancer cell that accelerate tumour growth. However, it is this very fact that makes MYCN partly responsible for a dilemma which could turn out to be a significant inherent weakness, since neuroblastoma cells are also characterised by increased division rates. Before each division, the affected cell must produce a complete copy of its entire genetic information. One of the two daughter cells then receives this copy, the other the original.At the same time, however, parts of this information, namely the tumour-specific genes activated by MYCN, must be transcribed.

Their approach involves packing mRNA inside nanoparticles that mimic the flu virus a naturally efficient vehicle for delivering genetic material such as RNA inside cells.The new mRNA delivery nanoparticles are described in a paper published recently in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.The work addresses a major challenge in the field of drug delivery: getting large biological drug molecules safely into cells and protecting them from organelles called endosomes. These tiny acid-filled bubbles inside the cell serve as barriers that trap and digest large molecules that try to enter. In order for biological therapeutics to do their job once they are inside the cell, they need a way to escape the endosomes. Current mRNA delivery methods do not have very effective endosomal escape mechanisms, so the amount of mRNA that actually gets released into cells and shows effect is very low. The majority of them are wasted when they get administered,  said senior author Liangfang Zhang, a professor of nanoengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.Achieving efficient endosomal escape would be a game changer for mRNA vaccines and therapies, explained Zhang.  If you can get more mRNA into cells, this means you can take a much lower dose of an mRNA vaccine, and this could reduce side effects while achieving the same efficacy.  It could also improve delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells, which is used in some forms of gene therapy.In nature, viruses do a very good job of escaping the endosome. The influenza A virus, for example, has a special protein on its surface called hemagglutinin that, when activated by acid inside the endosome, triggers the virus to fuse its membrane with the endosomal membrane. This opens up the endosome, enabling the virus to release its genetic material into the host cell without getting destroyed.Zhang and his team developed mRNA delivery nanoparticles that mimic the flu virus s ability to do this. To make the nanoparticles, the researchers genetically engineered cells in the lab to express the hemagglutinin protein on their cell membranes. They then separated the membranes from the cells, broke them into tiny pieces, and coated them onto nanoparticles made from a biodegradable polymer that has been pre-packed with mRNA molecules inside.The finished product is a flu virus-like nanoparticle that can get into a cell, break out of the endosome, and free its mRNA payload to do its job: instruct the cell to produce proteins.The researchers tested the nanoparticles in mice. The nanoparticles were packed with mRNA encoding for a bioluminescent protein called Cypridina luciferase. They were administered both through the nose the mice inhaled droplets of a nanoparticle-containing solution applied at the nostrils and via intravenous injection. The researchers imaged the noses and assayed the blood of the mice and found a significant amount of bioluminescence signal. This was evidence that the flu virus-like nanoparticles effectively delivered their mRNA payloads into cells in vivo.The researchers are now testing their system for delivery of therapeutic mRNA and siRNA payloads.Reference: Park JH, Mohapatra A, Zhou J, et al.

In a paper first posted online Nov. 26, 2021, in the journal Cell, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine and The Johns Hopkins University demonstrate how they can do the same thing at the molecular level, studying the ways cancer cells  talk  with one another using a different kind of barcode system   one made up of combinations of patterns and colors, with each set tied to a specific biochemical activity in the communication network. When cancer cells communicate, numerous proteins constantly change how they interact with one another,  says senior study author Chuan-Hsiang (Bear) Huang, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Studying this signaling in depth and in real time has traditionally been difficult, so we needed a method that could simultaneously image, track and analyze everything happening in the network, and therefore, reveal the true relationships among these activities. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors were previously used to study cellular protein functions, including signaling activities in cancer cells, says Huang. The biosensors are protein fragments tagged with fluorophores   fluorescent molecules that glow by absorbing light energy of a specific wavelength and then emitting light at a longer wavelength   and each color is linked to a specific activity in the cell. Using a fluorescent microscope to image the type, location and intensity of the colors exhibited by these sensors, researchers can accurately and precisely document proteins in action in different cell regions. For example, changes in the intensity of specific colors, their locations within cells and the ratio of one color to another shed light on the activity levels of the proteins being studied and how they interact with one another in real time,  says Huang.However, Huang says the usefulness of fluorescent biosensors was limited when researchers needed to track a complex system like a cancer cell communications network. This, he explains, was because different biosensors often had very similar colors and could not be distinguished from one another when imaged together. In the past, if you wanted to look at dozens of biosensors that tracked the activities of different proteins in a signaling network, each biosensor had to be imaged in separate experiments that lasted hours,  says study lead author Jr-Ming Yang, Ph.D., a research associate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Moreover, to understand the communication network s properties, those experiments had to be repeated. Besides the time investment, separate imaging runs increased the likelihood of variations popping up, making it difficult to ascertain that the changes in activity were from real effects. Huang and his colleagues overcame these problems by combining fluorescent proteins of different colors and localization patterns to create  biosensor barcodes,  tools that can concurrently identify and track a larger number of biosensors for various proteins, including those driving cancer formation. To track multiple signaling protein activities in parallel, we pair our different biosensors with specific barcodes in individual cells, and then mix and image them using time-lapse microscopy,  says Huang.  Since each cell has a different barcode, we also can use this method to identify different populations of cells in the mix and investigate how they communicate with one another. Huang says the images are analyzed with an artificial intelligence [AI] machine learning system created by study co-author Wei-Yu Chi, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory. The AI analysis enables us to read the barcodes in seconds rather than hours, a crucial step toward seeing how the activity of different proteins are synchronized over time,  says Chi. Using biosensor barcodes, we hope to get more insights and more comprehensive views than ever before of how oncogenes [genes that initiate the development of cancer cells] affect communication among cancer cells, and with other networks such as those used by the immune system,  says Huang.  These findings could help direct new interventions and treatments.

The research reveals four new cell types in the iris, maps the genetic changes that occur when the iris dilates, and provides information about how the iris forms during early development.The report, say the researchers, may help scientists connect genetic similarities between the mouse and human eye, and offer clues to develop new diagnostic tests and treatments for diseases that affect the iris   such as anterior uveitis, an inflammatory condition   and congenital diseases in which all or part of the iris is missing.  Eyes are a defining characteristic of the human face, and we tend to focus on the eyes when speaking to one another, ,  says Jeremy Nathans, M.D., Ph.D., professor of molecular biology and genetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  The iris has a prominent place, making it an easy access point to diagnose or treat medical conditions, but we need to understand it better. A summary of the research was published Nov. 16 in eLife.A genetic sequencing technology, called single cell RNA sequencing, allowed the researchers to begin deciphering the iris at a cellular level by analyzing which genes were turned on in a cell at a given time. This enabled the researchers to chart out closely related cell types, determined by the activity of their genes.The technique revealed new distinctions, including two types of iris structural cells called stroma and two types of smooth muscle cells that allow the iris to constrict in response to light.When the iris constricts or dilates, it s an extreme physical change, the researchers say. The tissue ends up in an accordion pattern, so we wondered whether a change in gene expression came along with the drastic physical changes,  says Nathans.Using single cell RNA sequencing again to compare relaxed, dilated and constricted mouse iris tissues, the researchers found that while there was not much change in gene expression between a relaxed mouse eye and a constricted one, there were dramatic differences in the genes expressed in the dilated mouse eye   the stage where the iris tissue is most compressed.Specifically, the researchers found the most gene expression change in dilator muscle cells, including a gene called EGR1, which is responsible for responding to changes in the environment across the body. This could be a signal that the physical changes are stressful to the cells and they are trying to adapt,  says Amir Rattner, Ph.D., research associate in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Finally, the research team tracked the developmental origins of iris cells.Using mouse embryos genetically engineered with glowing cells in the developing nervous system, called the neural crest, the researchers were able to follow where iris cells originated.  The majority of the iris cells came from the neural crest, which gives us a fundamental understanding of how the iris develops,  says Jie Wang, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.The information could someday lead to regenerative medicine or gene therapy treatments for disorders in the eye.Reference: Wang J, Rattner A, Nathans J.

Just step outside and look for some grass. Look to the top of the shiny, green blade   usually ankle high. A tick might be there, waiting.If something breathing brushes up against grass, the tick takes something similar to a needle   called its hypostome, which has dozens of fishing hook barbs - and inserts it into the skin. If unnoticed, Lyme disease could be transferred to its host after about 24 hours of feeding. Virginia Tech researchers discovered that the bacterium that causes Lyme disease has a highly unusual modification in its protective molecular bag   its peptidoglycan, which is common to all bacteria.The change in this bacterium is unprecedented   it s an unusual sugar modification that is not known to occur in any organism. One way the bacterium gets this sugar modification is from ticks by absorbing a carbohydrate unique to ticks. The alteration is specific to ticks and allows the bacterium to better move and be more likely to cause disease. We believe this change is critical to how the bacterium causes disease and is something that we can exploit for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes,  said Brandon Jutras, an assistant professor of Biochemistry in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and an affiliated faculty of the Fralin Life Sciences Institute and the Center for Emerging, Zoonotic, and Arthropod-Borne Pathogens.The findings were recently published in Nature Microbiology, which is produced by Nature Portfolio, and the research is the result of four years of work on ticks and Lyme disease, for which Jutras has been widely lauded. Partaking in this research was the most engaging and rewarding experience of my academic career at Virginia Tech,  said lead author Tanner DeHart  20 and  21, who earned his undergraduate and master s in biochemistry at Virginia Tech and is now a Ph.D. student at Harvard University.  This opportunity allowed me to hone my scientific skill-set, develop as a more independent researcher, and obtain first-hand experience with many experimental techniques and designs. Over the past two decades, the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in both the number of reported cases and the geographic distribution of Lyme disease. In the state of Virginia, the disease is transmitted by the bite of blacklegged ticks, which are infected with the Lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi.In 2019, Jutras discovered that B. burgdorferi sheds peptidoglycan once it invades the human body. Although all bacteria have peptidoglycan, many do not shed the substance.The bacterium that causes Lyme disease is different. It has oddities in how it makes its peptidoglycan and its components.Years ago, the researchers weren t able to figure out these oddities. They had huge chunks of missing information. After four years of research, they found a few of the missing puzzle pieces. While they don t know how the bacterium makes this modification, they do know how the bacterium acquires it.The sugar that B. burgdorferi puts into its peptidoglycan is a breakdown product of chitin, a structural carbohydrate with bonded sugar molecules made from modified glucose. Chitin is a critical component of ticks. The remarkable thing here is that the bacteria that causes Lyme disease is sucking up a breakdown product of its tick vector and uses it to help make this unusual molecule,  said Jutras, also an affiliate of the Translational Biology, Medicine, and Health Graduate Program at Virginia Tech.  What's more fascinating is that it appears that the bacterium has evolved this fine-tuned adaptation to make it move effectively, which is a feature required for disease. This adaptation makes the bacteria one of the fastest organisms on the planet in terms of how it can move.From a technical standpoint, identifying the sugar, chitobiose   the breakdown product of chitin   was the crux of the research and discovery.To determine chitobiose was the actual sugar, the researchers conducted LCMS, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy in The Mass Spectrometry Research Incubator (VT-MSI), directed by Rich Helm, from the Fralin Life Sciences Institute s Core Services. They also conducted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and metabolic labeling studies with C13 labeled sugars to confirm the identity of unusual modification.In doing so, they figured out why the bacterium has this modification.The way B. burgdorferi moves is by spiraling   or torquing   their own body using flagellum. The flagellum is essentially a propeller, but on the outside of the bag. The propeller cranks against this big molecular bag, and, as a result, propels itself forward. This type of strategy allows them to move through muscle tissue, even cartilage, fairly easily.Why is the sugar modification so important? It allows the bag to be more flexible and withstand the torque.The team used atomic force microscopy to probe the elasticity of the peptidoglycan. The material is much more flexible and elastic in the sense that allows them to propel themselves,  Jutras said.  If they don't have that modification, the material comes much stiffer, and the ability to move is impaired. Previously, it had been theorized that this bacterium needs to be flexible, but it was never known how or why. We need to understand this mechanism because it would be a perfect target for therapy,  Jutras said.  We know one way   when it's in the tick. But how does it make this modification when it s in a human? There s minimal to no chitin in a human. When we impair the bacterium s ability to suck up chitobiose, they still have this modification. There s just much less of it. That means the bacterium has another way to make this modification in its peptidoglycan. Understanding how the bacterium makes this modification inside a human is the next step of the research   and Jutras and his team are already studying this avenue.A long and winding roadJutras  previous research has shown that peptidoglycan in B. burgdorferi lingers in the bodies of Lyme arthritis patients after the bacteria has entered the body. Weeks to months after the initial infection, the peptidoglycan remains, inciting inflammation and pain.The lab discovered a protein associated with the peptidoglycan of Borrelia burgdorferi that plays an amplifying role in causing inflammation in Lyme arthritis patients by acting as a molecular beacon that antagonizes the patients  immune system.The new discovery by Jutras and his team may explain why the peptidoglycan can hang out and cause arthritis in Lyme patients. Human bodies cannot process the peptidoglycan of B. burgdorferi like it can the trillions of bacteria in and on human bodies. From the perspective of a bacteriologist, this is a paradigm shift in how we understand peptidoglycan, an essential molecule produced by virtually all bacteria and the most common antibiotic target,  Jutras said.Since nearly no other bacteria have peptidoglycan quite like B. burgdorferi, it is an attractive biomarker for diagnostics. Biomarkers are unique molecular signatures, like hashtags, that act as an indicator that something has gone awry in a system and are often used to diagnose different forms of cancer.This previous research and discovery directly led to the discovery of the self-altering properties of B. burgdorferi and its potential diagnostic methods. The new avenues of research are focused on this very unusual molecule and the bacteria that sheds these molecules. As diagnostics goes, that's an exciting new area of research for the lab as it relates to this discovery because this is a very unusual molecule,  Jutras said.  The bacterium sheds these molecules and this discovery could lead to developing a diagnostic tool focused on detecting this unusual molecule, much like a biomarker for Lyme disease. An approach that could make Lyme disease diagnosis as simple as a COVID-19 rapid test. Unraveling the mystery of the most reported vector disease in the country is progressing.In the meantime, don t stop doing those tick checks.Reference: DeHart TG, Kushelman MR, Hildreth SB, Helm RF, Jutras BL.

This study explores ways of enhancing the wound healing process by extracting PRP from the blood of a patient with a complex skin wound and manipulating it through 3D printing to form an implant for tissue repair which can be used to treat difficult-to-heal skin wounds in a single surgical procedure.Results showed that application of the 3D-printed PRP implant helped to speed up the healing of the wound by enabling efficient vascularisation (meaning development of new blood vessels) and inhibiting fibrosis (scarring/thickening of tissue), both of which are essential for effective wound healing.Speaking about the novel aspects of this discovery, Professor Fergal O Brien, Professor of Bioengineering and Regenerative Medicine at RCSI, said:  Existing literature suggests that while the PRP already present in our blood helps to heal wounds, scarring can still occur. By 3D-printing PRP into a biomaterial scaffold, we can increase the formation of blood vessels while also avoiding the formation of scars, leading to more successful wound healing. As well as promising results for skin wound healing, this technology can potentially be used to regenerate different tissues, therefore dramatically influencing the ever-growing regenerative medicine, 3D printing and personalised medicine markets.

The results point toward a promising screening or diagnostic technology that is simpler and cheaper to use than current standard practices, making it a potential target for use in remote, low-resource settings.The research appears online on November 30 in the journal Frontiers in Physics. The cells are flying through the scanner so fast that if the computer didn t slow them down on the screen, you wouldn t even be able to see them,  said Adam Wax, professor of biomedical engineering at Duke.  We were very excited to be able to image this many cells at once because it points toward this technology s potential for point-of-care diagnostics. In a traditional cellular diagnostic process, cells obtained from tissue scraping or fine needle biopsies are put on a slide and stained for a trained physician to carefully magnify and inspect. But in some cases, the staining process can damage the cells, and getting the slides to the eyes of trained experts can take days if not weeks.In the new holographic imaging approach, sample cells could be rinsed off of the collection instrument into a biocompatible solution and inserted into a microfluidic chip. The small device diverts the sample into a series of parallel channels that pass beneath a line camera, kind of like a conveyor belt passing newly manufactured items beneath an autonomous scanner for inspection. When slowed down, the march of cell images is reminiscent of green characters cascading down a computer screen in The Matrix.As the cells fly by, the device automatically picks out whole cells and shines a light through them. Based on the difference in time it takes for the light to return from its journey and an unimpeded reference beam, the camera can determine the topography of each cell and calculate features such as its shape and height. While these may sound like simple measurements, when they are combined with tens of thousands of data points and advanced deep learning techniques, they can become beacons for spotting disease. It takes about 30 seconds to process a 1 milliliter sample that could contain more than a half-million cells,  said Cindy Chen, a doctoral student working in Wax s lab and first author of the paper.  And once it s finished, a pathologist could pull up individual data for any of the cells that were imaged for closer inspection. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, Wax and Chen used it to image a combined 8500 cells from three different cell lines healthy breast cells, cancerous breast cells and pre-cancerous breast cells that had been exposed to cadmium, a known potent carcinogen. While the technology captures 25 separate physical characteristics of the cells, the researchers discovered that in this case, only four were necessary for differentiating the three types.Using a machine learning algorithm, the device was able to successfully categorize each cell with 98% to 99% accuracy using just the 2D area it occupies, the 3D space it takes up, its shape and its average height. This is a simple, label-free imaging technique that is getting data similar to that of flow cytometry, which looks at cells one at a time and typically requires fluorescent markers to be introduced,  said Chen.  The idea is that, by having this wealth of quantitative data, you can separate the cells better than if you were using one single metric. We re now trying to figure out how to put this technology at the point-of-care to figure out if people have been exposed to these carcinogens in the developing world, like maybe arsenic in the ground water,  added Wax.  For example, you might brush some cells off of the top of someone s mouth to see if they re being exposed to carcinogens in their drinking water. Reference: Chen CX, Park HS, Price H, Wax A.

Despite the fact that the group has been named  Denisovans  after the site, identifying further Denisovan remains from the cave has been challenging, as any human remains are extremely fragmentary and difficult to spot amongst the hundreds of thousands of animal bones that are also present. Without definitive Denisovan remains, when they arrived at the site, how they lived, and how they interacted with other humans they shared the space with has remained a mystery.Over the course of four years, a team led by Assistant Professor Katerina Douka at the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology of the University of Vienna   with colleagues in Germany and Russia, have worked to extract and analyse ancient proteins and DNA from nearly 4000 bone fragments from Denisova Cave. Their new findings are reported today in Nature Ecology and Evolution (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01581-2) and provide robust insights into the first occupants of Denisova Cave and their archaeological signature.Using a biomolecular method known as peptide fingerprinting or  ZooMS  (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectroscopy), the team focused on the site s oldest layers, which date to as early as 200,000 years ago and lacked human fossils until now. Such methods are the only means by which scientists could find human remains among the thousands of bones from the site, as more than 95% were too fragmented for standard identification methods. Samantha Brown, doctoral student at Douka s ERC FINDER Project and now junior group leader at the University of T bingen, analysed 3800 bone fragments no larger than 4 cm in length that were previously deemed taxonomically unidentifiable. Ultimately, Brown identified five bones whose collagen matched the peptide profile of humans. Finding one new human bone would have been cool, but five? This exceeded my wildest dreams,  says Brown. We were stunned to discover new human bone fragments preserving intact biomolecules from such ancient layers,  says Douka.Of the five newly identified human bones, four contained enough authentic DNA fragments to allow researchers to reconstruct their mitochondrial genome. Three of these aligned with the Denisovan mtDNA type and one with the Neanderthal type. Dating to 200,000 years ago, the new Denisovan bones are some of the oldest human fossils to have ever been genetically sequenced. Denisova is an amazing place for aDNA preservation and we have now reconstructed genomes from some of the oldest and best-preserved human fossils,  says Dr Diyendo Massilani, postdoctoral researcher from the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig who led the genetic analyses of the new fossils.The new findings help bridge a gap regarding the archaeological adaptations of the earliest Denisovans. Denisovans appear at the site during an interglacial (a warm period during which the environment and temperatures were similar to today) and take advantage of the strategic location of the cave. They appear with a fully-fledged lithic tradition, utilizing raw material found in the alluvium of the nearby Anui River and hunting herbivores, such as bison, roe and red deer, gazelle and saiga antelope, and even woolly rhinoceros. They continue to follow similar subsistence patterns for several thousand years. Around 130-150,000 years ago, Neanderthals also appear at the site, represented by one of the fossils also discovered in the current study.Team member Professor Tom Higham, also of the University of Vienna, says  the application of biomolecular fingerprinting like the one we have applied at Denisova has allowed us to find more human fossils than through formal archaeological excavation. It is a tremendous technical breakthrough for Palaeolithic archaeology. Research at Denisova Cave continues through systematic fieldwork and targeted analyses of bones and sediments with a team of Russian archaeologists camped there for nearly 6 months each year. It remains the only site so far discovered which contains evidence for the periodic presence of all three major hominin groups, Denisovans, Neanderthals and modern humans, in the last 200,000 years.Reference: Brown S, Massilani D, Kozlikin MB, et al.

When writing a song a composer tries to express a particular feeling, causing concert-goers to perhaps laugh, cry or even shiver. We use music on a day-to-day basis to regulate our emotions or revive a memory. Hence, knowing how to recognize the emotions that music produces has been and will continue to be very important. Major music platforms such as Spotify or Deezer use classifications, generated by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, based on the emotions that music arouses in its listeners. However, not all people agree on the type of emotions, neither those that music arouses in us nor those that we perceive in the music itself when listening to it. A song like  Happy Birthday  can express  happiness  because it is in a major scale and has a fast pace, but it can generate  sadness  if we remember a person who is no longer with us. Each of us perceives music in a very personal way and this can be influenced by such general aspects as musical preferences, cultural background, the language of the song, etc. It is important to define this aspect as an AI algorithm needs to know what is called  ground truth  or  labels . It is the basis on which the algorithm  learns . For example, for a photo of a golden labrador on Instagram, it is highly likely that we all agree that the label should be  dog . But with a symphony by Beethoven, the labels can range from  happy  to  nostalgic , depending on the listener and the context.In a recent publication in the journal IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, researchers with the Music Technologies Research Group (MTG) at Pompeu Fabra University, together with scientists from the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, the University of Hong Kong, and Durham University in the United Kingdom, among others, propose a new conceptualization framework that helps to characterize music in terms of emotions and thus build models that are better adapted to people s characteristics. Recognition of emotions in music is one of the most complex tasks of musical description and computational modelling , explains the doctoral student Juan Sebasti n G mez Ca n, first author of the study.  People s opinions vary greatly and it is difficult to find the reasons why the section of a song can arouse a certain emotion. It is a very subjective task and using artificial intelligence algorithms still requires a great deal of research .The main goal of the research was to create a guide on the operation of current music emotion recognition (MER) systems. Hence they propose an approach in which the human being is at the centre of the design of the system in order to combat the problem of subjectivity.The research has allowed the authors to propose areas where the research field needs to go into greater depth, such as the accessibility of open source data, the reproducibility of the experiments, the relevance of people s cultural context, and the need to study the ethical implications of the possible applications of MER. G mez adds that  most of the research on music and emotions has been carried out by and for people from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) countries. It is crucial to go further in order to evaluate non-Western traditional music, collect data from diverse listeners and democratize this research to different musical cultures in the world .They also included proposals for handling the ethical implications for these types of applications, such as privacy, the bias of the systems to the Western listener and the impact they can have on our well-being.  When an algorithm can accurately predict the emotion that a type of music can arouse, the most important question will be how we can ensure that these algorithms will be used for our well-being , G mez finishes explaining.

New UC Riverside research instead points to cells  slowing ability to clean themselves as the likely cause of unhealthy brain buildup. Along with signs of dementia, doctors make a definitive Alzheimer s diagnosis if they find a combination of two things in the brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The plaques are a buildup of amyloid peptides, and the tangles are mostly made of a protein called tau.  Roughly 20% of people have the plaques, but no signs of dementia,  said UCR Chemistry Professor Ryan Julian.  This makes it seem as though the plaques themselves are not the cause.  For this reason, Julian and his colleagues investigated understudied aspects of tau protein. They wanted to understand whether a close examination of tau could reveal more about the mechanism behind the plaques and tangles. A key but difficult-to-detect difference in the form of tau allowed the scientists to distinguish between people who expressed no outward signs of dementia from those who did. These results have now been published in the Journal of Proteome Research. Julian s lab focuses on the different forms that a single molecule can take, called isomers.  An isomer is the same molecule with a different three-dimensional orientation than the original,  Julian said.  A common example would be hands. Hands are isomers of each other, mirror images but not exact copies. Isomers can actually have a handedness. The amino acids that make up proteins can either be right-handed or left-handed isomers. Normally, Julian said, proteins in living things are made from all left-handed amino acids.For this project, the researchers scanned all the proteins in donated brain samples. Those with brain buildup but no dementia had normal tau while a different-handed form of tau was found in those who developed plaques or tangles as well as dementia.Most proteins in the body have a half-life of less than 48 hours. However, if the protein hangs out too long, certain amino acids can convert into the other-handed isomer.  If you try to put a right-handed glove on your left hand, it doesn t work too well. It s a similar problem in biology; molecules don t work the way they re supposed to after a while because a left-handed glove can actually convert into a right-handed glove that doesn t fit,  Julian said.In general, the process of clearing spent or defective proteins from cells, known as autophagy, slows down in people over the age of 65. It isn t clear why, but Julian s laboratory is planning to study this. Fortunately, drugs are already being tested to improve autophagy. Some candidates include existing drugs approved for cardiovascular disease and other conditions, which may help speed up the approval process.Autophagy can be induced by fasting. When cells run short on proteins from an individual s diet, they fill the void by recycling proteins already present in cells. Exercise also increases autophagy. These measures, as well as drug therapies, may ultimately help prevent the disease.  If a slowdown in autophagy is the underlying cause, things that increase it should have the beneficial, opposite effect,  Julian said. Reference: ","Published: November 30, 2021"

The research team has found that MND has 4 distinct patterns of changes in electrical signals that can be identified using EEG (electroencephalography).This breakthrough will be extremely valuable in identifying patients for clinical trials and will assist in finding new treatments for this devastating disease.The study has been published online today (Monday, 22nd November 2021) in the prestigious journal Brain HEREMND is a devastating condition which causes progressive paralysis, changes in thinking, increasing physical disability and ultimately death within an average of two to three years.  There are over 500 people in Ireland with MND, and one person is diagnosed every 3 days with the condition.  There is currently no effective treatment. While trials of new drugs are being undertaken, MND is known to be very heterogeneous with different patterns of disability and life expectancy.  Predicting in advance the pattern of disability and life expectancy is one of the major challenges in designing modern clinical trials.The world class electrical signal analysis research developed within Trinity College has discovered different patterns of brain network disruption reflect the underlying disease process.  The Trinity researchers have now shown that these patterns of  brain network disruptions in MND cluster into 4 distinct subtypes that are predictive of how the disease progresses.  The team s findings move the Trinity researchers one step closer to building better and more effective treatments for different sub-categories of the disease.The work was performed by Mr Stefan Dukic, a PhD student within the Academic Unit of Neurology at Trinity, under the supervision of Dr Bahman Nasseroleslami, Fr Tony Coote Assistant Professor in Neuroelectric Signal Analysis.Dr Bahman Nasseroleslami said:Understanding how brain networking is disrupted in MND has been the focus of our research for the past 10 years.  This work show that we are on the right track, and that the technologies we have developed to capture electrical activity in the brain can identify important differences between different patient groups.Professor Orla Hardiman,   Professor of Neurology and a world leader in MND research said:This is a very important and exciting body of work.  A major barrier to providing the right drug for the right patient in MND is the heterogeneity of the disease.  This breakthrough research has shown that it is possible to  use patterns of brain network dysfunction to identify subgroups of patients  that cannot be distinguished by clinical examination.  The implications of this work are enormous, as we  will have new and reliable ways segregate patients based on what is really happening within the nervous system in MND.Reference: Dukic S, McMackin R, Costello E, et al.

Left untreated, the condition usually results in early death. Approval was recently granted for a gene replacement therapy that enables the maintenance of muscle function. However, due to the treatment s relative novelty, data on safety and efficacy remain limited. A team from Charit    Universit tsmedizin Berlin recently conducted the first multicenter clinical study to evaluate data on the side effects associated with this new gene replacement therapy. Their study showed that treatment resulted in significant improvement in muscle function, particularly in children under two years of age. The researchers  findings have been published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health*.In Europe, the incidence of SMA is about one in 10,000 live births. The disorder results from a genetic defect which causes a deficiency of the  survival motor neuron  (SMN) protein in specific nerve cells in the spinal cord. Defective nerve cells are unable to transmit nerve impulses they receive from the brain to the muscles. The result is progressive muscle weakness and a lack of motor development, which also affects the muscles used for breathing. Most children with SMA are affected by the severest form of the disease which, without treatment, will result in death within the first two years of life.  Now, however, there is new hope. Since 2020, children in European Union countries have been able to receive a gene replacement therapy which restores their ability to produce the functional SMN protein,  explains Prof. Dr. Angela M. Kaindl, Head of the Department of Pediatric Neurology and Director of Charit s Center for Chronically Sick Children. Due to the severity of the disease involved, treatment with the novel gene therapy medication onasemnogene abeparvoven (marketed as Zolgensma) was approved on the basis of limited data.  During the first year, pediatric neurologists therefore had to proceed with caution, carefully gathering data on both the effects and side effects of this new treatment,  explains Prof. Kaindl, who led the study into the efficacy and side effects of this new gene replacement therapy in a large group of children. As part of this large observational study, the research team recruited a total of 76 children aged between six months and nearly five years from 18 participating treatment centers in Germany and Austria. Following their treatment with the gene replacement therapy between September 2019 and November 2020, the children were monitored for a period of six months. Participants included children for whom only a limited amount of data are available, namely children who had received nusinersen (the medication previously used to treat SMA) and children aged over 24 months and weighing up to 15 kilograms. The research team used standardized tests to evaluate the children s motor function both before and after treatment. They then analyzed to what extent these data correlated with age, sex, type of disease and prior therapy.  Gene replacement therapy improved significantly the children s muscle strength, irrespective of whether they had received prior treatment with nusinersen. They were able to reach new developmental milestones and showed improvements in crawling, sitting and standing,  says Prof. Kaindl. She adds:  This positive effect was particularly noticeable in children under 24 months of age; but even older children, who are usually more severely affected by SMA, were seen to benefit from treatment. Common side effects recorded included fever, vomiting, a low blood platelet count and abnormal liver function.  We paid particular attention to potential liver function abnormalities, which occurred in six children. Most cases required prolonged corticosteroid therapy to reduce liver inflammation beyond the recommended treatment duration of eight weeks. However, adverse effects are easily managed with close clinical monitoring in a specialist center,  explains Prof. Kaindl. Summarizing the results of the research, she adds:  This new gene replacement therapy offers an effective and safe alternative to nusinersen (the treatment previously used for SMA), particularly if used early. The recent introduction of an SMA screening test for use in newborn infants will help make this possible. Our data also enabled us to recommend a follow-up treatment regimen to facilitate the management of potential treatment side effects.  In order to evaluate the new gene replacement therapy s long-term effects, the researchers are planning to extend their observational study to collect longer term follow-up data on the same group of children.Reference: Wei  C, Ziegler A, Becker LL, et al.

Over billions of years, organisms have evolved many ways of replicating, from budding plants to sexual animals to invading viruses.Now scientists at the University of Vermont, Tufts University, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have discovered an entirely new form of biological reproduction and applied their discovery to create the first-ever, self-replicating living robots.The same team that built the first living robots ( Xenobots,  assembled from frog cells reported in 2020) has discovered that these computer-designed and hand-assembled organisms can swim out into their tiny dish, find single cells, gather hundreds of them together, and assemble  baby  Xenobots inside their Pac-Man-shaped  mouth that, a few days later, become new Xenobots that look and move just like themselves.And then these new Xenobots can go out, find cells, and build copies of themselves. Again and again. With the right design they will spontaneously self-replicate,  says Joshua Bongard, Ph.D., a computer scientist and robotics expert at the University of Vermont who co-led the new research.The results of the new research were published November 29, 2021, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We are working to understand this property: replication. The world and technologies are rapidly changing. It s important, for society as a whole, that we study and understand how this works,  says Bongard. These millimeter-sized living machines, entirely contained in a laboratory, easily extinguished, and vetted by federal, state and institutional ethics experts,  are not what keep me awake at night. What presents risk is the next pandemic; accelerating ecosystem damage from pollution; intensifying threats from climate change,  says UVM s Bongard.  This is an ideal system in which to study self-replicating systems. We have a moral imperative to understand the conditions under which we can control it, direct it, douse it, exaggerate it. Bongard points to the COVID epidemic and the hunt for a vaccine.  The speed at which we can produce solutions matters deeply. If we can develop technologies, learning from Xenobots, where we can quickly tell the AI:  We need a biological tool that does X and Y and suppresses Z,   that could be very beneficial. Today, that takes an exceedingly long time.  The team aims to accelerate how quickly people can go from identifying a problem to generating solutions like deploying living machines to pull microplastics out of waterways or build new medicines,  Bongard says. We need to create technological solutions that grow at the same rate as the challenges we face,  Bongard says.And the team sees promise in the research for advancements toward regenerative medicine.  If we knew how to tell collections of cells to do what we wanted them to do, ultimately, that s regenerative medicine that s the solution to traumatic injury, birth defects, cancer, and aging,  says Levin.  All of these different problems are here because we don t know how to predict and control what groups of cells are going to build. Xenobots are a new platform for teaching us.

So it s really important to know how people with dementia can be best supported at home   one possible route would be by adapting the physical environment to best suit their needs. As dementia progresses, people gradually lose their ability to carry out daily tasks due to changes in their cognitive, perceptual and physical abilities. Participation in daily tasks could then be improved by adapting the person s environment. To this end, we wanted to investigate the role of clutter in activity participation, given the potential to use de-cluttering to support people with dementia to continue to be independent. Environmental clutter has been defined as the presence of an excessive number of objects on a surface or the presence of items that are not required for a task. It is generally assumed that a person with dementia will be better-able to carry out daily tasks when their home space is tidy and clutter free. However there has been very little research to really test this hypothesis. We wanted to see whether clutter was negatively affecting people with dementia. So we studied how people at different stages of dementia coped with carrying out daily tasks at home, surrounded by their usual clutter, compared to in a clutter-free setting   a specially designed home research lab. Occupational therapist and PhD student Julieta Camino carried out the study with 65 participants who were grouped into those with mild, moderate and severe dementia.They were asked to carry out daily tasks including making a cup of tea and making a simple meal, both at their own home and at UEA s specially designed NEAT research bungalow  a fully furnished research facility that feels just like a domestic bungalow. The researchers evaluated performance of activities in both settings, and also measured the amount of clutter in the participants  homes. Meanwhile the NEAT home setting was completely clutter free.Julieta Camino, also from UEA s School of Health Sciences, said:  We thought that the complete absence of clutter in our research bungalow would play a beneficial role in helping people with dementia with daily living activities. But we were wrong. We were surprised to find that overall, people with moderate dementia, in particular, performed daily tasks better at home   even though their homes were significantly more cluttered than our research bungalow. And it didn t seem to make any difference how cluttered the participant s home was,  she added.  The only factor that contributed to how well they could carry out tasks at home was their level of cognition   with those with severe dementia encountering the same difficulties to perform the tasks at home and in the research bungalow. This research received funding from the Alzheimer s Society and National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration East of England (ARC EoE) programme.Sian Gregory, Research Information Manager at Alzheimer s Society, said:  We can sometimes make assumptions about what might help someone with dementia who s living at home, like de-cluttering so they can concentrate on tasks like making a cup of tea. But, as this study shows, our ideas might not always be right. Challenging assumptions is so important for carers to understand how to help someone with dementia to live well in their environment. That s why the Alzheimer s Society funds a variety of studies like this one to evaluate what actually works for people living with dementia today, as well as finding treatments for the future.

ANK2 encodes for various versions (isoforms) of ankyrin-B through a process known as alternatively splicing, whereby portions of the protein are excluded in the final molecules.Mammals, such as mice and humans, express the full-size (giant) ankyrin-B isoform only in neurons; another highly abundant isoform half its size is found in virtually every type of cell and organ. Multiple genetic studies have consistently identified rare variants in ANK2 in individuals with ASD, making it one of the high-confidence risk genes associated with the condition. Depending on their type and location in the gene, ANK2 variants can affect giant ankyrin-B exclusively or both isoforms simultaneously. Together with its high prevalence and striking clinical presentation, ASD s uncertain cause is a major limiting step in advancing therapeutic options,  Lorenzo said.  The evidence of ASD s genetic origin is strong but also complex, with at least 100 other high-risk genes linked to the disorder. Revealing the cause of ASD is made even more complicated because single genes such as ANK2 and the isoforms they encode can have multiple cellular functions. However, based on how subgroups of these genes overlap functionally, or work together to enact biological pathways, scientists have proposed convergent mechanisms that may be predominantly affected in individuals with ASD. One of these common mechanisms is neuron communication, which is determined in part by alterations in axons   the long extensions that carry signals from neurons to other neurons. Underlying these processes within a single neuron is the axonal cytoskeleton, a complex network of filament-like proteins that plays pivotal roles in each neuron s growth, shape, and plasticity. The axonal cytoskeleton is thought to be another major functional axis affected in ASD.Previous work by Lorenzo published in JCB showed that simultaneous loss of both major isoforms of ankyrin-B in the brain of mice resulted in profound anatomical defects involving axonal wiring, underscoring the importance of ankyrin-B in brain architecture and function. In a later study published in PNAS, Lorenzo and colleagues from Duke University observed that eliminating only the giant ankyrin-B isoform in neurons cultured in the lab resulted in more axon branches, which implicated deficits in the dynamics of microtubules, an essential cytoskeleton component.In this new study, the Lorenzo lab showed that selective loss of the giant ankyrin-B isoform leads to more axon branches in mouse brains and volumetric increases of multiple axonal bundles including the corpus callosum. In collaboration with Eva Anton, PhD, at the UNC Neuroscience Center and co-author of the eLife paper, they found that the giant ankyrin-B isoform is required to maintain the topographic order of callosal axons arising from the somatosensory cortex during brain development and to ensure the specific targeting and refinement of callosal projections on the opposite side of the brain. The team did not observe increases in axon branches in a novel mouse model they engineered that only lacks the shorter ankyrin-B isoform. These findings confirm divergent roles of ankyrin-B isoforms and support critical and specialized roles of giant ankyrin-B in axon collateral branch formation, targeting, and refinement,  Lorenzo said.In collaboration with a team led by Meng Meng Fu, PhD, at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and co-authors of the eLife paper, the researchers verified that the observed corpus callosum abnormalities did not involve changes in myelination and in the number and maturation of oligodendrocytes, a non-neuronal brain cell type implicated in similar pathologies.  Brain cortical regions have been the most directly linked to ASD pathology. The changes we observed in cortical structural connectivity likely result from combined defects in axon branch initiation, guidance, and pruning of misdirected or overabundant projections during development due to giant ankyrin-B deficiency,  Lorenzo said.Cues outside of cells modulate these processes to trigger changes in neurons through attractive and repulsive effects. Lorenzo s research team showed that cortical neurons require the giant ankyrin-B isoform to make possible the repulsive effects of semaphorin 3A, a molecule that interacts with and collapses the tips of axons and their branches. The team also showed that ANK2 variants exclusively affecting giant ankyrin-B have similar loss of response to the Semaphorin 3A molecule, revealing a possible mechanistic contribution to ASD. Our new insights together with our tools and methods will help us assign pathogenicity to other ANK2 variants. We are certain there is undiscovered biology relevant to brain function and ASD involving this gene and we are pursuing it,  Lorenzo said.  Our bottom-up approach of discovery and functional validation contributes to the underdeveloped knowledge database of ASD functional etiology. This is critical because this heterogeneous and complex disorder likely requires personalized strategies for clinical intervention. Reference: Creighton BA, Afriyie S, Ajit D, et al.

As a boarded veterinary dentist and oral surgeon, Dr. Santiago Peralta, associate professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) and first author of the recent study in Scientific Reports, sees CAA in his clinic all the time. This research was a good example of a full cycle of translational research,  Peralta said.  We took something we were dealing with in the clinical setting, studied it in the bench setting and are now hoping to use it to help veterinary patients and, potentially, humans. The resemblance between CAA and AM had long been noted by scientists and clinicians, but no one had confirmed any molecular similarities. A previous study on AM tumors revealed the underlying mutations, piquing the interest of Peralta and his CVM colleagues.  We wondered if we should look at these mutations and see if they precipitate the canine tumor,  Peralta said.They did just that, publishing a study in Veterinary and Comparative Oncology in 2019, that revealed that both AM and CAA shared mutations in a well-known signaling pathway, known as the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway.In their most recent study, Peralta and his colleagues analyzed a large genomic dataset generated by the Cornell Transcriptional Regulation and Expression Facility (TREx) to better understand the biological consequences of these mutations. While doing so, they compared the CAA tumors with another common canine tumor (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and healthy gum tissue. These samples were stored and made available through the Cornell Veterinary Biobank and gene expression was profiled with RNA sequencing by Dr. Jen Grenier and her team at TREx.The team also used genomic data from human tissues to run comparisons, thanks to their collaboration with a human oral cancer expert at the University of Turku in Finland. Through analyzing these different tissues, Peralta and his team were able to see that the mutations they had identified in their earlier study were largely responsible for the tumors they were seeing.They also found that CAA and AM are very similar at a molecular level, reinforcing the notion that dogs represent a potentially useful natural model of the human tumor.  All the dysregulated molecules and pathways in CAA tumor tissues were consistent with the mutations we d found and remarkably similar to those observed in AM,  he said.Now that they ve connected the dots between the underlying mutations and dysregulated molecular pathways driving tumor formation, Peralta and his colleagues have been working to establish in vitro and in vivo models of different canine oral tumors that can be used to test potential drugs.  Any drugs that might prove effective in treating oral tumors in dogs could also be promising candidates for human patients with analogue disease. If dogs truly represent a useful clinical model of the disease, they also represent an immense opportunity,  Peralta said. Because the CAA tumors are much more common in dogs than AM are in humans, scientists can rapidly enroll many more dogs in clinical trials and get more translatable data from those trials.Furthermore, dogs, which live in same type of environments as humans, are more accurate models of disease than other animal models.  My goal as a veterinarian is to bring solutions back to the clinic. We re not there yet, but we ve made a major step toward that,  Peralta said.Reference: Peralta S, Duhamel GE, Katt WP, et al.

These include genes that help them resist attacks from common antimicrobial drugs, making many illnesses caused by these bacteria resistant to treatment.  Better understanding conjugation could therefore allow scientists to find ways to stop the process and reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance.Although conjugation has been studied since the 1940s, the atomic details underlying the mechanism were unknown. Now, researchers from Imperial College London and Queen Mary University of London have imaged a key part of the process for the first time.The results, published in Nature Communications, are an important step forward in understanding how bacteria acquire drug resistance   and potentially how to stop them doing so.Lead researcher Dr Tiago Costa, from the MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection and Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said:  Our findings set the stage for an acceleration of our understanding of gene transfer conferring antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. Importantly, deciphering the mechanistic details of gene transfer could provide us with targets that can be exploited to suppress antibiotic resistance. The team studied E. coli bacteria. When an E. coli bacterium wants to initiate conjugation with another bacterium, it uses a type IV secretion system (T4SS)   a structure that reaches out and penetrates the other bacterium.Many types of bacteria use the T4SS for a range of processes, including injecting toxic proteins into our own cells during infection, or injecting toxins into rival bacterial cells to kill them when competing for resources.During conjugation, it s not toxic proteins that are transferred, but segments of free-ranging DNA that confer an advantage to bacteria   including antimicrobial resistance. These DNA segments can even be transferred to different species of bacteria, spreading drug resistance to new pathogens.  The T4SS is composed of three parts. The team were able to image the part called the outer-membrane core complex, which anchors the T4SS to the bacterium that is sharing its genes. From this anchor, the bacterium sends out a pilus   a long strand that grabs hold of the neighbouring bacterium to which the DNA is to be transferred.The images, obtained using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, revealed that the outer-membrane core complex is made up of two concentric rings of proteins with very flexible connectors. This structure is highly flexible, which researchers believe help with the extension and retraction of the pilus as it reaches out to the other bacterium.First author of the paper Ms Himani Amin, also from the Department of Life Sciences, said: ""Our structure reveals fascinating new insights into the outer membrane core complex by displaying remarkable protein organisation within. This will pave the way towards a better understanding of gene transfer amongst bacterial population and could enable researchers to develop preventative therapeutics.""The team now want to image the rest of the conjugation T4SS in E. coli, revealing its full functionality in sufficient detail to show scientists how the process could be disrupted, reducing the transfer of antimicrobial resistance.Reference: Amin H, Ilangovan A, Costa TRD.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/stem-cell-memories-may-drive-wound-repair-356308,Stem Cell Memories May Drive Wound Repair Epidermal stem cells derived from the hair follicle are almost indistinguishable from stem cells native to the epidermis  But the memory of their journey to the surface changes their approach to wound repair  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A trifling paper cut is a site of frenzied activity. Within it, a squad of epidermal stem cells briskly regenerate to patch up the wound. A closer inspection of this war-torn swath of epidermis will reveal that, while some of the stem cells are native to the area, others are newcomers former hair-producing stem cells that, upon sensing nearby injury, migrated from the hair follicle to the wound bed, where they transformed to resemble indigenous epidermal stem cells.Now, a new study demonstrates that, within their genetic material, these relocated stem cells retain memories of how to travel from the follicle to the skin s surface, repair damaged skin, and finally adapt to their new home. These seasoned stem cells are largely indistinguishable from naive epidermal stem cells. But the new research, published in Science suggests that they are primed to heal wounds faster and, after repeated wounds, may develop memories that could lead to chronic disease and cancer. Hair follicle-derived epidermal stem cells look the same as normal epidermal stem cells,  says Rockefeller s Elaine Fuchs.  But the memory of their migration, and their enhanced plasticity, has consequences.  Beyond inflammatory memory In recent years, scientists have found that immune cells acquire epigenetic changes when fending off pathogens, sensitizing them to further inflammation in a process known as trained immunity or inflammatory memory.Fuchs and colleagues began investigating inflammatory memory in skin back in 2017, seeking to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and chronic wounding. They discovered that epidermal stem cells, like immune cells, can draw on epigenetic memories of inflammation to muster non-specific, short-term responses to inflammation and injuries. Memory was once thought to be a privilege of T cells and B cells of the immune system,  Fuchs says.  But our findings have show that it s a more widespread phenomenon. Practically, this means that skin inflamed once will heal faster when damaged a second time, thanks to proteins that serve as molecular bookmarks tucked into the cell nucleus. The bookmarking reminds each cell which genes it had to activate or silence to defeat a prior challenge, empowering it to respond more efficiently to future injuries. No longer a privilege of immune cells, inflammatory memory has since been found in airway and intestinal epithelia, with implications for asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.In this new study, Fuchs  team focused on minor everyday skin injuries. Sixty days after such an injury, they found that the mouse s epidermal stem cells were indeed capable of remembering inflammation and learning from it to improve wound healing. But these stem cells, which had abandoned the hair follicles to rise to the surface and maintain the skin s inner layer, also contained a number of markers in their genetic material that are not seen in run-of-the-mill trained immunity. Memories of their previous and current jobs gave the stem cells newfound flexibility they could regenerate either hair or epidermis when challenged to do so. And memories of their migration to the skin s surface enabled the immigrant epidermal stem cells to mobilize more efficiently than native epidermal stem cells in response to fresh injuries.  We were surprised by the wide diversity, and cumulative nature, of memories that stem cells can retain,  says Kevin Gonzales, a postdoc in the Fuchs lab and first author on the study.  Thus far epigenetic memory has mainly been shown to record events of inflammation, but our experiments suggest that stem cells can potentially remember other things as well, perhaps every major stimulus that they encounter.  Bad memories Although speedy wound repair is usually a good thing, studies have raised the possibility that epigenetic memory may lead to chronic disease.  We know that inflammatory bouts of psoriasis often occur on the same sites and, in cancer, we know that tumors often arise at sites of previous injury,  Gonzales says.  This suggests that the diversity of memories accumulated over time could be culpable for a variety of chronic diseases that arise later in life. Fuchs adds that in mice, potentially dangerous stem-cell memories form after even minor injuries, and persist for at least six months the equivalent of five or six years of human life.  It probably happens to most of us several times a week. It is likely that these memories originated in evolution to help animals heal wounds faster and defend themselves against future encounters with pathogens. However, humans live longer, and it is disconcerting to think that each time, we are developing long lasting memories of our injuries and exposure to pathogens and other irritants.  This recent study contributes to a larger body of work that is teaching scientists about a bevy of inflammatory diseases, many of which develop in the epithelial tissues that are our first line of defense from the outside world.  The prevailing treatment for chronic inflammatory disorders of these epithelial tissues are immunosuppressive drugs and, while those may help, there is mounting evidence that suppressing the immune system may not target the roots of the problem,  says Fuchs. In the future, Fuchs hopes to provide better treatment alternatives by drilling down to the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of maladaptive stem-cell memories.  Ideally, we would eventually be able to get rid of bad memories and keep only the good ones,  she says.

NRPS enzymes are prolific producers of natural antibiotics such as penicillin. However, up until now, manipulating these complex enzymes to produce new and more effective antibiotics has been a major challenge.The UK government suggest antimicrobial resistance (AMR) infections are estimated to cause 700,000 deaths each year globally and are predicted to rise to 10 million, costing the global economy $100 trillion, by 2050. AMR also threatens many of the UN s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with an extra 28 million people that could be forced into extreme poverty by 2050 unless AMR is contained.The Manchester team says the gene editing process could be used to produce improved antibiotics and possibly lead to the development of new treatments helping in the fight against drug-resistant pathogens and illnesses in the future. Jason Micklefield, Professor of Chemical Biology at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB), UK, explains:  The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is one of the biggest threats we face today. The gene editing approach we developed is a very efficient and rapid way to engineer complex assembly line enzymes that can produce new antibiotic structures with potentially improved properties. Microorganisms in our environment, such as soil dwelling bacteria, have evolved nonribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes (NRPS) that assemble building blocks called amino acids into peptide products which often have very potent antibiotic activity. Many of the most therapeutically important antibiotics, used in the clinic today, are derived from these NRPS enzymes (e.g. penicillin, vancomycin and daptomycin).Unfortunately, deadly pathogens are emerging which are resistant to all of these existing antibiotic drugs. One solution could be to create new antibiotics with improved properties that can evade the resistance mechanisms of the pathogens. However, the nonribosomal peptide antibiotics are very complex structures which are difficult and expensive to produce by normal chemical methods. To address this, the Manchester team use gene editing to engineer the NRPS enzymes, swapping domains that recognise different amino acid building blocks, leading to new assembly lines that can deliver new peptide products.Micklefield added:  We are now able to use gene editing to introduce targeted changes to complex NRPS enzymes, enabling alternative amino acids precursors to be incorporated into the peptide structures. We are optimistic that our new approach could lead to new ways of making improved antibiotics which are urgently needed to combat emerging drug-resistant pathogens.

Currently, patients with glioblastoma do not receive this life-prolonging treatment because it has not been fully understood which of them could benefit. This is an important breakthrough for patients who have not had an effective treatment in the cancer drug arsenal available to them,  said Dr. Adam Sonabend, the senior/corresponding author of this study, and associate professor of neurosurgery at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine brain-tumor neurosurgeon.  It might ultimately influence the decision on how to treat glioblastoma patients and which patients should get these drugs to prolong their survival.   Our study emphasizes important immune cells that might be relevant for response to immunotherapy. We hope that ultimately this benefits glioblastoma patients,  said Victor Arrieta, a post-doctoral scientist at the Sonabend lab and the first author of this study.The immunotherapy response marker now needs to be validated in a clinical trial to make sure the study findings are reproducible and applicable to any glioblastoma patient, Sonabend said. He also is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.The study was published in Nature Cancer Nov. 29.Glioblastomas are the most common form of malignant brain tumors in adults and have the worst prognosis. Patients are treated with radiation and chemotherapy, but the cancer inevitably recurs. Upon recurrence, there are no treatments that prolong survival. But Sonabend and his research team s biomarker discovery shows which patients will respond to immunotherapy and could have their lives significantly prolonged. The finding was confirmed in two independent sets of patients. The new study describes a simple analysis that was able to differentiate the tumors from the patients who responded and lived longer after getting these drugs.The higher the amount of the biomarker a patient had in their tumor, the greater their chance of extended survival with the drug.","Published: November 30, 2021"

Although the members of this family are practically identical, some transport certain amino acids and not others. This specialisation determines their involvement in specific functions, such as cell growth or neuronal functions, and consequently in related diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer s disease. What confers this specificity and diversity of functions? This is one of the questions asked by researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO) and the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), who led the study, and one whose answer has been published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Thanks to the latest high-resolution structural technologies such as cryo-electron microscopy, combined with computational modelling and the design of mutants of these proteins, the researchers have been able to observe the structure of one of the members of this protein family in atomic detail and decipher its function. The results of the study show how only a few residues located in defined regions of this family of proteins select the specific amino acids to which they will bind and are therefore responsible for the protein to participate in specific physiological functions.Armed with this information, the researchers now face the challenge of finding new therapies and diagnostic tools for diseases that involve the HAT family of transporter proteins, with a particular interest in those conditions that pose serious health problems, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease.","Published: November 30, 2021"

This RNA-cutting enzyme can be designed to cleave any target sequence, including parts of the genome from SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.By pairing the Cas13 system with a simple nucleic acid amplification method, a handheld optical reader and a smartphone, the researchers created a low-cost, point-of-care test that could accurately diagnose COVID-19 from throat and nose swab samples taken from patients.The approach proved reliable and accurate with a fast turnaround time, from clinical sampling to a diagnostic result in just a few hours.  Our modality demonstrates several key features, including simplicity, specificity, sensitivity and portability,  Mahfouz says.A COVID-19 test represents just one potential application of the technology. Other diagnostic or therapeutic uses could soon follow, explains Ahmed Mahas, a Ph.D. student in Mahfouz s lab. We aim to develop next-generation sensors that can be applied for the detection of nucleic acids as well as other molecules, such as environmental molecules,  says Mahas, the first author of the journal article that describes the diagnostic assay.The miniature Cas13 system may also be useful as an antiviral therapeutic. The compact nature of the new Cas13 protein makes it easier to package the gene-editing machinery into a viral vector, the standard method for transferring CRISPR components into human cells. Once inside cells, the system could be used therapeutically to alter the expression of disease-associated genes or to destroy pathogens such as the influenza virus.What s more,  the small size of this novel protein allows for simple protein engineering,  Mahas says. And with further molecular tweaks, the KAUST team aims to expand the toolkit of potential Cas13-related applications.Mahfouz and his colleagues have filed a patent application connected to their CRISPR-Cas13 system. To refine their diagnostic method, they have also continued their search for novel Cas13 proteins.  This work demonstrates that bacterial defense systems have untapped potential for diverse synthetic biology applications,  says Mahfouz.Reference: Mahas A, Wang Q, Marsic T, Mahfouz MM.

Our computational tool allows you to see with unprecedented resolution where the viral proteins are binding on the human protein, and therefore, we can really understand what part of these proteins are key for these interactions,  said Haiyuan Yu, the study s senior author and a professor in the Department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology and the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology. Shayne Wierbowski, a graduate student in Yu s lab, is the paper s first author.A previous study by other scientists described interactions between COVID-19 and human proteins, for the purpose of repurposing human drugs to block the virus from binding. But binding  interfaces are small compared to the overall protein s surface, and previous research has lacked the detailed resolution to understand exactly where drugs might block a binding site. The tool we developed to predict protein-to-protein interfaces is the most accurate,  Yu said,  and we can use it to make the most informed predictions for any interactions.  The pandemic spurred a surge of research worldwide to understand the structure of SARS-COV-2, with scientists using advanced imaging technologies to reveal proteins that make the virus infectious. As a result, Yu and colleagues were able to validate their computationally predicted structures against those described by others using imaging technologies.The tool also allows researchers to predict how genetic variations in human proteins affect viral-protein interactions, as two people of similar health and age can have diverging responses to catching COVID-19, with some being asymptomatic and others showing dramatic negative reactions. Because of our structural models, we can predict how mutations to proteins in individuals potentially affect viral interactions,  Yu said. The results could one day shed light on whether some individuals may be at higher risk due to their genetics, which could prioritize them for monitoring, vaccines and treatments.Additionally, the tool will not only help clinicians develop drugs that precisely target human protein binding sites, it can also help reduce toxic or negative effects that could result when drugs bind to the wrong sites.Co-authors include Gary Whittaker, professor of virology, and Dr. Steven Lipkin, a clinical geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine.The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative and the William Strong COVID-19 Biobank.Reference: Wierbowski SD, Liang S, Liu Y, et al.

Researchers say the device can tell with 95% percent accuracy if someone has a virus, a significant improvement over current rapid tests that experts warn could have low accuracy. Testing for viruses is important for early treatment and to help stop their spread.The results are detailed in a new study in the journal Nano Letters.The researchers tested the device using samples of Dengue virus, a mosquito transmitted pathogen that causes Dengue fever and is a threat to people in the tropics. However, the technology can easily be adapted to detect other viruses, like COVID-19, says study co-author Debashis Chanda, a professor in UCF s NanoScience Technology Center. The sensitive optical sensor, along with the rapid fabrication approach used in this work, promises the translation of this promising technology to any virus detection including COVID-19 and its mutations with high degree of specificity and accuracy,  Chanda says.  Here, we demonstrated a credible technique which combines PCR-like genetic coding and optics on a chip for accurate virus detection directly from blood. The device closely matches the accuracy of the gold-standard PCR-based tests but with nearly instantaneous results instead of results that take several days to receive. Its accuracy is also a significant improvement over current rapid antigen tests that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Centers for Disease Control have cautioned could produce inaccurate results if viral loads are low or test instructions are not properly followed.The device works by using nano-scale patterns of gold that reflect back the signature of the virus it is set to detect in a sample of blood. Different viruses can be detected by using different DNA sequences that selectively target specific viruses.Key to the device s performance is that it can detect viruses directly from blood samples without the need for sample preparation or purification, thus speeding up the test and improving its accuracy. A vast majority of biosensors demonstrations in the literature utilize buffer solutions as the test matrix to contain the target analyte,  Chanda says.  However, these approaches are not practical in real-life applications because complex biological fluids, such as blood, containing the target biomarkers are the main source for sensing and at the same time the main source of protein fouling leading to sensor failure. The researchers confirmed the device s effectiveness with multiple tests that used different virus concentration levels and solution environments, including those with the presence of nontarget virus biomarkers.Abraham Vazquez-Guardado, the study s lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University who worked on the research as a doctoral student in Chanda s lab, says he s excited about the potential. Although there have been previous optical biosensing demonstration in human serum, they still require off-line complex and dedicated sample preparation performed by skilled personnel   a commodity not available in typical point of care applications,  Vazquez-Guardado says.  This work demonstrated for the first time an integrated device which separated plasma from the blood and detects the target virus without any pre-processing with potential for near future practical usages.

The research findings have recently been published in world-leading scientific journal Autophagy.Obesity is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalence in modern society. Since 1970s, the global number of obese people has trebled and reached 650 million (~ 13% of the total global population) in 2016. It is widely known that obesity provokes detrimental outcomes in multiple human organs and causes numerous chronic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver diseases, and atherosclerosis. Fat metabolism in the skeletal muscle of obese patients is slower than that of healthy people, which scientists believe is a consequence of abnormal functions in mitochondria (the powerhouses of a cell that convert nutrients into biological energy). However, how obesity impairs the activity of mitochondria is a long unresolved question.To study the functional impacts of obesity on the skeletal muscle, Dr Chan s team developed a special obesified mouse model by removing the gene of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exclusively in their skeletal muscle. BDNF is originally identified as an important growth factor for maintaining the survival and activities of neurons. Recent studies have proposed that BDNF is also a muscle-secreted protein (i.e., myokine), but its physiological significance is unknown.For the first time, Dr Chan s team found that obesity reduced the amount of BDNF in the skeletal muscle of mice. They also observed that the mice without BDNF in their muscle, called  MBKO  (Muscle-specific BDNF Knockout), gained more body weight and developed severer insulin resistance when the animals were fed with a high-fat diet. In addition, the research team found that MBKO mice have less energy expenditure than their control cohort.Using a number of biochemical, histological, metabolomic, and molecular analyses, the research team further demonstrated that the mitochondria in the muscle of MBKO mice were unable to recycle, leading to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria in the tissues. Consequently, the lipid metabolism in the muscle of MBKO mice was retarded, causing more lipid accumulation to interfere with insulin sensitivity. Clearly, muscle-derived BDNF is a weight-control protein by increasing the energy expenditure and maintaining insulin sensitivity, said Dr Chan. BDNF has long been considered a brain-localized peptide, and its importance in peripheral tissues has been underestimated. Our study provides a new insight to this area, and hopefully we can unlock more functions of this myokine using our MBKO mice,  Dr Chan further added.In addition to the animal studies, Dr Chan s team also utilized cultured cell models to pinpoint the molecular mechanism for the defective mitochondrial turnover in BDNF-deficient muscle cells. They found that muscle-secreted BDNF used AMPK-activated protein kinase, the well-known energy sensor in cells, to trigger the Parkin/PINK1 pathway for inducing mitophagy (a highly regulated mechanism to recycle the materials in cells in response to various challenges) in skeletal muscle.To extend these findings to therapeutic application, the research team further tested if restoring the BDNF signaling in muscle would rescue the obesity-induced mitochondrial damage. They fed the obese mice with 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, a natural bioavailable BDNF mimetic in plants (found in the leaves of Godmania aesculifolia, a plant species in South America) currently used in the clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease, and found that obesity-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was alleviated.Together with their previous findings that 7,8-DHF is an effective agent in reducing body weight and improving the insulin sensitivity in obese mice (Chem Biol 2015 22: 355-369; Metabolism 2018 87: 113-122), Dr Chan s work provides a new explanation on the pernicious nature of obesity and suggests that BDNF-signaling enhancer such as 7,8-DHF is a potential drug for obesity treatment in human beings.Reference: Ahuja P, Ng CF, Pang BPS, et al.

The researchers show that bumblebees with more of this type of bacteria in their guts have a better memory than individuals with fewer bacteria. Bumblebees that ate food containing more of this species of gut bacteria were also found to have more long-lasting memories than individuals with normal diets.The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, adds to growing evidence that the gut microbiome   the trillions of microbes that live in our intestines   can affect animal behaviour. To test the bees  memory and learning abilities, the researchers created different coloured artificial flowers; five colours were associated with sweet sucrose solution and the other five with a bitter tasting solution containing quinine, a repellent for bees. The researchers then observed how quickly the bees were able to learn which colours were associated with a sugar reward, and if they were able to retain this information in a follow-up test three days later. By sequencing gut samples from the bees, they were then able to compare individual differences in bumblebees learning and memory abilities with the levels of different bacteria found in their gut.To confirm that the numbers of Lactobacillus apis in the gut were directly responsible for the observed differences in memory, the researchers added these bacteria to the bumblebees  diet and measured their responses to the same task. Bees  cognitive abilities vary across individuals and they have a relatively small community of gut microorganisms compared with mammals, making them ideal models to explore the role of specific gut bacteria on differences in cognition between individuals.The researchers suggest observed variations in the microbiome across individual bumblebees could arise from differences or changes in nest environment, activities, pathogens, social interactions, and pollination environment.Dr Li Li, Lead author of the study and postdoctoral Researcher at Jiangnan University, said: Our results suggest not only that the natural variation in the amount of a specific gut bacterium effects memory, but also show a causal link   that by adding the same bacterial species to a bee s diet can enhance their memories. Further research will be required to determine if and which bacteria species might have the same effect in humans. But our work has shone a bright light on this possibility. Professor Lars Chittka from Queen Mary University of London and co-author of the study, said, This is a fascinating finding that could apply to humans as well as to bees. Our findings add to growing evidence of the importance of gut-brain interactions in animals and provide insights into the cause of cognitive differences in natural bumblebee populations. Professor Wei Zhao, corresponding author and Head of the Enzymology lab at Jiangnan University, said:  It s amazing to find out the specific memory-enhancing bacteria species. The results further validate our belief that we may improve our cognitive ability via the regulation of gut microbiota. Reference: ","Published: November 29, 2021"

For example, in dim evenings or fog, the contrast of the objects decreases, making it difficult to distinguish them. However, after repeatedly encountering specific objects, the brain can identify them even if they become indistinct. The exact mechanism contributing to the perception of low-contrast familiar objects remains unknown.In the primary visual cortex (V1), the area of the cerebral cortex dedicated to processing basic visual information, the visual responses have been considered to reflect directly the strength of external inputs. Thus, high-contrast visual stimuli elicit strong responses and vice versa.In this study, Rie Kimura and Yumiko Yoshimura found that in rats, the number of V1 neurons preferentially responding to low-contrast stimuli increases after repeated experiences. In these neurons, low-contrast visual stimuli elicit stronger responses, and high-contrast stimuli elicit weaker responses. These low contrast preferring neurons show a more evident activity when rats correctly perceive a low-contrast familiar object. It was first reported in Science Advances that low-contrast preference in V1 is strengthened in an experience-dependent manner to represent low-contrast visual information well. This mechanism may contribute to the perception of familiar objects, even when they are indistinct. This flexible information representation may enable a consistent perception of familiar objects with any contrast,  Kimura says.  The flexibility of our brain makes our sensation effective, although you may not be aware of it. An artificial neural network model may reproduce the human sensation by incorporating not only high contrast preferring neurons, generally considered until now, but also low contrast preferring neurons, the main focus of this research.

After infusion back into the patient, the CAR T-cells kill the targeted cancer cells. The work will be led by principal investigator Ezra Cohen, MD, professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine, associate director for clinical science and chief of the Division of Hematology-Oncology at Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health, and Charles Prussak, PharmD, PhD, director of the Cell Therapy Translational Laboratory at Moores Cancer Center.In their previous laboratory studies, Cohen and team developed CAR T-cells that specifically target ROR1, a molecule found on the surface of many cancer cells. ROR1 is normally used only by embryonic cells during early development, but it can also be exploited by cancer cells to promote tumor growth. ROR1 is also the target of cirmtuzumab, an experimental monoclonal antibody-based drug developed by another UC San Diego School of Medicine research team with funding from CIRM. Cohen and team used a portion of the cirmtuzumab antibody to construct ROR1 CAR T-cells. They discovered that ROR1 CAR T-cells were especially active in blood cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).The award will allow the team to take the steps needed to finalize the clinical product and launch clinical trials to test ROR1 CAR T-cell safety and efficacy in patients with blood cancers. Since ROR1 is rarely found in normal adult tissues, the researchers expect their therapy to have minimal side effects. This really has the potential to provide a meaningful therapy to many patients with blood cancers that are resistant to standard chemotherapies, have few therapeutic options and dire prognoses,  said Cohen, who is also head of the Solid Tumor Therapeutics Program at Moores Cancer Center and co-director of the San Diego Center for Precision Immunotherapy.  These patients represent a tremendous, global unmet medical need. Shortly after an initial Phase I clinical trial, the researchers plan to expand their approach to address difficult-to-treat solid tumors, such as head and neck cancers, triple-negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, which also produce ROR1.  CAR T-cell therapies represent a transformational advance in the treatment of hematologic malignancies,  said Maria T. Millan, MD, CIRM president and CEO.  This approach addresses the need to develop new therapies for patients whose cancers are resistant to standard chemotherapies, who have few therapeutic options and a very poor chance or recovery. Our goal is to always move the most promising research forward as fast as we can. That s why these programs are so important. They reflect potential therapeutic approaches that have shown promise in the lab and are ready to take the next step, to undergo further testing and examination to see if they might be able to work in patients.

An unresolved question is whether the olfactory nerve can provide SARS-CoV-2 with a route of entry to the brain. Scientists at the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics in Frankfurt in collaboration with physicians and scientists at the University Hospitals Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and a major hospital in Bruges, Belgium, together with scientists at NanoString Technologies Inc. in Seattle, USA, report that SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to infect the sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the team failed to find evidence for infection of olfactory bulb neurons. Instead, the sustentacular cells, also known as supporting cells, are the main target cell type for the virus in the olfactory epithelium. Since SARS-CoV2 spares olfactory sensory neurons and olfactory bulb neurons, it does not appear to be a neurotropic virus.To infect a cell, SARS-CoV-2 must bind to a receptor on the cell membrane, and the classic entry receptor is ACE2. Earlier studies had shown that ACE2 is expressed by sustentacular cells in the human olfactory epithelium but not by olfactory sensory neurons, the nerve cells that are stimulated by odorants in the inhaled air and that transmit electrical signals to the olfactory bulb. There is no literature about the functions of sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium of humans. Studies in laboratory animals suggest that sustentacular cells provide olfactory sensory neurons with a variety of supportive functions, including structural and metabolic support. Both cell types are continuously regenerated from stem cells within the olfactory epithelium throughout the life of an individual.As the olfactory mucosa is hidden deep within the nasal cavity, tissue sample procurement is not a practical option in patients while they are suffering from COVID-19. Hence, the physicians developed a novel protocol for harvesting tissue samples from deceased COVID-19 patients. As a control, tissue samples were taken from patients who had died from other causes and who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of death. The workflow started with the notification of a team of ear, nose, & throat physicians about the death of a COVID-19 patient in an intensive care unit or ward. Using an endoscope, the physicians collected samples from the respiratory and olfactory mucosae and both olfactory bulbs. They were able to do so within 60 to 90 minutes after the death of the patient.  Thanks to this short postmortem interval, the tissue samples were in pristine condition for molecular biology studies,  says Laura Van Gerven, an ear, nose, & throat surgeon in Leuven and co-principal investigator of the project called ANOSMIC-19.

This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. Here is a summary of what is currently known. Current knowledge about Omicron Researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available. Transmissibility: It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors. Severity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta. Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants. Initial reported infections were among university students younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key. Effectiveness of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection Preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but information is limited. More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks. Effectiveness of vaccines: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating variant, Delta. Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.   Effectiveness of current tests: The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well. Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests. Effectiveness of current treatments: Corticosteroids and IL6 Receptor Blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19. Other treatments will be assessed to see if they are still as effective given the changes to parts of the virus in the Omicron variant. Studies underway: At the present time, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omicron. Studies currently underway or underway shortly include assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments.    WHO encourages countries to contribute the collection and sharing of hospitalized patient data through the WHO COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform to rapidly describe clinical characteristics and patient outcomes.  More information will emerge in the coming days and weeks. WHO s TAG-VE will continue to monitor and evaluate the data as it becomes available and assess how mutations in Omicron alter the behaviour of the virus.

Kaufmann and his team did the work at the CRCHUM, the research arm of UdeM s teaching hospital, the Centre hospitalier de l Universit  de Montr al. In our study, we were able to determine which biomarkers are predictors of mortality in the 60 days following the onset of symptoms,  said Kaufmann, the study s co-lead author alongside CRCHUM research colleagues Nicolas Chomont and Andr s Finzi. Thanks to our data, we have successfully developed and validated a statistical model based on one blood biomarker,  viral RNA, Kaufmann said. Despite advances in the management of COVID-19, doctors have found it hard to identify patients most at risk of dying of the disease and so be able to offer them new treatments. Several biomarkers have been identified in other studies, but juggling the profusion of parameters is not possible in a clinical setting and hinders doctors  ability to make quick medical decisions.At the same time, Chomont s team measured the amounts of viral RNA and Finzi s the levels of antibodies targeting the virus. Samples were collected 11 days after the onset of symptoms and patients were monitored for a minimum of 60 days after that.The goal: to test the hypothesis that immunological indicators were associated with increased mortality. Among all of the biomarkers we evaluated, we showed that the amount of viral RNA in the blood was directly associated with mortality and provided the best predictive response, once our model was adjusted for the age and sex of the patient,  said Elsa Brunet-Ratnasingham, a doctoral student in Kaufmann s lab and co-first author of the study. We even found that including additional biomarkers did not improve predictive quality,  added the young researcher, whose work benefited from an UdeM COVID-19 Excellence Grant.","Published: November 29, 2021"

This is the first time that such significant resistance to compression has been incorporated into a soft material. The  super jelly  could be used for a wide range of potential applications, including soft robotics, bioelectronics or even as a cartilage replacement for biomedical use. The results are reported in the journal Nature Materials. The way materials behave   whether they re soft or firm, brittle or strong   is dependent upon their molecular structure. Stretchy, rubber-like hydrogels have lots of interesting properties that make them a popular subject of research   such as their toughness and self-healing capabilities   but making hydrogels that can withstand being compressed without getting crushed is a challenge. In order to make materials with the mechanical properties we want, we use crosslinkers, where two molecules are joined through a chemical bond,  said Dr Zehuan Huang from the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, the study s first author.  We use reversible crosslinkers to make soft and stretchy hydrogels, but making a hard and compressible hydrogel is difficult and designing a material with these properties is completely counterintuitive. Working in the lab of Professor Oren Scherman, who led the research, the team used barrel-shaped molecules called cucurbiturils to make a hydrogel that can withstand compression. The cucurbituril is the crosslinking molecule which holds two guest molecules in its cavity   like a molecular handcuff. The researchers designed guest molecules that prefer to stay inside the cavity for longer than normal, which keeps the polymer network tightly linked, allowing for it to withstand compression. At 80% water content, you d think it would burst apart like a water balloon, but it doesn t: it stays intact and withstands huge compressive forces,  said Scherman, Director of the University s Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis.  The properties of the hydrogel are seemingly at odds with each other. The way the hydrogel can withstand compression was surprising, it wasn t like anything we ve seen in hydrogels,  said co-author Dr Jade McCune, also from the Department of Chemistry.  We also found that the compressive strength could be easily controlled through simply changing the chemical structure of the guest molecule inside the handcuff. To make their glass-like hydrogels, the team chose specific guest molecules for the handcuff. Altering the molecular structure of guest molecules within the handcuff allowed the dynamics of the material to  slow down  considerably, with the mechanical performance of the final hydrogel ranging from rubber-like to glass-like states. People have spent years making rubber-like hydrogels, but that s just half of the picture,  said Scherman.  We ve revisited traditional polymer physics and created a new class of materials that span the whole range of material properties from rubber-like to glass-like, completing the full picture. The researchers used the material to make a hydrogel pressure sensor for real-time monitoring of human motions, including standing, walking and jumping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that glass-like hydrogels have been made. We re not just writing something new into the textbooks, which is really exciting, but we re opening a new chapter in the area of high-performance soft materials,  said Huang.Researchers from the Scherman lab are currently working to further develop these glass-like materials towards biomedical and bioelectronic applications in collaboration with experts from engineering and materials science.

But to researchers like Amanda Hargrove, a chemistry professor at Duke University, the complex shapes that RNA takes on as it folds upon itself could have untapped therapeutic potential in the fight against COVID-19.In a study to appear Nov. 26 in the journal Science Advances, Hargrove and colleagues have identified chemical compounds that can latch onto these 3D structures and block the virus s ability to replicate. These are the first molecules with antiviral activity that target the virus s RNA specifically, so it's a totally new mechanism in that sense,  Hargrove said.Even more than 18 months into the pandemic, that s good news. We have vaccines to prevent COVID-19, but effective, easy-to-administer drugs to help people survive and recover once they ve been infected remain limited.The virus is receding in some parts of the world, but cases are still surging in others where vaccines are in short supply. And even in regions with easy access to vaccines, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy means many of the world s eight billion people remain vulnerable to infection.To infect your cells, the coronavirus must break in, deliver its genetic instructions in the form of RNA, and hijack the body s molecular machinery to build new copies of itself. The infected cell becomes a virus factory, reading the 30,000 nucleotide  letters  of the virus s genetic code and churning out the proteins the virus needs to replicate and spread.Most antivirals -- including remdesivir, molnupiravir and Paxlovid, the only antiviral drugs for COVID-19 that have been FDA-approved or are in line for approval -- work by binding to these proteins. But Hargrove and colleagues are taking a different approach. They ve identified the first molecules that take aim at the viral genome itself -- and not just the linear sequence of A s, C s, G s and U s, but the complex three-dimensional structures the RNA strand folds into.When the first terrifying hints of the pandemic started to make headlines, the team including Hargrove, Blanton Tolbert from Case Western Reserve University and Gary Brewer and Mei-Ling Li from Rutgers were already investigating potential drug candidates to fight another RNA virus -- Enterovirus 71, a common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease in children.They had identified a class of small molecules called amilorides that can bind to hairpin-like folds in the virus s genetic material and throw a wrench in the virus s replication.To see if the same compounds could work against coronaviruses too, first they tested 23 amiloride-based molecules against another, far less deadly coronavirus responsible for many common colds. They identified three compounds that, when added to infected monkey cells, reduced the amount of virus within 24 hours of infection without causing collateral damage to their host cells. They also showed greater effects at higher doses. The researchers got similar results when they tested the molecules on cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Further work showed that the molecules stopped the virus from building up by binding to a site in the first 800 letters of the viral genome. Most of this stretch of RNA doesn t code for proteins itself but drives their production.The region folds in on itself to form multiple bulges and hairpin-like structures. Using computer modeling and a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the researchers were able to analyze these 3D RNA structures and pinpoint where the chemical compounds were binding.The researchers are still trying to figure out exactly how these compounds stop the virus from multiplying, once they re bound to its genome.When it comes to using RNA as a drug target, Hargrove says the field is still in its early stages. Part of the reason is that RNA structures are unstable. They bounce around a lot more than their protein counterparts, which makes it hard to design molecules that can interact with them in specific ways. The binding pocket that you re looking for may not even be present most of the time,  Hargrove said.What s more, 85% of the RNA in an infected cell doesn t belong to the virus, but to the ribosomes -- cellular particles made of RNA and protein -- of its human host.  There s a sea of competition,  Hargrove said.But Hargrove is hopeful. The first small-molecule drug that works by binding to non-ribosomal RNA directly, rather than proteins, was just approved by the FDA last August, to treat people with a devastating disease called spinal muscular atrophy.  So while there are lots of challenges, it s not impossible,  Hargrove said.The researchers have a patent pending on their method. They want to modify the compounds to make them more potent, and then test them in mice  to see if this could be a viable drug candidate,  Hargrove said.This isn t the first time that coronaviruses have caused an outbreak, and it likely won t be the last, the researchers say. In the last two decades, the same family of viruses was responsible for SARS, which emerged in China and spread to more than two dozen countries in 2002, and MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.The researchers determined that the loops and bulges of RNA they identified have remained essentially unchanged by evolution across related coronaviruses in bats, rats and humans, including the ones that caused the SARS and MERS outbreaks. That means their method might be able to fight more than just SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Clearly, more antivirals would be valuable weapons to have, so when the next pandemic hits we ll be better prepared. Having more drugs on hand would have another benefit: fighting resistance. Viruses mutate over time. Being able to combine drugs with different mechanisms of action would make it less likely that the virus could develop resistance to all of them simultaneously and become impossible to treat, Hargrove said. This is a new way to think about antivirals for RNA viruses,  Hargrove said.Reference: Zafferani M, Haddad C, Luo L, et al.

To be fair, they also broke the case. Experimentalists showed that zirconium-80   a zirconium atom with 40 protons and 40 neutrons in its core or nucleus   is lighter than expected, using NSCL s unparalleled ability to create rare isotopes and analyze them. Then FRIB s theorists were able to account for that missing piece using advanced nuclear models and novel statistical methods.     The interaction between nuclear theorists and experimentalists is like a coordinated dance,  said Alec Hamaker, a graduate research assistant and first author of the study the team published Nov. 25 in the journal Nature Physics.  Each take turns leading and following the other.     Sometimes theory makes predictions ahead of time, and other times experiments find things that weren t expected,  said Ryan Ringle, FRIB Laboratory senior scientist, who was in the group that made the zirconium-80 mass measurement. Ringle is also an adjunct associate professor of physics at FRIB and MSU s Department of Physics and Astronomy in the College of Natural Science.     They push each other and that results in a better understanding of the nucleus, which basically makes up everything that we interact with,  he said.     So this story is bigger than one nucleus. In a way, it s a preview of the power of FRIB, a nuclear science user facility supported by the Office of Nuclear Physics in the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.    When user operations begin next year, nuclear scientists from around the globe will have the chance to work with FRIB s technology to create rare isotopes that would be impossible to study elsewhere. They ll also have the opportunity to work with FRIB s experts to understand the results of those studies and their implications. That knowledge has a range of applications, from helping scientists make more sense of the universe to improving cancer treatments.     As we move forward into the FRIB era, we can do measurements like we ve done here and so much more,  Ringle said.  We can push further beyond. There s enough capability here to keep us learning for decades.    That said, zirconium-80 is a really interesting nucleus in its own right.    For starters, it s a tough nucleus to make, but making rare nuclei is NSCL s specialty. The facility produced enough zirconium-80 to enable Ringle, Hamaker and their colleagues to determine its mass with unprecedented precision. To do this, they used what s known as a Penning trap mass spectrometer in NSCL s Low-Energy-Beam and Ion Trap, or LEBIT, Facility. People have measured this mass before, but never this precisely,  Hamaker said.  And that revealed some interesting physics.   When we make mass measurements at this precise a level, we re actually measuring the amount of mass that s missing,  Ringle said.  The mass of a nucleus isn t just the sum of the mass of its protons and neutrons. There s missing mass that manifests as energy holding the nucleus together.     This is where one of science s most famous equations helps explain things. In Albert Einstein s E = mc2, the E stands for energy and m stands for mass (c is the symbol for the speed of light). This means that mass and energy are equivalent, although this only becomes noticeable in extreme conditions, such as those found at the core of an atom.    When a nucleus has more binding energy   meaning it s got a tighter hold of its protons and neutrons   it ll have more missing mass. That helps explain the zirconium-80 situation. Its nucleus is tightly bound, and this new measurement revealed that the binding was even stronger than expected.    This meant that FRIB s theorists had to find an explanation and they could turn to predictions from decades ago to help provide an answer. For example, theorists suspected that the zirconium-80 nucleus could be magic.    Every so often, a particular nucleus bucks its mass expectations by having a special number of protons or neutrons. Physicists refer to these as magic numbers. Theory posited that zirconium-80 had a special number of protons and neutrons, making it doubly magic.    Earlier experiments have shown that zirconium-80 is shaped more like a rugby ball or American football than a sphere. Theorists predicted that the shape could give rise to this double magicity. With the most precise measurement of zirconium-80 s mass to date, the scientists could support these ideas with solid data.     Theorists had predicted that zirconium-80 was a deformed doubly-magic nucleus over 30 years ago,  Hamaker said.  It took some time for the experimentalists to learn the dance and provide evidence for the theorists. Now that the evidence is there, the theorists can work out the next few steps in the dance.    So the dance continues and, to extend the metaphor, NSCL, FRIB, and MSU offer one of the finest ballrooms for it to play out. It boasts a one-of-a-kind facility, expert staff and the nation s top-ranked nuclear physics graduate program.   I am able to work onsite at a national user facility on topics at the forefront of nuclear science,  Hamaker said.  This experience has allowed me to develop relationships and learn from many of the lab's staff and researchers. The project was successful because of their dedication to the science and the world-leading facilities and equipment at the lab. ReferenceHamaker A, Leistenschneider E, Jain R. et al.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionated impact on older adults, with groups of people who were already marginalized feeling a far greater negative impact,  said Raina, lead principal investigator of the CLSA. Those who were socially isolated, experiencing poorer health and of lower socioeconomic status were more likely to have worsening depression as compared to their pre-pandemic depression status collected as part of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging since 2011. The research team included CLSA principal investigators Christina Wolfson of McGill University, Susan Kirkland of Dalhousie University, Lauren Griffith of McMaster, along with a national team of investigators.They used telephone and web survey data to examine how health-related factors and social determinants such as income and social participation, impacted the prevalence of depressive symptoms during the initial lockdown starting March 2020 and after re-opening following the first wave of COVID-19 in Canada.Caregiving responsibilities, separation from family, family conflict, and loneliness were associated with a greater likelihood of moderate or high levels of depressive symptoms that got worse over time.Women were also more likely to have higher odds of depressive symptoms during the pandemic compared to men, and a greater number of women reported separation from family, increased time caregiving as well as barriers to caregiving.Overall, older adults had twice the odds of depressive symptoms during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. But those with lower income and poorer health, either due to pre-existing health conditions or health concerns reported during the pandemic, experienced a greater impact. These findings suggest the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic persist and may worsen over time and underscores the need for tailored interventions to address pandemic stressors and alleviate their impact on the mental health of older adults,  Raina added.The findings mark the first published COVID-19 research emerging from the CLSA, a national research platform on aging involving more than 50,000 community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults at recruitment. The platform is funded by the Government of Canada through and Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.Reference: Raina P, Wolfson C, Griffith L, et al.

When research began to suggest otherwise, many questioned whether smoking was still to blame for adverse effects, since most vapers are either  dual users  who also smoke cigarettes or have a prior history of smoking.Now, a team of researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC has demonstrated that - independent of the effects of prior smoking   using e-cigarettes is linked to adverse biological changes that can cause disease. The study, published in Scientific Reports, revealed that vapers experience a similar pattern of changes to gene regulation as smokers do, although the changes are more extensive in people who smoke. Our study, for the first time, investigates the biological effects of vaping in adult e-cigarette users, while simultaneously accounting for their past smoking exposure,  said Ahmad Besaratinia, PhD, corresponding author and professor of research population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine. Our data indicate that vaping, much like smoking, is associated with dysregulation of mitochondrial genes and disruption of molecular pathways involved in immunity and the inflammatory response, which govern health versus disease state.

Published online in Science Translational Medicine on November 24, the study reported that a new class of compounds blocked the ability of a protein called RAGE to pass on inflammatory signals that injure the heart and kidneys in diabetes, and that slow the healing of diabetic wounds.The results revolve around the body s immune system, which recognizes and destroys invading bacteria and viruses. This system s activation causes inflammation, responses like swelling and pain that result from the homing in by immune cells into sites of infection or injury. Many diseases   including diabetes   include misplaced inflammation that damages tissues.Experiments in human cells and mouse models found that the lead study compound, RAGE229, significantly reduced short- and long-term complications of diabetes. Our results establish the molecular backbone of RAGE229 as the foundation for a new approach that targets intracellular RAGE actions to counter diabetic tissue damage,  says lead study author Ann Marie Schmidt, MD, the Dr. Iven Young Professor of Endocrinology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.  With further refinements, RAGE229 and its descendants have great potential to fill gaps in treatment, including that most current drugs work only against type 2 diabetes.

How tumours manipulate their environment to advance is one of the big questions that Peinado has been trying to answer for years. For decades  to fight tumours, researchers focused on studying their intrinsic behaviour, but not on their surroundings. Peinado is the head of the CNIO's Microenvironment & Metastasis Group, which studies the mechanisms involved in metastatic progression, including how nanoparticles called exosomes, which are released by tumours, manipulate the tumour microenvironment to favour metastasis. A paper published this week in the prestigious journal Nature Cancer describes how this critical process for melanoma progression occurs: exosomes travel and home to the sentinel lymph node -the lymph node where metastasis initially occurs- from where they remotely prepare a favourable environment -the pre-metastatic niche- for metastasis. In this study, they observed that the NGFR molecule drives this entire process and that blocking it drastically reduces metastasis in animal models. The reduction in metastasis was achieved using THX-B; this molecule is being tested for the treatment of other pathologies, which will accelerate its possible use in the treatment of tumours.The scientists also propose NGFR as a new biomarker of early melanoma metastasis to define risk groups and predict metastasis.  A higher number of NGFR-expressing metastatic cells in the sentinel lymph node correlates with a worse disease prognosis,  says Susana Garcia Silva, co-first author of the study.Unlike other skin cancers, melanoma is one of the most aggressive tumours; it can metastasise when the primary lesion is still very small. There are no early disease markers or disease prediction markers, which is why not only new treatments are important, but also early and accurate diagnoses to improve the prognosis of patients.

Experts at the University of Birmingham are calling on local and national health authorities and wildlife managers to adopt a robust approach.In a new paper, published in Frontiers in Veterinary Science, researchers in the University s College of Life and Environmental Sciences, collaborating with Wildlife Impact and other sector partners, have highlighted the issues using the example of translocated orangutans in Indonesia.All three species of orangutans in Indonesia are listed as Critically Endangered, and moving animals between habitats is a fairly common practice as demands for agriculture, mining, and other natural resource use puts pressure on the forests they inhabit. Interactions and conflict between humans and orangutans sharing the same habitats also contributes to the complex problems facing these rare species across their range.During the covid 19 pandemic, the team identified instances of orangutans being released who had been in direct contact or proximity to humans without any protective equipment. In some cases, formerly captive orangutans were released after long periods of contact and potential exposure to human diseases. The team s results suggest that there is a potential problem of pathogen transmission between humans and animals which needs to be properly understood and managed. Covid 19 threw a big spotlight on the risks of releasing captive orangutans back into the wild, or moving them between habitats, but we ve been concerned for several years about the ways in which these practices risk the transmission of pathogens such as TB from orangutans exposed to human disease into wild orangutan populations and to other wildlife species,  explained the study s co-author, Dr Steve Unwin.  While we can never eliminate all risk, our investigations showed the mitigation measures commonly used are not consistently practiced or enforced. If we don t address this deficient, we risk humans acting as a reservoir to transmit disease to endangered species which, if lost, contribute to the overall degradation of our environment. Though there has been much attention paid in both scientific and popular media to the risk of transmission of disease from wildlife to people, the risk in the other direction (from humans to wildlife) is actually much greater. The team has put together a set of recommendations that can be used by health authorities worldwide which will minimise the risk of disease transmission. This includes:  Disease risk analysis is a way to reduce the uncertainty about disease spread in populations and identify the gaps in the data,  said Dr Unwin.  While our study focused on orangutans, this approach offers workable solutions for reducing risk of disease transmission in any wild animal species. Reference: Sherman J, Unwin S, Travis DA, et al.

Researchers also identified clues to how the microbiology of the intestinal tract impacts disease-causing inflammation, suggesting that targeting the mucus interface between gut bacteria and the cells of the small intestine may be a novel means of preventing systemic inflammation. The study was published today in the Journal of Lipid Research. Inflammation is an important process that protects the body from invading infections and toxins. But in individuals who are successfully treated for HIV to the point that their viral load is no longer detectable, the continuing low-grade inflammation in the cells of the intestine contributes to the increased risk of heart attack or stroke in such people. These individuals have been found to have a leaky gut  with more gut bacterial products in their blood such as the potent pro-inflammatory bacterial product known as lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, which promotes systemic inflammation that can accelerate the disease in arteries that leads to heart attack and stroke.  UCLA researchers previously used mouse models of treated HIV to study this problem. They found that adding a tomato concentrate called Tg6F to the western diet of the mice improved their leaky gut  and significantly reduced systemic inflammation in the mice1. Tg6F contains a peptide mimetic of the main protein in HDL ( good cholesterol ). To learn more about how diet is related to inflammation, researchers led by Pallavi Mukherjee fed half a group of mice a typical western diet,  high in fat, cholesterol and calories, while the rest were fed the normal mouse diet, known as a chow diet,  which is low in fat, cholesterol and calories. The researchers examined dietary phospholipids to identity causes of the associated systemic inflammation.  Normal phospholipids do not induce inflammation, but oxidized phospholipids are known to often induce a strong inflammatory response. Researchers suspected that the high-fat western diet might contain high levels of oxidized phospholipids accounting for the ability of this diet to induce systemic inflammation. Surprisingly, they found the western diet contained very low levels of oxidized phospholipids, while the low-fat chow diet contained much higher levels of oxidized phospholipids.  Dr. Alan M. Fogelman, chair of the department of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA said, we studied the portion of the small intestine known as the jejunum, because it is very actively involved in the uptake of dietary fats.  The investigators focused on a thin mucous layer that is the interface between the bacteria in the lumen of the jejunum and the cells on the surface of the jejunum that take up the dietary components. The jejunum relies on antimicrobial peptides and proteins in this thin mucous layer to keep the bacteria in the lumen of the intestine from interacting with its cells.  In mice fed the western diet, the jejunum contained high levels of oxidized phospholipids compared to those in mice fed the chow diet. They also had low levels of antimicrobial peptides and proteins compared to mice fed the chow diet. Consistent with the decrease in levels of antimicrobial peptides and proteins, the number of bacteria and the levels of LPS increased in jejunum mucus from mice fed the western diet. The permeability of the jejunum also increased in mice fed the western diet.  The lymph draining from the jejunum of mice fed the western diet contained increased levels of LPS as did the blood of these mice. LPS is known to induce inflammation in both mice and humans, and markers of systemic inflammation were increased in the mice fed the western diet.  Researchers hypothesized that the western diet-mediated changes were due to the formation of oxidized phospholipids in the jejunum. To test this hypothesis, they added oxidized phospholipids to segments of jejunum taken from mice on the chow diet. This reproduced the changes in gene expression seen in the jejunum of mice fed the western diet, which would account for the decrease in antimicrobial peptides and proteins on this diet.  The investigators found adding Tg6F to the western diet reduced the levels of oxidized phospholipids in jejunum mucus. Additionally, it prevented the decrease in antimicrobial peptides and proteins, prevented the increase in bacteria and LPS in jejunum mucus, prevented the increase in jejunum permeability, and reduced LPS in lymph and blood, which reduced markers of systemic inflammation. The authors say their findings suggest that targeting the mucus interface between the bacteria and the cells of the small intestine with peptide mimetics of the main protein in HDL may be a way of preventing systemic inflammation.

The most recent example of this variation has been seen during the COVID-19 pandemic; while some infected patients present as asymptomatic, others develop severe forms of the disease. But why does this variation occur?Scientists are working to uncover the molecular mechanisms that underpin differences in our immune response. In research focusing specifically on SARS-CoV-2, evidence has emerged that suggests genetic traits, inherited from our ancestors, could offer protection or increase disease susceptibility. A new body of work by researchers at the University of Chicago has focused on quantifying variations in the human immune response to influenza infection, using a method known as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This is a form of next-generation sequencing that is used to profile gene expression at the individual cell level. It can be utilized to explore changes in gene expression under certain conditions, such as before and after cells are infected by a pathogen.  The researchers have applied scRNA-seq to blood samples derived from individuals with both European and African ancestry. In a laboratory environment, the cells were infected with influenza A virus, and sequenced. The results, published in Science, show that there is a significant amount of variation in gene expression levels between individuals of European and African ancestry.Technology Networks spoke with Dr. Luis Barreiro, principal investigator of the Barreiro lab at the University of Chicago and corresponding author of the study, to learn more about the rationale behind the research and the key findings. Barreiro also discussed the potential clinical implications of the research results, and the team's next steps in this field of work.Molly Campbell (MC): For our readers that may be unfamiliar, can you explain why viruses are amongst the strongest sources of selection pressure in human evolution?Luis Barreiro (LB): Viruses are known to evolve very rapidly in response to the immune defences mounted by the host. Each time a new virus emerges, or finds ways to escape our immune system, our immune system has to adapt to those changes. This leads to a constant process of adaptation and counter-adaptation over evolutionary time.MC: Why were widespread pandemics previously rare?LB: Because our ability to travel long distances in the past was much reduced as compared to what is possible now. In current societies, a new pandemic pathogen can spread throughout the globe in a matter of days, just by air travel (as is what happened with SARS-CoV-2).MC: What was the rationale behind your study?LB: We know that viruses have been a very strong source of selection pressure on the human genome. Thus, we hypothesized that variation in viral-mediated selection pressures between different human populations may have driven divergence of immune responses among modern-day human populations. Supporting that view, we know that the incidence and severity of several infectious diseases varies significantly across ancestry groups. We designed a study that would allow us to formally compare the immune response to a viral infection across individuals with different degrees of European and African ancestry.MC: To quantify variation in the response to influenza, your team adopted scRNA-seq of blood cells infected with influenza A. First, can you discuss why you used scRNA-seq, and second, can you please discuss the sample in further detail?LB: We used scRNA-seq as a means to  study how specific immune cell types within the mixed pool of immune cells respond to the virus. In contrast to bulk (traditional) RNA-seq, scRNA-seq allows us to evaluate how individual cells are transcriptionally altered in response to the virus, without having to sort the cells. This preserves the critical interactions observed in vivo between the many different cell types involved in an efficient immune response to influenza A.MC: What were your overall findings?LB: We found thousands of genes for which gene expression levels in response to influenza A infection varied significantly between individuals of European and African ancestry, suggesting that ancestry effects are pervasive. The most striking ancestry-linked differences were observed for the type I interferon response. Specifically, we found that individuals with a higher proportion of European ancestry showed an increase in type I interferon pathway activity during early influenza infection. This increased pathway activation was correlated with a greater capacity to limit viral replication at a later time point, suggesting that the differences observed may have a direct impact on the body s ability to control the virus. Finally, our results show that genes differentially expressed by genetic ancestry are enriched among genes associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Thus, our findings suggest that immune response variation may therefore interact with, or exacerbate, environmentally driven health disparities in viral susceptibility and morbidity, which occur for both influenza and COVID-19.MC: The study identified an outlier to the pattern of genetic ancestry's effect on immune response being cell-type specific. This was in the interferon (IFN) response. Can you discuss the clinical implications of this finding?LB: Interferons are proteins that are critical in the defence against viruses. In a response to a viral infection, interferons are quickly secreted, and they activate a host of different antiviral defences that ultimately interfere with viral replication. Thus, given the central role played by interferons in conferring antiviral activity to host cells, our findings have potential clinical implications not only for influenza infection, but also for other viruses. This includes SARS-CoV-2, for which the timing and magnitude of IFN-mediated antiviral responses are associated with disease progression and severity.MC: Are there any limitations to this work that you wish to highlight?LB: There are two main limitations to our study. First, it is based on in vitro models of infection, and therefore future studies are needed to evaluate if the identified ancestry-linked effects on innate immunity ultimately impact viral clearance and disease severity over the course of viral infections in vivo.Second, although we observed many genes for which gene expression levels correlate with genetic ancestry, these results are not evidence for genetic differences in disease susceptibility. Genetic ancestry also correlates with environmental differences. A lot of what we re capturing is likely to be the result of other disparities in our society, such as systemic racism and healthcare inequities. Although some of the differences we show in the paper can be linked to specific genetic variation   showing that genetics does play an important role   these genetic differences are not enough to fully explain all the differences that we observed, notably with respect to the interferon response.MC: What are your next research steps?LB: We are currently expanding this line of research to study ancestry differences in immune responses among COVID-19 patients. We are also expanding our study to a broader arrays of ancestry groups.Luis Barreiro was speaking to Molly Campbell, Science Writer for Technology Networks.Reference: Randolph H, Fiee J, Thielen B et al.

One in five U.S. adults will experience a mental illness in their lifetime, according to the National Alliance of Mental Health. But standard treatments can be slow to work and cause side effects.To find better solutions, a Virginia Tech researcher has joined a renaissance of research on a long-banned class of drugs that could combat several forms of mental illness and, in mice, have achieved long-lasting results from just one dose.Using a process his lab developed in 2015, Chang Lu, the Fred W. Bull Professor of Chemical Engineering in the College of Engineering, is helping his Virginia Commonwealth University collaborators study the epigenomic effects of psychedelics. Their findings give insight into how psychedelic substances like psilocybin, mescaline, LSD, and similar drugs may relieve symptoms of addiction, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The drugs appear to work faster and last longer than current medications   all with fewer side effects.The project hinged on Lu s genomic analysis. His process allows researchers to use very small samples of tissue, down to hundreds to thousands of cells, and draw meaningful conclusions from them. Older processes require much larger sample sizes, so Lu s approach enables the studies using just a small quantity of material from a specific region of a mouse brain.And looking at the effects of psychedelics on brain tissues is especially important.Researchers can do human clinical trials with the substances, taking blood and urine samples and observing behaviors, Lu said.  But the thing is, the behavioral data will tell you the result, but it doesn t tell you why it works in a certain way,  he said.But looking at molecular changes in animal models, such as the brains of mice, allows scientists to peer into what Lu calls the black box of neuroscience to understand the biological processes at work. While the brains of mice are very different from human brains, Lu said there are enough similarities to make valid comparisons between the two.VCU pharmacologist Javier Gonz lez-Maeso has made a career of studying psychedelics, which had been banned after recreational use of the drugs was popularized in the 1960s. But in recent years, regulators have begun allowing research on the drugs to proceed.In work by other researchers, primarily on psilocybin, a substance found in more than 200 species of fungi, Gonz lez-Maeso said psychedelics have shown promise in alleviating major depression and anxiety disorders.  They induce profound effects in perception,  he said.  But I was interested in how these drugs actually induce behavioral effects in mice. To explore the genomic basis of those effects, he teamed up with Lu.In the joint Virginia Tech - VCU study, Gonz lez-Maeso s team used 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, or DOI, a drug similar to LSD, administering it to mice that had been trained to fear certain triggers. Lu s lab then analyzed brain samples for changes in the epigenome and the gene expression. They discovered that the epigenomic variations were generally more long-lasting than the changes in gene expression, thus more likely to link with the long-term effects of a psychedelic.After one dose of DOI, the mice that had reacted to fear triggers no longer responded to them with anxious behaviors. Their brains also showed effects, even after the substance was no longer detectable in the tissues, Lu said. The findings were published in the October issue of Cell Reports. It s a hopeful development for those who suffer from mental illness and the people who love them. In fact, it wasn t just the science that drew Lu to the project. For him, it s also personal.""My older brother has had schizophrenia for the last 30 years, basically. So I've always been intrigued by mental health,  Lu said.  And then once I found that our approach can be applied to look at processes like that   that's why I decided to do research in the field of brain neuroscience.""Gonz lez-Maeso said research on psychedelics is still in its early stages, and there s much work to be done before treatments derived from them could be widely available.Reference: Revenga M de la F, Zhu B, Guevara CA, et al.

Researchers are working to find effective vaccines and therapies, as well as understand the long-term effects of the infection.While the vaccines have been critical in pandemic control, researchers are still learning how and how well they work. This is especially true with the emergence of new viral variants and the rare vaccine side effects like allergic reactions, heart inflammation (myocarditis) and blood-clotting (thrombosis).Critical questions about the infection itself also remain. Approximately one in four COVID-19 patients have lingering symptoms, even after recovering from the virus. These symptoms, known as long COVID,  and the vaccines  off-target side effects are thought to be due to a patient s immune response.In an article published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, the UC Davis Vice Chair of Research and Distinguished Professor of Dermatology and Internal Medicine William Murphy and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School Dan Longo present a possible explanation to the diverse immune responses to the virus and the vaccines.When SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, enters the body, its spike protein binds with the ACE2 receptor, gaining entry to the cell. The immune system responds by producing protective antibodies that bind to the invading virus, blocking or neutralizing its effects.As a form of down-regulation, these protective antibodies can also cause immune responses with anti-idiotype antibodies. Over time, these anti-idiotype responses can clear the initial protective antibodies and potentially result in limited efficacy of antibody-based therapies. A fascinating aspect of the newly formed anti-idiotype antibodies is that some of their structures can be a mirror image of the original antigen and act like it in binding to the same receptors that the viral antigen binds. This binding can potentially lead to unwanted actions and pathology, particularly in the long term,  Murphy said.The authors suggest that the anti-idiotype antibodies can potentially target the same ACE2 receptors. In blocking or triggering these receptors, they could affect various normal ACE2 functions. Given the critical functions and wide distribution of ACE2 receptors on numerous cell types, it would be important to determine if these regulatory immune responses could be responsible for some of the off-target or long-lasting effects being reported,  Murphy commented.  These responses may also explain why such long-term effects can occur long after the viral infection has passed. As for COVID-19 vaccines, the primary antigen used is the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. According to Murphy and Longo, current research studies on antibody responses to these vaccines mainly focus on the initial protective responses and virus-neutralizing efficacy, rather than other long-term aspects. With the incredible impact of the pandemic and our reliance on vaccines as our primary weapon, there is an immense need for more basic science research to understand the complex immunological pathways at play. This need follows to what it takes to keep the protective responses going, as well as to the potential unwanted side effects of both the infection and the different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types, especially as boosting is now applied,  Murphy said.  The good news is that these are testable questions that can be partially addressed in the laboratory, and in fact, have been used with other viral models. Reference: Murphy WJ, Longo DL.

For this latest study, scientists wanted to establish what effect a single three-minute exposure would have, while also using much lower energy levels than their previous studies. Furthermore, building on separate UCL research in flies** that found mitochondria display  shifting workloads  depending on the time of day, the team compared morning exposure to afternoon exposure.In summary, researchers found there was, on average, a 17% improvement in participants  colour contrast vision when exposed to three minutes of 670 nanometre (long wavelength) deep red light in the morning and the effects of this single exposure lasted for at least a week. However, when the same test was conducted in the afternoon, no improvement was seen.Scientists say the benefits of deep red light, highlighted by the findings, mark a breakthrough for eye health and should lead to affordable home-based eye therapies, helping the millions of people globally with naturally declining vision.Lead author, Professor Glen Jeffery (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology), said:  We demonstrate that one single exposure to long wave deep red light in the morning can significantly improve declining vision, which is a major health and wellbeing issue, affecting millions of people globally. This simple intervention applied at the population level would significantly impact on quality of life as people age and would likely result in reduced social costs that arise from problems associated with reduced vision.

In part due to historical misuse and cinematic portrayals such as in One flew over the cuckoo s nest, physicians and patients have been reluctant to use this approach. But extensive evidence appears to show that ECT may be one of the most valuable and effective options for severe and treatment-resistant mental conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. This latest study of more than 3,100 ECT sessions in a German psychiatric hospital appears to confirm that ECT is also very safe. There were no cases of permanent impairments from the treatment and only three sessions (<0.1%) caused potentially life-threatening events, which were all resolved by medical interventions. Our research provides evidence that the negative attitude toward ECT    one of the most effective treatments for psychiatric disease    urgently needs to be corrected,  said corresponding author Prof G ran Hajak from the Social Foundation in Bamberg, Germany.

Damage to the mammillothalamic tract (MTT) an important connection for this hub can cause memory loss in patients suffering a stroke, which is currently considered irreversible. In their new study available in the journal Current Research in Neurobiology, published by Elsevier, researchers from the Universities of Canterbury and Otago, in New Zealand, and the University of Oxford, in the UK, now show that stimulation of the anterior thalamus increases memory-related brain activity and restores memory function in rats with MTT lesions. Their findings suggest that therapies involving targeted stimulation of the anterior thalamus could help with memory restoration in patients with brain injury.Prof. John C. Dalrymple-Alford, a world-renowned expert in anterior thalamus research and the lead investigator of the study, explains:  The ultimate goal of many neuroscientists, including our team, is restoring  lost  functions of the brain, one of which is memory. Memory loss can be caused by damage to one or more key points in a distributed memory system. Such damage occurs in several neurological conditions acute brain injury, such as that caused by a stroke, and in dementia and affects the quality of life of patients. Given how complex the brain is, we are yet to fully understand whether memory impairments are caused by irreversible tissue loss, or by dysfunctions in the wider brain network. Through this study, we wanted to shed light on the latter and understand whether lost memory function, seemingly gone forever, could be retrieved. To test their hypothesis, Prof. Dalrymple-Alford s team first simulated memory loss in rats by inducing MTT lesions in these animals, given the link between damage to the MTT and memory loss in humans. Subsequently, they tested the effects of these lesions on spatial memory information required to remember different places using a radial arm maze (RAM) test. Their observations suggested that the MTT lesions affected the rats  ability to locate food pellets in the RAM, indicating poor working memory and the development of an amnesia-like syndrome.Next, the researchers tested whether working memory could be restored in the rats with MTT lesions. Based on previous evidence of the involvement of the anterior thalamus in supporting memory and the strong link between the anterior thalamus and the MTT, they asked whether the stimulation of the anterior thalamus could aid better memory function. Using optogenetics, a light-based technique that allows the activation of specific neurons, they stimulated anterior thalamus neurons in rats with MTT lesions and then tested their performance on the RAM test. A regular pattern of stimulation substantially improved spatial working memory in these rats, albeit temporarily, and also improved the electrical rhythmicity in the memory system. Moreover, such activation also increased the expression of the protein Zif268 an indicator of neural activity across the memory system. Interestingly, stimulation based on activity in the hippocampus, which has long been considered the seat of spatial memory, yielded no memory-enhancing effects in rats with MTT lesions.This study is the first to demonstrate that memory improvements are possible even after debilitating permanent damage to the MTT. Together, the findings challenge previous notions that memory recovery is primarily dependent on structures like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. More importantly, the study provides the first clear piece of evidence on the role of increased neuronal activity within the anterior thalamus in supporting memory. It indicates that the anterior thalamus is not simply a communication structure, rather, it plays an active role in influencing memory and cognition. The findings demonstrate that the stimulation of anterior thalamus neurons could help in countering clinical amnesia associated with impairments in pathways involving this region, not just in patients with brain injury and stroke but also in those with other neurological conditions like Alzheimer s disease and schizophrenia.Prof. Dalrymple-Alford observes:  So far, the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex have remained the focus areas for memory-related therapies. Our study shows that structures outside these areas, such as the anterior thalamus, could instead hold the key for such treatments. It is important to remember that such stimulation does not affect the content of the memory; instead, it appears to enhance the functionality of the brain s memory system. This could minimize brain impairments and allow patients to live a normal life. While the model we used in our study is typically observed in adult patients, similar injuries could be involved in childhood amnesia. The applications of our findings could have an even greater impact in these patients. Indeed, the findings of Prof. Dalrymple-Alford and his team represent an important breakthrough in our understanding of memory systems. In combination with parallel developments in areas such as remote brain stimulation, they could revolutionize therapies for memory defects and how the field at large views defective memory function.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Most prior work on the effects of sleep on mRNAs have focused on transcripts in the neuronal cytosol. However, Drs. Aton and Delorme found that after learning, major changes in RNAs are instead present  almost exclusively  on ribosomes associated with neuronal cell membranes. These results have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in November 30, 2021.The team first applied a commonly used biochemical method that homogenizes and centrifuges the hippocampal tissue, to separate the cytosol (the aqueous component of the cytoplasm of acell within which smaller organelles and particles are suspended) from other cellular components that are usually considered  debris  (endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, cell membrane, etc.). In this study, the authors found that RNA associated with ribosomes in the cytosol varied depending on whether the animals slept or not, confirming prior transcriptomic studies. However, cytosolic ribosomes showed almost no RNA changes depending on prior learning. If we had just stopped there, we wouldn t have found anything that was novel or insightful. We strongly felt that we had to rethink our methodology,  explained Aton. Since it is well known that the endoplasmic reticulum is covered with ribosomes, the machinery that converts RNAs into proteins, Delorme and Aton decided to sequence the RNAs in the other parts of the cell, the  debris,  outside of the cytosol. It is in the less-well-studied membrane-containing cell fraction that they found that many transcripts were affected as a function of prior learning.These modified transcripts also differed significantly whether the animals had been allowed to sleep following the learning   allowing a new memory to be stored   or if they had been sleep-deprived. These unexpected results open the door to many more investigations. By looking in those other areas of the cell, we now have the capacity to generate many new hypotheses about what happens at the molecular level when memories are consolidated, and when consolidation is interrupted due to sleep deprivation,  said Aton.For example, in the animals that slept following learning, Aton and Delorme observed an increase in the abundance of transcripts that encode components of protein synthesis machinery in the membrane fraction of hippocampal neurons. One hypothesis would be to test whether there is indeed an increase in protein production by membrane-associated ribosomes after post-learning sleep.In addition to mRNAs, the authors also found that learning led to changes in long non-coding RNAs  association with neuronal membrane-bound ribosomes. These could play a role in regulating the translation of other transcripts, which should be investigated.  The cells have developed very elegant mechanisms to fine tune the process from transcription to translation, and long non-coding RNAs could be one of them in this part of the brain,  said Aton.She further explained by comparing neurons to a large warehouse, with complex logistics that are needed to respond quickly to needs for new proteins in distant cell processes, requiring preparedness and distribution adaptation processes. Neurons have to deliver the  package  within a reasonable time frame, when it s needed, no matter how far away that location is. Neurons have evolved to do this, and it is a huge biological question to investigate. It is important to understand how this biology works because   in addition to storing new memories   it impacts regeneration, degeneration, and neurological diseases,  concluded Aton.This is the second PNAS publication from the Delorme-Aton team s research. In their first article (see press release), the team found, in sleep-deprived mice, an inhibitory gating mechanism that could disrupt hippocampal activity and memory consolidation. In contrast, post-learning sleep suppressed the activity of inhibitory interneurons, increased activity among surrounding hippocampal neurons, and improved memory storage.References: Delorme J, Wang L, Kodoth V, et al.

But to understand what parts of a cell can go wrong in a disease, scientists first need to have a complete list of parts. By combining microscopy, biochemistry techniques and artificial intelligence, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and collaborators have taken what they think may turn out to be a significant leap forward in the understanding of human cells. The technique, known as Multi-Scale Integrated Cell (MuSIC), is described November 24, 2021 in Nature. If you imagine a cell, you probably picture the colorful diagram in your cell biology textbook, with mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus. But is that the whole story? Definitely not,  said Trey Ideker, PhD, professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center.  Scientists have long realized there s more that we don t know than we know, but now we finally have a way to look deeper.  Ideker led the study with Emma Lundberg, PhD, of KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden and Stanford University.In the pilot study, MuSIC revealed approximately 70 components contained within a human kidney cell line, half of which had never been seen before. In one example, the researchers spotted a group of proteins forming an unfamiliar structure. Working with UC San Diego colleague Gene Yeo, PhD, they eventually determined the structure to be a new complex of proteins that binds RNA. The complex is likely involved in splicing, an important cellular event that enables the translation of genes to proteins, and helps determine which genes are activated at which times. The insides of cells   and the many proteins found there   are typically studied using one of two techniques: microscope imaging or biophysical association. With imaging, researchers add florescent tags of various colors to proteins of interest and track their movements and associations across the microscope s field of view. To look at biophysical associations, researchers might use an antibody specific to a protein to pull it out of the cell and see what else is attached to it. The team has been interested in mapping the inner workings of cells for many years. What s different about MuSIC is the use of deep learning to map the cell directly from cellular microscopy images.  The combination of these technologies is unique and powerful because it s the first time measurements at vastly different scales have been brought together,  said study first author Yue Qin, a Bioinformatics and Systems Biology graduate student in Ideker s lab.Microscopes allow scientists to see down to the level of a single micron, about the size of some organelles, such as mitochondria. Smaller elements, such as individual proteins and protein complexes, can t be seen through a microscope. Biochemistry techniques, which start with a single protein, allow scientists to get down to the nanometer scale. (A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, or 1,000 microns.) But how do you bridge that gap from nanometer to micron scale? That has long been a big hurdle in the biological sciences,  said Ideker, who is also founder of the UC Cancer Cell Map Initiative and the UC San Diego Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.  Turns out you can do it with artificial intelligence   looking at data from multiple sources and asking the system to assemble it into a model of a cell.  The team trained the MuSIC artificial intelligence platform to look at all the data and construct a model of the cell. The system doesn t yet map the cell contents to specific locations, like a textbook diagram, in part because their locations aren t necessarily fixed. Instead, component locations are fluid and change depending on cell type and situation. Ideker noted this was a pilot study to test MuSIC. They ve only looked at 661 proteins and one cell type.  The clear next step is to blow through the entire human cell,  Ideker said,  and then move to different cell types, people and species. Eventually we might be able to better understand the molecular basis of many diseases by comparing what s different between healthy and diseased cells.

The study, entitled  False Memories in Native and Foreign Languages , has been published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.Say, for example, you are in another country on holiday and happen to witness a shop being robbed. The next day, you give a witness statement to the police. Could you be affected by false memories when recounting the event in a foreign language?When dealing with witnesses, police detectives are aware of the fact that people s memories of events can be inconsistent. New information and insight can alter one s recollections, resulting in what is known as false memories.One might suppose that people are less susceptible to forming false memories when examining information in a foreign language, as it requires more cognitive effort. The team of researchers from HSE University decided to conduct an online experiment to investigate how exactly false memories are formed in such circumstances.Each of the 56 participants of the study was a native Russian speaker with an intermediate or higher level of English. They were shown a brief clip of someone stealing from a car, then asked to complete a four-minute arithmetic exercise to divert their attention. The subjects then read accounts of the theft by two  witnesses,  one describing the event in Russian, the other in English. Both texts contained false information.After watching the video and reading the two texts, the subjects were asked to answer a number of questions in Russian about whether a certain event occurred in the original video, and whether it was mentioned in either of the two texts. The subjects were also asked to rate how confident they were in their answers.This was used to determine the influence of the misinformation effect the degree to which false information obtained after watching the video distorted the subjects  recollections of the original event. The researchers also assessed the source misattribution effect, which concerns how frequently the subjects mixed up whether a certain fact originated in the English or Russian text.The researchers found that overall, the misinformation effect was equal for the Russian and English texts in other words, that the false information contained in both texts had an equal impact on the subjects  recollections. What s more, the subjects frequently misattributed information from the English text to its Russian counterpart.The results suggest that information processing in people who speak two languages may differ depending on the language the information is presented in.Aleksandra Dolgoarshinnaia, one of the authors of the article and Research Assistant at the Centre for Cognition & Decision Making at HSE University: Despite the fact that language did not have the expected impact on the degree of the misinformation effect, the results suggest that information processing in bilingual people may differ depending on the language the information is received from. Such differences could cause certain memory errors (such as the source misattribution effect), but not others (such as the misinformation effect). Furthermore, these processes may differ even in bilingual people depending on their level of second language proficiency. We observed that subjects with a more advanced command of English more frequently accepted false information obtained from English sources to be true. That said, these preliminary results require further testing. The results contribute to a greater understanding of information processing and memory function in bilingual people. The number of people in the world who speak two and more languages continues to grow, but much remains unknown about the effects of being bilingual on cognitive functions and their possible consequences. For example, memory errors can lead to wrongful convictions in legal proceedings. Learning more about how and when such errors occur could help improve the legal process and refine approaches to dealing with bilingual witnesses in order to minimize occurrences of false testimony.Reference:  This article has been republished from the following materials.

And for centuries, scientists have been trying to identify the active substances in these plants in order to use them in modern-day medicine.Now researchers from the University of Copenhagen have studied an Australian desert plant and found a substance that appears to counteract resistance to a specific type of chemotherapy. Cancer cells sometimes develop an ability to fight the medicine, chemotherapy, used to treat patients. We have found a substance in a plant that appears to inhibit cancer cells  ability to defend themselves against chemotherapy, i.e., build resistance to chemotherapy. The plant is only found in Australia and has traditionally been used by the Aboriginal people,  says PhD Students Malene J. Petersen from the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology.The natural substance isolated by the researchers is a so-called flavonoid. In the laboratory, they tested the substance on human cancer cells in combination with SN-38, which is the active substance of the drug Irinotecan that is used to fight e.g., aggressive lung cancer and colon cancer. The results showed that a combination of the natural substance and chemotherapy was able to inhibit the cancer cells  ability to fight the medicine. Cancer cells resistant to SN-38 produce a large amount of a protein responsible for transporting the medicine out of the cancer cell again, a so-called efflux pump. This natural substance isolated from the Australian plant is able to inhibit this pump, which makes it difficult for the cancer cell to remove the medicine effectively,  explains Professor Dan St rk, who supervised the project.The plant from the new study belongs to the Eremophila genus, comprising around 230 species, which are only found in the Australian deserts. The name Eremophila aptly means desert loving. An impressive collaboration across continents has made this research project possible. We have received help from a retired Australian botanist, who drove 55,000 kilometres through dry West Australia to collect plants. And a colleague at the University of Melbourne has helped us perform DNA analyses of the plans to help us predict which plants were worth studying. Finally, colleagues at the University of Copenhagen have explored the potential of producing bioactive substances sustainably in the future using synthesis biology,  says Dan St rk. 70 percent of all cancer drugs comes directly from nature or is inspired by substances found in nature. Hence, the new discovery does not surprise the researchers behind the study.  The idea is to take traditional medicine knowledge, which has been passed on from generation to generation through thousands of years, and use advanced technology to determine which substances are active and which genes in the plants that code for the production of these active substance. Nine out of ten cancer deaths are a result of resistance to the cancer medicine. When a cancer patient fails to respond to the treatment or experiences a so-called relapse following treatment, it is most often because the cancer cells have learned to defend themselves against the medicine by producing a large number of efflux pumps. We already have products that inhibit the efflux pump. But they do not work optimally, because they are not specific enough and can have lots of side effects. We also believe we can find compounds that work even better than the substance we have discovered here. That is why we will now start to look for similar substances in other plants,  says Professor Dan St rk. Interestingly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for example, appear to produce large amounts of almost identical efflux pumps, which has made them extremely good at pumping the antibiotics out of the cells. This natural substance, the flavonoid, targets this specific pump protein, which make us speculate whether it may play a role in treatment of antibiotic resistance too,  says Malene J. Petersen. The chemicals used to produce the majority of modern-day drugs are made from fossil fuels. Therefore, interest in nature s own active substances is increasing steadily. The US Food and Drug Administration still approves lots of natural products or analogues hereof as medicine. The latter are synthetic substances which are almost identical to the natural substance. The idea is to take traditional medicine knowledge, which has been passed on from generation to generation through thousands of years, and use advanced technology to determine which substances are active and which genes in the plants that code for the production of these active substances. In the long term, this will enable us to produce future drugs sustainably via synthetic biology,  Professor Dan St rk explains.Reference: Petersen MJ, Lund XL, Semple SJ, et al.

Therefore, in a process called air stripping, it is removed from wastewater and later used as a fertilizer or fuel. Air stripping converts ammonia into a gas, that can then escape the wastewater from its surface. But this process is not efficient: it is energy-intensive, and requires specific temperatures, air supply, and a lot of chemicals, making it expensive.Addressing these drawbacks, in a study published in Water Research (made available online on August 5, 2021 and published in Volume 203 of the journal on September 15, 2021), researchers from South Korea have demonstrated that the simple application of an electric field during air stripping can substantially improve the efficiency of ammonia removal, even under sub-optimal conditions.  So far, the removal of ammonia from wastewater was thought to be dependent on only pH, temperature, and air supply. However, we have shown that an electrical field can also act as a modulator of this process,  says Prof. Young-Chae Song, the lead investigator on this study.Prof. Song and his team used a combination of live experiments with an ammonia stripping tank and deep learning to understand how electric fields of different strengths influence the efficiency of ammonia removal from wastewater. They found that electric fields with an alternating current of 50 MHz and a power of 15 V/cm significantly improves the ammonia removal efficiency, increasing it from 51% to 94%, even under sub-optimal conditions. Therefore, improved ammonia yields could be achieved while considerably reducing the consumption of energy and chemicals.Prof. Song comments,  Our simulations showed that electric field application provides a similar efficiency of ammonia removal to conventional methods at a much lower temperature, air supply, and pH. Moreover, the energy needed to power the electric field is a minute fraction of the energy required to achieve these  optimal  conditions. Indeed, this new electric field-coupled platform could provide a more economical way of stripping ammonia from wastewater and reducing the carbon footprint associated with this process.Reference: Song YC, Woo JH, Oh GG, Kim DH, Lee CY, Kim HW.

Having accomplished that, it was time to put the microscope to work.   We knew we had to do something useful,  said Cocker, Jerry Cowen Endowed Chair in Experimental Physics in the College of Natural Science s Department of Physics and Astronomy.  We ve got the nicest microscope in the country. We should use this to our advantage.    With its microscope, Cocker s team is using light and electrons to study materials with an unparalleled intimacy and resolution. The researchers can see atoms and measure quantum features within samples that could become the building blocks of quantum computers and next-generation solar cells.    The team has given the world the first glimpse of those capabilities on Nov. 23 in the journal Nature Communications, taking snapshots of how electrons are distributed in what are known as graphene nanoribbons.     This is one of the first demonstrations that this type of microscope can tell you something new,  Cocker said.  We re very excited and proud of the work. We also have all these ideas in our heads about where we want to go with it.   Cocker s team is part of a collaboration that s working to develop these nanoribbons into qubits, pronounced  q-bits,  for quantum computers. The collaboration spans five institutions and the work is supported by a grant from the Office of Naval Research that will provide more than $1 million to MSU s contribution.  For the Nature Communications study, Cocker teamed up with the research group of Roman Fasel, a professor at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. Fasel invented what s known as the bottom-up growth method for graphene nanoribbons. Fasel s lab has synthesized molecules that, with the addition of heat, can build themselves into ribbons with a predetermined shape and size. You essentially bake the molecules like a cake,  Cocker said.  Then the properties of the ribbon you end up with are predefined. You know what you re getting before you start. The Swiss lab sent the molecules to MSU, where Cocker s lab grew the precision ribbons and then examined them with its microscope. The basis for the instrument is what s known as a scanning tunneling microscope, or STM, that brings a very sharp tip or probe extremely close to the specimen being studied without touching it. Even though the tip and sample aren t in contact, electrons can still jump or tunnel from the tip to the sample. By recording how the electrons tunnel   for example, how many electrons tunnel and how quickly   the microscope builds high-resolution images of the sample and its properties.What Cocker and his team have done is couple this conventional STM with extremely short pulses of laser light, which lets them bring the STM s tip even closer to the sample. As a result, they re able to extract more detailed information from a sample than ever before. It s almost like we re zooming in by physically bringing the tip closer,  he said.The team could then characterize different nanoribbons with atomic resolution, revealing unprecedentedly clear information about how electrons are distributed within the structure.In addition to a publication, this work also has earned awards for its Spartan authors. Postdoctoral scholar Vedran Jelic won an award for his poster about the research at a recent workshop in Germany. Graduate student researcher Spencer Ammerman won an award for presenting the work last November at a conference hosted by the Infrared, Millimeter and Terahertz Wave Society, which also awarded Cocker its 2021 Young Scientist Award. As excited as Cocker and his team are about the new paper and these accolades, they re looking forward to what s next. For example, the team is working on going from still images to movies of samples, showing how electrons move within the ribbons as the nanomaterial absorbs light.The researchers are also building a second microscope with support from a Department of Defense grant awarded in June, meaning the only two microscopes like this in the U.S. will both be at MSU. This paper is very exciting, but it s also just the first step,  Cocker said.  We think it s going to open up a lot of possibilities. ReferenceAmmerman SE, Jelic V, Wei Y, et al.

Mtb prevents the phagosome from merging with a lysosome, which otherwise would kill the bacteria. Instead, Mtb safely grows inside the phagosomes, then breaks out of the phagosomes into the cytosol of the macrophage, and it uses the TNT toxin to kill the macrophage by necroptosis, releasing the bacteria to infect other cells.Exotoxin export from Mtb or similar bacteria face two barriers   first, the toxin protein needs to be transported across the bacteria s cytoplasmic membrane, and then, it needs to be transported across the bacteria s outer membrane. To do this, bacteria employ a wide variety of specialized secretion systems   essentially molecular machines that recognize and transport the bacterial toxins or other proteins involved in a variety of bacterial functions, such as adherence or scavenging.Toxin secretion mechanisms have been described in almost all major bacterial pathogens, but there has been one notable exception   Mtb.Now, Niederweis, David Pajuelo, Ph.D., Uday Tak, Ph.D., Lei Zhang, Ph.D., UAB Department of Microbiology, have used a comprehensive genetic analysis to learn which of the five type VII secretion systems in Mtb is used for TNT secretion. They also discovered which three secretion systems are essential, acting in concert, to permeabilize the phagosome membrane. That sieve-like damage allows TNT to enter the macrophage cytosol, where it depletes NAD+ to induce necroptotic death.The five type VII secretion systems in Mtb are known as ESX-1, ESX-2, ESX-3, ESX-4 and ESX-5. Each of these secretion systems is a complex of between seven and more than 15 proteins that form the molecular machinery. Up to now, no roles were known for ESX-2 and ESX-4.TNT begins its journey as a part of a larger protein, CpnT. Only when CpnT reaches the outer membrane does the toxic TNT break away from the larger protein. Niederweis and colleagues found that both export to the cell surface and secretion of CpnT/TNT into the cytosol of macrophages infected with Mtb require the ESX-4 system. This is the first known molecular function for the ESX-4 system in Mtb.While it was known that ESX-1 participates in permeabilizing the phagosome membrane, the UAB researchers surprisingly found that ESX-2 and ESX-4 are also required to act in concert with ESX-1 to rupture the phagosomal membrane and enable trafficking of TNT into the cytosol of Mtb-infected macrophages. Thus, our study identifies not only the system required for the secretion of the only known exotoxin of Mtb,  said Niederweis,  but also establishes new molecular roles for the two previously uncharacterized type VII secretion systems, ESX-2 and ESX-4, in phagosomal rupture, a critical step in Mtb pathogenesis. In the Nature Communications paper, the researchers also propose a model for TNT production, export, secretion and trafficking by Mtb, and they point out the steps of this process that are still unclear. The paradigm-changing discovery that both the ESX-2 and ESX-4 systems need to act in concert with the ESX-1 system to permeabilize the phagosomal membrane raises important questions regarding the molecular mechanism of this process and the regulation of these activities,  Niederweis said.  This study presents a major advancement in our understanding of protein secretion and trafficking by Mtb and will certainly stimulate further research in these important areas of Mtb biology.

This painting technique, which has been practiced since Antiquity, is characterised by pigments applied in a water-based binding-medium, often egg-yolk. In order to understand the properties and appeal of this mixture on a molecular scale, a CNRS team, from Sorbonne Universit  and ESPCl1,reproduced 15th century recipes that a Tuscan painter Cennino Cennini had consigned to paper, using egg-yolk and a clay-based pigment, green earth (terra verde). This combination was used on a large scale in works dating from the Middle Ages, as a base-layer for gilding and the rendering of flesh. By measuring its flow properties and characterising its molecular organisation, the team has shown the formation of a network between the proteins of the egg-yolk, the water molecules and the clay particles of the pigment renders the mixture more viscoelastic. Thanks to this synergy between the yolk of egg and the pigment, the spreading and covering properties of the paint are enhanced due to a better internal cohesion of the pigments in the presence of the binder. This study at the very boundary of materials science and art history, published on the 24 November 2021 in the journal Angewandte Chemie, contributes to the better understanding of the materials chosen by painters, with the prospect of enhancing the conservation and restoration of works executed with this technique.

The drug called telaprevir works by blocking the function of chaperones important proteins that fold other proteins in the cell in bacteria.  Telaprevir is the first previously clinically approved compound that has been shown to inhibit chaperone function in bacteria,  said Tania Lupoli, assistant professor of chemistry at NYU and the study s senior author.  Our research marks a vital step in developing small molecule chaperone inhibitors that can be used in bacteria to increase the power of antibiotics and slow down the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Chaperones exist in almost every cell in every organism, from single-cell bacteria to humans. Due to their critical role in folding other proteins and what happens when proteins misfold, which can lead to toxicity in the cell chaperones are the targets of ongoing drug discovery research, but researchers have struggled to find small molecules that can specifically target or bind to chaperones.In this study, the researchers sought to identify small molecules that could turn off the function of chaperones in disease-causing bacteria. Focusing on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the microbe that causes tuberculosis, they screened roughly 25,000 compounds including 1,300 approved drugs to identify small molecules that inhibit chaperones in mycobacteria. They landed upon an antiviral drug called telaprevir, which was approved by the FDA to treat hepatitis C. In a series of experiments using model mycobacteria in the lab, they demonstrated that telaprevir binds to mycobacterial chaperones and blocks their ability to fold proteins. This made the mycobacteria more sensitive to antibiotics, including streptomycin, a commonly prescribed tuberculosis drug.Chaperones can also stabilize the proteins in the cell that cause antibiotic resistance, so using telaprevir to block chaperone function lowered mycobacteria s resistance against the first-line tuberculosis drug rifampicin. Reducing antibiotic resistance is a major public health priority in the U.S. and around the world, as an increasing number of infections including tuberculosis are growing more difficult to treat as antibiotics become less effective.  In the future, we envision that small molecule chaperone inhibitors could be used in combination with antibiotics to enhance antibiotic potency and lower resistance,  said Lupoli.While the researchers were excited to identify telaprevir as a chaperone inhibitor, they are continuing to explore hundreds of telaprevir analogs compounds that are similar in molecular structure to determine if others bind more tightly to chaperones, a key factor for moving the research into animal or clinical studies. Future work will also explore how to target chaperone inhibitors to only shut down certain chaperones for instance, blocking chaperones in bacteria, but not human cells. Our work contributes to a small but growing list of small molecules that block the function of chaperones and provides a promising avenue for ongoing study of the role that telaprevir and its analogs can play when administered with antibiotics,  said Lupoli.Reference: Hosfelt J, Richards A, Zheng M, et al.

Published in Frontiers in Immunology, the research was led by the School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences. The circadian body clock generates 24-hour rhythms that keep humans healthy and in time with the day/night cycle. This includes regulating the rhythm of the body's own (innate) immune cells called macrophages. When these cell rhythms are disrupted (due to things like erratic eating/sleeping patterns or shift work), the cells produce molecules which drive inflammation. This can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases such as heart disease, obesity, arthritis, diabetes and cancer, and also impact our ability to fight infection. In this study, the researchers looked at these key immune cells called macrophages with and without a body clock under laboratory conditions. They were interested to understand if macrophages without a body clock might use or 'metabolise' fuel differently, and if that might be the reason these cells produce more inflammatory products. The researchers found that macrophages without a body clock took up far more glucose and broke it down more quickly than normal cells. They also found that, in the mitochondria (the cells energy powerhouse), the pathways by which glucose was further broken down to produce energy were very different in macrophages without a clock. This led to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which further fuelled inflammation.Dr George Timmons, lead author on the study, said: ""Our results add to the growing body of work showing why disruption of our body clock leads to inflammatory and infectious disease, and one of the aspects is fuel usage at the level of key immune cells such as macrophages.""Dr Annie Curtis, Senior Lecturer at RCSI School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences and senior author on the paper, added: ""This study also shows that anything which negatively impacts on our body clocks, such as insufficient sleep and not enough daylight, can impact on the ability of our immune system to work effectively.""ReferenceTimmons GA, Carroll RG, O Siorain JR, et al.

But about 20% of patients develop more advanced-stage neuroendocrine prostate cancer in response to this type of hormone therapy, and so far, researchers haven t had effective ways to study that progression. These patients lose their dependency on hormone-driven processes, and conventional treatments don t work for them,  said Singh, associate professor in both the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Emory University and Georgia Tech and the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Tech. There are no targeted therapies, so there is a clear clinical need,  he added.  But a major challenge is, we don t fully understand what these tumors entail, the kind of tumor microenvironment it has, or the factors that induce resistance to therapeutics. There are no models to effectively study this cancer. To begin to answer those questions, Singh and his team developed a prostate cancer organoid that can help them model the patient-specific microenvironment. It could offer an important step forward in precision medicine, and they described it in the November issue of the journal Advanced Materials. Organoids are tiny, three-dimensional tissue cultures grown from a patient s cells. They can be engineered to replicate different organs of the human body, or to model diseases. Produced entirely in vitro, organoids are valuable tools for researchers, who can explore targeted treatments in authentic human micro-anatomies without harming a patient.Scientists grow organoids in a gel that acts as the extracellular matrix   the protein-rich molecular network that surrounds and supports cells in the body, helping them attach to and communicate with one another and playing a key role in multiple cell functions.Singh s collaborators on this study had previously developed Matrigel organoid models of neuroendocrine prostate cancer   that is, they grew cells in Matrigel, a naturally derived solution from mouse tumor cells. Using these organoids, the researchers had discovered a new therapeutic target called EZH2, a histone-modifying protein that promotes tumor growth. Using an EZH2 inhibitor, they were able to slow tumor growth. EZH2 inhibitors may require high doses, and we are just beginning to understand factors that control EZH2 activity. And, in some patients, EZH2 inhibitors may not eliminate the tumor in its entirety,  Singh said.  Reasoning that the EZH2 inhibitor would reach full potential in the right kind of tumor microenvironment, something they could design   i.e., not Matrigel   they analyzed 111 patient biopsies using a multi-omics approach and microscopy techniques to thoroughly profile these aggressive tumors. Their findings helped them design and develop a synthetic, Maleimide-polyethyleneglycol-based hydrogel that accurately mimics the extracellular matrix of a patient-specific tumor. Using these organoids, the researchers were able to study the impact of the matrix on tumor development   particularly the changes associated with transforming a treatable prostate cancer tumor into an untreatable one.With the new organoids, they discovered that extracellular matrix regulates EZH2 activity and the efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors, a previously less understood phenomenon. They also discovered a potential new therapeutic target, a molecule called DRD2. Currently, DRD2 inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials for gliomas, but they have never been tested in neuroendocrine prostate tumors. Singh s team found that certain extracellular matrices found in patients could render neuroendocrine tumors resistant to DRD2 inhibitors, but the resistance could be overcome with a combination therapy: first, an EZH2 inhibitor to reprogram the cells and make them more susceptible to DRD2 inhibition.  As a single-agent targeted therapeutic, DRD2 is very exciting,  said Singh, whose collaborators included co-lead investigator Oliver Elemento, director of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, the biomedical research unit and medical school of Cornell University. The lead author was Matthew Mosquera, a former Ph.D. student in Singh s lab.Singh believes this work could evolve into a new standard of precision medicine. Not every patient s tumor microenvironment is the same,  Singh said.  We could take a biopsy sample, profile the patient s microenvironment, take that specific information and create an organoid model that you can treat with drugs and develop a personalized treatment regime. Tailoring this towards precision oncology would be pretty huge for us. That was original idea. That is the ultimate goal.

The patients were selected for the trial because their tumors carried a genetic mutation known as v600E in the BRAF gene. This mutation is found in only two to three percent of patients with high-grade gliomas but is found in up to 60% of certain types of low-grade gliomas. The study included 13 patients with low-grade gliomas. Of those patients, nine had an objective response to treatment with the drug combination, for a response rate of 69%. This is the first time that any targeted drug has been shown to work in glioblastoma in a clinical trial,  said Patrick Wen, MD, first author of the report in The Lancet Oncology and director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at Dana-Farber. With all current chemotherapy treatments for glioblastomas, the response rate is no better than five per cent, he said, which contrasts with the 33 percent response rate achieved by the combination. The response rate was even higher   about 40 %   in patients younger than 40 years of age, according to Wen.The two drugs paired in the study were dabrafenib and trametinib. Both drugs target proteins in the MAPK pathway, a signaling chain of proteins that acts as a switch for cell growth and can become stuck in the  on  position, causing uncontrolled growth leading to tumors.Three patients had complete responses   their tumors no longer could be seen on imaging scan   and 12 had partial shrinkage of their tumors. The patients were not cured, but those who responded to the drugs experienced remarkably durable benefits   by one assessment, the median duration of response was 13.6 months, and by another assessment, it was 36.9 months.The findings are from an ongoing phase 2 study called ROAR (Rare Oncology Agnostic Research) that has been enrolling patients since 2014 in 27 community and academic cancer centers in 13 countries. The study is a so-called  basket  trial, which seeks to enroll patients who share a common tumor characteristic   in this case the BRAF v600E mutation   although they may have an array of different cancers. The ROAR study includes patients with thyroid and biliary tract cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, low- and high-grade glioma brain tumors, and others. The study is designed to determine the overall response rate of dabrafenib combined with trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated cancers. The BRAF protein is a growth signaling protein kinase that plays a role in regulating the MAPK signaling pathway. BRAF V600E mutations drive cancer by activating the MAPK pathway, which is made up of many proteins, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and the development of a tumor.The drugs used in this study, dabrafenib and trametinib, are oral drugs that block parts of the overactive MAPK signaling pathway. Dabrafenib inhibits an enzyme, B-Raf, and trametinib inhibits molecules called MEK1 and MEK2, which are part of the MAPK pathway. They have been used in combination to treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and thyroid cancer.Gliomas are cancer that originate in the glia   the supporting cells of the brain   not the brain neurons themselves. Gliomas comprise about 80 percent of all malignant brain tumors. Some are slow-growing low-grade gliomas, while others are aggressive high-grade gliomas including glioblastomas that are difficult to remove and almost always recur. No important advances in treating gliomas in recent years, the authors of the report said, but there have been isolated reports of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib showing activity in gliomas. Their report from the ROAR study  is the first time that a combination of BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) and a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) have shown notable activity in these difficult-to-treat gliomas, including glioblastomas which have historically shown resistance to therapies. Although the drugs only helped patients whose tumors carried the rare V600E mutation, Wen said the results were encouraging  because people were starting to think you will never have any targeted therapies for glioblastoma.  He added that there is emerging evidence that there may be other targets in gliomas that could be blocked by designer drugs.Reference: Wen PY, Stein A, Bent M van den, et al.

The study was published in PLOS ONE.Until now, to study venom, the scorpion was sacrificed so that the venom gland could be extracted from the telson (stinger) or the telson was excised and homogenized (Figure 1). The new approach relies on transcriptomics   a technique used to study an organism s RNA transcripts or transcriptome. mRNA is collected directly from the venom and sequenced. The researchers believe that the approach could be applied more broadly to other venomous taxa. Thanks to this technique, we can very precisely see which genes are active at various moments during the venom production,  said the study s first author Prof. Freek Vonk, in a recent press release. The approach developed by Vonk and colleagues is unique in that it has been directly applied to the venom instead of the venom gland tissue. There are two key caveats to the traditional method for obtaining a scorpion venom gland transcriptome. Firstly, analysis of the venom gland can only be achieved at a single time point. Secondly, in cases where the telson is homogenized, tissues unrelated to venom production are also sequenced, making the target less specific.    The genes behind the scenes: new technique revolutionizes venom research. M ty s Bittenbinder discusses the key findings from their study, published in PLOS ONE. ","Published: November 24, 2021"

In the interview, he was pressed to respond to the notion of mRNA vaccines   such as the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine   becoming the ""future"" of vaccinology. In his response, Soriot suggested that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine (Vaxzevria) may offer a longer-lasting form of immunity against the virus, compared to other vaccines, by inducing T-cell responses. He also implied that the increasing rates of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 across mainland Europe may be attributable to the reduced uptake of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in these countries when compared to the UK.""It's really interesting. When you look at the UK, there was a big peak of infections, but not so many hospitalizations relative to Europe. In the UK, this vaccine was used to vaccinate older people. Whereas in Europe, initially, people thought the vaccine doesn't work in older people,"" Soriot said.Soriot is referring to the decision made earlier this year by several EU countries, including Germany, to advise against older people receiving Vaxzevria. In many cases this decision was revised based on subsequent guidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).""What I'm saying, is that T cells do matter, and in particular, as it relates to the durability of the response, especially in older people,"" Soriot said.  This vaccine has been shown to stimulate T cells to a higher degree in older people [ ] There's no proof of anything, we don't know. But we need more data to analyze this and get the answer.""The scientific community has responded to Soriot's statement. The general consensus appears to be that, while it's plausible the AstraZeneca vaccine could trigger a stronger T-cell immune response compared to other vaccines, currently, there is not sufficient data to state this as fact. Even if it was the case, there are many other factors that could contribute to varying infection rates across different countries, experts argue. The adaptive immune system can be further subdivided into humoral and cellular immunity. ""Humoral immunity refers to the immunity found in the blood, or specifically, serum, the non-cellular part of the blood   i.e., [it refers] to antibodies,"" Dr. Peter English, consultant in public health and health protection, told the Science Media Centre. Cellular immunity, on the other hand, is mediated by T cells.  ""The antibody response is what drives the immediate reaction or defence of the body when you are attacked by the virus,"" Soriot told BBC Radio 4. ""The T-cell response takes a little longer to come in. But it's actually more durable, it lasts longer, and the body remembers that [for] longer. So, you see, everybody's focused on antibodies, but [with] antibodies, you see them decline over time.""Measuring cellular responses in a laboratory environment is more challenging than measuring antibody responses. This is why we typically see more reports of antibody levels post-vaccination or after a disease, and less reports on cellular immunity,"" English said.  While B cells are largely recognized for producing antibodies, there are a number of different T cells that are important for adaptive immunity. ""They include, for example, the killer T cells, whose role is to kill cells which are misbehaving,"" English said. ""They are also involved with stimulating some B cells to become long-lived memory B-cells; cells which circulate in the bloodstream or live in the bone marrow, and which can very rapidly pump out large quantities of antibody if the virus is (or, more accurately, the relevant antigens are) detected in the future,"" he added.The severity of illness that an individual experiences when infected by a pathogen   like SARS-CoV-2   can therefore depend on that individual's T-cell response.

Now, ABSTRAX researchers have discovered a number of key volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs)   volatile organic compounds that contain sulfur   which directly explain this pungent odor given off by some cannabis strains. Their research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in ACS Omega, also suggests that these VSCs could have additional medicinal properties, as their chemical structures strongly resemble a number of compounds in garlic that are known to improve cardiovascular health. To unravel cannabis  scent profile, the ABSTRAX Tech scientists focused on investigating VSCs for two reasons. Firstly, since cannabis smells are often described as skunk-like, it would make sense to screen them for compounds that are also present in skunk s aerosol spray. And since VSCs are already known to exist in other pungent plants like hops, it would be unsurprising to find the same compounds in cannabis plants. In order to screen cannabis samples for known and unknown VSCs, the scientists employed the use of a custom-built two-dimensional gas chromatography (2DGC) system with three detectors running simultaneously: a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS), flame ionization detector (FID), and a sulfur chemiluminescence detector (SCD). The use of two-dimensional gas chromatography provides better separation efficiency than traditional one-dimensional analysis, with the combination of sulfur chemiluminescence, mass spectrometry, and flame ionization, giving researchers the means to detect, identify, and quantify very low concentrations of any VSCs present in the samples.  The combination of multiple detectors, in tandem with 2DGC to analyze cannabis, gave us the tools needed to parse through data and identify trends between certain compounds and the aromas of various cannabis cultivars,  lead study author Dr Iain Oswald, explained in a statement.  Our data conclusively establishes a link between this new family of VSCs in cannabis and its pungent aroma.  The study identified a family of seven VSCs present in cannabis, some of which had not been previously identified in nature. Five of these compounds contained a prenyl functional group in their chemical structure and are believed to contribute to cannabis  unique skunk-like smell. Further tests identified the compound 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol as the primary component of this aroma.  Much like cannflavins are prenylated flavonoids found specifically in cannabis, some of these newly discovered  cannasulfur compounds  also appear to be highly specific prenylated VSCs to cannabis,  said Oswald.  It is interesting to see a common chemical theme within entirely different classes of compounds produced by this plant.  Possibly the most important impact of the study is the discovery that the VSCs found in cannabis are structurally very similar to other VSCs found in garlic. I have suspected for years now that we were missing something in our understanding of this plant,  study co-author Josh Del Rosso, said in a statement.  Although terpenes have been hailed as the major source of the pungent scent of cannabis, we now know that it is this new class of VSCs.   I hope our results can act as a springboard to help other researchers determine if these compounds endow cannabis with even more medicinal properties than we ever imagined.  Interestingly, when the researchers screened three brands of butane hash oil concentrates for the VSCs detected in cannabis, they found measurable concentrations of the major VSC found in cannabis flower, 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol, in all three extracts. Additionally, a second VSC found in cannabis flower, 3-methyl-2-butenyl acetothioate, was observed in higher concentrations than the 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol in two of these samples. After an olfactory testing panel, it was found that high levels of these two compounds were correlated with higher scores for extract pungency. The fact that these volatile compounds can be retained throughout the extraction process appears to be one of the reasons why these extracts can still carry such a strong cannabis-like aroma. But if these compounds are confirmed to have medicinal benefits, this could be a significant finding for the industry.  We confirmed that cannabis extracts can indeed contain these compounds in reasonable concentration if processed correctly,  said Kevin Koby, CSO of ABSTRAX, in a statement.  Their high volatility makes them prone to volatilization, so we weren t sure how they would translate into cannabis extracts. We were pleasantly surprised to see high levels in the sample we measured, especially if these compounds possess beneficial medicinal properties.  Lastly, the ABSTRAX scientists set out to determine when these VSCs appear in the cannabis, and when their concentrations are at a peak. By sampling small clippings from cannabis plants being grown in a hydroponic greenhouse system and continuing to take measurements after harvesting and curing, the researchers found that the VSCs in cannabis arise very late in the growth cycle of the plant. VSCs were first detected seven weeks after the cannabis clones were planted, at which point the smell of the plants in the greenhouse also became more noticeably pungent. Peak VSCs concentrations were recorded at the end of the curing and drying process, but when remeasured after ten days of storage, the levels of almost every VSC had fallen off significantly.  These results prove that cannabis producers are racing against time when it comes to getting quality products into customers  hands,  said Koby.  Hopefully our results will establish a new standard for cultivators and distributors to help preserve and protect these key compounds   regardless of the rigors of processing, packaging, and time on shelf. Most importantly, it will help brands maximize their products and literally push cannabis quality to the next level. ","Published: November 24, 2021"

As well as to memory and learning. A recent study from McGill University, published in Current Biology, suggests that dopamine may also play a key role in shaping what songs female songbirds enjoy, which may ultimately affect mating as females choose (and then remember) their mates based on the songs they prefer.Zebra finches are monogamous songbirds and form pairs that last throughout their lifetimes. The male sings and does a dance, and this can then lead to copulation. Thus, for males, success in mating depends on how an individual female songbird receives and reacts to the songs they sing. But female songbirds are very selective about which songs they like,  explains Sarah Woolley, the lead researcher on the study and an associate professor in McGill s Biology Department.  And, while different birds prefer different songs, each female remains consistent in her preferences over time. The researchers found that many parts of the brain that produce dopamine connect to the auditory cortex, and cells in some of those regions showed more activity when female songbirds listened to the songs they preferred. Using an experiment where the songbirds learnt to pull strings to hear the songs they preferred, the researchers also discovered that by administering dopamine to the female songbirds, they were able to manipulate and cause lasting changes in their song preferences.It is a finding that advances current scientific thought in the area. Earlier research in the field had suggested that the auditory cortex was important for recognizing and discriminating between songs, while other  reward  centers were important for determining how much females liked the song they were listening to. I find it fascinating that the way that each of us perceive communication signals, like speech, or other sounds, like music, is not static,  adds Woolley.  Rather, our perceptions of these sounds depend on experiences that we have throughout our lives. Studying how experiences can gain access to and shape the neural circuits for perception can not only expand our general understanding of how we process and perceive sounds, it can also help us to understand why we like or enjoy particular sounds.

The eDNA method consists of extracting molecules of DNA present in water samples and identifying the species to which they belong by means of genetic markers.An article on the research published in the journal Scientific Reports also discusses the limitations of the technique for the study of environments as highly diverse as Amazonia. We need to continue catching and identifying animals by traditional methods in order to create libraries of genetic material. They will serve as a reference for comparing whatever is found in water samples. As the technique advances, in a few years we may be able to know about all the fish species present in a place without catching them,  said Carlos David de Santana, a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution s National Museum of Natural History in the United States and first author of the article.The study was part of the project Diversity and evolution of Gymnotiformes , supported by FAPESP and led by Na rcio Menezes, a professor at the University of S o Paulo s Zoology Museum (MZ-USP) in Brazil.  The extraction of DNA from water samples creates expectations that are highly favorable to protection of the environment, as the usual methods for collecting samples of aquatic animals include the use of nets and other fishing gear with a negative impact,  said Menezes, a co-author of the article.The group of researchers spent 18 days on the Javari River, collecting water samples at three of 46 locations where they collected fish specimens. The number of species represented reached the surprising total of 443, and 60 were new to science.At the sites from which water for eDNA analysis was collected, 201 species were caught using traditional methods. However, only 58, or 26% of the total, were identified with precision at the species level from analysis of the eDNA. A possible explanation is lack of reference genetic material in databases that can be used for purposes of comparison. In addition, many species in these locations are entirely new and have never been identified before using conventional techniques,  said Gislene Torrente-Vilara, a professor at the Federal University of S o Paulo s Institute of Marine Sciences (IMAR-UNIFESP) in Santos and also a co-author of the article.Torrente-Vilara led the expedition as part of the Amazon Fish project, an international collaboration that was supported by FAPESP and resulted in a new understanding of the distribution of fish species in the region (more at: agencia.fapesp.br/31956).

Their results, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, may alter not only how scientists view the role that genomics plays in OCD but also how new treatments might be developed.The study was led by scientists in the laboratory of Dorothy Grice, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at Icahn Mount Sinai.Affecting about two percent of Americans, OCD describes a set of potentially life-long and debilitating symptoms, most notably intense and distressing recurring thoughts and actions. Although scientists have yet to find the exact causes of OCD, several studies indicate that multiple genomic and environmental factors may play a role in the disease. For instance, it has been estimated that anywhere between 25 to 50 percent of the risk for OCD behaviors may be attributable to genomic differences between individuals in a population.Led by Behrang Mahjani, PhD, a researcher in Dr. Grice s lab, the researchers compared the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) the minor DNA spelling differences normally found in a person s chromosomes of 2,090 Swedish-born OCD patients with that of 4,567 controls, making it the largest study of its kind to date. Initial results supported previous studies. About 29 percent of the risk for OCD was attributed to differences in SNPs between patients and control subjects and about 90 percent of these differences are commonly observed throughout the general population. However, the researchers also found that about 10 percent of the risk could be linked to rare genomic differences, which were not seen in previous studies. Further analysis showed that the OCD-related SNPs were distributed across patients  chromosomes, suggesting that multiple genomic differences combine to influence risk. Overall the results support the idea that OCD risk may, in part, be driven by randomly occurring changes to the entire genome rather than a few naturally selected  hot spots.  The researchers concluded that this new view of OCD highlights the important role of rare genomic differences in the risk of OCD, and may alter how scientists study the disorder to develop new treatments for patients.Reference: Mahjani B, Klei L, Mattheisen M, et al.

While this deterministic sequence is sometimes true, it does not seem to be the case for all patients. Moreover, the disappointing results of recently marketed drugs have highlighted the need to reconsider this disease, which affects nearly 10 million people in Europe. A European consortium of physicians and scientists, led by the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG), in Switzerland, which also includes INSERM in France, has analysed the data presented in nearly 200 previously published studies. Far from being a monolithic disease where the same causes produce the same effects, this analysis proposes a categorisation of patients into three groups, each with its own dynamics. In addition, the research team calls for an increased effort to screen people at risk, in order to implement preventive measures as early as possible. This work, to be read in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience, proposes a profound paradigm shift in the way Alzheimer s disease is understood.Alzheimer s disease is usually described as a four-step sequence: a deposit of amyloid appears in the cerebral cortex, then hyperphosphorylated tau protein increases and aggregates in neurons. They then cause neurodegeneration, and finally cognitive decline, with memory loss as the first symptom. The first drug targeting the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain, approved a few months ago by the European and American regulatory authorities, has however proved relatively disappointing.  Yet, if we consider Alzheimer s disease as a sequential cascade of biological events, it should have been much more effective , explains Giovanni Frisoni, Professor in the Department of Readaptation and Geriatrics at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and Director of the HUG Memory Centre, who directed this work.  Stopping the production of beta-amyloid with a drug should logically interrupt neuronal loss and therefore memory loss, which has not been massively observed. Furthermore, we have found that some people with amyloid do not develop cognitive symptoms. What does protect their brain from neurotoxicity?

In the new study, published Nov. 22 in Nature Microbiology, senior author Dr. Iliyan Iliev, associate professor of immunology in medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and his team at Weill Cornell Medicine investigated if it might also play a role in managing gut fungi. Unlike bacteria, fungi can change their shape in response to environmental conditions, and certain forms are harmful to humans. In particular, a type of fungus called Candida albicans transforms from a yeast form that is not pathogenic to a form that produces long, branched structures called hyphae, which can invade tissues and cause damage.The investigators found that antibodies that are secreted in the gut help control the pathogenesis of Candida albicans in healthy individuals and that this protective mechanism may be disabled in people with Crohn s disease, causing a harmful overgrowth of the pathogenic form of the fungus. An intestinal overabundance of Candida albicans is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and several other conditions that directly or indirectly affect the gastrointestinal tract. We found that antibodies secreted in the gut are involved in maintaining specific intestinal fungi such as C. albicans in its benign, so-called commensal form,  said Dr. Iliev, who is also a scientist in the Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Weill Cornell Medicine.  This process is interrupted in patients with Crohn s disease. In their experiments, the investigators found that an antibody called secretory immunoglobulin A (slgA) in feces from healthy mice selectively bind to the form of C. albicans with hyphae, stopping its spread. They found these antibodies also bind hyphae in feces from healthy humans. Those antibodies are preferentially binding to hyphae,  said Itai Doron, a doctoral candidate in the laboratory. Specifically, they bind to sites on the hyphae that produce molecules used by these fungi to harm host tissues. The antibodies, however, don t bind preferentially to the non-harmful form of the yeast. This suggests that antibodies may help the body maintain a healthy balance of gut fungi by preventing harmful forms of the fungi from taking over.The investigators also found that patients with Crohn s disease who develop severe inflammation in their colon and small intestine have high levels of anti-fungal antibodies in their blood compared with healthy adults. But those antibodies don t appear to be secreted at high levels into the gut to counteract C. albicans hyphae. Samples from the colons of these patients reveal an overabundance of the fungi with hyphae. An impairment in this mechanism of control in mice and in patients with Crohn s disease might be a contributing factor to the increased hyphal growth in the gut,  Dr. Iliev said.When the investigators added the anti-fungal antibodies to human cells grown in culture with C. albicans the fungi produced less hyphae. It seems that these antifungal antibodies  disarm  hyphae to a degree,  Doron said.The results suggest that exploring anti-fungal antibodies therapeutically might be a way to help patients who develop an overgrowth of C. albicans. Dr. Iliev noted that not all patients with this inflammatory bowel disease have this type of fungal overgrowth, but it may be an important contributor to disease in a subset of patients. The community of fungi in the gut, specifically C. albicans, is shaping our immunity,  Dr. Iliev said. We develop these antibodies, and it seems they have a protective role in a specific context.

We then update the RSC with fresh information based on the new impressions of how much we enjoyed the evening s soup and pasta.New research led by Division of Biological Sciences postdoctoral scholar Ryoma Hattori and Professor Takaki Komiyama is now revealing details about how such dynamic information is processed. The results, published Nov. 23 in the journal Neuron, show that persistency allows value signals to be most effectively represented, or  coded,  across different areas of the brain, especially the RSC.To investigate the details of how brain activity represents value-based decision making, a core animal behavior that is impaired in neurological conditions such as schizophrenia, dementia and addiction, the researchers set up reinforcement learning experiments in which mice were presented with options and their choices were rewarded with certain probabilities. They recorded corresponding brain activities during the reinforcement learning. The resulting data and network simulations pointed to the significance of persistent coding in how the mice and their value decisions were represented and the RSC as a nexus for this activity. These results suggest that, although information coding is highly distributed, not all of the information represented in neural activity may be used in each area,  the authors explain in the paper.  These results reveal that context-dependent, untangled persistency facilitates reliable signal coding and its distribution across the brain. According to Hattori, neurons are known to cycle through different activity patterns, with some neurons spiking in activity and others remaining silent.  These brain activity patterns have been shown to correlate to certain task-related information such as value information for decision making. Because the RSC plays a central role in connecting several brain networks and functions, the new findings reinforce ideas about the site s fundamental importance. We think that in the mouse brain the RSC functions as a stable reservoir for value information,  said Hattori.  The RSC appears to distribute value information to other brain areas that are vital for further processing of the value signals when mice perform reinforcement learning and decision making. To further test their findings, Hattori and Komiyama tapped into their  big data  trove of more than 100,000 mouse decisions recorded during the experiments. They programmed artificial intelligence (AI) networks to imitate behavioral strategies in computer-based reinforcement trials and found remarkably similar results to the real-world experiments. When we trained the artificial intelligence network to do the same behavior, it adopted the same strategy and the same way of representing the information in neural activity,  said Komiyama, who is a professor of neurobiology (Division of Biological Sciences) and neurosciences (Department of Neurosciences, School of Medicine), with affiliations in UC San Diego s Center for Neural Circuits and Behavior and Hal c o lu Data Science Institute.  This suggests that this is an evolutionarily selected strategy for neural circuits to perform this behavior. This parallel between the biological brain and the AI that Ryoma trained is really interesting. Reference: Hattori R, Komiyama T.

Researchers now report in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology Letters that satellite data from before and during the spring 2020 lockdown in Los Angeles shows that vehicles, rather than agriculture, are the main source of urban airborne ammonia (NH3), which forms small particles that contribute to air pollution and harm human health.When emitted into the atmosphere, NH3 is converted into tiny particles of inorganic compounds, including ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate. On a national or global scale, most NH3 pollution comes from agricultural sources, such as livestock manure. But vehicles also contribute to the problem because their catalytic converters or selective catalytic reduction systems   which are designed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollutants including NO2   have the undesirable side-effect of producing ammonia emissions. In cities, it s been hard to tell whether agriculture or traffic emits more NH3, and the default assumption has been that agriculture is the greater culprit, despite some labor-intensive measurement studies that suggested otherwise in a few cities. Daven K. Henze and colleagues wanted to see if satellite data could be used to answer this question for the first time from space, since such an approach, in principle, could be applied more broadly to urban areas throughout the world. The researchers focused on western Los Angeles, where previous on-the-ground measurements found that vehicle emissions of NH3 were being underestimated. The team analyzed satellite readings of NH3, as well as NO2. Because the main source of NO2 in the region is on-road transportation, the compound can serve as a proxy for changes in traffic volume and an indicator of vehicular as opposed to agricultural ammonia emissions. The team correlated concentrations of the two pollutants, and also took meteorological effects into account, to calculate the amount of ammonia emissions that can be traced to vehicles. They found that vehicles accounted for 60% to 84% of total NH3 emissions at this urban location, consistent with estimates provided by modeling, but substantially higher than the 13% to 22% share estimated by government agencies. The researchers say their findings suggest the health impact of vehicle-related ammonia may rival that of NOx, yet it has been largely under-recognized and uncontrolled.ReferenceCao H, Henze DK, Cady-Pereira K, et al.

We think this is exciting progress into using computers to give us new information about how image sets are different from each other,  Vitriol says.  What are the actual biological changes that are happening, including ones that I might not be able to see, because they are too minute, or because I have some kind of bias about where I should be looking. At least in the analyzing data department, computers have our brains beat, the neuroscientist says, not just in their objectivity but in the amount of data they can assess. Computer vision, which enables computers to pull information from digital images, is a type of machine learning that has been around for decades, so he and his colleague and fellow corresponding author Dr. Peter Bubenik, a mathematician at the University of Florida and an expert on topological data analysis, decided to partner the detail of microscopy with the science of topology and the analytical might of AI. Topology and Bubenik were key, Vitriol says.Topology is  perfect  for image analysis because images consist of patterns, of objects arranged in space, he says, and topological data analysis (the TDA in TDAExplore) helps the computer also recognize the lay of the land, in this case where actin   a protein and essential building block of the fibers, or filaments, that help give cells shape and movement   has moved or changed density. It s an efficient system, that instead of taking literally hundreds of images to train the computer how to recognize and classify them, it can learn on 20 to 25 images.Part of the magic is the computer is now learning the images in pieces they call patches. Breaking microscopy images down into these pieces enables more accurate classification, less training of the computer on what  normal  looks like, and ultimately the extraction of meaningful data, they write.No doubt microscopy, which enables close examination of things not visible to the human eye, produces beautiful, detailed images and dynamic video that are a mainstay for many scientists.  You can t have a college of medicine without sophisticated microscopy facilities,  he says.But to first understand what is normal and what happens in disease states, Vitriol needs detailed analysis of the images, like the number of filaments; where the filaments are in the cells   close to the edge, the center, scattered throughout   and whether some cell regions have more.The patterns that emerge in this case tell him where actin is and how it s organized   a major factor in its function   and where, how and if it has changed with disease or damage.As he looks at the clustering of actin around the edges of a central nervous system cell, for example, the assemblage tells him the cell is spreading out, moving about and sending out projections that become its leading edge. In this case, the cell, which has been essentially dormant in a dish, can spread out and stretch its legs.Some of the problem with scientists analyzing the images directly and calculating what they see include that it s time consuming and the reality that even scientists have biases.As an example, and particularly with so much action happening, their eyes may land on the familiar, in Vitriol s case, that actin at the leading edge of a cell. As he looks again at the dark frame around the cell s periphery clearly indicating the actin clustering there, it might imply that is the major point of action. How do I know that when I decide what s different that it s the most different thing or is that just what I wanted to see?  he says.  We want to bring computer objectivity to it and we want to bring a higher degree of pattern recognition into the analysis of images. AI is known to be able to  classify  things, like recognizing a dog or a cat every time, even if the picture is fuzzy, by first learning many millions of variables associated with each animal until it knows a dog when it sees one, but it can t report why it s a dog. That approach, which requires so many images for training purposes and still doesn t provide many image statistics, does not really work for his purposes, which is why he and his colleagues made a new classifier that was restricted to topological data analysis.The bottom line is that the unique coupling used in TDAExplore efficiently and objectively tells the scientists where and how much the perturbed cell image differs from the training, or normal, image, information which also provides new ideas and research directions, he says.Back to the cell image that shows the actin clustering along its perimeter, while the  leading edge  was clearly different with perturbations, TDAExplore showed that some of the biggest changes actually were inside the cell. A lot of my job is trying to find patterns in images that are hard to see,  Vitriol says,  Because I need to identify those patterns so I can find some way to get numbers out of those images.  His bottom lines include figuring out how the actin cytoskeleton, which the filaments provide the scaffolding for and which in turn provides support for neurons, works and what goes wrong in conditions like ALS.Some of those machine learning models that require hundreds of images to train and classify images don t describe which part of the image contributed to the classification, the investigators write. Such huge amounts of data that need analyzing and might include like 20 million variables, require a super computer. The new system instead needs comparatively few high-resolution images and characterizes the  patches  that led to the selected classification. In a handful of minutes, the scientist s standard personal computer can complete the new image analysis pipeline.The unique approach used in TDAExplore objectively tells the scientists where and how much the perturbed image differs from the training image, information which also provides new ideas and research directions, he says.The ability to get more and better information from images ultimately means that information generated by basic scientists like Vitriol, which often ultimately changes what is considered the facts of a disease and how it s treated, is more accurate. That might include being able to recognize changes, like those the new system pointed out inside the cell, that have been previously overlooked.Currently scientists apply stains to enable better contrast then use software to pull out information about what they are seeing in the images, like how the actin is organized into bigger structure, he says. We had to come up with a new way to get relevant data from images and that is what this paper is about. Reference: Edwards P, Skruber K, Mili evi  N, et al.

The SERS tags were composed of a thiolated aptamer, modified with additional G bases at the 3  end, which was functionalized on Au shell NPs via Au-S bonds. The capturing element was prepared by anchoring a thiolated aptamer on magnetic NPs. For the recognition of target miRNA, the magnetic capturing element was initially exposed to the target, which captured the miRNA sequences via immunoreaction between recognition and target sequences. The NPs were separated using an external magnetic field, rinsed, and probed with SERS tags (Scheme). As a result, the target sequence was captured via sandwich formation. The enhanced Raman signal of adenine base at 3' end of SERS tag was used to calibrate the output. This research utilized aptamer-combined SERS methodology to detect miRNA as the biomarker to evaluate radiation-induced organ injury. Another advantage of this method is the use of magnetic NPs. It can provide the additional facility of rapid and ready separation of analytes using an external magnetic field. This method is also applicable to evaluate the drug triggered liver inflammation via examining the exosomal miRNA as the biomarker. In general, this method could provide easy and early diagnosis for analyzing hepatic inflammation cases at the clinical level.ReferenceMuhammad M, Shao CS, Liu C, Huang Q.

They provide for instance the increased surface area necessary for the absorption of nutrients in your intestine or for gas exchange in your lungs. More and more evidence suggests that cells are able to sense whether they are in flat or curved environments. Three-dimensional curvature can impact many processes such as the movement of cells, the development of stem cells, and even disease progression. However, the underlying mechanisms by which cells sense curvature and how it ultimately dictates their behavior are less clear.Now, a study in Nature Physics led by PhD student Marine Luciano and Professor Sylvain Gabriele of the University of Mons in Belgium in cooperation with postdoc Shi-Lei Xue and Professor Edouard Hannezo at IST Austria has uncovered some new findings. The researchers found the mechanisms that regulate the cells  behavior depending on the change of the environment s curvature.Gabriele s team reproduced the folding patterns observed in living tissues in a very controlled way by developing a method to grow cells on curved surfaces using soft hydrogels   gels made of long molecules trapping water between them. This was important because it is very hard to clearly observe the effects of curvature in complex living tissues. They have many feedback loops depending on their own shape, making it difficult to distinguish cause and effect. These specially constructed surfaces have valleys and mountains with sizes from a hundredth to a tenth of a millimeter. The experiments showed that cells grown on these surfaces tend to spread thinly on the mountains and gather in the valleys.At IST Austria, Xue and Hannezo developed a key theoretical model that explains the experimental distribution of cells on the surfaces. They used the simple physical principle of energy minimization. Their cell model is inspired by the physics of foam and led to the understanding how the curvature governs the distribution of cells on the surface and therefore also their shape and density in an area. It was already known that cells could sense the density of other cells around them and that this governs their biochemical machinery. Therefore, biochemicals like the Yes-associated proteins (YAP)   key markers of stem cells   are influenced by the curvature via density sensing.This study identifies how curvature sensing influences multiple pathways in cell development. This kind of interdisciplinary study incorporating physical chemistry, cell biology, and theoretical physics once again sheds light on a cellular mechanism that has been poorly understood so far.Reference: Luciano M, Xue SL, De Vos WH, et al.

These renewable liquids could serve as a more sustainable replacement for today s fossil fuels used to make everyday products like plastic containers and bags, automobile parts, lubricants, and soaps. The new study by scientists at the University of California Berkeley and the University of Minnesota is published online in Nature Chemistry, a leading peer-reviewed chemistry journal by Nature Publishing Group. It has been difficult for scientists to use plants as a source for plastics because they are mostly made up of sugars which are nothing like the molecules obtained from petroleum. The key sugar in plants is glucose, which contains too much oxygen and at six carbons is too small for many important applications. In order to use plants to make new materials, both problems must be solved the conversion process needs to strip oxygen atoms from the glucose, and molecules must be combined to make larger products. Researchers at the NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers discovered an optimal technology to make sustainable liquids similar to those obtained from petroleum by combining two normally independent technologies. First, glucose obtained from plants was fermented with microbes to remove most of the oxygen. In the second step, metal oxide catalysts stripped the remaining oxygen and combined molecules together to make a useful distribution of olefins that are the building blocks of the chemical industry.  Our insight early on was that we needed to find a molecule that could be readily made with fermentation that could strip most oxygen from glucose,  said Michelle Chang, a Professor of Chemistry and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California Berkeley and leader of the project.  We optimized the chemistry to take advantage of the unique capabilities of molecular biology, after which we could solve the rest of the problem with metal nanoparticle catalysts.  Professor Chang s group developed a unique strain of Escherichia coli that converted glucose to eight- and 10-carbon hydroxy-acids, which are molecules with only a few oxygen atoms at the end of the chain. The microbes were optimized through genetic engineering so that they can  grow  these molecules from sugar. Chang said the target molecule was designed to have oxygen left in strategic positions to make the downstream conversion more efficient for a group of researchers led by University of Minnesota Chemical Engineering and Materials Science Professor Paul Dauenhauer.  The biorenewable molecules that Professor Chang s group made were perfect raw materials for catalytic refining,  said Dauenhauer, who was one of the co-authors of the research study.  These molecules contained just enough oxygen that we could readily convert them to larger more useful molecules using metal nanoparticle catalysts. This allowed us to tune the distribution of molecular products as needed, just like conventional petroleum products except this time we were using renewable resources.  Dauenhauer s laboratory at the University of Minnesota screened a broad array of catalysts to demonstrate that the bio-petroleum molecules made by fermentation could be converted to a range of important chemicals. The outcomes included small molecules for making key polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene used in products like plastic bags and mid-size molecules for making rubbery materials. Even more important was the ability to combine fermentation product molecules together to produce larger molecules that can serve as the basis for manufacturing soap-like molecules for cleaning applications and longer chain molecules for lubricants. The breadth of possible products depending on the selected catalyst and reaction conditions means that the combined fermentation-catalysis technology can be tuned to manufacture almost the full slate of unprocessed chemical materials that can be used in manufacturing processes like conventional petroleum but with biorenewable resources. The hybrid approach of combined fermentation and chemical refining has the benefit of competing economically with conventional products derived from fossil fuels while also improving sustainability. Technologies were integrated to find the lowest-energy and lowest-cost processing techniques leading to the most overall efficient method of making chemicals.  This is a unique scientific approach to a new sustainable technology that was facilitated by the synergistic research that happens between disparate research groups supported in the NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers,  said Marc Hillmyer, center director and a University of Minnesota chemistry professor.  The teamwork and combined focus on solving the problem produced a new approach that would not have been possible in either of the individual research groups.   This advance from the NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers demonstrates a truly innovative, green entry into the building blocks for valuable polymers/plastics,  said NSF Chemistry Division Director David Berkowitz.  By cleverly combining biology and chemistry, the Chang team has opened a new, potential bio-renewable alternative to petroleum cracking. These results showcase how NSF investments in collaborative, interdisciplinary science can push the envelope toward developing more sustainable chemical industries.

The difference is that moles are usually harmless, while melanomas are cancerous and often deadly without treatment. In a study published today in eLife Magazine, Robert Judson-Torres, PhD, Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) researcher and University of Utah (U of U) assistant professor of dermatology and oncological sciences, explains how common moles and melanomas form and why moles can change into melanoma.Melanocytes are cells that give color to the skin to protect it from the sun s rays. Specific changes to the DNA sequence of melanocytes, called BRAF gene mutations, are found in over 75% of moles. The same change is also found in 50% of melanomas and is common in cancers like colon and lung. It was thought that when melanocytes only have the BRAFV600E mutation the cell stops dividing, resulting in a mole. When melanocytes have other mutations with BRAFV600E, they divide uncontrollably, turning into melanoma. This model is called  oncogene-induced senescence. A number of studies have challenged this model in recent years,  says Judson-Torres.  These studies have provided excellent data to suggest that the oncogene-induced senescence model does not explain mole formation but what they have all lacked is an alternative explanation which has remained elusive. With help from collaborators across HCI and the University of California San Francisco, the study team took moles and melanomas donated by patients and used transcriptomic profiling and digital holographic cytometry. Transcriptomic profiling lets researchers determine molecular differences between moles and melanomas. Digital holographic cytometry helps researchers track changes in human cells. We discovered a new molecular mechanism that explains how moles form, how melanomas form, and why moles sometimes become melanomas,  says Judson-Torres.The study shows melanocytes that turn into melanoma do not need to have additional mutations but are actually affected by environmental signaling, when cells receive signals from the environment in the skin around them that give them direction. Melanocytes express genes in different environments, telling them to either divide uncontrollably or stop dividing altogether. Origins of melanoma being dependent on environmental signals gives a new outlook in prevention and treatment,  says Judson-Torres.  It also plays a role in trying to combat melanoma by preventing and targeting genetic mutations. We might also be able to combat melanoma by changing the environment. These findings create a foundation for researching potential melanoma biomarkers, allowing doctors to detect cancerous changes in the blood at earlier stages. The researchers are also interested in using these data to better understand potential topical agents to reduce the risk of melanoma, delay development, or stop recurrence, and to detect melanoma early.Reference: McNeal AS, Belote RL, Zeng H, et al.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules carry the instruction code that tells our cells how to do everything they need to survive, such as when, where and how to make proteins or enzymes.One of the many ways the cells in our bodies control mRNA molecules is to decorate them with different chemical groups that either subtly or drastically change the way that messages are conveyed.Mugridge, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, was recently awarded $1,956,466 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study specific enzymes that can act like erasers and remove critical chemical groups, called methyl groups, found on mRNA molecules.With hard-to-treat cancers like glioblastoma, sometimes these methyl eraser enzymes are overexpressed in cancer cells   meaning too many eraser enzymes are working at once. This can cause mRNA molecules to lack important information, which can change the messages they deliver in a way that leads to cancer progression and tumor growth. Little is known about how these eraser enzymes decide which methyl groups to eliminate or keep, how often they erase methyl groups in healthy cells or why they misbehave in some human diseases.","Published: November 24, 2021"

Cellular DNA is continuously exposed to both endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging agents, such as reactive oxygen species and UV radiation. To reduce the biological consequences of DNA damage, all living organisms have evolved mechanisms to tolerate and repair DNA damage to try to ensure that genetic information is accurately inherited. One such mechanism, called translesion synthesis (TLS), allows DNA replication to proceed through unrepaired DNA lesions. TLS involves highly accurate DNA synthesizing enzymes (replicative DNA polymerases) being temporarily replaced with specialized, low-fidelity TLS polymerases that can ensure cell survival at the expense of introducing mutations. The mutagenic and translesion synthetic activity of TLS polymerases can result in normal cells becoming cancerous or cancer cells becoming drug resistant.The Y-family TLS polymerase Pol K is able to perform DNA synthesis across several damaged bases and is recruited to DNA lesions by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Previous studies have shown that PCNA is regulated by ubiquitination.  The addition of a single ubiquitin molecule at lysine residue 164 (K164) of PCNA facilitates the recruitment and retention of TLS polymerases to damage sites, but the structural basis of the interaction between these polymerases and ubiquitinated PCNA is poorly understood,  says structural biologist Alfredo De Biasio from KAUST.De Biasio s group has been collaborating with the laboratory led by Samir Hamdan, an expert in single-molecule analysis of human DNA replication, since 2018. They have been using cryo-EM to investigate the three-dimensional structure and function of key protein complexes involved in DNA replication and repair. Their latest study describes cryo-EM reconstructions of full-length human Pol K bound to DNA, an incoming nucleotide, and unmodified PCNA or mono-ubiquitylated PCNA, at near-atomic resolution. They found that in the absence of DNA, the structure of Pol K bound to PCNA is highly flexible, suggesting that binding to DNA is required to form a rigid and active complex. Muhammad Tehseen, a senior researcher in Hamdan s group and the co-lead author of the study, has performed key functional studies elucidating how PCNA ubiquitination modulates the activity of Pol K. Our data provide a structural framework to explain how PCNA recruits a Y-family TLS polymerase to sites of DNA damage,  Tehseen explains. Because of the high degree of domain conservation between Y-family polymerases, some of the structural features observed in the Pol K-DNA-PCNA  complex are likely to apply to other TLS polymerase complexes. By understanding the interactions between the proteins forming these complexes and how they are regulated, we can identify ways to reduce or increase their function for medical applications,  he concludes.Reference: Lancey C, Tehseen M, Bakshi S, et al.

Some people can even rattle off reasons it keeps your muscles and joints strong, and how it fights off certain diseases. But how many people can tell you the story of why and how physical activity was built into human biology? A team of evolutionary biologists and biomedical researchers from Harvard are taking a run at it (sometimes literally) in a new study published in PNAS. The work lays out evolutionary and biomedical evidence showing that humans, who evolved to live many decades after they stopped reproducing, also evolved to be relatively active in their later years.  The researchers say that physical activity later in life shifts energy away from processes that can compromise health and toward mechanisms in the body that extend it. They hypothesize that humans evolved to remain physically active as they age and in doing so to allocate energy to physiological processes that slow the body s gradual deterioration over the years. This guards against chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even some cancers.  It s a widespread idea in Western societies that as we get older, it s normal to slow down, do less, and retire,  said Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel E. Lieberman, the paper s lead author. Our message is the reverse: As we get older, it becomes even more important to stay physically active.  The research team, which includes Aaron Baggish and I-Min Lee from Harvard Medical School, believes the paper is the first detailed evolutionary explanation for why lack of physical activity as humans age increases disease risk and reduces longevity. Baggish, 47, who also serves as team cardiologist for the New England Patriots and U.S. Soccer, and Lieberman, 57, are longtime running buddies and often discussed the ideas that went into the paper during 5-to-10-mile morning runs. The study uses humans ape cousins as a jumping off point. The researchers point out that apes, which usually live only about 35 to 40 years in the wild and rarely survive past menopause, are considerably less active than most humans, suggesting that there was selection in human evolution not just to live longer but also to be more physically active.  We evolved basically from couch potatoes,  said Lieberman, who has twice observed wild chimpanzees in Tanzania and been surprised by how much of their day is spent  sitting on their butts, digesting.  This is especially jarring when contrasted against contemporary hunter-gatherers, who average about 135 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day. That level of movement about six to ten times more than average Americans may be one of the keys to why hunter-gatherers who survive childhood tend to live about seven decades, approximately 20 years past the age at which humans generally stop having children. Fossil evidence indicates that these extended lifespans were common by 40,000 years ago, contrary to the belief that human lifespans until recently were short. The team emphasized that the key health benefit of physical activity is to extend the human healthspan, which is defined as the years of life spent in good health. Researchers examined two pathways by which lifelong physical activity reallocates energy to improve health. The first involves dealing excess energy away from potentially harmful mechanisms, like excess fat storage. The team also identified how physical activity allocates energy to repair and maintenance processes. The paper shows that besides burning calories, physical activity is physiologically stressful, causing damage to the body at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. The body s response to this damage, however, is essentially to build back stronger.  This includes repairing tears in muscle fibers, repairing cartilage damage, and healing microfractures. The response also causes the release of exercise-related antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, and enhances blood flow. In the absence of physical activity, these responses are activated less. The cellular and DNA repair processes have been shown to lower the risk of diabetes, obesity, cancer, osteoporosis, Alzheimer s, and depression.  The key take-home point is that because we evolved to be active throughout our lives, our bodies need physical activity to age well. In the past, daily physical activity was necessary in order to survive, but today we have to choose to exercise, that is do voluntary physical activity for the sake of health and fitness,  Lieberman said.  The research team, which includes the graduate students Timothy Kistner and Daniel Richard, hope the study makes that message harder to ignore.  Physical activity levels have been decreasing worldwide as machines and technology replace human labor. A recent study from Lieberman s lab showed that Americans are engaging in less physical activity than they did 200 years ago.  The researchers  advice? Get out of your chair and get in some exercise.   The key is to do something, and to try to make it enjoyable so you ll keep doing it,  Lieberman said. The good news is that you don t need to be as active as a hunter-gatherer. Even small amounts of physical activity just 10 or 20 minutes a day substantially lower your risk of mortality.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-neural-mechanisms-behind-slacklining-356116,The Neural Mechanisms Behind Slacklining From everyday movements to intense activities  the brain is constantly working to maintain the balance of the body  Researchers have now designed a method to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these tasks  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The human body constantly adapts its posture in response to its external environment. Known as  whole-body dynamic balance,  this is necessary for everything ranging from daily activities to more complex sports activities. Problems with whole-body dynamic balance can result in stumbles or falls. Naturally, the involvement of the whole body makes the neural networks behind this kind of postural control incredibly complex. Understanding the underlying neural mechanisms could prove valuable to sports training and rehabilitation following traumatic brain injuries such as stroke.However, the study of these neural networks is challenging and information on this front has been limited. In a new study published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers from Ritsumeikan University, Japan, have developed a new method for the investigation of whole-body dynamic balance mechanisms.  Our study opens the door to studying the neural mechanisms of motor learning  in situ  during activities like gymnastics and swimming without constraints,  says Associate Professor Kenji Ueta, who led the study.Repeated movements, such as motor learning exercises, alter the structural and functional connectivity between different regions in the brain. This is called  motor engram  or motor memory trace. The research team studied a group of 28 people to develop a motor engram of functional connectivity for slackline exercises. They took MRI images of the participants  brains before and after 30-min of slackline training and repeated the sequence with ergometer-based aerobic exercise. Using this as a control, they evaluated the changes to the brain brought about specifically by whole-body dynamic balance training.They found that slackline training significantly increased the  resting-state functional connectivity  (rs-FC) between several parts of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, parts of the sensorimotor cortex, the hippocampus, and the cingulate cortex brain regions associated with cognitive functions, motor tasks, memory, and mood, respectively. This suggested that whole-body dynamic balance training positively affects brain function as well.More significantly, however, they observed that these changes were associated with offline learning, i.e., they were retained in the brain for a short period after the exercise.  The discovery that changes in rs-FC in the brain are correlated with the offline process of balance learning implies that certain constraints that we previously held true   such as the idea that a participant s head needs to be fixed in place for us to evaluate their memory engrams effectively   are not necessary. This means that the neural mechanisms of motor learning can be studied during natural tasks using robotic devices, explains Ueta.What are the implications of these findings? While Ueta stresses that the study focused only on healthy young adults and more research would be required to see how whole-body dynamic balance training would affect other population groups, the results have potential applications in sports neuroscience and neurorehabilitation, enabling the development of more effective assessments and training programs. They can be used to create efficient training regimens for athletes or to develop treatment protocols that can help people rehabilitate and recover their motor functions more quickly, speculates Ueta.  A few years from now, we may even have tailor-made neuroscience-based training methods for sports and exercise, which will increase their enjoyability. Making exercise more fun will go a long way towards decreasing lifestyle disease, he concludes.Reference: Ueta K, Mizuguchi N, Sugiyama T, Isaka T, Otomo S.

(Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus to hold genetic materials.)  The research effort has implications for understanding the biochemical processes that are common to all animals, plants, and fungi. The open-access work appears Nov. 11 in Science.As part of a multi-institutional collaboration, the lab of David Baker at the UW Medicine Institute for Protein Design helped guide this new development. To really understand the cellular conditions that give rise to health and disease, it s essential to know how different proteins in a cell work together,  Baker said.  In this paper, we provide detailed information on protein interactions for nearly every core process in eukaryotic cells. This includes over a hundred interactions that have never been seen before. Proteins, the workhorses of all cells, rarely act alone. Different proteins often must fit together to form precise complexes that carry out specific tasks. These can include reading genes, digesting nutrients, and responding to signals from neighboring cells and the outside world. When protein complexes malfunction, disease can result. This work shows that deep learning can now generate real insights into decades-old questions in biology   not just what a particular protein looks like, but also which proteins come together to interact,  said senior author Qian Cong, assistant professor of biophysics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.To exhaustively map the interactions that give rise to protein complexes, a team of structural biologists from UW Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Harvard University, and several other institutions examined all known gene sequences in yeast. Using advanced statistical analyses, they identified pairs of genes that naturally acquire mutations in a linked fashion. They reasoned that such shared mutations are a sign that the proteins the genes encode must physically interact.The researchers also used new deep-learning software to model the three-dimensional shapes of these interacting proteins. RoseTTAFold, invented at UW Medicine, and AlphaFold, invented by the Alphabet subsidiary DeepMind, were both tapped to generate hundreds of detailed pictures of protein complexes. As computer methods become more powerful, it is easier than ever to generate large amounts of scientific data, but to make sense of it still requires scientific experts,  said Baker, who is a University of Washington School of Medicine professor of biochemistry.  So we recruited a village of expert biologists to interpret our 3D protein models. This is community science at its best. The hundreds of newly identified protein complexes provide rich insights into how cells function. For example, one complex contains the protein RAD51, which is known to play a key role in DNA repair and cancer progression in humans. Another includes the poorly understood enzyme glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase, which has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer in humans. Understanding how these and other proteins interact may open the door to the development of new medications for a wide range of health disorders.The protein structures generated in this work are available to download from the ModelArchive. The researchers thank and remember the late John Westbrook at the Protein Data Bank for his support in establishing formats and software code to allow efficient deposition of the models into the archive.

Inflammation originally evolved as the body s response to various pathogens (such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites). A recent study carried out at Tampere University in Finland discovered that the expression of an allergy-related receptor chain for proinflammatory IL-13 cytokine (IL-13Ra1) protects against experimental skin cancer.The key soluble transmitters of inflammation are a group of glycoproteins secreted by inflammatory cells called cytokines. In allergic diseases such as allergic asthma, atopic eczema and allergic rhinitis, the symptoms arise from what is known as the type 2 inflammatory response (type 2 inflammation). One of the key cytokines in type 2 inflammation is interleukin-13 (IL-13), which causes, among other things, bronchoconstriction, and increased mucus secretion in allergic asthma.The basic finding of a recently published study is that the expression of the IL-13 receptor associated with allergic inflammation protects against experimental skin cancer; the tumors formed earlier and were more abundant in the absence of IL-13Ra1 than in its presence.  Mice were used as experimental animals in the study. Murine T cells show little expression of the IL-13 receptor and, somewhat surprisingly, the study found that IL-13 receptor deficiency led to an increase in the number of immune-suppressing regulatory T cells during the development of skin cancer.According to the researchers, this fits well with the idea that excessive regulatory T-cell activity, by inhibiting the immune response against tumour cells, may provide  space  for cancer to develop. While the exact mechanism remains unclear, it is clear that when the IL-13 receptor expression on the cell surface is absent during the development of cancer, the number of regulatory T cells increases, and the immune response is suppressed (skewed). This then may leave  space  for cancer cells to grow and form tumours.The researchers also shed new light on the relationship between inflammation and cancer. We made the interesting observation that IL-13 receptor deficiency leads to aberrant neovascularization in skin tumours. The abnormal accumulation of inflammatory cells after IL-13Ra1 deficiency strongly suggests that there is a chronic oxygen deficiency in the tumours associated with this abnormal new blood vessel formation. This potentially drives the formation of cancer,  says Professor Tero J rvinen. This is an interesting finding because cellular signalling via the IL-13 receptor has been considered a very specific allergy-related phenomenon. Our discovery that IL-13 signalling pathway might also potentially be very centrally involved in the regulation of cellular oxygen supply remains to be studied but might in some ways change our thinking about the role of immune defence in the fight against cancer. It would be straightforward to think that it is the IL-13 receptor that regulates the body s immune defence (inflammatory response) against cancer,  J rvinen adds. However, it is possible that the IL-13 receptor regulates tumour neovascularization and that the immune response is a secondary response to the lack of oxygen that develops in the tumour,  Academy of Finland Research Fellow Ilkka Junttila continues.Junttila and J rvinen will therefore continue to investigate the current finding at the molecular level. It is easy to see two new lines of research opening up in the wake of this finding: both the basic immunological effect of immune response on cancer development and the molecule-level role of IL-13Ra1 in it, and on the other hand the effect of the IL-13 receptor on neovascularization,  J rvinen and Junttila say.Reference: Salomaa T, Pemmari T, M tt  J, et al.

We found participants with no memory impairments and with higher coffee consumption at the start of the study had lower risk of transitioning to mild cognitive impairment - which often precedes Alzheimer s disease - or developing Alzheimer s disease over the course of the study,  she said.Drinking more coffee gave positive results in relation to certain domains of cognitive function, specifically executive function which includes planning, self-control, and attention.Higher coffee intake also seemed to be linked to slowing the accumulation of the amyloid protein in the brain, a key factor in the development of Alzheimer s disease.Dr Gardener said although further research was needed, the study was encouraging as it indicated drinking coffee could be an easy way to help delay the onset of Alzheimer s disease. It s a simple thing that people can change,  she said. It could be particularly useful for people who are at risk of cognitive decline but haven t developed any symptoms. We might be able to develop some clear guidelines people can follow in middle age and hopefully it could then have a lasting effect.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Capable of integrating multiple streams of sensory information, the circuit employs just a few key neurons to sustain long-lasting behaviors, and yet flexibly switch between them as environmental conditions warrant. For a foraging worm, the decision to roam or to dwell is one that will strongly impact its survival.  said study senior author Steven Flavell, Lister Brothers Career Development Associate Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.  We thought that studying how the brain controls this crucial decision-making process could uncover fundamental circuit elements that may be deployed in many animals  brains. This approach of studying simple invertebrates to gain basic insights into how the brain functions has a long tradition in neuroscience, Flavell said. For example, studies of how a squid nerve propagates electrical impulses led to the key insight explaining how brain cells fire in virtually all animals.Though the critical component of brain circuitry identified by Flavell and colleagues may seem simple now that it has been revealed, finding it was anything but easy.

Immune responses to other human coronaviruses, which mostly only cause harmless colds, also provide some protection against SARS-CoV-2. This cross-reactive immune response is an important piece of the puzzle of how to achieve comprehensive coronavirus immunity, researchers at the University of Zurich have shown.The population s immunity to SARS-CoV-2, achieved either through infection or vaccination, is crucial to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. A team of researchers led by the University of Zurich (UZH) has now discovered another component that contributes to SARS-CoV-2 immunity   previous antibody responses to other, harmless coronaviruses.  People who have had strong immune responses to other human coronaviruses also have some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection,  says Alexandra Trkola, head of the Institute of Medical Virology at UZH. In their study, the researchers used a specially developed assay to analyze antibody levels against four other human coronaviruses in 825 serum samples taken before SARS-CoV-2 emerged. They also examined 389 samples from donors infected with SARS-CoV-2. Combining these analyses with computer-based models enabled the team to precisely predict how well the antibodies would bind to and neutralize invading viruses.The researchers were able to demonstrate that people who caught SARS-CoV-2 had lower levels of antibodies against coronaviruses that cause common colds compared to uninfected people. In addition, people with high levels of antibodies against harmless coronaviruses were less likely to have been hospitalized after catching SARS-CoV-2.  Our study shows that a strong antibody response to human coronaviruses increases the level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. So someone who has gained immunity to harmless coronaviruses is therefore also better protected against severe SARS-CoV-2 infections,  says Trkola. This type of immune response is referred to as cross-reactivity, and it also occurs with T cell responses,  the additional line of the immune system in the defense against infections. People are only fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 shortly after they have recovered from an infection or have received an effective vaccination. This is when antibody levels against the virus are still very high. As these levels drop over time, infection is no longer prevented, but the immunological memory quickly reactivates the body s defenses, the production of antibodies as well as the T cell defense.  Of course, immune responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 that are mounted by the memory cells are far more effective than cross-reactive responses. But even though the protection isn t absolute, cross-reactive immune responses shorten the infection and reduce its severity. And this is exactly what is also achieved through vaccination, just much, much more efficiently,  says Trkola.It is not yet known whether this cross-reactivity also works in the opposite direction. Whether immunity to SARS-CoV-2   achieved through vaccination, for example   also offers protection against other human coronaviruses still needs to be elucidated.  If SARS-CoV-2 immunity also offers some degree of protection from infection with other coronaviruses, we would be a significant step closer to achieving comprehensive protection against other coronaviruses, including any new variants,  the virologist explains. This idea is also supported by the fact that cross-reactive protection is not only based on antibodies, but very likely also on T cells.ReferenceAbela IA, Pasin C, Schwarzm ller M, et al.

Using influenza as a model, a team of researchers led by Penn State has developed a new technique that overcomes many of these roadblocks, and they say the tool may be useful for better assessments of exposure to a variety of viruses, including the ones that cause COVID-19 and pneumonia. Without an accurate picture of a population s exposure to a particular virus, we cannot effectively plan and implement public health interventions,  said Maciej Boni, associate professor of biology who led the study.In their study, which appeared on Nov. 18 in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers specifically investigated the attack rate for human influenza A virus in a tropical setting, which comprises two subtypes   H3N2 and H1N1   and multiple strains.According to Boni, an attack rate is an estimate of how many people have been infected with a particular disease, regardless of whether they had symptoms or whether they were tested or not. Accurately estimating the attack rate of a virus sounds like something epidemiologists should be able to do quite easily,  he said,  but there are at least four major complications. First, you need to pre-plan collections of blood samples, otherwise there s no way to get a snapshot of who in the population right now has antibodies and who doesn t. Second, when testing for antibodies, you cannot always differentiate someone who was infected from someone who was vaccinated. Third, antibodies wane, so you may not be able to tell if someone was infected if their antibody levels are low now. Finally, many pathogens circulate as groups of strains or groups of variants, and there may be no laboratory assay to test for general exposure to any of these variants. The team, which included researchers from Vietnam and the Netherlands, created a new method that resolves many of these problems and presents accurate general-population, attack-rate estimates for influenza A virus. To conduct their study, the researchers used a dataset of 24,402 general-population serum   or blood plasma   samples collected in central and southern Vietnam between 2009 to 2015 and assayed the samples for antibodies to eleven different strains of human influenza A, including the 1918 pandemic  Spanish Flu  strain and the 2009  swine flu  pandemic virus strain, which are within the H1N1 subtype. Next, they used this large set of antibody measurements to derive a  composite antibody measurement  across both subtypes of influenza and across all the different strains.  This composite measurement allowed us to more accurately estimate who had been infected by any strain and who hadn t,  said Boni.  This gives us a general picture of the disease burden of influenza in the tropical environment of southern and central Vietnam. The team s results suggest that, on average, 26% of the Vietnamese population is exposed to subtype H3N2 influenza every year, and 16% is exposed to subtype H1N1. These exposure rates, Boni said, are somewhat higher than the expected level of influenza exposure in temperate countries, all of which have winter flu seasons, but temperate country data have not yet been analyzed with this new approach. The future of antibody testing will be to move toward technologically advanced platforms that can test for multiple antibody types in a single blood sample,  said Marion Koopmans, co-lead author of the study and head of the Viroscience Department at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands.  With a small team, we were able to generate 270,000 antibody measurements in just two years. This is proof that this approach could work at a larger scale.The key synergy that allowed this study to go forward, the team said, was the combination of large pre-planned serum collections, which began in 2009, and a high-throughput microarray platform that allowed for large-scale testing of many different kinds of influenza antibodies. Pre-planning the serum collections and establishing a large, structured serum bank was the key to this study s success,  added Guy Thwaites, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  The serum bank that made this work possible has also allowed us to do rapid assessments of H7N9 avian influenza antibodies during the H7N9 outbreaks of April 2013 in China, as well as estimates of tetanus vaccine coverage, chikungunya virus circulation history and more. According to Boni, the next key steps in this  big data  approach to antibody testing are understanding the dynamics of immune waning. Our study population had almost zero influenza vaccination,  said Boni,  so we were able to use our antibody measurements as true indicators of past influenza infection, but we still need a better understanding of how to distinguish infected individuals from vaccinated individuals and how to include the effects of antibody waning into an analysis like this.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/researchers-create-new-pain-relieving-compounds-356097,Researchers Create New Pain Relieving Compounds Scientists have designed new pain relieving compounds that  like morphine and other drugs  provide pain relief via activation of opioid receptors  but without inducing unwanted side effects  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Scientists at Scripps Research in Florida have created a collection of new pain-relieving compounds that, like morphine and other drugs, provide relief via activation of opioid receptors, but without inducing many dangerous and unwanted side-effects that have driven opioid-related overdose and deaths.Writing Nov. 22 in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, biochemist Laura Bohn, PhD, and colleagues describe a compound called SR-17018, which activates the same pain-relieving receptor as opioid drugs including morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl; however it binds to opioid receptors in a different way from those drugs, leaving the opioid receptor open and available to the body s own natural pain-relieving substances, apparently augmenting pain relief. In a study published earlier this year (Pantouli et al., 2021, Neuropharmacolgy), the group showed that the compound performed particularly well in mouse studies of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, the scientists write.In the current report, the authors have made strides in understanding why these drugs seem so different.  We demonstrate that these compounds bind to a different site on the receptor than a typical opioid. Because of that, they seem to leave the receptor on and yet still receptive to endogenous opioids,  says Bohn, who chairs the Scripps Research Department of Molecular Medicine in Jupiter, Florida.  In neuropathy pain, we show they are far superior to morphine and oxycodone; moreover, SR-17018 does not decrease breathing. The authors also described a related compound that, being more potent, induces respiratory suppression, but at higher doses than are needed to relieve pain.  Importantly for safety, this compound, SR-14968, proved responsive to overdose rescue medication naloxone, when given at doses high enough to suppress breathing.Perhaps most importantly for people with severe chronic pain, SR-17018 showed an ability to provide sustained pain relief over time without development of tolerance, the problem of reduced efficacy over time that requires increased doses, increasing danger of overdose.The paper s first author, Edward L. Stahl, notes that the new compounds are referred to as  biased agonists,  because they activate the mu opioid receptor in a way that preferentially engages one of its signaling pathways, the one that provides pain relief, over other pathways such as those that lead to suppressed breathing. The compound SR-17018 is the first biased agonist of the mu opioid receptor that does not lead to tolerance with chronic use,  says Stahl, a senior staff scientist in the Bohn lab.  This is a desirable feature for potential use in the context of chronic, severe pain. The new compounds were engineered to avoid the  beta-arrestin  signaling cascade that leads to opioids  dangerous and unwanted traits, including respiratory suppression, a cause of overdose, and constipation, he adds.Opioid medications remain a go-to treatment for severe pain, whether it s from surgery, a sudden injury, or nerve damage. But as opioid addiction and overdose deaths reach new highs in the United States, the need for safer ways to treat acute pain has grown more urgent, Bohn says.  In work spanning more than two decades, Bohn and her team have demonstrated the feasibility of untangling the pain-relieving properties of opioids from their negative traits. Her work has not only broadened understanding of how opioid receptors work to direct multiple physiological responses, it has pointed the field toward potentially safer options for providing relief from severe pain.Bohn s research group has engineered multiple compounds which, in mouse studies, diminish activation of beta-arrestin signaling. Additional problems of opioids continue to pose challenges, including dependance, or addiction. The fact that SR-17018 avoids tolerance with chronic use is good news, Bohn says. Also good news is how it wears off, she adds. The compound showed a nice, slow tapering. That, in itself, may help curb some of the dependence problems. A drug like morphine provides a quick rush then a quick clear, and you need the rush again. Going forward, the team is continuing to refine and test the compounds so that they could eventually be tested in a clinical setting. Severe and chronic pain associated with surgery, nerve damage, and trauma require strong pain relief,  Bohn says.  Safer solutions are needed. We believe these new compounds are a big step in the right direction. Reference: Stahl EL, et al.

We tried to find out which plastic particles penetrate better into living cells, which ones are more detrimental, where they are localized, and how to distinguish one type of plastic in the body from another,  says Dr. G lnur Fakhrullina, Research Associate of KFU s Bionanotechnology Lab and the principal investigator of this project.The technique used in the publication is based on the imaging the live cells using dark-field microscopy. The imaging data is then sifted through deep-learning algorithms which help to identify the particles in cells.  For the model study, we used polystyrene particles pigmented by various dyes and incubated together with human cells. To visualize the particles in a suspension and within the cells, we used high contrast dark-field microscopy at high magnifications. The data were then uploaded into a residual neural network (ResNet) for learning and testing. The neural network model appeared to determine the class of particles with an accuracy comparable to that of spectral analysis,  adds Dr. Fakhrullina. The applied method can be used to screen microplastics in a variety of samples. It s very sensitive and can reduce the time-consuming data acquisition and processing steps characteristic to hyperspectral imaging, which can be omitted in this case.  Dark-field microscopy provides images having a large number of distinctive features for very small objects. In a bright field, microparticles are either not visible at all or seen as homogeneous spots, having no discernible features. The more information about particles is contained in the pictures, the simpler it is for the neural networks to handle them, and the results are better,  explains Ilnur Ishmukhametov, co-author and PhD student at the Bionanotechnology Lab. The accuracy of detection for 1-micron polystyrene particles was 93%.

Dr. Weyand is senior author of the new publication. Based on data collected over more than 20 years of work, Dr. Weyand's team began investigating helper T cells. They coordinate immune response, but they also can remain in the body after infection to help the immune system respond more quickly should the invader return. But it's not just previous encounters with pathogens that these cells remember. ""Unfortunately, these T cells can also memorize their own mistakes, and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, they lead the attack against the joints,"" says Dr. Weyand.In collaboration with Mayo Clinic patients, as well as their rheumatologists and surgical teams, researchers found that T cells are a significant source of tumor necrosis factor. They turned to cell and mouse models to determine why and eventually discovered that the T cells had a defect in their mitochondria. ""We made the observations that T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis have low-performing mitochondria, and by screening the cells for their mitochondrial products, we found that the rheumatoid arthritis T cells lack the amino acid aspartate,"" explains Dr. Weyand. Through a series of experiments, the researchers discovered that aspartate acts as a messenger between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. When mitochondria decrease aspartate communication with the endoplasmic reticulum, that organelle assumes the mitochondria are under stress. The endoplasmic reticulum begins to expand and overproduce proteins in response, one of which is tumor necrosis factor. ""In essence, TNF hyperproduction is a result of a metabolic defect,"" explains Dr. Weyand. ""Misnourished T cells dedicate themselves to TNF production and become highly efficient pro-inflammatory effector cells.""Equipped with this knowledge, Dr. Weyand hopes researchers will develop new therapeutic strategies to combat excess TNF. ""This will be of great importance for our patients because many become resistant to standard TNF blockers. Of equal importance is the recognition that metabolic defects within cells can lead to disease,"" says Dr. Weyand. ""We want to develop strategies that can repair the mitochondrial defect, replenish the aspartate and successfully suppress tissue inflammation.""ReferenceWu B, Zhao TV, Jin K, et al.

Circadian clocks help regulate a number of different processes in the human body, including sleep-wake cycles, body temperature, blood pressure, food intake, hormone release, cardiac function, immune responses and metabolism. On the cellular level, circadian clocks also play a role in cellular proliferation, metabolism and DNA damage repair. Though researchers have known for years that changes to the circadian clock s daily rhythms can lead to all sorts of diseases, including various cancers, we don t yet know exactly what is going wrong at the cellular level when the circadian clock is altered. We can generate static snapshots of a cell,  says Farkas,  but they don t tell you all that much. We need tools to help us track the dynamic changes occurring inside a cell over time.  Only then can researchers begin to see what happens when the circadian clock is altered.Farkas s team plans a two-pronged approach over the next five years. First, they will develop new methods of tracking the production of proteins the cell s building blocks including in cases of altered circadian rhythms. To do this, Farkas and her colleagues will continue to develop tools, which will allow researchers to watch as proteins are generated by multiple genes at the same time.  These next-generation tools, called  reporters,  will let us track the process for different components, giving us a clearer, more complete picture. Farkas and her colleagues are also generating new approaches to  perturb,  or alter, the circadian rhythms of the cells by directly targeting the core circadian proteins. By using their reporters to track the proteins that are at the heart of the cell s circadian clock, the team will be able to alter circadian rhythms and watch how cells respond including responses that lead to the development of cancer. Cancer is a complicated, dynamic process,  says Farkas, whose lab at UMass Amherst is supported by the Institute for Applied Life Sciences (IALS), which combines deep and interdisciplinary expertise from 29 departments on the UMass Amherst campus to translate fundamental research into innovations that benefit human health and well-being. We need systems, like the one we re developing, to track its development.  This article has been republished from the following materials. Note: material may have been edited for length and content.

The discovery could lead to new treatments for Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases.The cells in your body are constantly renewing themselves, with older cells aging and dying as new ones are being born. But sometimes that process goes awry. Occasionally damaged cells linger. Called senescent cells, they hang around, acting as a bad influence on other cells nearby. Their bad influence changes how the neighboring cells handle sugars or proteins and so causes metabolic problems.Type 2 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease in the US. About 34 million people, or one out of every 10 inhabitants of the US, suffers from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most people with diabetes have insulin resistance, which is associated with obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet. But it also has a lot to do with senescent cells in people s body fat, according to new findings by UConn Health School of Medicine s Ming Xu and colleagues. And clearing away those senescent cells seems to stop diabetic behavior in obese mice, they report in the 22 November issue of Cell Metabolism. Ming Xu, assistant professor in the UConn Center on Aging and the department of Genetics and Genome Sciences at UConn Health, led the research, along with UConn Health researchers Lichao Wang and Binsheng Wang as major contributors.Alleviating the negative effects of fat on metabolism was a dramatic result, the researchers said. If a therapy worked that well in humans, it would be a game-changing treatment for diabetes.Xu and his colleagues tested the efficacy of a combination of experimental drugs, dasatinib and quercetin. Dasatinib and quercetin had already been shown to extend lifespan and good health in aged mice. In this study, they found these drugs can kill senescent cells from cultures of human fat tissue. The tissue was donated by individuals with obesity who were known to have metabolic troubles. Without treatment, the human fat tissues induced metabolic problems in immune-deficient mice. After treatment with dasatinib and quercetin, the harmful effects of the fat tissue were almost eliminated. These drugs can make human fat healthy, and that could be great,  says Xu.  The results were very impressive and cleared the route for potential clinical trials. Xu and his colleagues at UConn Health and the Mayo Clinic are now pursuing using the dasatinib and quercetin combination in clinical trials to see if the drugs can improve Type 2 diabetes in human patients.  Although these preclinical results were very promising, large scale clinical trials are absolutely critical to examine the efficacy and safety of these drugs in humans before clinical use , emphasized Xu.The research team is also focusing on a previously unexplored senescent cell population. These senescent cells express high levels of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and one of the key markers for cellular senescence. By using a newly developed mouse model, Xu s team demonstrated that clearance of these senescent cells once every month is effective for both slowing down the development of diabetes and alleviating developed diabetic symptoms in obese mice. Xu says previous research has focused on different cell markers, but that the effects of clearing away cells highly expressing p21 was so marked on alleviating diabetes that this marker should get more attention.

This enables study of the relationship between mouth and lung microbes and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that may allow for the development of new treatments.The study, published in the journal NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes, is the first to test the accuracy of these saliva-based, at-home COVID test kits in measuring the oral microbiome, the bacteria found in animals and humans. We inhale a small amount of our saliva every day, so it makes sense that some of the microbes that live in our mouths would end up in our lungs,  said lead author Abigail Armstrong, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine (CABM) at Rutgers.  By studying the mouth microbiome in these banked samples of people with or without COVID-19, we can get an idea of how the microbial environment in the mouth and lung might impact the disease. Salvia tests use preservatives to maintain genetic material (RNA) in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enable fast results. However, until now, it was unknown if it also would preserve the bacterial genetic material.To test the ability to measure the microbiome in the saliva COVID test kits, the researchers collected saliva samples from 22 participants with the kits and in empty tubes. Six of the participants also came back the next days to give another set of samples so the researchers could study their microbiome over time. They then compared their ability to measure the microbiome in both types of saliva collection.They found that the samples collected in the COVID testing kits still allowed for accurate measuring of the bacteria and gave a more stable picture of the microbiome over time compared to samples collected in kits without a preservative. These findings mean that saliva collected for COVID testing can also be used to measure microbes in the mouth and help further our understanding of the systemic effects of COVID infection and also help researchers to develop probiotic- or microbiome-centered therapies to help treat COVID-19. This work puts us into a position to examine the many saliva specimens we have obtained from Rutgers study subjects volunteering to participate in COVID investigations,  said senior author Martin Blaser, CABM director.Veenat Parmar, Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, was a co-author of the study, which was supported by Danone Inc. and by the National Institutes of Health.Reference: Armstrong AJS, Parmar V, Blaser MJ.

To help control future outbreaks and identify at-risk individuals, it is important to understand the exact make-up of the immune response to COVID. Our test accurately detects both the T-cell and antibody response to the virus in one blood sample. Together these indicators represent a powerful measure of immunity from COVID-19. The test can be made widely available, is easy to employ and cost effective, and should play a very useful role in monitoring this pandemic, for instance by identifying individuals at greater need of booster jabs. Antibody testing was seen as crucial to easing lockdown during the pandemic   but antibodies are just one arm of the body s immune response and in some individuals this response is weak and short-lived. Scientists believe T-cell immunity plays a much greater role in protecting people from future infection, however large-scale testing has proven more challenging.In this study, the researchers took a small sample of blood from individuals of all ages, 68 with underlying cancer and 231 healthy donors. They stimulated T-cells with small pieces of the virus called peptides; the T-cells recognise these peptides if the individual has been previously infected (or vaccinated) and produce chemicals named cytokines which can be easily measured.The study also monitored the size of the T-cell and antibody responses in a group of individuals tested before, during and after the UK s COVID-19 vaccination campaign. While both vaccine doses were required to maximise the T-cell response against the virus, the study found previously infected individuals required only one dose to achieve comparable immune responses.The test proved most useful in monitoring immune responses in patients considered more at risk from COVID-19, even after vaccination. The study found the second vaccine dose was essential for cancer patients. Among cancer patients recruited from Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff, two doses induced T-cell and antibody responses to equivalent levels as healthy donors.However, it is clear that in some cancer patients there is a dramatic fall of in immune responses at three months, not seen in healthy controls, and highlights the importance of monitoring these responses.Professor Andrew Godkin, co-senior author from Cardiff University and the University Hospital of Wales, said:  Without this sort of information there is uncertainty around whether repeated booster vaccinations will be required in future, and who in particular will need them. This data is crucial for understanding how and when to offer re-vaccinations to different groups. The research team will also monitor whether T-cell and antibody responses induced by vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 mutant variants, including the Delta variant that is currently the most prevalent in the UK.Danny Altmann, Professor of Immunology at Imperial University, said:  This study is important in both demonstrating the ease of measuring immune responses using a whole blood approach, but also the importance of monitoring susceptible individuals and healthy controls for differences in vaccine response and future potential loss of protection. Long-term monitoring will be crucial to understand and quantify this problem. Reference: Scurr MJ, Zelek WM, Lippiatt G, et al.

This is because people with cystic fibrosis can experience a decrease in the flow of bile fluid, which is secreted by the liver that helps with digestion and detoxification. The bile duct is a tube-like structure found in the liver that carries bile to the small intestine. The loss of flow leads to liver dysfunction. As a result, some patients require liver transplantation. Until now, we have not had a good scientific model to study the human liver s bile duct system physiologically,  says senior study author Shinichiro Ogawa, an affiliate scientist at the McEwen Stem Cell Institute and Ajmera Transplant Centre, University Health Network (UHN), and an assistant professor in U of T s department of laboratory medicine and pathobiology. In order to study a disease in a dish at the basic cellular and molecular level, we need functional cells. The fact that we can derive these functional cells from stem cells gives us a totally different way of evaluating and treating defective cells. The cells that the researchers generated have the properties of mature, functional cholangiocyte cells, which are the cells that make up the bile duct. Cholangiocytes play a role in several chronic and progressive liver diseases that have few medical treatment options. These diseases are responsible for about 20 per cent of adult liver transplants and most pediatric liver transplants.  Not much is known about the bile duct disorders that can lead to liver disease, but Ogawa says this research may lead to a deeper understanding of the specific mechanisms of the disease, as well as being a powerful tool for finding new treatments.Ultimately, the researchers say it may be possible to develop therapies that involve transplanting the cells into a patient who has bile duct disease, bypassing the need for a transplant.The work is funded through Medicine by Design s large team projects. Ogawa and his co-investigator Christine Bear, a senior scientist in molecular medicine at The Hospital for Sick Children and a U of T professor of physiology, are part of a team focused on harnessing the liver s power to regenerate.Funded by a $114-million grant from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, Medicine by Design is a strategic research initiative at U of T and its affiliated hospitals that is working at the convergence of engineering, medicine and science to catalyze transformative discoveries in regenerative medicine and accelerate them toward clinical impact.Ogawa says it was the work of many different researchers and labs that brought the study together.Beginning with pluripotent stem cells, which have the capacity to give rise to most of the cell types in the human body, Mina Ogawa, scientific associate at the McEwen Stem Cell Institute, was able to identify methods to efficiently guide the stem cells through the process of changing into cholangiocytes. Donghe Yang   a PhD candidate in the lab of Gordon Keller, who is director of UHN s McEwen Stem Cell Institute   analyzed the stem cell-derived cholangiocytes at a single cell level to compare to human cholangiocytes in the liver.The team used earlier Medicine by Design-funded research on the Human Liver Map to confirm that the cells they developed had the characteristics of mature cells, which are more functional and have more therapeutic applications as opposed to immature cells.Researchers in Bear s lab   Janet (Jia-Xin) Jiang, research project co-ordinator, and Sunny Xia, PhD student   were able to demonstrate that the cells were functional and responded to natural environmental cues like the force associated with fluid transport. Their work also showed that newly developed stem cell-derived cholangiocytes could, in the future, play a powerful role in developing organ-specific therapies. These studies highlight the importance of generating mature cells from stem cells that faithfully mimic the functional properties of the native tissue,  says Bear.  We can better understand the real effect of disease-causing mutations and cystic fibrosis therapies, especially in those hard-to-access organs .Bear adds that this work was made possible through an interdisciplinary effort.  This work is an excellent example of how collaboration among the research teams funded by Medicine by Design can help to target cutting-edge basic research in a way that will make a difference for patients. Ogawa says the power of stem cell technology is to be able to identify and correct the disease at a cellular level. One day, this research could lead to the development of personalized, customized treatments for other bile duct disorders. Ogawa adds that the McEwen Stem Cell Institute is a world leader in producing different cell types from these stem cells.Reference: Ogawa M, Jiang JX, Xia S, et al.

It is the first drug to be licensed for the condition in nearly two decades, and the first to be based on the contentious  amyloid hypothesis  of the disease. That approval was contentious and came with caveats   not only did the FDA s decision go against the advice of its independent advisory board, but it also required Biogen to conduct a post-approval randomized clinical trial to produce more data on the drug s efficacy.     While many patient groups, such as the Alzheimer s Association, released statements suggesting they were delighted with the drug s progress, negative reaction from some experts began a precipitous dip for the drug. There are more twists and turns ahead, suggests a statement from Biogen, which reflects on the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s reaction to the drug. The CHMP must give its approval before aducanumab can be made available to Europe-based patients. What is adunacumab? The brains of AD patients are often found to be riddled by amyloid plaques that disrupt healthy neuronal function and cause toxicity, ultimately leading to cognitive decline. Aducanumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to bind to aggregated forms of  -amyloid to clear it. The drug was originally developed by Neurimmune via a reverse translational medicine approach, in which the antibody was extracted from older individuals that have not developed AD.While not yet an outright  no  to aducanumab, the  negative trend vote  that Biogen says it received certainly does not bode well for the formal opinion that CMHP is scheduled to adopt at its December meeting (December 13-16).The committee was voting whether to approve aducanumab under its trade name, ADUHELM, an injection of a 100 mg/mL solution of the monoclonal antibody, which targets the amyloid-beta protein thought to play a central role in the disease s pathology.Dr. Priya Singhal, head of global safety and regulatory sciences and interim head of research and development at Biogen, commented in a press release,  While we are disappointed with the trend vote, we strongly believe in the strength of our data and that aducanumab has the potential to make a positive and meaningful difference for people and families affected by Alzheimer s disease. In a pair of earlier clinical trials, aducanumab showed an impressive clearance of the amyloid protein, but only modest improvements in cognition that critics said were based on flimsy data.David Thomas, head of policy at Alzheimer s Research UK, commented on the announcement in a release by the UK Science Media Centre,  We urgently need new treatments for Alzheimer s disease, but it s vital that regulators judge that any new treatment is safe and effective. Results of aducanumab s phase III trials, EMERGE and ENGAGE, have sparked much debate among the research community about how to judge the effectiveness of any new Alzheimer s treatment."" The FDA s approval of aducanumab in the US was based on the drug s ability to clear the hallmark Alzheimer s protein amyloid from the brain. As part of this approval the regulator now requires further trials to be carried out to ensure that aducanumab brings long-term improvement to people s memory, thinking and day-to-day lives. This cautious tone, which was echoed in an SMC statement from Dr Richard Oakley, associate director at the dementia charity Alzheimer s Society, contrasted with a scathing response from Robert Howard, a professor of old age psychiatry at University College London who has previously been critical of Biogen s trials for the drug. Howard said,  This is absolutely the decision that we should have expected from the EMA's expert advisory panel and is consistent with the FDA's Advisory Committee who voted unanimously 12 months ago against approval of aducanumab because of a lack of demonstrable efficacy in the pivotal phase 3 trials ENGAGE and EMERGE.""He added,  The FDA's Accelerated Approval of aducanumab, solely on the grounds that it was reasonable to expect that reduction in amyloid would lead to improvement in the course of Alzheimer's disease, despite all the evidence indicating no meaningful correlation between amyloid reduction and symptom improvement, has been highly controversial and has called into question the impartiality of the FDA and its Staff,"" Before concluding, "" I would anticipate that [the] EMA, when they meet in December, will not grant a license to aducanumab. Aducanumab is a treatment without convincing efficacy, with serious associated adverse effects and a high financial cost. On the basis of the available evidence and in the best interests of people with Alzheimer's disease, their families and those who care for them, EMA and MHRA should not approve a license for aducanumab.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology have now demonstrated in mice that the brain relies on the body s feedback to regulate fear. The brain s insular cortex strongly reacts to stimuli signaling danger. However, when the body freezes in response to fear, the heartbeat slows down leading to attenuated insular cortex activity. Processing these opposing signals helps the insular cortex to keep fear in balance. The body s reactions are thus actively used to regulate emotions and are much more than passive emotional responses.We usually experience fear as extremely unpleasant. Nevertheless, this emotion has a crucial function: it prevents us from engaging in too risky behaviors. However, this only works if fear is kept within a healthy range. Too intense fear can severely impair our daily lives, as in the case of anxiety disorders or panic attacks. So how can fear be kept in balance? It seems obvious that bodily signals may play a crucial role, as fear causes noticeable changes in our bodies: the heart beats faster or breathing becomes shallower. However, how exactly the brain processes this information to ultimately regulate emotions like fear is still largely unknown.Scientists in Nadine Gogolla's research group have now gained important new insights into the influence of body-brain interactions on emotion regulation. They focused on the insular cortex, a brain region that processes both positive and negative emotions. In addition, it receives information from the body, for example from the heart or the lungs. The researchers played a tone to mice and combined it with an unpleasant stimulus. After some time, the mice became fearful of the tone, which was expressed through  freezing    a typical fear behavior that is shared among humans and many other species. When the tone was no longer paired with the unpleasant stimulus, the mice gradually learned not to be afraid of it anymore.","Published: November 22, 2021"

There is currently no treatment to protect the brains of a growth-restricted baby,  Dr Wixey said. Up to 50 per cent of them have long term issues ranging from mild learning and behavioural disorders all the way through to cerebral palsy. We know there s inflammation in the brain and it doesn t cease once these babies are born.   Our study has shown we could reduce inflammation and ongoing brain injury by treating these newborns on the day they re born using a combination of two types of stem cells   endothelial colony forming cells and mesenchymal stromal cells   isolated from a healthy human placenta. About 32 million growth-restricted babies are born around the world each year, with around 10 per cent of newborns in Australia affected.These babies fail to grow normally in the womb, often because they haven t received enough nutrients and oxygen from the placenta. Our research has found after just three days, the combination stem cell therapy not only reduced inflammation but also, importantly, appeared to repair damaged blood vessels in the brain in animal models,  Dr Wixey said.  We re really excited by the outcomes of this study and we hope it ll improve these babies  lives long term. The patent technique for harvesting stem cells from the placenta was co-invented by UQ s Professor Kiarash Khosrotehrani and Dr Jatin Patel   now at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). This has been a fantastic collaborative study and demonstrates the exciting potential of stem cell therapy in the near future in treating unwell babies,  Dr Patel said. We are now working towards scaling up our patented stem cell technology, that will result in greater quantities of cells to drive and expand the preclinical animal studies with the aim of progressing towards a human trial.

The proper reduction of IIS leads to longevity in animals but often causes defects in multiple health parameters including impaired motility, reproduction, and growth.The research team found that a specific amino acid change in the PTEN protein improves health status while retaining the longevity conferred by reduced IIS. They used the roundworm C. elegans, an excellent model animal that has been widely used for aging research, mainly because of its very short normal lifespan of about two to three weeks. The PTEN protein is a phosphatase that removes phosphate from lipids as well as proteins. Interestingly, the newly identified amino acid change delicately recalibrated the IIS by partially maintaining protein phosphatase activity while reducing lipid phosphatase activity. As a result, the amino acid change in the PTEN protein maintained the activity of the longevity-promoting transcription factor Forkhead Box O (FOXO) protein while restricting the detrimental upregulation of another transcription factor, NRF2, leading to long and healthy life in animals with reduced IIS.Professor Lee said,  Our study raises the exciting possibility of simultaneously promoting longevity and health in humans by slightly tweaking the activity of one protein, PTEN.

New research led by plant biologists at the University of California, Davis, published Nov. 19 in Science Advances, shows the underlying mechanism behind eliminating half the genome and could make for easier and more rapid breeding of crop plants with desirable traits such as disease resistance.The work stems from a discovery made over a decade ago by the late Simon Chan, associate professor of plant biology in the UC Davis College of Biological Sciences, and colleagues.Plants, like other sexual organisms, inherit a matching set of chromosomes from each parent. In order to transmit a favorable trait, such as pest or drought resistance, to all their offspring, the plant would have to carry the same genetic variant on each chromosome. But creating plants that  breed true  in this way can take generations of cross-breeding.In 2010, Chan and postdoctoral fellow Ravi Maruthachalam serendipitously discovered a way to eliminate the genetic contribution from one parent while breeding the lab plant Arabidopsis. They had modified a protein called CENH3, found in the centromere, a structure in the center of a chromosome. When they tried to cross wild-type Arabidopsis with plants with modified CENH3, they got plants with half the normal number of chromosomes. The part of the genome from one parent plant had been eliminated to create a haploid plant.That work was published in Nature in March 2010, setting off efforts to achieve the same result in crop plants such as maize, wheat and tomato.","Published: November 22, 2021"

Taking advantage of the extremely high sensitivity in the axial (vertical) direction, SPR can track the particle's axial motions with sub-nanometer precision, which is much more precise than regular microscopy imaging,  Wang says.  We demonstrated that this feature can be used to study the details of molecular binding events at the single molecule-level and also for processing multiple signals at once. The new study appears in the current issue of the journal ACS Sensors and has been selected as an ACS Editors' Choice, due to its potential for broad public interest.","Published: November 22, 2021"

But the findings of a new study, led by Salk Associate Professor Sreekanth Chalasani, are more than just a novelty; they help the scientists better understand how the brain functions and integrates information. We found some unexpected things when we started looking at the effect of these sensory stimuli on individual cells and connections within the worms  brains,  says Chalasani, member of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory and senior author of the new work, published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology on November 9, 2021.Chalasani is interested in how, at a cellular level, the brain processes information from the outside world. Researchers can t simultaneously track the activity of each of the 86 billion brain cells in a living human but they can do this in the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which has only 302 neurons. Chalasani explains that in a simple animal like C. elegans, researchers can monitor individual neurons as the animal is carrying out actions. That level of resolution is not currently possible in humans or even mice.Chalasani s team set out to study how C. elegans neurons react to smelling each of five different chemicals: benzaldehyde, diacetyl, isoamyl alcohol, 2-nonanone, and sodium chloride. Previous studies have shown that C. elegans can differentiate these chemicals, which, to humans, smell roughly like almond, buttered popcorn, banana, cheese, and salt. And while researchers know the identities of the small handful of sensory neurons that directly sense these stimuli, Chalasani s group was more interested in how the rest of the brain reacts.The researchers engineered C. elegans so that each of their 302 neurons contained a fluorescent sensor that would light up when the neuron was active. Then, they watched under a microscope as they exposed 48 different worms to repeated bursts of the five chemicals. On average, 50 or 60 neurons activated in response to each chemical.By looking at basic properties of the datasets such as how many cells were active at each time point Chalasani and his colleagues couldn t immediately differentiate between the different chemicals. So, they turned to a mathematical approach called graph theory, which analyzes the collective interactions between pairs of cells: When one cell is activated, how does the activity of other cells change in response?This approach revealed that whenever C. elegans was exposed to sodium chloride (salt), there was first a burst of activity in one set of neurons likely the sensory neurons but then about 30 second later, triplets of other neurons began to strongly coordinate their activities. These same distinct triplets weren t seen after the other stimuli, letting the researchers accurately identify based only on the brain patterns when a worm had been exposed to salt. C. elegans seems to have attached a high value to sensing salt, using a completely different circuit configuration in the brain to respond,  says Chalasani.  This might be because salt often represents bacteria, which is food for the worm. The researchers next used a machine-learning algorithm to pinpoint other, more subtle, differences in how the brain responded to each of the five chemicals. The algorithm was able to learn to differentiate the neural response to salt and benzaldehyde but often confused the other three chemicals. Whatever analysis we ve done, it s a start but we re still only getting a partial answer as to how the brain discriminates these things,  says Chalasani.Still, he points out that the way the team approached the study looking at the brain s network-wide response to a stimulus, and applying graph theory, rather than just focusing on a small set of sensory neurons and whether they re activated paves the way toward more complex and holistic studies of how brains react to stimuli.The researchers  ultimate goal, of course, isn t to read the minds of microscopic worms, but to gain a deeper understanding of how humans encode information in the brain and what happens when this goes awry in sensory processing disorders and related conditions like anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders and others.Reference: How JJ, Navlakha S, Chalasani SH.

In this study, researchers from Japan have found that stimulation at specific frequencies can modulate thought processes related to problem solving.In a study published this month in Scientific Reports, researchers from the University of Tsukuba have revealed that a non-invasive form of brain stimulation called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS, can be used to modulate brain rhythms and cognitive behavior related to  giving-up  during problem solving.rTMS has been found to increase the synchronization of brain rhythms during cognitive tasks. Because specific brain rhythms are related to aspects of cognition, this could have great potential in helping people to enhance their cognitive abilities, something the researchers at the University of Tsukuba aimed to address. Prefrontal theta rhythms are known to be associated with cognitive control and conflict resolution, while alpha rhythms are related to the generation of new ideas during problem solving,  says lead author of the study Professor Masahiro Kawasaki.  Because rTMS can be used to alter neural activity, we wanted to investigate how stimulation at specific frequencies could affect problem-solving behavior. To do this, the researchers examined the relationship between brain oscillations and cognitive  giving-up  while participants performed problem-solving tasks. Then, they examined the effects of rTMS on brain oscillations and task performance. The task involved solving riddles, and the participants were allowed to indicate when they  gave up  on the task. We found the theta rhythm in the frontal lobe of the brain was associated with  giving-up , while the alpha rhythm was associated with successful problem solving,  explains Professor Kawasaki.Next, the researchers applied rTMS at specific frequencies while the participants completed the same cognitive task, and measured brain waves and task performance. The results were exciting,  says Professor Kawasaki.  Theta-frequency rTMS increased theta amplitudes and decreased  giving-up  behaviors, and alpha-frequency rTMS increased alpha amplitudes but had no effect on  giving-up . This is important evidence that rTMS can be used to modulate brain oscillatory activity and behaviors related to  giving-up  processes. During rumination, which is a common feature of depression, adaptive  giving-up  behaviors can be suppressed. For instance, individuals may have trouble deciding to  give up  and focus on something else when a certain behavior is not leading to the desired outcome. This research shows how modulating neural rhythms such as alpha and theta could decrease rumination, and thus treat symptoms of depression. Furthermore, this study is an important example of how rTMS can be used to change behavior related to cognitive performance via the modulation of task-related brain rhythms.Reference: Miyauchi E, Kawasaki M.

With the limited efficacy of commercially available drugs, the need for novel antifungal compounds is on the rise. The Wang research team examined the structural dynamics of fungal polysaccharides and their responses to cell wall stress. Specifically, the team examined the cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus, a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals.The research team coupled its expertise in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with a functional genomics approach using multiple mutants of Aspergillus fumigatus, each of which selectively eliminates a single type of structural carbohydrate at one time.  This research strategy allowed us to evaluate the structural role of each major carbohydrate by tracking the changes in cell wall structure after the removal of a component,  Wang said.  The spectroscopy method provided atomic resolution on the structure of polysaccharides and associated proteins using intact fungal cell walls free from any treatment that might perturb the native status of these biomolecules.  The data led to the development of a revised model of fungal cell wall organization and the assembly of five categories of polysaccharides, including chitin,  -glucan, mannan,  -glucan, and galactosaminogalactan. The findings confirmed an overlooked but prominent role of  -glucans in the cell wall structuration. The mutants produce stiffer and more water-proof cell walls for better protection, which might be a general mechanism used by these microbes to handle stresses.The research involved an interdisciplinary collaboration with scientists from Institut Pasteur in France, University of Crete in Greece, as well as the Guangxi Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Sciences in China. Scientists involved in this study also utilized instrumentation at the National Science Foundation's National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Fla. Now that we revealed the structural principles used by fungi to respond to cell wall defects, it is time to explore how fungi reconstruct this carbohydrate armor to survive through antifungal treatments and severe environments,  said Wang. Their findings and methodology may open a new research avenue of looking at these complex biomaterials in many different pathogenic fungal species and assessing the mode of actions of novel antifungal molecules, which will assist in the combat against invasive fungal infections.Reference: Chakraborty A, Fernando LD, Fang W, et al.

Co-senior authors are Ben Cosgrove and Iwijn De Vlaminck, both associate professors of biomedical engineering in the College of Engineering.Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing allow biologists to identify tens of thousands of cells from a single tissue sample, but because muscle stem cells account for less than 1% of those cells   with their short-lived transient cell offspring being even more rare   sequencing experiments simply can t capture the complete picture of muscle regeneration.It s a problem that Cosgrove ran into when he published a 2020 cell atlas containing 35,000 individual cells involved in the repair process. But of those cells, fewer than 200 of them were committed or fusing myogenic cells   the rare transient states that sequencing struggles to document. Imagine if you had a paint-by-numbers picture and you only colored in a quarter of the numbers,  said Cosgrove, who co-led the development of scMuscle along with De Vlaminck and doctoral student David McKellar.  We just couldn t collect enough data ourselves to paint the whole picture of these subtle transitions as cells mature and specialize.""The Cornell team knew there were other large sequencing datasets being developed, each capturing their own share of data. So, they used advanced computational techniques to start merging collections to paint the fuller picture. They combined 88 publicly available datasets with several of their own, leading to the scMuscle database, which houses the transcriptomic data from approximately 365,000 cells involved in muscle injury over a wide range of ages and experimental conditions. We liken it to creating a mosaic with multiple artists. It assembles into a richer and more complicated painting,  Cosgrove said.  Now we have a comprehensive picture of the very rare cell types that we know are involved in skeletal muscle repair, but weren t previously sampled. The scMuscle database provides another important piece of information that single sequencing experiments fail to produce   spatial data that details how cells organize and interact across the tissue landscape. It s well known in biology that your neighbors make your identity,  Cosgrove said,  and now we can identify molecular factors that are uniquely communicating between cell types and depict their spatial patterns in the injury zone. Since soft-launching the scMuscle database in January, hundreds of researchers across the world have accessed it, searching for information such as sex-specific gene expression patterns during aging, and what gene expression signatures define different cell types involved in disease processes.One finding reported by Cosgrove and the team answered a long-standing question about how many genes are expressed by the differentiating offspring of stem cells as they specialize in mature muscle tissue. It turns out the cells are really diversifying gene expression signatures and turning on all sorts of genes as the start to differentiate,  Cosgrove said,  and then as soon as they begin to fuse, they hit this bottleneck and their gene expression patterns become locked in place and very restricted. Cosgrove said the scMuscle database will continue to serve as a powerful tool for biologists and others seeking a new view of rare cellular activity in muscle regeneration, and hopes to attract funding to help with hosting and continually integrating new data into it as the field grows.Reference: McKellar DW, Walter LD, Song LT, et al.

Chan School of Public Health researchers. Methodological limitations in prior observational studies have led to confusion about whether reducing current levels of sodium in the diet increases CVD risk,  said first author Yuan Ma, a research scientist in the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard Chan School.  Our study combined high-quality individual participant data from six cohort studies where sodium was measured by the currently most reliable method, namely, multiple 24-hour urine samples. Our results should help clarify sodium s role in CVD that lower consumption is associated with lower risk of CVD in most populations, including in the U.S.  The study was published online November 13, 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Sodium, one of the components of table salt, is naturally found in some foods, but high amounts of sodium are frequently added to commercially processed, packaged, and prepared foods. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently released new voluntary guidance encouraging the food industry to gradually reduce sodium linked in previous research with increased blood pressure in commercially produced foods over the next two and a half years. Potassium has an opposite effect in the body it can help relax blood vessels and increase sodium excretion while decreasing blood pressure. Rich sources of potassium include fruits, leafy greens, beans, nuts, dairy foods, and starchy vegetables like winter squash. The relationship between sodium consumption and the risk of CVD has been controversial, according to the study authors. Comprehensive data, including those from randomized trials, have consistently shown that as daily sodium intake increases, so does blood pressure, and as blood pressure increases, so does the risk of CVD. A few cohort studies suggested that lower sodium intake is associated with increased risk of CVD. However, those studies assessed sodium intake using methods prone to measurement errors, such as spot urine or single 24-hour samples that are unreliable for estimating individual usual sodium intake. In the new study, the researchers conducted a pooled analysis of six prospective cohort studies: the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the Nurses  Health Study, the Nurses  Health Study II, the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease study, and the Trials of Hypertension Prevention Follow-up studies. The researchers analyzed the individual sodium and potassium excretion data and the incidence of CVD which includes coronary heart disease or stroke. The data came from multiple 24-hour urine samples the most reliable method for assessing sodium intake that were taken from more than 10,000 generally healthy adults with a study follow-up of CVD events for an average of nearly nine years. A total of 571 cardiovascular events were documented during the cohort studies. After accounting for a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors, the researchers determined that higher sodium intake, as measured by multiple 24-hour urine samples, was significantly associated with higher cardiovascular risk in a dose-response manner with a daily sodium intake of approximately 2,000 to 6,000 mg. Every 1,000 mg per day increase in sodium excretion was associated with an 18% increased risk of CVD. For every 1,000 mg per day increase in potassium excretion, the risk of cardiovascular disease was 18% lower. In addition, higher sodium to potassium ratio was significantly associated with increased cardiovascular risk. These associations were consistent across subgroups defined according to age, sex, baseline hypertension, weight status, and years of follow-up.  This study underscores the importance of using a reliable biomarker to measure habitual sodium intake and assess its relationship with cardiovascular risk,  said Frank Hu, Fredrick J. Stare Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard Chan School, and senior author of the paper.  The findings provide further support for public health strategies including regulations, food labeling, and promoting healthy dietary patterns to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake.

However, no artificial materials with these characteristics have been created. In order to develop an artificial molecular system that can multiply and evolve, the information (genes) coded in DNA must be translated into RNA, proteins must be expressed, and the cycle of DNA replication with those proteins must continue over a long period in the system. To date, it has been impossible to create a reaction system in which the genes necessary for DNA replication are expressed while those genes simultaneously carry out their function.The group succeeded in translating the genes into proteins and replicating the original circular DNA with the translated proteins by using a circular DNA carrying two genes necessary for DNA replication (artificial genomic DNA) and a cell-free transcription-translation system(1). Furthermore, they also successfully improved the DNA to evolve to a DNA with a 10-fold increase in replication efficiency by continuing this DNA replication cycle for about 60 days.By adding the genes necessary for transcription and translation to the artificial genomic DNA developed by the group, it could be possible to develop artificial cells that can grow autonomously simply by feeding them low-molecular-weight compounds such as amino acids and nucleotides, in the future. If such artificial cells can be created, we can expect that useful substances currently produced using living organisms (such as substances for drug development and food production) will become more stable and easier to control.This research has been led by Professor Norikazu Ichihashi, a research director of the project  Development of a self-regenerative artificial genome replication-transcription-translation system  in the research area  Large-scale genome synthesis and cell programming  under the JST s Strategic Basic Research Programs CREST (Team type).

The Liggins Institute, New Zealand s authority on pregnancy and baby health, was asked by the government to review the global evidence on nitrate in drinking water and birth outcomes. Researchers conducted a meta-analysis, using statistical methods to assess a decade s worth of relevant scientific papers.  The current evidence is uncertain and findings from different studies are inconsistent,  said Dr Luling Lin, the postdoctoral fellow who led the research, supported by colleagues including Professors Jane Harding, Caroline Crowther and Frank Bloomfield.  We need more evidence, and this country should expand the monitoring and reporting of levels of nitrate in drinking water to help to gather that evidence,  said Dr Lin. Maximum acceptable levels of nitrates in drinking water should be reviewed regularly as more evidence becomes available, she said. New Zealanders are generally exposed to low levels in drinking water, especially if their water comes from reticulated supplies in cities and towns. However, private rural wells can be vulnerable to accumulating nitrate from sources such as fertilisers and animal waste from dairy farming. Internationally, concerns about the potential for links between nitrate in drinking water and adverse birth outcomes have been triggered by studies showing statistical associations. No causal connections were established by the Liggins researchers. The studies under review included research showing a statistical association between nitrate in drinking water and an increased risk of giving birth to a baby with a limb deficiency. (A limb deficiency is when a baby's leg, arm, hand, finger, foot or toe is crooked, uneven, partially formed or even missing because part or all of a child's limb does not completely form during pregnancy.) However, as with other adverse birth outcomes, including cleft palates, neural tube defects, preterm births, and reduced lengths and weights of babies, the evidence was not strong and any causal link remains uncertain. Aotearoa New Zealand deems 50 milligrams per litre the maximum acceptable level, which is the same as the World Health Organisation guideline and similar to a US federal maximum, although there are concerns about chronic exposure at lower levels. According to estimates from a 2020 study, more than 60 percent of our population were exposed to less than 2 milligrams per litre, 8.2 percent to more than 5 milligrams, 2.2 percent to more than 10 milligrams, and only 0.1 percent to more than 25 milligrams.ReferenceLin L et al.

In individuals carrying mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an ion channel controlling the flow of ions and water in and out of cells, the mucus in airways and other passageways, which normally is thin and slippery, becomes sticky and thick   thus instead of acting as a lubricant, it becomes a contestant.Advances in patient screenings and breakthrough therapies allow CF patients now to live into their mid- to late 30s or 40s, sometimes even longer. However, even the ~90% of patients (dependent on continent) with the most common CFTR mutation, called  F508, who can be treated with available drugs, are still plagued by bacteria settling in their mucus, which causes inflammation in their lungs. The repeated bouts of infection and inflammation, as well as a chronic lower-grade inflammation between infections, gradually weakens and scars patients  airways, which eventually causes their respiratory systems to fail. For the remaining ~10% of patients with various other CFTR mutations, no targeted treatments even exist yet. A major barrier to developing new and urgently needed treatments is the lack of human in vitro models that recapitulate the CF disease s pathology. Now, a multidisciplinary research team at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering led by Wyss Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D. and supported by a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, have developed a microfluidic Organ Chip device the size of a USB memory stick that recapitulates key pathological hallmarks from CF patients more accurately than other in vitro systems have so far. The model replicates CF-specific changes in multiple hallmarks of the disease, including in the airway s mucus layer, beating of mucus-transporting cilia, pathogen growth, inflammatory molecules, and the recruitment of white blood cells, providing a comprehensive preclinical human model in which to investigate new CF therapies. The findings are published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis. Now that we are able to accurately model CF pathology, including microbiome and inflammatory responses, in human Airway Chips, we have a way to attack challenges that are important to CF patients,  said Ingber.  The bundled capabilities of this advanced in vitro model can help accelerate the search for drugs that may dampen the exaggerated immune response in patients, treat them with more personalized therapies and, help solve problems that CF patients face every day which cannot be addressed by existing treatments.  Ingber also is faculty lead of the Wyss  Bioinspired Therapeutics & Diagnostics Platform, as well as the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied SciencesTo model and compare the microstructure and function of vascularized CF airways, the authors grew lung airway cells obtained from human CF patients or healthy individuals in one of two parallel running hollow channels of a microfluidic device under air, recapitulating the lung s air-transporting environment. In the second channel, which is separated from the first one by a porous membrane, they recreated a human blood vessel from human lung microvascular cells that was perfused with a blood substitute medium.  This first microphysiological model of a CF airway closely mimics what we know from airways in CF patients. Maintaining the typical composition of all relevant cell types, it developed a thicker mucus layer, and its ciliated cells exhibit higher densities of cilia that beat at a higher frequency compared to Airway Chips created with airway cells from healthy individuals,  said co-first author and former Postdoctoral Fellow on Ingber s team Ratnakar Potla, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.  Importantly, these pathological changes were accompanied by an enhanced inflammatory response in the modeled CF bronchial epithelium that is much like the one observed in CF patients.  Potla is now Senior Scientist of complex in vitrosystems at Genentech-Roche.After culturing the Airway Chips for two weeks, the researchers measured the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors flowing out of the Airway Chip s vascular channel that are known to be involved in the inflammatory response in the lungs of CF patients. Among other changes, the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 was increased in CF chips compared to those in control Airway Chips. Interestingly, IL-8 is known for its ability to attract the type of white blood cells know as neutrophils that also drive inflammation in the lungs of CF patients.When the researchers then actually flowed human neutrophils through the vascular channel of the CF Airway Chips, they observed that more of the immune cells spontaneously adhered to the surface of vascular cells, squeezed themselves through the vascular cell layer and porous membrane, and accumulated in the airway epithelial cell layer of the air channel   recapitulating a process known as  transmigration.  But the CF-mimicking airway tissue not only stimulated immune cell recruitment, it also supported the growth of the bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is present in the microbiome of normal lung but can grow out of control and cause lung infections in human CF patients. Twenty-four hours after they introduced a fluorescently labeled version of P. aeruginosa into the airway channel of chips created with bronchial epithelial cells from CF patients, the team detected higher numbers of the pathogen in CF-specific mucus than in mucus in healthy Airway Chips. As a consequence, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were further increased, thus replicating the infection-inflammation cycle seen in CF patients.As next steps, the team will further personalize their CF Lung Airway Chip by generating versions in which bronchial epithelial, vascular endothelial, and immune cells all are obtained from the same patient.  For this proof-of-concept study, we have only used CF-specific bronchial airway cells from patients carrying the frequent  F508 CFTR mutation. But different CFTR mutations may also affect the function of endothelial and immune cells and differ in their effects,  said co-first author Roberto Plebani, Ph.D.  By developing a panel of patient-specific Airway Chips using cells from patients with different mutations, and also by directly measuring the activity of differently compromised CFTR ion channels on-chip, drug responses and efficacies could be investigated in a highly personalized manner.  Plebani worked in Ingber s lab as a visiting professor from the  G. d Annnunzio  University of Chieti-Pescara in Italy, and spearheaded the project in Ingber s group with Potla.

When the newly identified cells were removed, the heart rate increased, and when they were deprived of a key gene that drives their glial development, the heart beat irregularly. The research was published recently in PLOS Biology. For me the definition of great science is something that you discover that opens up even more questions, and this, I think, is the definition of that,  said Smith, who is also affiliated with the University s Center for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine. It s a discovery that now we have 100 questions we didn t even know existed, so we re following up on them to explore this path that has never been studied before. And while there is not a definitive connection between the discovery and congenital heart defects, these cardiac nexus glia cells are located in the outflow tract of the heart, the same place where many congenital heart defects are found. The outflow tract is a structure that forms during development and contributes to a pathway connecting the ventricles to the arteries leaving the heart. The research team discovered the cells first in zebrafish hearts, then confirmed their existence in both mouse and human hearts.Astrocytes were previously thought to reside only in the central nervous system   the brain and the spinal cord. Researchers in the Smith lab had wondered why organs that are supplied with nerves by the peripheral nervous system, which include all the remaining nerves in the body, did not appear to have astrocyte-like glial cells. They play an important role in building and maintaining neural circuits in the brain. Why would they not also exist elsewhere?Nina Kikel-Coury, first author of the paper and a recent graduate of Smith s lab, said she searched for astrocyte-like glial cells in the heart because of the gap in knowledge, and because glial cells have been found in multiple organs, including the pancreas, spleen, lungs and intestines. However, their function is not always clear. I thought that if we could find a new cellular piece to the cardiovascular puzzle, it could be foundational for future work,  she said.Kikel-Coury was particularly interested in how these cells factored into a group of medical conditions called dysautonomia, which result from faults in the autonomic nervous system. She has one of the conditions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which causes lightheadedness, fainting and a rapid increase in heart rate.While POTS could potentially be linked to the new cell discovered in the fundamental research outlined in the study, it is too soon to tell, Smith said.  We don t completely know the function of these cells, but the concept that if you get rid of them, heart rates increase, could link it to certain disease cases,  Smith said.  I think these glial cells could play a pretty important role in regulating the heart. This is another example of how studying basic neurobiology can lead to the understanding of many different disorders,  Smith said.  I m excited about the future.

Our study reveals that during times in the past when the ice sheet retreated, the periods of rapid mass loss  switched on  very abruptly, within only a decade or two,  says Dr Thomas.  Interestingly, after the ice sheet continued to retreat for several hundred years, it  switched off  again, also only taking a couple of decades.  Dr Thomas says the Antarctic Ice Sheet went through many of these on/off episodes, each time contributing to global sea level rise as the world warmed at the end of the last ice age, about 20,000 years ago. The researchers  findings confirm computer modelling that had indicated that the diminishing ice sheet had passed a critical tipping point leading to irreversible loss of parts of the ice sheet below sea level.  We have already observed over the last two decades that the Antarctic Ice Sheet has suddenly started losing ice which has contributed to rising sea levels around the world,  says Prof. Turney.  But the satellite data showing this speed-up only go back about 40 years, so we needed longer records to put this change in context. The researchers examined the gritty sediments released from melting icebergs that settled into mud on the sea floor for clues to the ice sheet s history of retreat and growth phases. By counting the amounts of this iceberg-rafted sediment through the core, the scientists were able to identify eight phases with high amounts of debris which they interpreted as retreat phases of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Each phase showed the same pattern - the ice sheet destabilised within a decade, contributed to global sea level rise for centuries to a millennium, and then subsequently re-stabilised equally rapidly. Combining the sediment record with computer models of ice sheet behaviour, the team showed that each episode of increased iceberg calving reflected increased loss of ice from the interior of the ice sheet, not just changes in the already-floating ice shelves. Professor Nick Golledge from Te Puna P tiotio, the Antarctic Research Centre at Te Herenga Waka, Victoria University of Wellington, led the ice-sheet modelling.  We found that iceberg calving events on multi-year time scales were synchronous with discharge of grounded ice from the Antarctic Ice Sheet,  he says.Dr Thomas then applied statistical methods to the model outputs to see if early warning signs could be detected for tipping points in the ice sheet system. Her analyses confirmed that tipping points did indeed exist.  If it just takes one decade to tip a system like this, that s actually quite scary because if the Antarctic Ice Sheet behaves in future like it did in the past, we must be experiencing the tipping right now,  she says. Lead author Dr Michael Weber, from the Institute of Geosciences at the University of Bonn, led the team that recovered cores of the sediment from the Southern Ocean.  Our findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting the acceleration of Antarctic ice-mass loss in recent decades may mark the beginning of a self-sustaining and irreversible period of ice sheet retreat and substantial global sea level rise,  he says.  When we might see the eventual stabilisation of the ice sheet is unknown, because it will depend significantly on how much future climate warming occurs.

Porter, M.D., Ph.D., of NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and colleagues in the National Human Genome Research Institute and National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease. It appears in Molecular Genetics and Metabolism. The study was supported in part by a grant from the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation.NPC1 results from an impaired ability to move cholesterol through cells, leading to difficulty controlling movements, liver and lung disease, impaired swallowing, intellectual decline and death. Much of the movement difficulties in NPC1 result from gradual loss of brain cells known as Purkinje neurons. The researchers found that mice with a form of NPC1 have a diminished ability to lower levels of glutamate  a brain chemical that stimulates neurons after it has bound to a neuron s surface. High levels of glutamate can be toxic to cells. The researchers believe the buildup of glutamate contributes to the brain cell loss seen in the disease. Riluzole blocks the release of glutamate and hence delays the progression of ALS in people.In the current study, mice with NPC1 survived 12% longer when treated with riluzole, compared to untreated mice. The researchers believe that riluzole or similar drugs may provide a way to slow disease progression in patients with NPC1.Reference: Cougnoux A, Yerger JC, Fellmeth M, et al.

However, in most cancer patients, T cells become disarmed once they enter the environment surrounding a tumor.Scientists are now trying to find ways to help treat patients by jumpstarting those lackluster T cells. Much of the research in this field, known as cancer immunotherapy, has focused on finding ways to stimulate those T cells directly. MIT researchers have now uncovered a possible new way to indirectly activate those T cells, by recruiting a population of helper immune cells called dendritic cells.In a new study, the researchers identified a specific subset of dendritic cells that have a unique way of activating T cells. These dendritic cells can cloak themselves in tumor proteins, allowing them to impersonate cancer cells and trigger a strong T cell response. We knew that dendritic cells are incredibly important for the antitumor immune response, but we didn t know what really constitutes the optimal dendritic cell response to a tumor,  says Stefani Spranger, the Howard S. and Linda B. Stern Career Development Professor at MIT and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.The results suggest that finding ways to stimulate that specific population of dendritic cells could help to enhance the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, she says. In a study of mice, the researchers showed that stimulating these dendritic cells slowed the growth of melanoma and colon tumors.Spranger is the senior author of the study, which appears today in the journal Immunity.

It manages to do this with the help of intestinal cells that among other things are specialized in the absorption of food components or the secretion of hormones. In adult humans, the intestinal cells regenerate every five to seven days. The ability to constantly renew and develop all types of intestinal cells from intestinal stem cells is crucial for the natural adaptability of the digestive system. However, a long-term diet high in sugar and fat disrupts this adaptation and can contribute to the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and gastrointestinal cancer.The molecular mechanisms behind this maladaptation are part of the research field of Heiko Lickert and his group at Helmholtz Munich and the Technical University of Munich. The scientists assume that intestinal stem cells play a special role in maladaptation. Using a mouse model, the researchers investigated the effects of a high-sugar and high-fat diet and compared it with a control group.From high-calorie diet to increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer The first thing we noticed was that the small intestine increases greatly in size on the high-calorie diet,  says study leader Anika B ttcher.  Together with Fabian Theis  team of computational biologists at Helmholtz Munich, we then profiled 27,000 intestinal cells from control diet and high fat/high sugar diet-fed mice. Using new machine learning techniques, we thus found that intestinal stem cells divide and differentiate significantly faster in the mice on an unhealthy diet.  The researchers hypothesize that this is due to an upregulation of the relevant signaling pathways, which is associated with an acceleration of tumor growth in many cancers.  This could be an important link: Diet influences metabolic signaling, which leads to excessive growth of intestinal stem cells and ultimately to an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer,  says B ttcher.With the help of this high-resolution technique, the researchers have also been able to study rare cell types in the intestine, for example, hormone-secreting cells. Among their findings, they were able to show that an unhealthy diet leads to a reduction in serotonin-producing cells in the intestine. This can result in intestinal inertia (typical of diabetes mellitus) or increased appetite. Furthermore, the study showed that the absorbing cells adapt to the high-fat diet, and their functionality increases, thus directly promoting weight gain.Important basic research for non-invasive therapiesThese and other findings from the study lead to a new understanding of disease mechanisms associated with a high-calorie diet.  What we have found out is of crucial importance for developing alternative non-invasive therapies,  says study leader Heiko Lickert, in summarizing the results. To date, there is no pharmacological approach to prevent, stop or reverse obesity and diabetes. Only bariatric surgery causes permanent weight loss and can even lead to remission of diabetes. However, these surgeries are invasive, non-reversible and costly to the healthcare system. Novel non-invasive therapies could happen, for example, at the hormonal level through targeted regulation of serotonin levels. The research group will examine this and other approaches in subsequent studies.Reference: Aliluev A, Tritschler S, Sterr M, et al.

In co-infections with two different SARS-CoV-2 variants, the Delta variant also boosted the multiplication of its co-infected partners.The study also showed that a novel natural antiviral drug called thapsigargin (TG), recently discovered by the same group of scientists to block other viruses, including the original SARS-CoV-2, was just as effective at treating all of the newer SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Delta variant.In their previous studies* the team showed that the plant-derived antiviral, at small doses, triggers a highly effective broad-spectrum host-centred antiviral innate immune response against three major types of human respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.In this latest study, the team set out to find out how well the emergent Alpha, Beta and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 are able to multiply in cells relative to each other as single variant infections and in co-infections- where cells are infected with two variants at the same time. The team also wanted to know just how effective TG was at blocking these emergent variants. Of the three, the Delta variant showed the highest ability to multiply in cells, and was most able to spread directly to neighbouring cells; its amplification rate at 24 hours of infection was over four times that of the Alpha variant and nine times more than the Beta variant.In co-infections, the Delta variant boosted the multiplication of its co-infected partners. Furthermore, co-infection with Alpha and Delta or Alpha and Beta conferred multiplication synergy, where total new virus output was greater than the sum of corresponding single-variant infections.Notably, all SARS-CoV-2 variants were highly susceptible to TG treatment. A single pre-infection priming dose of TG effectively blocked all single-variant infections and every co-infection at greater than 95% relative to controls. Likewise, TG was effective in inhibiting each variant during active infection.Professor Kin Chow Chang, lead author of the study, said:  Our new study has given us better insights into the dominance of the Delta variant. Even though we have shown that this variant is clearly the most infectious and promotes production of other variants in co-infections, we are pleased to have shown that TG is just as effective against all of them. Together, these results point to the antiviral potential of TG as a post-exposure prophylactic and an active therapeutic agent. Reference: Al-Beltagi S, Goulding LV, Chang DKE, et al.

Researchers from Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital in collaboration with the Jessa Hospital in Hasselt (Belgium) have now shown that the virus can disseminate to the blood and extrapulmonary organs in severe COVID-19 cases. Moreover, prolonged virus replication in these (extra)pulmonary sites can even be accompanied by virus evolution leading to the emergence of new variants, including variants of concern (VOCs). They have found multiple infectious viruses with mutations hallmark to VOCs in different organs (lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and spleen) of a severe COVID-19 patient while the patient had died long before the reported emergence of these VOCs. This study has recently been published by Nature Communications.How is that possible? SARS-CoV-2 dissemination out of the lungs is a rare event in COVID-19, as a healthy immune system rapidly clears the infection. However, inadequate immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection may fail to confine the virus to the respiratory tract. The patient in this study was under immunosuppressive therapy against B cell lymphoma cancer. Such patients cannot fight off the initial infection in the airways. This results in prolonged and enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection with virus dissemination to other organs. SARS-CoV-2 evolves during extensive and prolonged infection throughout the body, leading to the emergence of new virus variants including variants of concern (VOCs). In VOCs, these changes have affected the virus s properties, such as infection rate, disease severity, or the performance of vaccines. This research shows that mutations hallmark to current VOCs were evolving in different countries at multiple sites throughout the body, including the organs of this Belgian COVID-19 patient. Indeed, a virus with mutations of concern (N501Y, T1027I, and Y453F) was not only found in the latter patient s lungs, but also in its kidneys, heart, liver, and spleen, while the patient had died long before reported emergence of VOCs. This shows that COVID-19 treatment and hygiene measures need to be tailored to specific needs of immunocompromised patients, even when respiratory symptoms cease.Even though infectious viruses were retrieved from this patient s organs, we don t know whether they could have been transmitted to other people. If this had been the case, we would not have talked about the UK variant. Instead, we would have named it the Belgian variant.Reference: Van Cleemput J, van Snippenberg W, Lambrechts L, et al.

This is because left-handedness is related to brain asymmetry: the way that the two brain hemispheres are specialised for different functions. In right handers, the left hemisphere controls the dominant right hand, whereas the situation is reversed in left-handers. Most people also have left hemisphere dominance for language, but this is more often reversed in left-handers. As MPI s Clyde Francks explains,  Hemispheric specialisation is important for language and other cognitive functions. Various psychiatric traits involve increased rates of left-handedness, including autism, schizophrenia and intellectual disability   although of course most left-handed people do not have these.  But how exactly is hand preference related to brain asymmetry, and what role do genes play?To investigate the neural and genetic basis of left-handedness, researchers from the MPI and Donders institutes in Nijmegen collaborated with an international team of scientists from the University of Bordeaux, the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language in San Sebastian, and the University of Oslo. To examine differences between left-handers and right-handers, the team used images from a large dataset (the UK Biobank) to measure asymmetries. According to postdoctoral researcher Zhiqiang Sha,  It took around three months of processing on twelve computer cluster servers, running in parallel . Francks adds  If we could map which parts of the brain are linked to handedness, and examine the genetic effects on these brain regions, then we could start to understand which other brain functions might be linked to handedness as it develops in individuals, or were linked during our evolutionary history .Right-handers differed on average from left-handers in their brain asymmetry in ten specific regions, spread widely across the brain s surface. In all ten of these regions, the grey matter of the right hemisphere tended to be relatively larger in left-handers, consistent with increased neural resources to support that hemisphere s role in controlling the left hand.  This is the first time that specific parts of the brain s anatomy have been linked confidently to handedness , says Francks.The scientists also discovered that genetic influences on handedness were associated with brain asymmetries in language-related regions. Interestingly, one of the implicated genes is NME7, which is also known to affect the positions of body organs such as the heart or liver on the right or left side of the body.According to Francks, handedness and language may be partly linked to each other during human brain development, and might have shared an evolutionary history.  Gestural communication may have been an important part of early language evolution, or perhaps hand control and language share a certain type of neural information processing that is particularly well supported by the left hemisphere in most people. However, Francks stresses that the differences in brain anatomy between left- and right-handers were only visible as slightly different averages between the two groups, while the variation in both groups was largely overlapping.  We did not find a clear  marker  or  signature  in the brain s anatomy that can predict whether someone is left-handed. Reference: Sha Z, Pepe A, Schijven D, et al.

The large undertaking will characterize known proteoforms (specific protein molecules) as well as aim to systematically discover and analyze new ones in human tissues, cells and fluids. We are all built of proteins, and most drugs target proteins,  said Northwestern University s Neil Kelleher, a world-renowned proteomics pioneer and corresponding author of the paper.  But understanding proteins is an open frontier. Like other seminal moments in science and technology, this project will serve as a major achievement that can help us more fully understand proteins  role in all types of disease, aging and new therapeutics. Kelleher is the Walter and Mary Glass Professor of Molecular Biosciences and professor of chemistry in Northwestern s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciencesand a professor of medicine in Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.He also is director of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute(CLP) and faculty director of Northwestern Proteomics, a center of excellence within CLP that develops novel platforms for drug discovery and diagnostics. Kelleher co-authored the paper with the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics.The human body comprises at least 20,000 individual genes   and from each gene, proteins are processed into various forms (or proteoforms). So, for the 20,300 genes, there are millions of unique proteoforms created due to genetic variation, modification or alternative splicing. There is a proteoform family for every human gene,  Kelleher said.  And proteoforms have a life of their own. They can be activated or repressed after they are produced, and their diversity varies widely in our different cell types in unknown ways. Understanding the exact proteins we are made of is complex and challenging and will require a major global effort.  The Human Proteoform Project s ultimate goal is to establish a definitive and comprehensive Human Proteoform Atlas, a reference set which will be public and available to all, including the many proteomics companies recently advancing in the private sector. In order to develop this extensive, high-quality atlas, researchers must accelerate development of new, powerful, state-of-the-art technologies for deep proteoform analysis.Kelleher said he hopes researchers, physicians, clinicians, scientists and engineers will help contribute to the global effort. With our global collaborators, we are excited to bring about the next generation of proteomics,  Kelleher said.

This was shown by researchers from the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD) in T bingen. Insulin lowers the dopamine level in a specific region of the brain (striatum *) that regulates reward processes and cognitive functions, among other things. This interaction can be an important driver of the brain s regulation of glucose metabolism and eating behavior. The study has now been published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. Worldwide, more and more people are developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. Studies show that the brain plays an important role in causing these diseases. Dopamine is the most important neurotransmitter for the reward system. The hormone insulin is released after eating and regulates the metabolism in the human body (homeostatic system). It is not yet known how these two systems interact. However, changes in these systems have been linked to obesity and diabetes. In the current study, researchers from the Institute of Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen at the University of T bingen, a partner of the DZD, and T bingen University Hospital (Innere IV, Director: Prof. Andreas Birkenfeld) examined how the two systems interact specifically in the reward center of the brain, the striatum.   Our eating behavior is regulated by the interaction between the reward system and homeostatic systems. Studies indicate that insulin also acts in dopamine-driven reward centers in the brain. It has also been shown that obesity leads to changes in the signaling of the brain that have a negative effect on the glucose metabolism in the whole body,  said first author Stephanie Kullmann. ""We now wanted to decipher the interaction between the two systems in humans and find out how insulin regulates the dopamine system."" For this purpose, ten healthy, normal-weight men received insulin or a placebo via a nasal spray (randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded crossover study). When insulin is absorbed via the nose, it reaches the brain directly. To study the interaction between insulin and dopamine, the researchers used a unique measurement technique: they combined magnetic resonance imaging to assess functional brain activity and positron emission tomography to assess dopamine levels.   Analysis of the study showed that the intranasal administration of insulin lowered dopamine levels and led to changes in the brain's network structure. ""The study provides direct evidence of how and where in the brain signals triggered after eating   such as insulin release and the reward system   interact,"" said Professor Martin Heni, last author of the study, summarizing the results. ""We were able to show that insulin is able to decrease dopamine levels in the striatum in normal-weight individuals. The insulin-dependent change in dopamine levels was also associated with functional connectivity changes in whoe-brain networks. Changes in this system may be an important driver of obesity and related diseases."" In further studies, the researchers want to investigate changes in the interaction of dopamine and insulin in obese or diabetic participants. These people often suffer from insulin resistance in the brain. The researchers therefore assume that this resistance prevents the normal insulin-induced regulation of dopamine levels in the reward center. In further steps, they want to restore the normal action of insulin in the brain by behavioral and/or pharmaceutical interventions. * StriatumThe striatum belongs to the human cerebrum and forms part of the basal ganglia. It is a central connection point for various neural pathways as well as control circuits and is involved in the interaction of motivation, reward, emotion, movement behavior and numerous cognitive functions.

In a study jointly published by Purdue University and the National Institutes of Health, scientists do just that.Majid Kazemian, assistant professor in the departments of Computer Science and Biochemistry at Purdue University, was co-lead author of the highly collaborative study, along with Dr. Behdad Afzali, chief of the Immunoregulation Section of the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  Our work demonstrates a mechanism by which vitamin D reduces inflammation caused by T cells. These are important cells of the immune system and implicated as part of the immune response to the infection causing COVID-19. Further research, especially clinical trials, and testing in patients, are necessary before this can be adopted as a treatment option.  Kazemian said.  We do not recommend the use of normal vitamin D off the shelf at the pharmacy. No one should be taking more than the recommended doses of vitamin D in an attempt to prevent or combat COVID infections.  Previous studies have shown vitamin D s ability to reduce the inflammation caused by T cells   inflamed cells in the lung characteristic of the most severe and dangerous cases of COVID-19. But as important as understanding that a drug works is understanding the how and the why. This is both to maximize benefit and minimize harm (such as preventing people from eating livestock dewormer or injecting household cleaners into their veins) as well as to pave the way for future treatments. If scientists understand how vitamin D works to combat inflammation, they understand more about how both the drug and related diseases work, paving the way for new, even more effective drugs. Kazemian and his team began by studying how viruses affect lung cells in a previous study. Finding that viruses can trigger a biochemical pathway, known as the immune complement system, the researchers started looking for ways to disrupt that pathway and ameliorate the subsequent inflammation. The team studied and analyzed individual lung cells from eight people with COVID   something only possible because of Kazemian s experience with gene sequencing and data mining. They found that in the lung cells of people with COVID, part of the immune response was going into overdrive, exacerbating lung inflammation.  In normal infections, Th1 cells, a subset of T cells, go through a pro-inflammatory phase,  Kazemian said.  The pro-inflammatory phase clears the infection, and then the system shuts down and goes to anti-inflammatory phase. Vitamin D helps to speed up this transition from pro-inflammatory to the anti-inflammatory phase of the T cells. We don t know definitively, but theorize the vitamin could potentially help patients with severe inflammation caused by Th1 cells.  In patients with COVID-19, the pro-inflammatory phase of the Th1 cells seems not switched off, possibly because the patients didn t have enough vitamin D in their system or because something about the cell s response to vitamin D was abnormal. In that case, the researchers posit, adding vitamin D to existing treatments in the form of a prescribed highly concentrated intravenous metabolite may further help people recovery from COVID infections, though they have not tested this theory.  We found that vitamin D   a specialized form of it, not the form you can get at the drugstore   has the potential to reduce inflammation in the test tube, and we figured out how and why it does that,  Kazemian said. However, it s important to understand that we did not carry out a clinical study, and the results of our experiments in the test tube need to be tested in clinical trials in actual patients.

Our ancestors could have used links between speech sounds and visual properties to create some of the first spoken words   and today, many thousands of years later, the perceived roundness of the English word  balloon  may not be just a coincidence, after all. The  bouba/kiki effect  is thought to derive from phonetic and articulatory features of the words, for example, the rounded lips of the 'b' and the stressed vowel in  bouba , and the intermittent stopping and starting of air in pronouncing  kiki .To find out how widespread the bouba/kiki effect is across human populations, the researchers conducted an online test with participants who spoke a wide range of languages, including, for example, Hungarian, Japanese, Farsi, Georgian, and Zulu.The results showed that the majority of participants, independent of their language and writing system, showed the effect, matching  bouba  with the rounded shape and  kiki  with the spiky one.Co-author Dr Bodo Winter, Senior Lecturer in Cognitive Linguistics at the University of Birmingham, commented:  New words that are perceived to resemble the object or concept they refer to are more likely to be understood and adopted by a wider community of speakers. Sound-symbolic mappings such as in bouba/kiki may play an important ongoing role in the development of spoken language vocabularies. Iconicity the resemblance between form and meaning had been thought to be largely confined to onomatopoeic words such as  bang  and  peep , which imitate the sounds they denote. However, the team s research suggests that iconicity can shape the vocabularies of spoken languages far beyond the example of onomatopoeias.The researchers note that the potential for bouba/kiki to play a role in language evolution is confirmed by the evidence they collected. It shows that the effect stems from a deeply rooted human capacity to connect speech sound to visual properties, and is not just a quirk of speaking English.Reference: wiek A, Fuchs S, Draxler C, et al.

Those with ADHD were four times more likely to have GAD at some point in their life, when compared to those without ADHD. Even after controlling for other relevant factors, including sociodemographics, adverse childhood experiences, and a lifetime history of substance use disorders and major depressive disorders, those with ADHD still had more than double the odds of GAD. These findings underline how vulnerable adults with ADHD are to generalized anxiety disorders,  says lead author Esme Fuller-Thomson, professor at the University of Toronto s Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and Director of the Institute for Life Course & Aging.  There are many studies linking adult ADHD to depression and suicidality, but less attention has been paid to generalized activity disorders and other adverse outcomes across the life course. The study identified several factors that were associated with GAD among those with ADHD. Female respondents with ADHD had nearly five times higher odds of GAD, even after controlling for other covariates. ADHD has been severely underdiagnosed and undertreated in girls and women,  says co-author Andie MacNeil, a recent Master of Social Work (MSW) graduate from the University of Toronto.  These findings suggest that women with ADHD may also be more susceptible to experiencing anxiety, emphasizing the need for greater support for women with ADHD. Adults who had experienced adverse childhood experiences such as childhood sexual or physical abuse or chronic parental domestic violence were three times more likely to have a generalized anxiety disorder.  Sixty percent of those with ADHD who had anxiety disorders had experienced at least one of these adverse childhood experiences.Other factors associated with GAD among adults with ADHD include having an income below $40,000, having fewer close relationships, and having a lifetime history of major depressive disorder. The odds of GAD among those with ADHD were six-fold for those with a lifetime history of major depressive disorder. These results highlight the importance of screening for mental illness and addressing depressive symptoms when providing support to those with ADHD,  said Lauren Carrique, a recent graduate of University of Toronto's MSW program who is a social worker at Toronto General Hospital.  Individuals experiencing ADHD, GAD, and depression are a particularly vulnerable subgroup that may need targeted outreach by health professionals. Investigators examined a nationally representative sample of 6,898 respondents from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health aged 20-39, of whom 272 had ADHD and 682 had GAD.Unfortunately, the researchers did not have access to information on what treatments, if any, respondents with ADHD were receiving to address their anxiety.  One particularly promising talk-based therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, also called CBT, has been shown to be very effective for improving anxiety, depression, and ADHD symptoms. It is crucial that those with ADHD who are struggling with mental health issues reach out for help from their family doctor or other mental health professional including social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. Effective treatments, such as CBT, are available and these can dramatically improve one s quality of life , said Fuller-Thomson.Reference: Fuller-Thomson E, Carrique L, MacNeil A.

The data, specifically neural signals called spike trains, can be fed into machine-learning algorithms to improve the usability of brain-computer interfaces (BCI).BCI systems work by analyzing a person s brain signals and translating that neural activity into commands, allowing the user to control digital devices like computer cursors using only their thoughts. These devices can improve quality of life for people with motor dysfunction or paralysis, even those struggling with locked-in syndrome when a person is fully conscious but unable to move or communicate.Various forms of BCI are already available, from caps that measure brain signals to devices implanted in brain tissues. New use cases are being identified all the time, from neurorehabilitation to treating depression. But despite all of this promise, it has proved challenging to make these systems fast and robust enough for the real world.Specifically, to make sense of their inputs, BCIs need huge amounts of neural data and long periods of training, calibration and learning. Getting enough data for the algorithms that power BCIs can be difficult, expensive, or even impossible if paralyzed individuals are not able to produce sufficiently robust brain signals,  said Laurent Itti, a computer science professor and study co-author.Another obstacle: the technology is user-specific and has to be trained from scratch for each person.","Published: November 19, 2021"

Yet this is done in less than half of cases. A new study led by Clint Cary, M.D., MPH, of the Regenstrief Institute and Indiana University School of Medicine, explores environmental barriers to implementation of these guidelines and may help refine strategies to improve care of bladder cancer patients.In the study, published in The Journal of Urology, the most significant environmental barrier to chemotherapy was identified by 58 Michigan urologists in diverse practice settings as lack of a protocol or standard operating procedure in the recovery room for instilling and disposing of the chemotherapy. Our findings are encouraging because the number one barrier to administering post-op chemo to reduce bladder cancer recurrence was an operational barrier   one that is modifiable and can be relatively easily tackled. Protocols or standard operating procedures can be established and professionals will follow them,  said Dr. Cary.  By not routinely administering post-op chemo we simply are not following the evidence-based data that exists, and which informs guidelines and can help us reduce cancer recurrences. More than 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2020. Approximately three-quarters of these cases were non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Whether postoperative immediate chemotherapy is indicated is governed by clinical factors including tumor stage and grade, as well number of tumors present in the bladder. Chemotherapy is appropriate in the majority of cases. Current recurrence rate of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is estimated to be as high as 75 percent. So it s important that we know what the barriers to administering post-op chemo are and develop tailored strategies to lower them, so recurrence decreases,  said Dr. Cary.  It s critical that we maximize evidenced-based care for patients with bladder cancer.

The findings, led by University of Bristol researchers and published in Behavior Research Methods, identifies the earliest age humour emerges and how it typically builds in the first years of life.Researchers from Bristol s School of Education sought to determine what types of humour are present in early development and the ages at which different types of humour emerge. The team created the 20-question Early Humour Survey (EHS) and asked the parents of 671 children aged 0 to 47 months from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada, to complete the five-minute survey about their child s humour development.The team found the earliest reported age that some children appreciated humour was 1 month, with an estimated 50% of children appreciating humour by 2 months, and 50% producing humour by 11 months. The team also show that once children produced humour, they produced it often, with half of children having joked in the last 3 hours.Of the children surveyed, the team identified 21 different types of humour. Children under one year of age appreciated physical, visual and auditory forms of humour. This included hide and reveal games (e.g., peekaboo), tickling, funny faces, bodily humour (e.g., putting your head through your legs), funny voices and noises, chasing, and misusing objects (e.g., putting a cup on your head).One-year-olds appreciated several types of humour that involved getting a reaction from others. This included teasing, showing hidden body parts (e.g., taking off clothes), scaring others, and taboo topics (e.g., toilet humour). They also found it funny to act like something else (e.g., an animal).Two-year-olds  humour reflected language development, including mislabelling, playing with concepts (e.g., dogs say moo), and nonsense words. Children in this age group were also found to demonstrate a mean streak as they appreciated making fun of others and aggressive humour (e.g., pushing someone).Finally, 3-year-olds were found to play with social rules (e.g., saying naughty words to be funny), and showed the beginnings of understanding tricks and puns.Dr Elena Hoicka, Associate Professor in Bristol s School of Education and the study s lead author, said:  Our results highlight that humour is a complex, developing process in the first four years of life. Given its universality and importance in so many aspects of children s and adults lives, it is important that we develop tools to determine how humour first develops so that we can further understand not only the emergence of humour itself, but how humour may help young children function cognitively, socially, and in terms of mental health. The Early Humour Survey addresses an important gap of when different types of humour develop. It has the potential, with more research, to be used as a diagnostic tool in early development in terms of developmental differences, and to help inform early years educators and the UK s national curriculum for 0-5 years.

The current standard for women is a three-dose regimen. The single-dose vaccine was highly effective at 18 months for HPV vaccination,  said Ruanne Barnabas, principal investigator of the trial and a professor of global health at the University of Washington School of Medicine.  The single-dose efficacy was the same as multiple doses. This news could greatly hasten the pace of vaccinations and brings renewed energy to the push to make cervical cancer the first cancer to be wiped out globally. Currently, just 15% of women are vaccinated against HPV, according to an analysis published in March in Preventive Medicine, which outlined a course of action to eliminate the disease.Barnabas said the KEN-SHE trial could help the World Health Organization reach its goal to have 90% of 15-year-old girls vaccinated against HPV by 2030. She said a single-dose vaccine would simplify logistics and decrease costs. The abstract was given on the same day that the WHO is marking the first anniversary the world has committed to eliminate cancer. These findings are a gamechanger that may substantially reduce the incidence of HPV-attributable cervical cancer and positions  single-dose HPV vaccination as a high value and high impact public health intervention that is within reach for us,  said Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Acting Director General, Prof. Sam Kariuki.Like many African countries, the Kenya HPV vaccine program rollout has faced the challenges of vaccine delivery, low uptake of the second HPV dose coupled with global HPV vaccine shortages.In the trial, women 15 to 20 years old were randomly assigned a therapy and followed from December 2018 to June 2021: After 18 months, the bivalent vaccine was 97.5% effective against HPV 16/18 and the nonavalent vaccine was 97.5% effective against HPV 16/18. The nonavalent vaccine was 89% effective against HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58. Even if women tested positive for one strain of HPV, the vaccine protected them from other strains of the virus.The majority of participants (57%) were between 15 and 17 years old and most reported one lifetime sexual partner (61%). To be eligible, participants needed to be sexually active, have no more than five lifetime partners, be HIV-negative, and have no history of HPV vaccination.Researchers said more studies need to be done to test how long the vaccine lasts. This trial brings new energy to the elimination of cervical cancer. It brings great hope to the women living in countries like Kenya, who have a high burden of the disease,  said Dr. Nelly Mugo, co-principal investigator on the study and senior principal clinical research scientist with the Center for Clinical Research at the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi. She also is a UW associate research professor of global health.Researchers said one impetus for the trial was the cervical cancer ward at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi. They said they want the ward empty.   I believe that I will see cervical cancer eliminated in my lifetime,  said Dr. Maricianah Onono with KEMRI.  So, let s do this -- one shot for every woman! According to the WHO, most sexually active women and men will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives and some will be repeatedly infected. The peak time for acquiring infection among both women and men is shortly after becoming sexually active. While nine out of 10 HPV infections go away by themselves in two years, others lead to cancer of the reproductive system, mainly cervical cancer. HPV also can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, and oropharyngeal cancer (throat, tongue, and tonsils).Worldwide, cervical cancer kills a women every two minutes, according to the WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus. Most of those deaths are in Africa, which bears 80% of the cervical cancer burden, according to the WHO.This trial comes 15 years after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first HPV vaccine. Merck produced Gardasil in 2006, which prevented four types of HPV (6/11/16/18). Since then, two other HPV vaccines have been introduced: Cervarix (which prevents HPV 16/18) was approved in 2009, and Gardasil-9, which prevents an additional five high-risk HPV types, was approved in 2014. However, due to cost and limited vaccine supply, coverage has been low in areas with the highest cervical cancer burden.Barnabas said women have been given multiple doses of the HPV vaccine because of gaps in evidence for the effectiveness of a single-dose vaccine and concerns about clinically meaningful differences in efficacy.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Researchers at the University of New Hampshire have found that variants of this venom, known as cone snail insulin (Con-Ins), could offer future possibilities for developing new fast-acting drugs to help treat diabetics. Diabetes is rising at an alarming rate and it s become increasingly important to find new alternatives for developing effective and budget-friendly drugs for patients suffering with the disease,  said Harish Vashisth, associate professor of chemical engineering.  Our work found that the modeled Con-Ins variants, or analogs, bind even better to receptors in the body than the human hormone and may work faster which could make them a favorable option for stabilizing blood sugar levels and a potential for new therapeutics. In their study, recently published in the journal Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, researchers looked more closely at the cone snail venom which induces a hypoglycemic reaction that lowers blood sugar levels. Unlike insulin made in the body, the venom s peptide sequence - which allows it to bind to human insulin receptors   is much shorter. To test whether it would still bind effectively, the researchers used sequences of the insulin-like peptides in the venom of the cone snail C. geographus as a template to model six different Con-Ins analogs. The newly created variants were made up of much shorter peptide chains than human insulin - lacking the last eight residues of the B-chain of the human insulin.To study the stability and variability of the new Con-Ins structures, they conducted multiple independent computer simulations of each Con-Ins variant complex with human insulin receptor in a near-physiological environment (accounting for water solvent, salinity of solution, temperature and pressure). They found that each insulin complex remained stable during the simulations and the designed peptides bound strongly   even better than the naturally occurring human insulin hormone. The interactions were then compared with the human insulin receptor and it was determined that each Con-Ins variant exhibits few feasible residue substitutions in human insulin. While more studies are needed, our research shows that despite the shorter peptide sequences, the cone snail venom could be a viable substitute and we are hopeful it will motivate future designs for new fast-acting drug options,  said Biswajit Gorai, postdoctoral research associate and lead author.The insulin-like venom released by certain cone snails can be highly dangerous causing a hypoglycemic shock that immobilizes fish and potential prey. C. geographus has the most toxic sting known among the species and there have been reports of human fatalities, especially to unsuspected divers who are not aware of the snail s venom.Reference: Gorai B, Vashisth H.

They also identified potential targeted treatments based on the findings, as reported in Science Advances in November.This is the first study using multi-omics, the integration and analysis of multiple data types, to create a computational model of multiple myeloma, which the scientists named the Multiple Myeloma Patient Similarity Network (MM-PSN). The genes identified in the analysis included some associated with a high risk of relapse. Our findings have immediate implications for the development of novel precision medicine tools and clinical trials, as different subgroups of patients may respond to different targeted and immuno- oncology therapies based on their genomic and transcriptomic profiles,  said lead author Alessandro Lagana, PhD, Assistant Professor of Oncological Sciences at The Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai.  These studies are fundamental to advancing our understanding of myeloma pathology and pave the way for future research into drug repurposing approaches aimed at novel therapies tailored to specific patient subgroups. Researchers believe that MM-PSN captures the complexity of multiple myeloma by associating patients with highly similar DNA and RNA profiles to form more granular and homogeneous classes than achieved by previous classifications. Within the MM-PSN model, researchers represented patients as nodes, much as in a social network, that are connected with one another based on how similar their DNA and RNA profiles are.To create MM-PSN, researchers analyzed five different types of data obtained from DNA and RNA sequencing of 655 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. The analysis of MM-PSN identified three main groups and 12 subgroups enriched for distinct genetic and molecular features, revealing remarkable diversity within previously defined disease subtypes  such as hyperdiploid and MMSET-translocated, which are chromosome abnormalities and novel insights into the occurrence of primary and secondary genomic alterations within each patient s cancer.One of the biggest findings of the MM-PSN is the an abnormality within an area of chromosome 1 being the most important single genetic variant associated with a high risk of relapse; the study suggests that it should now be incorporated into international myeloma staging systems. Researchers also identified new classes of high-risk patients beyond current classifications in multiple myeloma, including one of patients at highest risk of relapse and shortest overall survival, and another that is often associated with more favorable outcomes.Reference: Bhalla S, Melnekoff DT, Aleman A, et al.

Consequently, cells with mutated p53 have a survival advantage, which can cause cancer. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have found new links between CRISPR, p53 and other cancer genes that could prevent the accumulation of mutated cells without compromising the gene scissors  effectiveness. The study, published in Cancer Research, can contribute to tomorrow s precision medicine.Much hope is being pinned on the potential of gene editing using the CRISPR (gene scissors) method as a crucial part in the precision medicine of the future. However, before the method can become hospital routine, several hurdles need to be overcome. One of these challenges is associated with how cells behave when subjected to DNA damage, which CRISPR gene editing causes in a controlled fashion. Damage to cells activates the protein p53, which acts as the cell s  first aid  response to DNA damage.It is already known that the technique is less effective when p53 is active; at the same time, however, a lack of p53 can allow cells to start growing uncontrollably and become cancerous. In over half of all cancers the gene for p53 is mutated and thus unable to protect against uncontrolled cell division. It is therefore important to avoid the enrichment (accumulation) of such mutated cells.Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have now shown that cells with inactivating mutations of the p53 gene gain a survival advantage when subjected to CRISPR and can thus accumulate in a mixed cell population.  The researchers have also identified a network of linked genes with mutations that have a similar effect to p53 mutations, and shown that the transient inhibition of p53 is a possible pharmaceutical strategy for preventing the enrichment of cells with such mutations. It can seem contradictory to inhibit p53 in a CRISPR context,  says the study s first author Long Jiang, doctoral student at the Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet (Solna).  However, some of the literature supports the idea that p53 inhibition can make CRISPR more effective. In our study we show that this can also counteract the enrichment of cells with mutations in p53 and a group of associated genes. The research has a contributory potential to the future clinical implementation of CRISPR in having identified a network of possible candidate genes that should be carefully controlled for mutations when cells are subjected to the CRISPR technique. Another possible conclusion is that the transient inhibition of p53 could prove a strategy for reducing the enrichment of mutated cells.The researchers have also studied the DNA-damage response as a possible marker in the development of more precise guide RNA sequences, which are used to show CRISPR where a DNA sequence is to be altered. We believe that the up-regulation of genes involved in the DNA damage response can be a sensitive marker for how much unspecific ( off-target ) activity a guide RNA has, and can thus help in the selection of  safer  guide RNAs,  says the study s last author Fredrik Wermeling, researcher at the Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet (Solna).The study is largely based on CRISPR, CRISPR screening experiments on isolated cells and analyses of the DepMap database.The next step of the research is to understand how relevant the described mechanisms are. In cell cultures, we see a rapid and pronounced enrichment of cells with p53 mutations when we subject the cells to CRISPR, provided, however, that cells with mutations are there from the start,  says Dr. Wermeling.  So we can show that the mechanism exists and factors that affect it, but don t currently know at what level this is a genuine problem, and that s something we want to explore further in more clinic-centered tests. The study was conducted in collaboration with David P. Lane s group (MTC) and financed by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, Karolinska Institutet, the Magnus Bergvall Foundation, the China Scholarship Council and the Nanyang Technological University-Karolinska Institutet Joint PhD Program (VSI).Reference: Jiang L, Ingelshed K, Shen Y, et al.

The puppies that had been fed raw tripe, raw organ meats, and human meal leftovers during puppyhood showed significantly less allergy and atopy related skin symptoms in adult life. On the other hand, puppies not getting any raw foods, eating most of their food as dry food, i.e. kibble, being fed fruits, and heat-dried animal parts, had significantly more allergy and atopy related skin symptoms in adulthood , says DogRisk research group team leader, Docent Anna Hielm-Bj rkman from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Helsinki.According to the study, consumption of at least 20% of the puppy s diet as raw food, or less than 80% of the puppy s diet as dry food, associated with a significant decreased prevalence of allergy and atopy related skin symptoms in adult age.  Also, in case of no consumption of raw food at all or eating 80% or more of the puppy s diet as dry food, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of allergy and atopy related skin symptoms in the same dogs, later in life. Further, when feeding 20 % of other type of processed commercial dog foods (such as canned or sausage packed foods), also this associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of allergy and atopy related skin symptoms, while consumption of zero % of the puppy s diet from these same foods, significantly decreased the prevalence of the disease in adulthood. These findings indicate that it was the raw food component that was the beneficial health promotor,  says Hielm-Bj rkman,  and that even as little as 20% of the diet being raw foods, already gives health benefits .In addition to the previous variables, puppies that were eating dead animals outside i.e.  air dried raw food , also showed a decrease in the incidence of allergy and atopy related skin symptoms as adults. Our mission is to find ways for the dog-owner to impact their own pet s health-span. We could see an association between lower prevalence of allergy and atopy related skin symptoms as adult and serving puppies fresh foods and avoiding processed foods as well as sweet fruits. That s a good start for any owner,  says Manal Hemida, DVM from the DogRisk research group and from the Helsinki One Health network, and the main researcher of this study.  However, the study only suggests a causal relationship but does not prove it. Diet intervention studies are required to further elucidate the in-depth association between the development of atopy and allergy related skin symptoms and dietary factors such as raw and dry foods, human meal left-overs and the correct dosing of oils,  concludes Hemida.Reference: Hemida MBM, Salin S, Vuori KA, et al.

While individual genotyping information is stored securely, some people consent to share their genomic data for further study.This data sharing has raised some valid concerns about genomic privacy. For example, could hackers reidentify a person   perhaps construct a picture of their face based on genotype data downloaded legally from open-source web platforms? In 2017, genomics-based health intelligence company Human Longevity and other research groups reported that it was feasible to predict a person s facial appearance from their DNA.Intrigued by the privacy risk implications of this work, Washington University in St. Louis faculty member Yevgeniy  Eugene  Vorobeychik, an expert in applying game theory to determine privacy risks in data sharing settings, undertook his own study. We wanted to see to what extent these results can generalize to the real world,  said Vorobeychik, associate professor of computer science & engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering.  We explored whether it was possible to demonstrate in a more practical situation that these concerns were real. Vorobeychik and his co-authors   WashU graduate student Rajagopal Venkatesaramani and Vanderbilt University Biomedical Informatics Professor Bradley Malin found the task of linking faces and genomes is much harder on average than previously reported. They published their findings in Science Advances Nov. 17, 2021.In the study, they developed a method to calculate the risk of reidentifying individuals from a carefully curated dataset of 126 genomes obtained from the OpenSNP genome-sharing platform by linking these to publicly posted face images. Specifically, they used neural network models to predict visible physical traits, such as hair, eye and skin color, as well as sex, and then used this information along with known genotype-trait correlations to score possible genome-face matches.Earlier phenotype association studies used high-quality photos taken in a laboratory setting with professional quality lighting. Vorobeychik s team, on the other hand, conducted their research using real-world photographs found on social media sites. What we did was construct probabilistic models for these different kinds of visual characteristics and essentially connected the dots by scoring the matching quality between particular genomes and particular faces,  Vorobeychik explained.  We then used that scoring system to predict which matches are most likely. Overall, their results suggest that it s sometimes possible to link public face images with public genomic data, but the success rates are well below what prior research papers suggest in idealized settings. However, our observations are about average privacy risk for a collection of individuals; it is possible that for some people the privacy risk is indeed high,  Vorobeychik said.To protect those individuals  privacy, Vorobeychik s team created a method that alters a social media photo just enough to prevent the neural network from reliably identifying visible traits, and thereby reducing the risk of those who have publicly released their genomic data and whose image appears elsewhere online. Our method adds enough imperceptible noise to the image so it s difficult for a deep neural network to link the phenotype of the face to a particular genome,  he said.  This carefully crafted noise doesn t change one s perception of [the face] to the naked eye. This tool could be further developed into image filters that individuals could use to protect their social media photos from hackers who might try to link their images to genetic data they ve publicly shared on OpenSNP or other online sites.Reference: Venkatesaramani Rajagopal, Malin Bradley A., Vorobeychik Yevgeniy.

The project, published in the international journal Communications Materials, shows how the artificial micro-hooks can be applied to a series of devices that, when attached to plant leaves, act as a kind of temporary plaster, releasing beneficial substances into the plant s vascular system, or as intelligent clips that wirelessly communicate information on the health status of crop plants.The research has been funded with the support of the National Geographic Society, and as part of the European GrowBot project dedicated to the creation of new robots inspired by climbing plants and for which Mazzolai is coordinator. The climbing plant Galium aparine, commonly known as  catchweed , has evolved a particular mechanism for parasitic anchoring that allows it to climb over other plants via micro-hooks on its leaves. These hooks allow it to anchor onto the surfaces of other plants as it grows, exploiting them for physical support. The researchers at IIT studied the structure of these natural micro-hooks from both a morphological and biomechanical point of view in order to artificially reproduce their characteristics. The hooks were made with a high-resolution 3D printer, employing a range of highly resistant materials and with characteristics that can be adapted to the relative application, for example to photosensitive or biodegradable materials made from isomalt, a sugar-like substance.  Our studies always begin by observing nature, seeking to replicate the strategies employed by living creatures through low-environmental-impact robotic technologies , commented Barbara Mazzolai, Associate Director of Robotics at IIT and the head of the IIT Bioinspired Soft Robotics Lab.  With this latest research project, we have further demonstrated that it is possible to create innovative solutions that not only have the aim of monitoring the health of our planet, in particular of plants, but of doing so without altering it . The micro-hook structure has been tested for its anchoring capacities and has proved to be capable of solidly attaching to a range of plant species. On the basis of this form of Velcro, the researchers have come up with a number of devices to use in precision farming and in environmental protection. One initial application has been designed to penetrate plant cuticle in a barely invasive manner, allowing plants to be monitored and treated. By attaching to the plant, the isomalt micro-hooks can connect with the leaf s vascular system and, as isomalt is soluble, dissolve inside. This application allows the micro-hooks to be used as a plaster that can locally release beneficial substances, pharmaceuticals, pesticides or bactericides onto the leaves, optimising the use of natural resources and reducing the excessive use of pesticides, thus contributing to the protection of ecosystems. Furthermore, once applied, the plaster dissolves, thus avoiding the creation of waste.  These micro-hooks are versatile and have allowed us to create a range of applications, as well as filing a patent , explained Isabella Fiorello, a researcher in Mazzolai s group at the Genoa-based IIT, and the main author of the project.  This form of anchoring can be exploited for in situ monitoring of the plant s microclimate, such as temperature, humidity and light, or for the controlled release of molecules into the plant s vascular system . In particular, hooks printed with the use of a photosensitive resin have been assembled together with electronics and sensors for light, temperature and humidity within a unified system, creating intelligent clips for the wireless monitoring of the plant through both sides of the leaf. Lastly, again on the basis of the same structure, the researchers have come up with a microrobotic system capable of using microsteps to move over the surface of the leaves.ReferenceFiorello I, Meder F, Mondini A, et al.

Their simulation, described in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, could help government agencies keep a closer check on human-made sources of carbon-based pollutants. Human activity has led to a substantial increase in organic air pollutants, like aerosols, which has caused a deterioration of air quality in many places around the world and even changes in climate,  said Dr. Qi Ying, associate professor from the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  But by gaining a better estimate of organic aerosols through specific marker compounds, we can develop better emission control measures for cleaner air for all. According to published reports, 20-40% of the particulate matter in the lower atmosphere comes from organic aerosols. Air pollution contributed by these compounds is an ongoing menace that affects climate, health and visibility. For example, depending on the type of aerosol, some can change the amount of heat coming into the atmosphere, while others influence the quantity of heat leaving. Also, organic aerosols can be inhaled easily and, if present in the body in high enough concentrations, can worsen many health problems from asthma to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These compounds can also reduce visibility by causing haze. Organic aerosols begin their journey into the atmosphere as volatile compounds that are released into the air from a variety of natural and human-made sources, such as burning fossil fuels and vehicle emissions. These precursor aerosols then react with oxidants and condense onto existing particles in the atmosphere to form secondary organic aerosols. Thus, from an air quality management's perspective, Ying said it is necessary to know which precursors contribute to the build-up of secondary organic aerosols so that their specific sources can be curtailed.The extent of certain precursor aerosols is calculated from the ratio of the abundance of a marker molecule called 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid (DHOPA) to the amount of secondary organic aerosol in air samples from field experiments. Historically, this ratio is determined using laboratory test chambers wherein very controlled atmospheric conditions are maintained. However, the ratio may not be suitable for use in different atmospheric conditions in the field.  We really don't know whether this ratio is fixed or changes in the open environment,  said Ying.  In ambient air humidity, temperature and other climatic factors change continuously which, in turn, could impact the estimates of the concentration of the secondary organic aerosols. To overcome this drawback, the researchers used a supercomputer at the High Performance Research Computing facility at Texas A&M to simulate the atmospheric chemistry based on the ambient conditions over East Asia, including China, Japan and Korea. As inputs, the simulation was given information on where the emissions are coming from, the emission rates and the meteorological data at different locations. The simulation focused on how much secondary organic aerosols are formed from different precursors, particularly the ones that contained the molecular signature, DHOPA.Upon running the simulations, the research team found that the ratio varied with the ambient temperature and the levels of organic aerosols in the air. They also observed that the ratio determined from previous chamber studies would lead to significant errors in the estimation of secondary organic aerosols without a correction. However, for regions with comparable levels of air pollution, the correction for the ratio remained the same. We have come a long way in reducing inorganic air pollutants, but as the contribution of these compounds becomes smaller, a much higher fraction of air pollution will be from organic precursors,  said Ying.  We have started with DHOPA as a marker for some precursor aerosols but would like to identify molecular markers for other precursors, which still remains to be done.

How they do so is unclear. Researchers have now developed a model to show that if these species have complementary preferences for what they consume, they can more easily coexist.Many microbes grow diauxically they consume the available food resources one at a time instead of simultaneously. Each species has a particular order of preferences, ranging from most preferred to least preferred. Importantly, this list differs among the different microbes. Interestingly, sugars like glucose, which should be universally prized, are not preferred by some microbes, allowing them to choose different items from the same menu.  Although diauxic growth was discovered in the 1940s, people haven t paid much attention to it from a modeling perspective,  said Sergei Maslov (BCXT/CABBI), a professor of bioengineering and Bliss faculty scholar.  We have this incredible zoo of microbial ecosystems that are present everywhere and people are trying to understand what allows different species to co-exist. We wanted to understand the basic assembly principles of diauxically growing communities.  The researchers modelled the assembly of a microbial community in serial dilution cultures, where the bacteria are allowed to grow up on a fresh batch of nutrients for a certain time before they are diluted again.  Serial dilution experiments are the simplest experiments to perform in the lab and they represent the boom-and-bust scenarios in nature. For example, in the gut you may have a fresh batch of nutrients, which is used by the microbes until they run out of food. At the end of every boom cycle comes the bust cycle represented by the dilution,  Maslov said.  Each species has a predetermined preference list that is hardwired into its DNA. What we assumed, and what is supported by experiments, is that the order of nutrient consumption is different for different species. Some may have glucose as the top choice while others use, for example, lactose. We are looking at this interplay between the diversity of nutrients and the microbe preferences,  Maslov said.    In the model, the researchers first assumed that a single species can grow on four food resources. It first grows on its most preferred resource until it runs out and then switches to the next one. After all the resources are depleted, a fraction of the bacteria is transferred to a fresh batch of resources, resulting in serial dilution. After this point, a randomly chosen second species is introduced and the researchers modelled the resulting competition and resource depletion. This process continues until no other species from the random pool can invade the community. Across many such simulations, the set of microbes in the final community tends to have complementary resource preferences i.e., their top choices are all different. Although one might guess that the microbe s top choice is whatever it grows on the fastest, the model has no such assumption.  Experiments have shown that there is no clear relationship between what you prefer and how fast you grow on it. However, the assembled community consists almost exclusively of microbes that grow the fastest on their top choice nutrient,  said Akshit Goyal, a postdoctoral fellow at MIT and a collaborator of the Maslov lab. The researchers used a large pool of bacteria, which was generated randomly, for their model. Consequently, they were looking for patterns which did not depend on the identity of the bacteria.  We have created a geometric theory where you can grab your species and look at their preference lists and growth rates on different nutrients and predict the outcome of the experiment. Even without running the simulations, you can predict whether a species will survive in a particular community or not,  said Veronika Dubinkina, a PhD student in the Maslov lab.  This work did not incorporate other growth factors that might affect microbial growth.  We did not consider cross feeding in our model where one bacterium produces products that the others can use. We assumed that all the species can only use the resources that are present in the beginning,  said Zihan Wang, a PhD student in the Maslov lab. The researchers plan on including cross feeding into their future studies to see how it shapes the microbial community.  We are interested in applying this model to real microbial ecosystems and we have started another project to see what happens in actual serial-dilution experiments,  Maslov said.  It s very easy to make a big, complicated model. Our philosophy is to add one property at a time, such as diauxie or cross feeding, and understand what is going on at every step. That way you gradually get better at understanding of complex, real-world systems. ReferenceWang Z, Goyal A, Dubinkina V. et al.

Molecule-specific therapy or immunotherapy are some of the latest approaches that have been investigated recently for ovarian cancer treatment, but with no major breakthroughs in overcoming this challenging disease. Now, a new assay developed by Professor Abhishek D. Garg's team, in collaboration with Professor An Coosemans' group, may change this scenario. The so-called  sFIS  assay, looks at specific immune-biomarkers that are indicative of patient s survival chances and effectiveness of the ovarian cancer treatments. This way, a patient can be monitored in a targeted manner and receive an appropriate specific (immuno)therapy.Immunotherapy is a collective term for anticancer treatments that stimulate the patient's own immune system to attack cancer cells and it has recently emerged as a game-changing therapeutic option for prolonging patient survival for various cancer types. However, a range of immunotherapies have been investigated for the treatment of ovarian cancer without the same degree of success, as achieved for other cancers like melanoma or lung cancer. This is due to the highly immune-resistant nature of ovarian cancer cells as well as the high diversity among patients whereby not every treatment works for everyone. Herein, the use of qualitative biomarkers   which classify patients into different categories sothey can receive tailored care and treatment   may hold the key to success.","Published: November 18, 2021"

The method, used at MU Health Care, could help other laboratories prevent unnecessary quarantining and repeated testing of people who are not actually infected. COVID-19 testing is an important tool for managing the virus during the pandemic, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is the most widely used method. But while this type of test is considered reliable, it is associated with a small number of false positive results, most easily recognized in asymptomatic, nonexposed patients.     False positive diagnoses have important implications for patient management,  said Lester Layfield, MD, professor of pathology and anatomical sciences and director of the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory.  False positives may lead to inappropriate quarantine, delay of other necessary medical treatment or transfer to a COVID-19 ward.  To help ensure the accuracy of positive tests, Layfield developed a protocol for repeat testing of all positive results involving asymptomatic and unexposed patients, and in all cases in which a specimen with a positive result was located in a testing well next to another specimen with a high virus load.  Layfield and his team of researchers implemented the quality control protocol in September 2020. Over an eight-week period, 24,717 RT-PCR tests were performed. Of those, 6,251 came from asymptomatic patients. In that group, 288 specimens initially returned a positive result. A second test revealed 20 of these to be false positives.   Retesting of positive results from asymptomatic individuals revealed some technologist errors but also contamination from positive specimens in adjacent specimen wells, Layfield said.  This study should alert the laboratory testing community of the possibility of false positive COVID-19 tests. Reference: Layfield LJ, Camp S, Bowers K, Miller DC.

Now, a new study by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev researchers and their colleagues clearly demonstrates that early diagnosis and treatment lead to considerable improvement in ASD social symptoms.Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Autism recently.BGU's Prof. Ilan Dinstein, head of the Azrieli National Centre for Autism and Neurodevelopment Research, led a team who measured changes in core autism spectrum disorder symptoms over a 1 2-year period in 131 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 1.2  5 years of age, and treated in the community. Community treatment is defined as regular treatment, in contrast to highly specialized intervention programs that are developed and studied in university settings. Previous studies had not examined whether children diagnosed before the age of 2.5 and treated in the community improve more than those diagnosed at later ages.The results revealed that children who were diagnosed before 2.5 years of age were three times more likely to exhibit considerable improvements in the core social symptoms of autism in comparison to children diagnosed at later ages.""We believe this larger improvement is due to the larger brain plasticity and behavioral flexibility that is a fundamental characteristic of early childhood,"" says Prof. Dinstein. ""These results highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder even in community settings with heterogeneous services.

The vaccine is delivered by the same mRNA technology that has proved so effective against COVID-19.In the United States, at least 40,000 cases of Lyme Disease are reported annually but the actual numbers of infections could be 10 times greater, researchers said. In addition, other tick-borne diseases have also spread in many areas of the U.S. There are multiple tick-borne diseases and this approach potentially offers more broad-based protection than a vaccine that targets a specific pathogen,  said senior author Erol Fikrig, the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Medicine (infectious diseases) and professor of epidemiology (microbial diseases) and of microbial pathogenesis.  It could also be used in conjunction with a more traditional pathogen-based vaccine to increase their efficacy. The saliva of the black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis (I. scapularis), which transmits the Lyme Disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) contains many proteins, and the investigators have focused on 19 separate proteins.Yale researchers, in collaboration with Drew Weissman s team at the University of Pennsylvania, used bits of mRNA that produce all 19 of the saliva proteins as the basis of a vaccine, the same strategy used in vaccines that effectively combat the SARS-Cov-2 virus. They tested the vaccine on guinea pigs, which can be infected with the Lyme disease agent and have also been used as a model to study tick resistance.Compared to non-immunized guinea pigs, vaccinated animals exposed to infected ticks quickly developed redness at the tick bite site. None of the immunized animals developed Lyme Disease if ticks were removed when redness developed. In contrast, about half of the control group became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick removal. When a single infected tick was attached to immunized guinea pigs and not removed, none of vaccinated animals were infected compared to 60 percent of control animals. However, protection waned in immunized guinea pigs if three ticks remained attached to the animal. Ticks in immunized animals were unable to feed aggressively and dislodged more quickly than those on guinea pigs in the control group. The vaccine enhances tick recognition, partially turning a tick bite into a mosquito bite,  Fikrig said.  When you feel a mosquito bite, you swat it.  With the vaccine, there is redness and likely an itch so you can recognize that you have been bitten and can pull the tick off quickly, before it has the ability to transmit B. burgdorferi. Researchers also noted a caveat in their findings.  Mice, which lack the ability to acquire natural tick resistance after infection, were not protected against Lyme Disease after vaccination. In contrast to guinea pigs, mice are a natural reservoir for I. scapularis ticks, and the ticks may have evolved to develop ways to specifically feed repeatedly on mice. Another possibility may be that guinea pig skin, like human skin, is more layered than the skin of mice.Fikrig said more study is needed to discover ways proteins in saliva can prevent infection. Ultimately, human trials would need to be conducted to assess its efficacy in people.Reference: Sajid A, Matias J, Arora G, et al. mRNA vaccination induces tick resistance and prevents transmission of the Lyme disease agent.

They never feel full, even after a hearty meal. The result can be life-threatening overeating and obesity.According to a new study, their constant hunger results in part to disordered signaling in the brain s cerebellum, a region of the brain also responsible for motor control and learning. An international research team spanning 12 institutions, led by J. Nicholas Betley, an assistant professor of biology in the School of Arts & Sciences, and Albert I. Chen, an associate professor at the Scintillion Institute, in San Diego, used clues from Prader Willi patients to guide investigations in mice that uncovered a subset of cerebellar neurons that signals satiation after eating. When the researchers activated these neurons, the magnitude of the effect  was enormous,  accordingly to Betley. The animals ate just as often as typical mice, but each of their meals was 50-75% smaller.  This was mind-blowing,  he says.  In fact, it was so mind-blowing I thought it had to be wrong.  Betley encouraged Aloysius Low, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab and first author on the study, to conduct a number of other experiments to ensure the effect was real. Over nearly a year, they became convinced. It s amazing that you can still find areas of the brain that are important for basic survival behaviors that we had never before implicated,  Betley says.  And these brain regions are important in robust ways. The work, shared in the journal Nature, suggests that neurons in the cerebellum s anterior deep cerebellar nuclei (aDCN) are involved in helping animals regulate their meal size.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Another bacterial pathogen, Vibrio vulnificus, is found in raw seafood and brackish waters and can have rare, but deadly consequences for human beings. To poison the cells, both pathogens use toxins called ExoY that are almost inactive inside the bacteria. Once injected into cells, however, ExoY takes a turning point as it becomes ten thousand times more active. Yet, the exact mechanism that leads to this ten thousand fold activity was until recently unknown.For the first time, researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology in Dortmund, Germany, in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France, have discovered how the structure of the toxin becomes more ordered when interacting with actin, one of the main components of the cytoskeleton. It appears that the docking of ExoY to actin induces a stabilisation downhill at the toxin enzymatic core, which becomes apt to perform its venomous function. The scientists used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computational simulations to obtain the structural details of the toxins before and after binding, as well as enzymatic assays to quantify the activity of the toxin. Their findings have been published in the online edition of the journal Nature Communications.Stefan Raunser, Director at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology in Dortmund, and lead author of this study, explains the research in detail:","Published: November 18, 2021"

Scholars of CIMeC at UniTrento have discovered that the same neural mechanisms that signal the direction of movement in the physical environment are also used for orientation and navigation in abstract spaces.The results of their work were published today in the international scientific journal Communications Biology with the title ""The neural representation of absolute direction during mental navigation in conceptual spaces"". The article is available in Open Access on Communications Biology, a journal from Nature Portfolio.The authors of the study are Simone Vigan , Valerio Rubino, Marco Buiatti and Manuela Piazza, who is also the head of the research team at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences-CIMeC of the University of Trento.Some time ago, the research team provided experimental evidence that the populations of neurons that provide spatial information based on a grid-like system (as a navigation system) are activated not only to navigate the physical environment, but also to navigate in the abstract space of ideas and concepts. These neuronal populations are called place cells and grid cells, and are located in the hippocampus region and in the medial prefrontal cortex.Now, the same research team - again using magnetic resonance imaging - has demonstrated that another type of brain cells is involved in abstract thinking, which is complementary to the previously identified types, and which acts as a sort of compass for orientation in the space of ideas. In this study, the research team searched for the involvement of so-called head-direction cells, which have been identified in the brains of several species of non-human animals when navigating physical space.""Using magnetic resonance imaging, we have shown that there are populations of neurons, mostly located in the medial parietal cortex, that behave like head-direction cells; in other words, they signal the direction of movement even when movement does not occur in a physical space, but in an abstract, conceptual space.

A promising route for turning CO2 emissions into a fuel feedstock is a process known as electrochemical reduction. But to be commercially viable, the process needs to be improved, to select for, or to yield, a higher amount of desirable carbon-rich products.Now, as reported in the journal Nature Energy, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have improved the process s selectivity by developing a new approach to modify the surface of the copper catalysts used to assist the reaction.  Although we know copper is the best catalyst for this reaction, it doesn t give high selectivity to the desired products,  said Alexis Bell, a faculty senior scientist in Berkeley Lab s Chemical Sciences Division and professor of chemical engineering at UC Berkeley.  Our group has found that you can do various tricks with the local environment of the catalyst to provide that selectivity.  In previous studies, the researchers had established the precise conditions that gave the best electrical and chemical environment for creating commercially interesting carbon-rich products. But those conditions are contrary to those that naturally occur in a typical fuel cell, which uses a water-based conductive material. To pinpoint a design that could be used in the aqueous environment of fuel cells, Bell and his team, as part of the Department of Energy s Liquid Sunlight Alliance Energy Innovation Hub project, turned to thin layers of ionomers, polymers that allow certain charged molecules (ions) to pass through while excluding others. As a result of their highly selective chemistry, they are uniquely suited to have a strong influence on the microenvironment. Chanyeon Kim, a postdoctoral researcher in Bell s group and the lead author on the paper, proposed to coat the surface of the copper catalyst with two common ionomers, Nafion and Sustainion. Doing so, the team hypothesized, should modify the environment   including the pH and amounts of water and CO2   in the catalyst s immediate vicinity in a way that would steer the reaction to generate carbon-rich products that can be readily converted to useful chemicals and liquid fuels. The researchers applied a thin layer of each ionomer, as well as a bilayer of both ionomers, to copper films supported by a polymer material, forming membranes that they could insert near one end of a hand-sized electrochemical cell. While feeding CO2 into the cell and applying a voltage, they measured the total current flowing through the cell. Then they measured the gases and liquids that collected in adjoining reservoirs during the reaction. For the two-layer case, they found that carbon-rich products accounted for 80% of the energy consumed by the reaction   up from 60% in the uncoated situation.  This sandwich coating gives the best of both worlds: high product selectivity and high activity,  said Bell. The bilayered surface favored not only carbon-rich products, but at the same time generated a strong electrical current, indicating increased activity. The researchers concluded that the improved reaction was a consequence of the high CO2 concentration that built up in the coating layer immediately on top of the copper. Additionally, negatively charged molecules that piled up in the region between the two ionomers created a low local acidity. That combination countered the concentration trade-off that tends to occur in the absence of the ionomer films. To increase the reaction efficiency even further, the researchers turned to a technique that had been demonstrated before, without ionomer films, as another way to increase CO2 and pH: pulsing the voltage. By using a pulsed voltage with the bilayer ionomer coating, the researchers achieved a 250% increase in carbon-rich products compared to uncoated copper and a static voltage. While some researchers have focused their work on developing new catalysts, catalyst discovery does not consider the operating conditions. Controlling the environment at the catalyst s surface is a new and different approach.  Rather than coming up with a brand new catalyst, we ve taken what we know about the kinetics of a reaction and used that knowledge to guide our thinking about how to change the environment at the catalyst site,  said Adam Weber, a senior staff scientist in Berkeley Lab s Energy Technologies Area and a co-author on the paper. The next step is to scale up production of the coated catalyst. The Berkeley Lab team s initial experiments involved small, flat model systems, which are far simpler to work with compared with the high-area, porous structures necessary for commercial applications.  It s not hard to coat a flat surface. But a commercial approach might involve coating tiny copper spheres,  said Bell. Adding a second coating becomes challenging. One possibility is to mix and deposit the two coatings together in a solvent and hope that they separate as the solvent evaporates. And if they don t? Bell concluded,  We ll just have to get more clever. ReferenceKim C, Bui JC, Luo X, et al.

We wanted to find out what people knew about microplastic pollution in fish, from fishers to fishmongers to consumers,  Nina said.  It varied, but about half weren t aware it was an issue because South Australian oceans had such a reputation for being clean. We still have time to make sure Australian seafood products remain some of the cleanest in the world, but we need the seafood industry, and the general public, to recognise the problem and start taking positive actions now. The fishing industry can take a lead in solving the problem: previous studies estimate that 10% of plastic pollution in the ocean comes from fishing sources, so fishers can improve the quality of their own product by limiting their use of plastic where possible.While fishers and other stakeholders were worried about the cost and inconvenience, simple actions like replacing plastic fishing equipment with natural materials, or using biodegradable bags at fish markets, could quickly reduce the amount of plastic ending up in the ocean. The researchers suggest an education program to raise awareness of the problem and provide solutions that the industry could implement easily to maintain the quality of locally caught fish.Michael Violante, who has been part of the family-run fishmongers Seafood Works for nearly 25 years, said he was initially shocked by the findings. Fresh local seafood is a big part of my life, and to know that South Australia is not completely exempt from the plastic problem has got me thinking,  he said.  I am open to making changes to the way I use plastic and encourage others to do the same. From the fishers to the consumers, we all share this planet and can all do our small part to help lead the way to a cleaner and healthier ocean. The study shows the importance of bringing all stakeholders to the table to chart the way forward. We know that by bringing fishers into conversations around policy, we encourage the acceptance of new management ideas within the industry,  Nina said.  There is lots we can do to mitigate the problem of ocean plastic but we cannot begin unless people are aware there is a problem. This isn t just a South Australian problem, or even an Australian one   about 75% of the fish we eat is imported from overseas. Future research could include a global audit of plastic in the fishing industry, and an evaluation of ways in which the industry can adopt new practices quickly and affordably.Reference: Wootton N, Nursey-Bray M, Reis-Santos P, Gillanders BM.

Good exterior insulation reduces heating costs, which means lower CO2 emissions. Nowadays, sustainable natural insulation materials are already available for the interiors of buildings. But what does sustainability really mean? It means the material should be environmentally friendly and made from renewable raw materials, it must have good thermal insulation and fire protection, and it must be easy to recycle at the end of its useful life. A research group at the University of G ttingen has long been researching manufacturing processes for products made of popcorn that are sustainable and efficient. The University has now agreed a licence agreement with the Bachl Group for the commercial use of the process and the products for building insulation.The market is dominated by conventional insulation materials made of plastics or mineral fibre with about 90% of the market share. In fact, plastics derived from petroleum are used for exterior insulation. Could plastic exterior insulation also be replaced by sustainable materials? A research group at the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology   Chemie und Verfahrenstechnik von Verbundwerkstoffen (chemistry and process engineering of composite materials)   at the University of G ttingen has now succeeded in developing a novel process. Based on its many years of experience in the field of renewable raw materials, the group has managed to develop a process by which insulation boards made of  granulated  popcorn can be produced that have excellent thermal insulation properties and good protection against fire. The great advantage of this granular material is that it is a plant-based, environmentally friendly and a sustainable alternative to the products derived from petroleum currently used in the industry. ""This new process, based on that of the plastics industry, enables the cost-effective production of insulation boards at an industrial scale,"" explains the head of the research group, Professor Alireza Kharazipour. ""Especially in the field of insulation in construction, this ensures that natural insulation materials are no longer just niche products."" In addition, the new popcorn products have water-repellent properties, which opens up even more opportunities for practical applications and extends their useful life. Michael K blbeck, group Managing Director of the exclusive divisional licensing partner Bachl, adds: ""We are delighted to be launching such an innovative insulation product using popcorn onto the market together with the University of G ttingen. For us, this is another important milestone in our strategic development towards becoming an integrated, multi-material insulation supplier.

Every day, hundreds of thousands of new COVID-19 cases and thousands of new deaths are still being reported worldwide, creating a need for drugs that can combat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.Now, new research led by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital points to a well-known and widely available drug called disulfiram as a possible treatment for COVID-19.In the retrospective study, published Oct. 28 in PLOS ONE, patients taking disulfiram for alcoholism were less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who did get infected were less likely to die from COVID-19 than those not taking the drug. The researchers caution that since the study was observational, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect link between disulfiram and disease development. However, they say, the results are encouraging enough to warrant further study and clinical testing. The precise mechanism of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known, but researchers have hypothesized that it may prevent the virus from taking hold by interfering with an enzyme it requires to replicate. Additionally, disulfiram may blunt the symptoms of severe COVID-19 by inhibiting a protein involved in hyperinflammation. If disulfiram s effect against SARS-CoV-2 is confirmed, it could become a useful tool against the virus.","Published: November 18, 2021"

However, they re hard to find in the wild, so some companies make synthetic versions of this flavor. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry have come up with a naturally derived wild strawberry aroma by having an edible fungus make it from waste from black currant juice production.Often found in forests, wild strawberries are smaller than cultivated varieties, but they re bursting with flavor. And between their rarity and size, it s expensive to get a natural wild strawberry flavor   the combination of their distinct aroma and taste   into foods. Interestingly, some species of fungi are adept at converting plant material into pleasant odor compounds, including vanillin, raspberry ketone and benzaldehyde, an almond-like odor. One particular edible brown-rot fungus, Wolfiporia cocos, can break down a variety of foods, even tea and carrot peels, and release fruity and floral aromas in the process. An abundant and nutrient-rich substrate for the fungus could come from the black currant juice industry, which produces a lot of pulp, seed and skins   waste known as pomace   that is usually thrown away. So, Holger Zorn and colleagues wanted to grow W. cocos on pomace from black currants and tweak the conditions to naturally produce the unique aroma associated with wild strawberries, which is highly desired by the food industry. The researchers initially grew W. cocos with black currant pomace as the fungus  sole source of nutrition, which resulted in fruity and floral aromas. When then the team added ammonium nitrate, sodium L-aspartate monohydrate, monopotassium phosphate and a few other substances to the medium, the culture released an aroma similar to wild strawberries. To pinpoint the exact compounds that contributed to the scent, the researchers used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O) and 10 trained panelists. The most intense odors that the sensory panel perceived were (R)-linalool, methyl anthranilate, geraniol and 2-aminobenzaldehyde. The researchers then combined artificial versions of these four compounds into a model wild strawberry smell and found that the sensory experts rated it as being very similar to the wild strawberry-like odor from the cultivated fungus. So, by growing W. cocos on food waste, the researchers say they ve developed a sustainable and cost-effective way to produce an aroma that could be used industrially in a natural flavoring agent.ReferenceSommer S, Fraatz MA, B ttner J, Salem AA, R hl M, Zorn H.

The commentary is published in Nature Medicine.""The lack of diversity in science and medicine exacerbates and compounds the problem of health disparities,"" says Folakemi Odedina, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic cancer researcher. Dr. Odedina's education, training and community outreach activities have focused on addressing health disparities in racial, ethnic minority and underserved communities.Dr. Odedina and co-author Mariana Stern, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California write that the relatively small number of minority clinicians and researchers in biomedical research in the U.S., and the lack of minority participants in clinical trials, poses significant barriers to addressing health disparities. For example, ""Black investigators continue to be underfunded in science and medicine due to bias in the scientific review process,"" says Dr. Odedina. She says multiple reasons have been associated with this bias, including a perception that Black investigators are less capable or less accomplished than White or Asian candidates.The authors say another factor limiting diversity in biomedical research is a misalignment between the priorities of funding agencies and the research focus of scientists from underrepresented groups. ""Funding decisions that do not appropriately weigh the potential impact of awards on minority communities or the importance of promoting the careers of diverse scientists   Black, Latinx and Indigenous   miss the opportunity to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in science and medicine, and improve the health of minority communities,"" says Dr. Odedina.Dr. Odedina says funding organizations can play a critical role in addressing diversity and equity issues in medical research. ""They can start by addressing diversity among their own staffs by prioritizing health disparities research when developing funding opportunities and by making funding decisions that address health disparities and promote scientists from underrepresented groups.""Dr. Odedina says bias toward Black scientists in academic funding has led many to switch to academic administrative positions or to leave academia altogether, as it is very difficult to be successful without extramural funding. ""In the U.S., there is a nationwide problem retaining Black scientists in academia,"" says Dr. Odedina. She says the downstream effect of this problem is fewer Black scientists in academia and biomedical research, as the pipeline continues to decrease.Dr. Odedina says that efforts to ensure a well-trained, racially and ethnically diverse workforce in science and medicine will effectively and respectfully help deliver health care interventions for diverse populations and help eliminate health disparities.Reference: Odedina FT, Stern MC.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/creating-sustainable-pharmaceuticals-355951,Creating More Sustainable Pharmaceuticals Researchers have developed a novel and sustainable way to create pharmaceuticals using blue light  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Chemistry researchers at the University of Bath have developed a new method using blue light to create pharmaceuticals in a more sustainable way, significantly reducing the amount of energy needed and the chemical waste created in the manufacture process.Synthesising small-molecule drugs normally requires several steps, each one creating waste products and solvent waste   these are often toxic and difficult to dispose of safely.Currently, it is estimated that for every kilogram of drug made, around 100 kg of waste is produced, making it a hugely inefficient process.The team at Bath, led by Dr Alex Cresswell, a Royal Society University Research Fellow in the University s Department of Chemistry, has developed a new way of synthesising nitrogen-containing chemicals called primary amines, which are used in more than half of all pharmaceuticals.The method uses a catalyst, activated by blue light, to speed up the reaction, and uses fewer steps, less energy and dramatically cuts down the waste created by drug development.The team has tested the method by synthesising a drug used for multiple sclerosis (MS), Fingolimod (brand name Gilenya), which is made by Novartis and had worldwide sales of $3 billion in 2020.The team has published their research in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS).Dr Cresswell said:  Making pharmaceuticals can be a wasteful process, with most of that waste being incinerated. Our new process synthesises  -trisubstituted primary amines using only one step, a goal that has eluded chemists for many years. People don t really think about the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to carbon emissions, but some studies have calculated that big pharma emits more than the automotive industry. We re really excited that our group is the first in the world to achieve this breakthrough, and hope that it could in the future lead to much more sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.Whilst the new process is not likely to be adopted straight away by pharmaceutical companies for bulk manufacture of existing drugs, the team hopes that the method might speed up the process of discovery and development of new drugs, by making it easier to synthesise new chemical structures for testing.Dr Cresswell said:  Building new molecules during the drug discovery process requires reactions that make it simple to  click  atoms together in the required way, a bit like building models out of Lego. The aim is to make thousands of different derivatives for biological testing, and our new process gives chemists a way to connect certain atoms that simply wasn t available before. This should help to speed up the discovery process. The team is now collaborating with several pharmaceutical companies to scale up the process.Reference: Askey HE, Grayson JD, Tibbetts JD, et al.

These bursts may have potential to serve as biomarkers for brain disease and conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, dementia, and ADHD.While analyzing human neuroimaging data, the IU research team discovered short bursts of activity that form ongoing  events  in the brain and are always taking place no matter the activity or state of the brain. In the course of a 10-minute brain scan, these events will occur roughly 10 to 20 times, each lasting for just a few seconds, the researchers found. What people had not seen is that how brain regions talk to each other is punctuated by these brief moments that are just a few seconds long during which there s a lot happening,  said Olaf Sporns, who is Distinguished Professor and Robert H. Shaffer Chair in the College of Arts and Sciences Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at IU Bloomington. Now that we see them, we ve focused on those moments to get a picture of how specific brain regions link up and talk to each other during these events. To begin investigating the workings of these mysterious events, the team built a computational model. Led by Maria Pope, a graduate student in Sporns  lab and a dual Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience and informatics, the group used neuroimaging data of a human brain to build a model replicating its connections. The model was then simulated in a state similar to the resting brain to create synthetic MRI signals, using mathematical equations that reenact neuronal activity.The model showed burst-like events just like those seen in human brain recordings.The paper outlining the model and describing how it compares to the real brain was published in the November 16 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The model shows us that these events are guided by the brain s structural network,  Pope said.  They are tied to the physical structure of brain. More specifically, the events originate in clusters of neurons and brain regions that are densely interconnected and momentarily light up together. Sporns compared the pattern to an orchestra playing a piece of music. There are moments when the orchestra comes together and there s a theme. They are not just playing a single note for 10 minutes. There are brief moments in which coordinated activity dominates and at other times there might be much less,  Sporns said.  This ebb and flow of coordination is something we also see in the brain, and our model can reproduce it. Clusters of brain regions combine in different ways. It s not just one pattern, but multiple variations on a theme. The new model s outcome, Sporns suggested, is a potential game changer. Functional connectivity has been a strong focus in research as a potential biomarker for brain disorders and has been related to conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, dementia, and ADHD. And researchers have tried for years to use brain simulations in clinical applications for modeling lesions or diseases,  Sporns said.  This new model gives us a better lens through which to look at the brain, to see more clearly what goes on under both normal and abnormal conditions.  The researchers are now delving further into why the human brain employs these brief bursts of activity. Perhaps the brain has developed this type of activity because it s beneficial. Something about the structure of events may be useful to the brain,  Pope said.  For example, many kinds of networked systems have to do occasional system updates or resets, taking some kind of globally useful information and communicating it to the rest of the system. Answers to these questions may have implications not only for understanding the brain, but also for the study of neural networks and artificial intelligence. A clearer mapping of structure and function at the individual level could have implications for how we diagnose neurological disease and lead to personalized treatment and intervention,  said Betzel, professor in the College of Arts and Sciences Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences.Reference: Pope M, Fukushima M, Betzel RF, Sporns O.

The nerve cells use these so-called axons and dendrites to communicate with one another. During early development, nerve cells grow a large number of axons and dendrites. To make the connections specific, redundant extensions are removed at a later stage in a process called  pruning . Using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model, an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of M nster (Germany) asked whether energy (in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) is needed for pruning, which takes place in the flies during metamorphosis. The results of the study have now been published in the journal  Cell Reports .Some background: ATP is the energy currency of all living cells. Because it is so important, there are many different ways of producing it   for example, through the process of glycolysis from glucose or by so-called oxidative phosphorylation from various other nutrients.  The reason that we asked whether ATP is important for pruning comes from observations of the fruit fly,  explains Marco Marzano, a member of the team led by Dr. Sebastian Rumpf at the Institute of Neuro- and Behavioural Biology and lead author of the study.  Firstly, in Drosophila most pruning happens during the pupal stage when the animals do not feed and have to be very careful with their stored resources. And secondly, a fundamental question: Is energy needed when a biological structure breaks down? Marzano observed that nerve cells did not properly prune their dendrites when they lacked an important regulator of energy metabolism. This factor   the so-called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)   normally safeguards cells from consuming too much energy. With the help of members of Prof. Erez Raz s research group at the Centre for Molecular Biology of Inflammation, Marzano set up a sensor system which enabled him to measure the ATP content in the nerve cells. In this way he was able to show that AMPK specifically promotes ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation. Another collaboration with the  Medical Cell Biology  team led by Prof. Michael Krahn (Faculty of Medicine and M nster University Hospital) made it possible to measure the activity of AMPK directly, revealing that AMPK is activated by an important development regulator.  This indicates that a constant supply of energy seems to be especially important for pruning,  says Sebastian Rumpf.  One reason for this may be that some of the pruning enzymes need to be produced just before the process. Interestingly, the team was able to demonstrate that the defects in nerve development were intensified by malnutrition. The results thus show important connections between nerve development, cellular energy metabolism and the general energy supply. It was already known from studies on neurodegenerative diseases that nerve cells can atrophy when their energy balance is disturbed. This new study shows that sufficient, precisely regulated energy supply is already decisive for nerve development at an early stage   and not only for the growth of nerve processes, but also for their degradation.For their studies, the researchers combined modern microscopy techniques   such as sensors based on F rster resonance energy transfer (FRET),   with molecular Drosophila genetics.Reference: Marzano M, Herzmann S, Elsbroek L, et al.

Now, for the first time, researchers at Penn State have produced a nanocomputing agent that can control the function of a particular protein that is involved in cell movement and cancer metastasis. The research paves the way for the construction of complex nanoscale computers for the prevention and treatment of cancer and other diseases.Nikolay Dokholyan, G. Thomas Passananti Professor, Penn State College of Medicine, and his colleagues   including Yashavantha Vishweshwaraiah, postdoctoral scholar in pharmacology, Penn State   created a transistor-like ""logic gate,"" which is a type of computational operation in which multiple inputs control an output. Our logic gate is just the beginning of what you could call cellular computing,  Dokholyan said,  but it is a major milestone because it demonstrates the ability to embed conditional operations in a protein and control its function. It will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of human biology and disease and introduces possibilities for the development of precision therapeutics. The team s logic gate comprised two sensor domains designed to respond to two inputs   light and the drug rapamycin. The team targeted the protein focal adhesion kinase (FAK) because it is involved in cell adhesion and movement, which are initial steps in the development of metastatic cancer. First, we introduced a rapamycin-sensitive domain, called uniRapr, which the lab had previously designed and studied, into the gene that encodes FAK,  said Vishweshwaraiah.  Next, we introduced the domain, LOV2, which is sensitive to light. Once we optimized both domains, we combined them into one final logic-gate design. The team inserted the modified gene into HeLa cancer cells and, using confocal microscopy, observed the cells in vitro. They studied the effects of each of the inputs separately, as well as the combined effects of the inputs, on the cells  behavior.They discovered that not only could they rapidly activate FAK using light and rapamycin, but also that this activation resulted in the cells undergoing internal changes that enhanced their adhesive capabilities, which ultimately decreased their motility.Their results were published today (Nov. 16) in the journal Nature Communications. We show for the first time that we can build a functioning nanocomputing agent within living cells that can control cell behavior,  said Vishweshwaraiah.  We also discovered some interesting features of the FAK protein, such as the changes it triggers in cells when it is activated. Dokholyan noted that the team hopes to eventually test these nanocomputing agents in vivo within living organisms.Other Penn State authors on the paper include Jiaxing Chen, graduate student; Venkat R.

Two-thirds of these  zero-dose  kids live below the international poverty line, their families subsisting on less than $2.35 a day in poor villages, in urban slums, in conflict zones. Over the last 20 years, international organizations spearheaded by GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance in partnership with national governments, the World Health Organization and UNICEF   have ensured that significantly more children in poor countries in Africa and elsewhere get routine vaccinations: 81 per cent today versus 59 per cent in 2000.And that has had a major impact - a 70 per cent drop in child mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases over two decades. As an anchor donor to the Gavi Alliance, Canada has played a major part in this success. But what about the root causes of non-vaccination of the young: is the problem one of poverty alone, of the failure of domestic governments and their public-health departments to reach the most vulnerable communities, or simply of an inability to overcome deep-rooted social disadvantages? A new Canada-India study of tens of thousands of zero-dose children in India suggests that the causes of low-vaccination rates in lower-income countries is all of those and more.Published today in the Lancet Global Health and led by Universit  de Montr al public-health professor Mira Johri with colleagues S.V.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the delta variant   currently the predominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States   causes more infections and spreads faster than earlier forms of the virus.The study findings were first reported online Oct. 25, 2021, in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. Previous research has suggested that humoral immune response   where the immune system circulates virus-neutralizing antibodies   can drop off at six months after vaccination, whereas our study indicates that cellular immunity   where the immune system directly attacks infected cells   remains strong,  says study senior author Joel Blankson, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  The persistence of these vaccine-elicited T cells, along with the fact that they re active against the delta variant, has important implications for guiding COVID vaccine development and determining the need for COVID boosters in the future. To reach these findings, Blankson and his colleagues obtained blood from 15 study participants (10 men and five women) at three times: prior to vaccination, between seven and14 days after their second Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine dose, and six months after vaccination. The median age of the participants was 41 and none had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.CD4+ T lymphocytes get their nickname of helper T cells because they assist another type of immune system cell, the B lymphocyte (B cell), to respond to surface proteins   antigens   on viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Activated by the CD4+ T cells, immature B cells become either plasma cells that produce antibodies to mark infected cells for disposal from the body or memory cells that  remember  the antigen s biochemical structure for a faster response to future infections. Therefore, a CD4+ T cell response can serve as a measure of how well the immune system responds to a vaccine and yields humoral immunity.In their study, Blankson and colleagues found that the number of helper T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins was extremely low prior to vaccination   with a median of 2.7 spot-forming units (SFUs, the level of which is a measure of T cell frequency) per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, identified as any blood cell with a round nucleus, including lymphocytes). Between 7 and 14 days after vaccination, the T cell frequency rose to a median of 237 SFUs per million PBMCs. At six months after vaccination, the level dropped slightly to a median of 122 SFUs per million PBMCs   a T cell frequency still significantly higher than before vaccination.The researchers also looked six months after vaccination at the ability of CD4+ T cells to recognize spike proteins atop the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. They discovered the number of T cells recognizing the delta variant spike protein was not significantly different from that of T cells attuned to the original virus strain s protein.Although the study was limited because of the small number of participants, Blankson feels it pinpoints areas that merit further research. The robust expansion of T cells in response to stimulation with spike proteins is certainly indicated, supporting the need for more study to show booster shots do successfully increase the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells circulating in the blood,  says Blankson.  The added bonus is finding that this response also is likely strong for the delta variant.

The researchers have been able to measure and observe the degree of bond formation, both in terms of the increasing participation of electrons and the magnetic interaction between the two atoms at either end of the bond, as the bond forms. The study involved using high-quality X-Ray diffraction data and cutting-edge solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques on crystalline materials. The researchers studied a series of six molecules in which a bond between a nitrogen and carbon atom was partially formed to different degrees. This meant that, for the first time, it was possible to follow the redistribution of electrons on bond formation, determined from accurately measured X-Ray diffraction on a single crystal. Complementary NMR work monitored the magnetic interaction between the two atoms as the bond formed.  Our work provides the methods for studies on other bond forming processes,  said lead researcher John Wallis, Emeritus Professor in Nottingham Trent University s School of Science and Technology.

A group of Michigan State University (MSU) scientists have linked a booming meat trade to critical roadblocks for sustainable diets.In this week s BMJ Global Health scientists found that the red and processed meat trade   beef, pork, lamb and goat, as well as red meat processed by smoking, salted, or curing   is playing a substantial role in balancing nutrition and meat availability across the world. In many developing countries, eating more red meat is a hallmark of newfound prosperity.Unfortunately, the researchers have found, so is a substantial rise in non-communicable diseases such as colorectal cancer, type-two diabetes and coronary heart disease. Understanding the true global costs to both human health and the environment is crucial if countries are going to achieve sustainable diets. Trade is about more than economic benefits,  said Jianguo  Jack  Liu, MSU Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability and director of the Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability.  As foods move over distances, various consequences also show up in distant places. It is essential to understand what happens to people s health when a shipment of meat arrives in a new place. Examining the true costs of meat consumption through telecouplings such as trade can help avoid or minimize counterproductive consequences. The group used a risk assessment framework to compare where and how much of the red and processed meats were traded across 154 countries over 25 years. They compared this to the rates, of three chronic diet-related health problems at the same time, 1993   2018, to determine what health effects could be attributed to meat trade and which countries were particularly vulnerable to these health problems.What they found was rates of change in disease twice as high in developing countries compared with developed countries as new prosperity and urban growth translated to meals of imported meat. Particularly vulnerable to diet-related disease and death were island countries in the Caribbean and Oceania. Countries in northern and eastern Europe also found diet-linked disease and death soaring as red and processed meats from across the world ended up on their plates.These rapid increases are partly because many of these countries, such as Slovakia, Lithuania, and Latvia, joined the European Union (EU) between 2003 and 2004, and regional trade agreements for goods among EU members greatly accelerated meat imports to these countries with economic benefits. Our findings suggest that both exporters and importers must urgently undertake cross-sectoral actions to reduce the meat trade s health impacts,  said author Min Gon Chung, who received his PhD at MSU and now is a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Merced.  To prevent unintended health consequences due to red and processed meat trade, future interventions need to integrate health policies with agricultural and trade policies with both responsible exporting and importing countries. The paper also suggested that since the World Trade Organization brokered regional trade agreements to accelerate the flow of red and processed meats, strengthening collaborations to likewise make health agenda regulations more robust.Last October, Chung and Liu published another paper in Scientific Reports that outlined for the first time the underlying forces driving these dietary changes to better understand the unintended social and environmental consequences of a world that eats more meat.Reference: Chung MG, Li Y, Liu J.

They found that the proximity of figurative senses to the literal sense affects their perception as  semantically different. In addition, they noticed that context affects one s ability to notice semantic distinctions it is harder to perceive the differences between perceive meanings that differ only slightly  when they are presented together with drastically different meanings. This is related to general cognitive mechanisms of attention: people pay attention to more salient  stimuli, which diverts their attention away from subtle differences. The study was published in the Frontiers in Psychology (Language Sciences) journal.Since the 1990s, psycholinguists have been researching the structure of lexical polysemy multiple related senses in  words in the mental lexicon. There are various theories on the correlation between polysemy as reflected in dictionaries and the  real  reflection of what happens in the human brain when it stores and processes polysemous words.For example, the word  cold  has different senses in different contexts: cold air (air of low temperature), cold day (day when the air is cold), or cold person (an unfriendly person). Some psycholinguists, such as Steven Frisson and Martin J. Pickering, believe that the brain has one general  underspecified  meaning for a polysemous word, which activates when it is perceived. By contrast, researchers such as Devorah E. Klein and Gregory L. Murphy claim that the brain stores each meaning of a polysemous word separately.Finally, proponents of the  hybrid  approach to polysemy (such as Ekaterini Klepousniotou) argue that various types of senses are stored and processed differently depending on their proximity to the literal sense. Particularly, metonymy-based senses (extension by contiguity) are stored together with the literal sense, since they are closer to it, while metaphor-based senses (extension by similarity) are stored separately as more distant ones.In the example above, cold air   cold day is a metonymy-based extension, while cold air   cold person is a metaphor-based extension. This means that following a  hybrid  approach, the first pair of senses will be stored together, while the second pair will be stored separately. One argument for this approach is that metonymic senses are processed faster than metaphoric ones, as well as the fact that native speakers, when asked to separate the senses of a polysemous word, mix literal senses with metonymic ones much more often than with metaphorical ones.However, it is still unknown how different types of metonymic extensions are stored and processed. Theoretical studies of polysemy say that there are different types of metonymies, some of which are closer to the literal sense, while others are more distant.For example, there is a regular type of metonymy in adjectives, when a human emotional state or feature is extended to their appearance or actions: smart boy   smart eyes   smart behaviour. In this type of extension, the only semantic shift is the idea of relation ( smart eyes  are the eyes of a smart person;  smart behaviour  is the behaviour of a smart person), so this metonymy is close to the literal sense.On the other hand, there is  distal  metonymy, in which other important semantic components are added to the literal sense, such as temporality or causality: hungry person   hungry years (years when people where hungry), sad girl   sad news (news that causes sadness).The researchers carried out an experiment in which they looked at how native speakers perceive the senses of polysemous words based on proximal metonymy, distal metonymy and metaphor. A total of 1,809 individuals aged 18 to 70 took part in the experiment. Their median age was 34.The experiment considered four groups of senses: Each type of meaning was represented by two or more sentences.The participants were asked to read sentences that illustrated different senses of polysemous adjectives, such as: The participants were then asked to assign the sentences to virtual  baskets  based on their understanding of which phrases contained the same sense of the word. The number of baskets was unlimited.The baskets with literal senses also often contained proximal metonymy, less often distal metonymy, and extremely rarely metaphor . Metonymic senses were also mixed with each other. Two proximal metonymies were most likely to get mixed (smart eyes and smart behaviour), as well as a proximal and a distal metonymy (sad eyes and sad news), which were mixed with each other even more often than with the literal sense. Metaphors were rarely mixed with metonymies, but still more often than with the literal sense.The authors believe that this signifies that the senses of a polysemous word in the mental lexicon are not arranged as discrete entities, but form a continuum. In this continuum, metonymy is generally closer to the literal sense and therefore overlaps with it to a greater extent, although different types of metonymy have an even larger degree of overlap. Although metaphors rarely overlap with other senses, they are confused with metonymies more than with the literal senses, which might indicate a general intuitive ability to distinguish between literal and figurative senses.  The researchers also demonstrated that in cases where distal metonymy was presented together with proximal metonymy, it was more easily perceived by the speakers as a distinct  sense. In the second group, proximal metonymy was confused with the literal sense (cheerful person and cheerful look), but distal metonymy was frequently classified as a separate sense (cheerful song). In the fourth group, where distal metonymy was presented together with a metaphor, it was confused with the literal sense considerably more often (cheerful person and cheerful song), while metaphor (cheerful wind) was put in a separate  basket . It turns out that the perception of semantic differences is affected by general cognitive mechanisms of attention,  commented Valentina Apresyan, Professor at the HSE School of Linguistics.  Our attention is focused on the most salient stimuli, and the degree of salience is relative. In the context of subtly differing stimuli, a stimulus of average distinctiveness will be perceived as separate, while in the presence of strongly differentiated stimuli, it will blend into the background. Subtle differences sharpen our perception of semantic shades, while strong differences dampen it. Reference: Apresjan V, Lopukhina A, Zarifyan M.

They found plants with a long history of use by Native Americans as topical analgesics, were often also used as gastrointestinal aids.The study, published in Frontiers in Physiology, found plants that activated the KCNQ2/3 potassium channel, a protein that passes electrical impulses in the brain and other tissues, showed a long history of use by Native Americans as topical analgesics, to treat conditions such as insect bites, stings, sores and burns. Less intuitively, the same plants that activated KCNQ2/3 and were used as folk analgesics, were often also used as gastrointestinal aids, especially for preventing diarrhea. Done in collaboration with the US National Parks Service, this study illustrates how much there is still to learn from the medicinal practices of Native Americans, and how, by applying molecular mechanistic approaches we can highlight their ingenuity, provide molecular rationalizations for their specific uses of plants, and potentially uncover new medicines from plants,  said Geoffrey Abbott, PhD, a professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the UCI School of Medicine.KCNQ2/3 is present in nerve cells that sense pain, and its activation would be expected to soothe pain by disfavoring transmission of the pain signal. The breakthrough finding came when the team discovered that the same plant extracts that activate KCNQ2/3 have the opposite effect on the related intestinal potassium channel, KCNQ1-KCNE3. This finding was striking as previous studies on modern medicines showed that KCNQ1-KCNE3 inhibitors can prevent diarrhea.The Abbott Lab is currently undertaking a much broader screen of native US plants toward these goals. Already they have shown that quercetin and tannic and gallic acids, present in several of the plants studied, explained many of the beneficial effects of the plants.  The team also identified binding sites on the channel proteins that produce the effects.With this knowledge at the molecular level of compounds that can activate versus inhibit closely related human ion channel proteins, future work can be directed at improving drug specificity and therefore safety, while retaining efficacy. More specifically, medicinal chemistry approaches can be applied to further optimize the plant compounds with the goal of treating pain and secretory diarrhea. I personally am very excited about the paper; it was my lab s first published collaboration with the National Park Service, and it shines a light on the incredible ingenuity and medicinal wisdom of Californian Native American tribes,  said Abbott.The public health implications for improved drugs in these areas are considerable. Novel, non-opioid analgesics are highly sought after as we battle the twin public health concerns of chronic pain and opioid addiction. In addition, according to the CDC, diarrheal diseases account for 1 in 9 child deaths worldwide; incredibly, diarrhea kills over 2000 children every day worldwide - more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.Reference: Abbott GW, Redford KE, Yoshimura RF, et al.

Now, an international team of researchers has found the molecular proof of this concept, demonstrating how diet ultimately affects immunity through the gut microbiome. The work, conducted in mice, reveals that what animals consume initiates the release of a metabolic byproduct from a specific gut microbe that, in turn, modulates the animals  gut immunity.The findings, published Nov.10 in Nature, offer a unifying explanation for the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and immune function. They are the result of collaboration among scientists at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women s Hospital, Seoul National University, and Monash University in Australia. The experiments pinpoint a microbial molecule, the synthesis and release of which are influenced by host diet. That molecule, in turn, stimulates the activation and signaling of a subset of cells known as natural killer (NK) T cells, which are involved in immune regulation and implicated in a range of inflammatory conditions.While scientists have surmised for a long time that diet plays a role in immune health, the new study elucidates the precise molecular cascade behind this interplay, said study senior author Dennis Kasper, professor of immunology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. We have shown how diet affects the immune system through a microbial mediator in the gut, and this is a really striking example of the diet-microbiota-immunity triad at play,  Kasper said.  What this work really does is provide a step-by-step pathway from beginning to end that explains how and why this triad works and how diet ultimately affects the immune system. If confirmed in larger animals and eventually in humans, the findings can help inform the design of small-molecule treatments that enhance both intestinal and overall immunity, the researchers said. Gut-resident microbes produce molecules with enormous structural diversity. We used microbial and chemical tools to elucidate how these molecules are synthesized by gut bacteria and how they act in the host gut,  said study first author Sungwhan Oh, a principal investigator at the Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury at Brigham and Women s Hospital and a former postdoctoral fellow in the Kasper lab. Our findings yield fascinating insights about the microbiome, diet, and immune function and provide interesting clues about how molecules made by our inner neighbors can be used to design therapies. In a series of experiments, the team identified the immune-signaling cascade triggered by the metabolic breakdown of dietary amino acids in the mouse gut. This multistep pathway begins with an animal consuming food that contains branched-chain amino acids, so named for the tree branch-like structure of one of their molecular chains. The branched-chain amino acids are then taken up by B. fragilis, a gut-resident microbe, and converted by a specific enzyme into sugar-lipid molecules that also have branched chains. B. fragilis then releases branched-chain molecules that are spotted and picked up by a class of immune-signaling cells known as antigen-presenting cells, which in turn induce NK T cells to exercise their immunoregulatory response through upregulating inflammation-controlling genes and immune-regulatory chemicals. Notably, the experiments demonstrated that it is the branching of the chain structure that initiates the cascade. Straight-chain versions of the molecule did not yield the same effect. Furthermore, the team found that B. fragilis alters the structure of the sugar-lipid molecules that it metabolizes and renders them better capable of binding to receptors on specific immune cells and initiating a signaling cascade that culminates in downregulating inflammation.

Individual ants have two stomachs   one for digesting their own food and another one that comes first, a  social stomach  for storing fluids that they share with other ants in their colony. These fluid exchanges allow ants to share food and other important proteins that the ants themselves produce,  says senior author Adria LeBoeuf, Assistant Professor and leader of the Laboratory of Social Fluids at the Department of Biology, University of Fribourg, Switzerland. To help us understand why ants share these fluids, we explored whether the proteins they exchange are linked to an individual s role in the colony or the colony s life-cycle,  adds lead author Sanja Hakala, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Fribourg.The team analysed all of the ant-produced proteins found in the social stomachs of individual ants. They then compared how the proteins varied depending on whether the ant was a forager or a nurse caring for the colony s young. They also investigated if the proteins varied depending on whether the ants were part of a new colony or a more established one.They identified proteins that could be used to determine both the individual s role and the age of their colony. For example, they found that members of more mature ant colonies had more nutrient storage proteins necessary for the growth and metamorphosis of their young, in comparison to members of newly founded ant colonies.Nurse ants that cared for the young in their colony also had more anti-aging proteins in their stomachs. This suggests that colony members may pool these life-extending proteins in their nurses to help ensure that they survive to look after the next generation.  These findings show that some colony members can do metabolic labour for the benefit of others,  Hakala says.The authors say that more studies are needed to understand what each shared protein does for individual ants and the wider colony.LeBoeuf concludes:  It is hard to measure how metabolic work is shared between cells. Here, the ants pass things around in a way that we can easily access what they are sharing. Having a better understanding of how ants share metabolic labour may help us learn more about the ways that other creatures, like humans, distribute metabolic tasks between different tissues or different cells in their bodies.

The tests were evaluated for COVID-19 patients and shown to identify both bacterial and fungal infections and identify outbreaks with resistant bacteria within 24 hours.This research can now be moved into clinical service this winter for COVID-19 and influenza patients on ICU to demonstrate the full benefit of nanopore technology embedded in an NHS setting. This is particularly important for COVID-19 patients who are highly susceptible to secondary infection and outbreaks.The research was conducted at Guy s and St Thomas  in collaboration with researchers from King s College London and the Quadram Institute. It is published in Genome Medicine.When critically ill patients are cared for in the ICU, doctors take deep samples from their lungs. Currently, these samples are often sent to multiple labs where different bacterial and fungal cultures are set up alongside other complex molecular tests. Initial results take two to four days to return. During this time the patient often remains on standard antibiotic treatment, some of which may be unnecessary. In other patients, the treatment may be ineffective, as the bacteria has resistance genes to the standard antibiotics.Professor Jonathan Edgeworth, Director of the Centre for Clinical Infection and Diagnostics Research (CIDR) and Medical Director of Viapath, led the research. He said:  As soon as the pandemic started, our scientists realised there would be a benefit to sequencing genomes of all bacteria and fungi causing infection in COVID-19 patients while on ICU. Within a few weeks we showed it can diagnose secondary infection, target antibiotic treatment and detect outbreaks much earlier than current technologies   all from a single sample. This will revolutionise our approach to prevention and treatment of serious infection on ICU and we now plan to offer it as a clinical service for COVID-19 and influenza patients this coming winter. The new same-day service uses cutting edge Nanopore sequencing technology to identify all bacterial and fungal pathogens present in patients  samples, as well as any resistance genes present. The advance means that unnecessary treatment can be reduced, and patients can benefit from starting the right treatment sooner.The following day, the same test provides enough genetic sequence to compare pathogen genomes with a database that accurately identifies patients carrying the same strain so outbreaks can be detected at the very start. This is the first time this combined benefit of a single test has been demonstrated.This ground-breaking service was made possible through funding from the NIHR Guy's and St Thomas' Biomedical Research Centre, and a partnership between Kings College London; Viapath; the Quadram Institute in Norwich; Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Guy s and St Thomas .Gordon Sanghera, CEO Oxford Nanopore said:  Rapidly characterising co-infections for precision prescribing is a vital next step for both COVID-19 patients and respiratory disease in general. This year we ve seen an amazing response from the research community using Oxford Nanopore's sequencing technology to gain rapid insights into many aspects of COVID-19   from genomic epidemiology to testing and now co-infections. It s a privilege to see such rapid innovation, huge congratulations to the team. Dr Andrew Page of the Quadram Institute said:  We have been working on metagenomics technology for the last seven years. It is great to see it applied to patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrating how one test can help answer several clinical questions. We are really excited this technology is now in the process of being implemented in one of the best hospitals in the world, to improve patient management and reduce antimicrobial resistance.

Because of this, standard 2D cell culture models used for drug screening tend to perform poorly when predicting response to potential therapies.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and rising air pollution levels, incidence of IPF is anticipated to rise, urgently increasing the need for strong model systems.In APL Bioengineering, from AIP Publishing, researchers from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, describe a 3D cell culturing platform that allows study of lung fibroblasts and their microenvironment. The platform enables measurement of cell behaviors and microenvironment changes involved in the disease progression of IPF, and the platform s size and simplicity make it suitable for use in high-throughput drug screening protocols. IPF is a horrible disease that drastically impacts a patient s life and eventually causes them to die from lack of oxygen,  said co-author Katherine Cummins.  It s really important to have lab tools and models that create and control the microenvironment in which the cells sit, because this may be key to preclinical identification of possible treatments. Unlike rodent IPF models that do not mimic progressive disease and other cell culture systems that lack the surrounding microenvironment, their microtissue platform allows study of fibroblasts within an extracellular matrix (ECM). Changes in the ECM are a hallmark of IPF, so the system allows more relevant functional outputs. Moreover, its simplicity and tunability make it easy to use. Many organoid and lab-on-a-chip platforms can be hard to use,  said co-author David Wood.  What s exciting is that this system is very easy to use. We ve already disseminated it to two other labs who are using it completely independent of us. Validation of the system s functioning focused primarily on ECM remodeling (i.e., cell-driven changes to the microenvironment) and cell contractility, which increases in activated, diseased fibroblasts.Multiple tests for each of these two functions demonstrated the system robustly quantifies key aspects of fibrosis. These results were reproduced using patient-donated cells as well, indicating the system could be used for personalized medicine.Moreover, the system s versatility allows it to be used with different cell types and other matrix components, so it could be adapted for use in the study of other diseases where cell-microenvironment interactions contribute to disease. The research team has already used the system to study liver toxicity and anticipates it could be used across multiple solid organ systems, including in the study of cancer progression and metastasis.Reference: Cummins KA, Bitterman PB, Tschumperlin DJ, Wood DK.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/studying-the-life-history-of-prostate-cancer-355910,Studying the Life History of Prostate Cancer Researchers have developed a new way to study the life history of prostate cancer in mice  The method allows scientists to study the behavior and properties of prostate cancer in a setting that accurately mimics the disease in real life  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Associate Professor Pavel Osten and Professor Lloyd Trotman have developed a new way to study the life history of prostate cancer in mice. The pair combined their expertise in whole-organ imaging and prostate cancer to track how prostate cancer cells grow into tumors and spread to other organs. Their method allows scientists to study the behavior and properties of prostate cancer, for the first time, in a setting that accurately mimics the disease in real life. The study led by Julian Taranda, a former postdoc in the Osten lab, was published in Cell Reports.Natural tumors usually originate from a single cell that went awry. However, synthetic tumors grown in lab mice often originate from millions of cells instead of individual ones. Trotman says this process does not accurately reflect how cancer usually starts. He explains: If you think of skin cancer, right? It s going to be a cell that has suffered UV irradiation that s going to be the trigger, not essentially your entire skin in general. The new approach described by Osten and Trotman uses a more tailored technique to studying very early prostate cancer. lt uses a virus to transform as little as one normal mouse prostate cell into a cancerous cell. This lone cancer cell can be located using a microscope technique called whole-organ serial two-photon tomography. The tomography machine is fully automated. It takes an image of all the cells on the top layer of an organ, slices off that piece, images what is in the next layer, and repeats the process until it has photographed the entire organ. Then, using an artificial intelligence program, the machine creates a 3D reconstruction of the organ, at single-cell resolution. Osten says this is important because: In the later stages of cancer, you have a big bulk of cancer cells and it s easy to find them. In the early stage, you may have very few cells in the organ. And so looking with traditional methods is really painful because you have to slice and look and find. The researchers were able to track the progression of prostate cancer cells from their birth up to 20 days later, when they started spreading within the organ. Later, these fugitive cells started migrating to the liver and, unexpectedly, the brain.The scientists hope this versatile new method will help tackle unexplored questions about the early steps of cancer s growth and escape into other organs, wherever it starts.

Alternatively, separation technologies that use mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) containing metal-organic framework (MOF) fillers do not require heat and consume up to 90 percent less energy than distillation, resulting in a more efficient separation process with sustainability benefits, in addition to added energy and cost savings. However, the lack of interfacial adhesion between the polymer matrix and the MOF filler causes nanosized gaps, creating defects and voids on the membrane s surface, which can diminish the selectivity of the MMM. Inspired by nature, Gyorgy Szekely and Rifan Hardian from KAUST, working with scientists from the University of Manchester, Hokkaido University and the Japan Science and Technology Agency, have overcome the interfacial adhesion problems by fabricating MOF nanoparticle fillers that are more compatible with the MMM s polymer matrix. This eliminates the formation of pinholes at the filler matrix interface and significantly improves the performance of the membranes.  The approach was inspired by cementum, the tissue layer that covers the root of the tooth, which is connected to the surrounding tissues by collagen fibers,  says Hardian.  In our case, the MOF crystal is connected to or entangled with the surrounding polymer matrix by grafting with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide).  To fabricate the membranes, the researchers first prepared a series of MMMs using polybenzimidazole and zirconium-based MOF nanoparticles of the UiO-series, namely UiO-66-NH2, UiO-67-NH2, and UiO-68-NH2. These nanoparticles had similar chemical and surface properties but with increasing pore size, which allowed the team to investigate how various pore sizes influence the separation in MMMs. The nanoparticles  surfaces were then covalently grafted with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), or PNIPAM chains, which became entangled with the MMMs polymer matrix, preventing the formation of pinholes. Hardian says that PNIPAM is a promising candidate for polymer grafting due to its interesting hydrogen-bonding properties and easy synthesis.  And due to the regularity of the pore arrangement and tunability of the pore size in the MOF structure, we can now fine-tune the molecular sieving performance of the MMMs,  says Hardian. The researchers are now investigating the possibility of enhancing the MOF/matrix adhesion without the need for surface grafting. By increasing the chemical compatibility of the fillers and the polymers in MMMs, the work  may eliminate the necessity of grafting agents, making the membrane fabrication process simpler and more environmentally sustainable,  says Szekely.ReferenceCseri L, Hardian R, Anan S, et al.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-does-the-quality-of-protein-in-plant-based-burgers-compare-to-meat-355906,How Does the Quality of Protein in Plant Based Burgers Compare to Meat  A new standard for protein quality which reflects our body s use of protein  the digestible indispensable amino acid score  has been devised and used to understand protein quality in beef  pork and plant based burgers  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Plant-based burgers often promise protein comparable to their animal-based counterparts, but the way protein is expressed on current nutrition labels   a single generic value expressed in grams   can be misleading. That s because the human body does not use  protein  per se. Instead, it needs essential amino acids, which are present in proteins, but the concentration and digestibility of amino acids are different among protein sources.To account for these differences, a new standard for protein quality, the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS), was developed by the U.N. s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) about a decade ago. It specifically focuses on the digestibility of essential amino acids, and aims to put more accurate tools in the hands of nutritionists and food assistance programs the world over.  A new study from the University of Illinois and Colorado State University leverages the DIAAS system to understand protein quality in beef and pork burgers and plant-based burgers from Impossible  and Beyond Meat . The researchers fed pork burgers, 80% and 93% lean beef burgers, the soy-based Impossible Burger, and pea-based Beyond Burger to pigs, the FAO s recommended research subject for DIAAS studies. They then measured digestibility of individual essential amino acids, and used those digestibility scores to compute DIAAS values. Both beef and pork burgers, served without buns, scored as  excellent  sources of protein (DIAAS scores 100+, for people of all ages). The Impossible Burger, when served without a bun, also scored as an excellent protein source for ages 3 and up, but not for children less than 3 years old. With a value of 83, the bunless Beyond Burger was a  good  source of protein for ages 3 and up.  We have previously observed that animal proteins have greater DIAAS values than plant-based proteins and that is also what we observed in this experiment,  says Hans H. Stein, professor in the Department of Animal Sciences and the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Illinois and co-author on the European Journal of Nutrition study. Burger patties are typically eaten with a bun, so the researchers also looked at the protein quality of patties and buns together. Because grain products, like hamburger buns, offer low protein quality, feeding the bun and the patties together reduced DIAAS values. Consuming the Impossible Burger together with a bun reduced the DIAAS value to  good  (for ages 3 and up). But when pork or 80% lean beef patties were consumed together with buns, DIAAS values were still at or above 100 for the over-3 age group, demonstrating that the needs for all essential amino acids were met by these combinations.  There was a greater DIAAS value of mixing either the pork or beef burger with the bun   values of 107 and 105 respectively, for the over-3 age group   than there was for the Impossible Burger, which had a DIAAS value of 86 if consumed with the bun. That means you need to eat 15% more of the Impossible Burger- bun combination to get the same amount of digestible amino acids as if you eat the pork-based or the beef-based burgers. And if you have to eat more, that means you also get more calories,  says Mahesh Narayanan Nair, professor at Colorado State University and a co-author of the publication. Stein says,  It's particularly children, teenagers, lactating women, and older people who are at risk of not getting enough amino acids. Results of this experiment, along with previous data, demonstrate the importance of getting animal-based proteins into diets to provide sufficient quantities of digestible essential amino acids to these populations.  This is also really important in developing countries where there may be little access to animal-based proteins, particularly for children. In some countries, a majority of children are amino acid deprived. That s extremely serious because, if children don't get enough amino acids, their brain development can suffer. It's especially important in those cases to design a strategy for getting high-quality proteins into diets for children. ReferenceFanelli NS et al.

The study, published in Science, identified more than 100 probable protein complexes for the first time and provided structural models for more than 700 previously uncharacterized ones. Insights into the ways pairs or groups of proteins fit together to carry out cellular processes could lead to a wealth of new drug targets. Our results represent a significant advance in the new era in structural biology in which computation plays a fundamental role,  said Qian Cong, Ph.D., Assistant Professor in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development with a secondary appointment in Biophysics.Dr. Cong led the study with David Baker, Ph.D., Professor of Biochemistry and Dr. Cong s postdoctoral mentor at the University of Washington prior to her recruitment to UT Southwestern. The study has four co-lead authors, including UT Southwestern Computational Biologist Jimin Pei, Ph.D.Proteins often operate in pairs or groups known as complexes to accomplish every task needed to keep an organism alive, Dr. Cong explained. While some of these interactions are well studied, many remain a mystery. Constructing comprehensive interactomes   or descriptions of the complete set of molecular interactions in a cell   would shed light on many fundamental aspects of biology and give researchers a new starting point on developing drugs that encourage or discourage these interactions. Dr. Cong works in the emerging field of interactomics, which combines bioinformatics and biology.Until recently, a major barrier for constructing an interactome was uncertainty over the structures of many proteins, a problem scientists have been trying to solve for half a century. In 2020 and 2021, a company called DeepMind and Dr. Baker s lab independently released two AI technologies called AlphaFold (AF) and RoseTTAFold (RF) that use different strategies to predict protein structures based on the sequences of the genes that produce them.In the current study, Dr. Cong, Dr. Baker, and their colleagues expanded on those AI structure-prediction tools by modeling many yeast protein complexes. Yeast is a common model organism for fundamental biological studies. To find proteins that were likely to interact, the scientists first searched the genomes of related fungi for genes that acquired mutations in a linked fashion. They then used the two AI technologies to determine whether these proteins could be fit together in 3D structures.Their work identified 1,505 probable protein complexes. Of these, 699 had already been structurally characterized, verifying the utility of their method. However, there was only limited experimental data supporting 700 of the predicted interactions, and another 106 had never been described.To better understand these poorly characterized or unknown complexes, the University of Washington and UT Southwestern teams worked with colleagues around the world who were already studying these or similar proteins. By combining the 3D models the scientists in the current study had generated with information from collaborators, the teams were able to gain new insights into protein complexes involved in maintenance and processing of genetic information, cellular construction and transport systems, metabolism, DNA repair, and other areas. They also identified roles for proteins whose functions were previously unknown based on their newly identified interactions with other well-characterized proteins. The work described in our new paper sets the stage for similar studies of the human interactome and could eventually help in developing new treatments for human disease,  Dr. Cong added.Dr. Cong noted that the predicted protein complex structures generated in this study are available to download from ModelArchive. These structures and others generated using this technology in future studies will be a rich source of research questions for years to come, she said.Dr. Cong is a Southwestern Medical Foundation Scholar in Biomedical Research.

His overall research goal is to understand Treg biology more thoroughly in order to use the cells to treat a range of autoimmune problems. I became passionate about the immune system while getting my Ph.D. at Harvard. My mentor was Dr. Jack Strominger, who crystallized the structure of HLA proteins back in the 1980s. Understanding HLA is so important in immunology because it is one of the main  keys  of how our bodies recognize our own cells from foreign cells, or self versus non-self,  explained Ferreira.In his postdoctoral training at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), Ferreira turned his focus to engineering the immune system of organ transplant recipients to reduce transplant rejection.  Right now, it is hard to find a match for patients who need organ transplants. This is because matching the HLA proteins is a major barrier. Humans have 18 different types of HLA proteins, which is why there is a huge organ donor database, yet so few patients matched with donors. Ferreira thinks of the immune system as an army. The Tregs are the  generals,  and the other immune cells are the  soldiers.  The Tregs guide the other immune cells by suppressing them when they become over-activated, as in autoimmunity, and by letting them fully function when there is a threat, such as infections or cancer. The immune system is involved in every body function; it is not static. T-cells have 'X-ray' vision with blinders to see only the intracellular proteins in other cells that they are supposed to attack,  said Ferreira.For the past five years, he has been optimizing CARs to direct T-cells to certain targets. A CAR replaces a T-cell s normal surface receptor, the T-cell receptor, or TCR, which assigns the T-cell to a single surface HLA protein complex. Ferreira s research involves taking immune cells from people and studying them, with the goal of using Tregs as  living drugs. Type 1 diabetes is a useful model for determining if the CAR Tregs are functioning therapeutically. The CAR Tregs are designed to go to the pancreas and put out the autoimmune fire. Insulin has been used as a Type 1 diabetes treatment for 100 years as of this year, but it does not treat the source of the problem, he said. Immunology can get to the root of the problem by stopping the chronic inflammation that is causing the disease.Ferreira said that the research, described in the Frontiers in Immunology article, is one of the first to precision engineer CAR Tregs using a gene-editing method called CRISPR-Cas9. This process is like using a scalpel to remove the original Treg TCR precisely and then insert the CAR in its place. This method is safer because it ensures that only one copy of the CAR is present and that the CAR is regulated in the same way as the original TCR.Using a  humanized  mouse model of diabetes with human islet cells and human immune cells, Ferreira and his colleagues at UCSF found that the CAR Tregs could delay or reduce the damaging inflammation. He said that the rich biology of the Tregs is just now being explored, and the use of CARs may provide artificial tolerance with specificity. Ferreira is now conducting studies in his lab at Hollings to optimize and understand the CAR Treg biology more fully.There are translational challenges that must be overcome before CAR Tregs can become living drugs, such as cost and approval. One biological hurdle is that Tregs only make up approximately 1% to 2% of the white blood cells, so getting enough cells for therapies is a challenge.Ferreira believes that it is important to have a mix of basic science and translational research projects ongoing, since the results inform both areas of research. I am excited about using the clean cell facility here at MUSC. I have a garage full of different CARs and am eager to study how they work. There is the potential that some of the CAR Tregs can be used in cancer, and Hollings is the perfect place to collaborate with cancer researchers,  said Ferreira.His vision for the immunology program at Hollings is to help the cancer center continue to expand its cellular therapies and be a part of making this therapy more accessible to patients.  There is a powerful interactive dynamic between the research faculty here. The smaller faculty size combined with the collaborative atmosphere, translational resources and cGMP clean cell facility make this an exciting time to be a part of this great research community at MUSC,  he said.Reference: Muller YD, Ferreira LMR, Ronin E, et al.

But often, these therapies   especially those based on immune cells   must be tailored to the individual patient, costing valuable time and pushing their price into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.Now, in a study published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, UCLA researchers report a critical step forward in the development of an  off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy using rare but powerful immune cells that could potentially be produced in large quantities, stored for extended periods and safely used to treat a wide range of patients with various cancers. In order to reach the most patients, we want cell therapies that can be mass-produced, frozen and shipped to hospitals around the world,  said Lili Yang, a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA and the study s senior author.  That way, doses of these therapies can be ready and waiting for patients as soon as they are needed. For the study, Yang and her colleagues focused on invariant natural killer T cells, or iNKT cells, which are unique not only for their power and efficacy but also because they don t carry the risk of graft-versus-host disease, which occurs when transplanted cells attack a recipient s body and which is the reason most cell-based immunotherapies must be created on a patient-specific basis, Yang said.The researchers developed a new method for producing large numbers of these iNKT cells using blood-forming stem cells, which can self-replicate and produce all kinds of blood and immune cells. The team used stem cells obtained from four donor cord-blood samples and eight donor peripheral blood samples. Our findings suggest that one cord blood donation could produce up to 5,000 doses of the therapy and one peripheral blood donation could produce up to 300,000 doses,  said Yang, who is also an associate professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and a member of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. At this yield, the cost of producing immune cell products could be dramatically reduced. The researchers first used genetic engineering to program the blood-forming stem cells to make them more likely to develop into iNKT cells. Next, these genetically engineered stem cells were placed into artificial thymic organoids, which mimic the environment of the thymus, a specialized organ in which T cells naturally mature in the body. After eight weeks in the organoids, each stem cell produced, on average, 100,000 iNKT cells.Yang and her collaborators then tested the resulting cells, called hematopoietic stem cell-engineered iNKT cells, or HSC iNKT cells, by comparing their cancer-fighting abilities with those of immune cells called natural killer cells, or NK cells. In a lab dish, the HSC iNKT cells were significantly better at killing multiple types of human tumor cells   including leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma cells   than the NK cells, the researchers found.Even more importantly, the HSC iNKT cells sustained their tumor-killing efficacy after being frozen and thawed, an essential requirement for widespread distribution of an off-the-shelf cell therapy.The researchers next equipped the HSC iNKT cells with a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, a specialized molecule used in some immunotherapies to enable immune cells to recognize and kill a specific type of cancer. In this case, they added to the HSC iNKT cells a CAR that targets a protein found on multiple myeloma cells and then tested the cells  ability to fight human multiple myeloma tumors that had been transplanted into mice.These CAR-equipped HSC iNKT cells eliminated the multiple myeloma tumors, and the mice that underwent this treatment remained tumor-free and showed no signs of complications such as graft-versus-host disease throughout their lives.The researchers are now working to improve their manufacturing methods by moving to a feeder-free system that eliminates the need for supportive cells  such as those used in the thymic organoids  to assist blood stem cells in producing iNKT cells. Yang says she hopes this advance will better enable mass-production of the therapy and, ultimately, its clinical and commercial development.The paper s co first authors are UCLA doctoral students Yan-Ruide (Charlie) Li and Yang (Alice) Zhao.

But exactly how the behaviour of individual cells is regulated remains unclear. One unique feature of beta cells is that microtubules, which serve as roads for intracellular trafficking, form a mesh-like grid pattern rather than a wheel spoke-like pattern seen in many other cells. Previous studies have hinted that this may play a role in the release of insulin. We wanted to further explore the role of the beta cell s microtubules in regulating insulin release in response to sugar,  says first author Kathryn Trogden, a former Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, US.To do this, Trogden and her colleagues analysed the timing and location of insulin secretion in individual mouse beta cells grown in the laboratory under different conditions. They found that the stability of microtubule structures varies from cell to cell and affects how much insulin is released in response to sugar. Less insulin is released in cells with static stable microtubules, and more insulin is released from cells where microtubules are dynamically turned over. Sugar exposure causes the microtubule structures to disassemble and release insulin,  Trogden explains.  Normally, this release occurs at specialised sites within each of the selected beta cells. These sites are known as   hotspots  of insulin secretion.  But the team found that when microtubules are missing from beta cells, secretion hotspots fire in multiple random cells rather than in selected sub-populations of cells only. The timing of insulin secretion also changes, causing prolonged and excessive release of insulin.These microtubule-driven changes in secretion were independent of the release of calcium in the cells, which also plays a role in regulating insulin release. This suggests that there are multiple, layered systems for fine-tuning insulin release in these cells. Our findings uncover a new role for microtubules in tuning insulin secretion hotspots in selected cells, which leads to the precisely measured and carefully timed release of insulin in response to sugar,  concludes senior author Irina Kaverina, Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University.  This is an important step towards understanding what underlies the functional diversity of beta cells, one of the parameters that dramatically changes in diabetes. We envision that our study will, in the long run, be impactful for future diabetes prevention and therapy. Kaverina adds that the next steps for her team include determining how microtubules regulate secretion sites at the molecular level and exploring how this process changes in disease conditions.Reference: Trogden KP, Lee JS, Bracey KM, et al.

The study s findings might one day lead to personalized learning strategies based on a person s cognitive and brain development.The researchers found that whereas adults build integrated memories with inferences already baked in, children and adolescents create separate memories that they later compare to make inferences on the fly. How adults structure knowledge is not necessarily optimal for children, because adult strategies might require brain machinery that is not fully mature in children,  said Alison Preston, professor of neuroscience and psychology and senior author of the study published today in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. She co-led the study with first author Margaret Schlichting, formerly a doctoral student in Preston s lab and currently assistant professor of psychology at the University of Toronto.To understand the distinction between how adults and children make inferences, imagine visiting a day care center. In the morning, you see a child arriving with one adult, but in the afternoon that child leaves with a different adult. You might infer that the two grown-ups are the child s parents and are a couple, and your second memory would include both the second person you saw and information from your earlier experience in order to make an inference about how the two adults   whom you didn t actually see together   might relate to each other.This new study finds that a child who has the same experiences isn t likely to make the same kind of inference that an adult would during the second experience. The two memories are less connected. If you ask your child to infer who that child s parents are, your child can still do it; he or she just has to retrieve the two distinct memories and then reason about how each adult might be related.The neural machinery of children and adults differs, and the strategy that children use may be optimal for the way their brains are wired before key memory systems in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex fully mature, the researchers believe. That difference could keep children from recalling past memories during new learning and limit their ability to connect events. In the absence of a mature memory system, the best thing a child can do is lay down accurate, non-overlapping memory traces,  Preston said.  From those accurate memory traces, children can later bring them to mind to promote inferences about their connections. The researchers asked 87 subjects, ages 7 to 30, to look at pairs of images while lying in an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scanner, which measures brain activity by detecting small changes in blood flow with images that, as in the day care example above, provide opportunities to infer relationships between objects that had not appeared together.The researchers found that the strategy adolescents used for making inferences was different from both that of young children and adults. Going back to the example of the parents at the day care, when an adolescent stores a memory of the second grown-up with the child, the adolescent suppresses the earlier memory involving the first one. Each memory becomes even more distinct than with younger children, and there are even fewer automatic inferences about how the two adults relate. Teenagers may have learning strategies that are tuned to explore the world more so than exploiting what they already know,  Preston said.This and other lessons from the study could inform strategies for improving teaching and learning at various ages. From a brain maturation perspective, different people are going to be at different places,  Preston said,  and we can devise learning strategies that take advantage of the neural machinery that an individual has at hand, no matter if they are 7 years old or 70 years old.

However, a new MIT study suggests that these regions form much earlier than previously thought. In a study of babies ranging in age from two to nine months, the researchers identified areas of the infant visual cortex that already show strong preferences for either faces, bodies, or scenes, just as they do in adults.

Jarve Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a member of MIT s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the new study.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers collected usable data from more than 50 infants, a far greater number than any research lab has been able to scan before. This allowed them to examine the infant visual cortex in a way that had not been possible until now. This is a result that s going to make a lot of people have to really grapple with their understanding of the infant brain, the starting point of development, and development itself,  says Heather Kosakowski, an MIT graduate student and the lead author of the study, which appears today in Current Biology.","Published: November 16, 2021"

Chromatin is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells; regions of chromatin at key gene regulatory elements appear in open configurations within certain cell nuclei. Precisely delineating these accessible chromatin regions in cells of different human tissue types would be a major step toward understanding the role of gene regulatory elements (non-coding DNA) in human health or disease. The findings are published online in the November 12, 2021 issue of Cell.For scientists, the human genome, popularly called the  book of life,  is mostly unwritten. Or at least unread. While science has famously put an (approximate) number to all of the protein-coding genes required to build a human being, approximately 20,000+, that estimation does not really begin to explain how exactly the construction process works or, in the case of disease, it might go awry.  The human genome was sequenced 20 years ago, but interpreting the meaning of this book of life continues to be challenging,  said Bing Ren, PhD, director of the Center for Epigenomics, professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a member of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at UC San Diego.  A major reason is that the majority of the human DNA sequence, more than 98 percent, is non-protein-coding, and we do not yet have a genetic code book to unlock the information embedded in these sequences. Put another way, it s a bit like knowing chapter titles but with the rest of the pages still blank.Efforts to fill in the blanks are broadly captured in an ongoing international effort called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), and include the work of Ren and colleagues. In particular, they have investigated the role and function of chromatin, a complex of DNA and proteins that form chromosomes within the nuclei of eukaryotic cells. DNA carries the cell s genetic instructions. The major proteins in chromatin, called histones, help tightly package the DNA in a compact form that fits within the cell nucleus. (There are roughly six feet of DNA tucked into each cell nucleus and approximately 10 billion miles in each human body.) Changes in how chromatin bundles up DNA are associated with DNA replication and gene expression. After working with mice, Ren and collaborators turned their attention to a single-cell atlas of chromatin in the human genome.  They applied assays to more than 600,000 human cells sampled from 30 adult human tissue types from multiple donors, then integrated that information with similar data from 15 fetal tissue types to reveal the status of chromatin at approximately 1.2 million candidate cis-regulatory elements in 222 distinct cell types.  One of the initial challenges was identifying the best experimental conditions for such a diverse set of sample types, particularly given each tissue s unique makeup and sensitivity to homogenization,  said study co-author Sebastian Preissl, PhD, associate director for Single Cell Genomics at UC San Diego Center for Epigenomics, a collaborative research center that carried out the assays. Cis-regulatory elements are regions of non-coding DNA that regulate transcription (copying a segment of DNA into RNA) of neighboring genes. Transcription is the essential process that converts genetic information into action.  Studies in the last decade have established that sequence variations in non-coding DNA are a key driver in multi-genic traits and diseases in human populations, such as diabetes, Alzheimer s  disease and autoimmune diseases,  said study co-author Kyle J. Gaulton, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  A new paradigm that helps explain how these noncoding variants contribute to diseases posits that these sequence alterations disrupt function of transcriptional regulatory elements and lead to dysregulation of gene expression in disease-relevant cell types, such as neurons, immune cells or epithelial cells,  said co-first author Kai Zhang, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine.  A major barrier to unlocking the function of noncoding risk variants, however, is the lack of cell-type-specific maps of transcriptional regulatory elements in the human genome.  Ren said the new findings identify disease-trait-relevant cell types for 240 multi-genic traits and diseases, and annotate the risk of noncoding variants.  We believe that this resource will greatly facilitate the study of mechanism across a broad spectrum of human diseases for many years to come.  Preissl said the chromatin atlas will also allow the scientific community to unravel tissue environment-specific differences of cell types that reside in multiple tissues, such as fibroblasts, immune cells or endothelial cells.Reference: Zhang K, Hocker JD, Miller M, et al.

Central to this regular rhythm is the circadian clock, timekeepers that are present in virtually every organ, tissue and cell type. When a clock goes awry, sleep disruption or a variety of diseases can result. A recent Northwestern University discovery could help in understanding how this clock is linked to daily cycles. A team of neurobiologists has identified a new gene, called Tango10, that is critical for daily behavioral rhythms. This gene is involved in a molecular pathway by which the core circadian clock (the  gears ) controls the cellular output of the clock (the  hands ) to control daily sleep-wake cycles.While the study was done using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the findings have implications for humans.Knowledge of how this pathway works could lead to therapeutics to help sleep problems and could shed light on clock-related human diseases, such as depression, neurodegenerative disease and metabolic disease. Scientists know a lot about the clock s  gears  but not so much about the  hands,  where the behavior is produced, or the connection between the two,  said Dr. Ravi Allada, a circadian rhythms expert who led the study. We wanted to better understand the molecular underpinnings of the daily  wake-up signal,  which alerts an animal it s time to awake,  he said.  In this study, we focused on pacemaker neurons that control the sleep-wake cycle and used genetic screening to identify genes that regulate the neurons. Allada is the Edgar C. Stuntz Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience and chair of the neurobiology department in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Allada also is associate director of Northwestern s Center for Sleep and Circadian Biology.The study will be published this week by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Allada is the corresponding author of the paper.In addition to the fly experiments conducted in Allada s lab, the Northwestern team worked with Casey Diekman and Matthew Moye at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who performed computational modeling experiments.The Northwestern researchers screened a number of genes they thought could be important for the circadian clock s operation and behavior of the fly. Through this process, they discovered the gene called Tango10. When they knocked out this gene, the fly lost its normal 24-hour rhythm of behavior. Certain potassium currents were reduced and likely resulted in hyperactive neurons and contributed to a loss of regular rhythm.Under normal conditions in the fly, the levels of Tango10 protein go up and down with circadian time which can modulate the activity of the neurons to go up and down, which in turn can drive the animal s sleep-wake cycle and behavior. In flies that lack the Tango10 gene, this daily rhythm is disrupted. Our findings fill a molecular gap in our understanding of how the core gears of the clock control the hands,  Allada said.This article has been republished from the following materials.

And what kind of laughter do we find most positive? A new study by researchers from the University of Amsterdam with international colleagues shows that our laughter gives us away. The study included Dutch and Japanese producers of laughter and listeners. Listeners could detect whether a laughing person is from their own or another cultural group by only hearing a brief laughter segment. Spontaneous laughter was rated as most positive by both groups. The results are now published in a special issue on voice modulation of Philosophical Transactions B.Analyzing these data, the authors find that listeners were able to detect group membership from both spontaneous and voluntary laughter, and equally well. Spontaneous laughter was rated as more positive than voluntary laughter across the two cultures, and in-group laughs were perceived as more positive than out-group laughs by Dutch but not Japanese listeners. Our results demonstrate that listeners can detect whether a laughing person is from their own or another cultural group at better-than-chance accuracy levels based on only hearing a brief laughter segment , conclude the authors.  Contrary to prediction, we found no advantage for the notion that participants would be better at identifying group membership from voluntary laughter.  These findings add to the growing literature on laughter as a rich vocal signal that can be used by listeners to make a wide range of inferences about others, from their social relationships to their identity.Reference: Kamilo lu RG, Tanaka A, Scott SK, Sauter DA.

The widely used food additive   which helps keep the liquid smooth and well-mixed even after days sitting on a store shelf   is not desired by many consumers, especially in organic chocolate milk.  Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of carrageenan, concerns about its safety remain, according to team leader Federico Harte, professor of food science. He noted that some scientists believe that the additive   a compound extracted from red seaweed   can cause inflammation and digestive problems such as bloating and irritable bowel disease. As a result, the additive is banned in infant formula in the European Union. This research is not about being against carrageenan   it s about consumers wanting clean food labels with only ingredients they recognize,  he said.  And carrageenan definitely is not something they want in chocolate milk. We know that USDA has considered banning it for organic chocolate milks. Our results indicate that would be possible. In the study, researchers thermally treated fat-free chocolate milk formulations containing skim milk, cocoa powder and sugar and then processed them using high-pressure jet technology from 125 to 500 megapascals. The viscosity, flow properties and stability of chocolate milks treated with high-pressure jets were compared with chocolate milks that did not undergo high-pressure jet processing, prepared both with and without adding carrageenan.As expected, carrageenan-free chocolate milk exhibited immediate phase separation of the cocoa powder, whereas formulations containing carrageenan were stable for 14 days, with cocoa particles not dropping out of suspension. However, the researchers observed increased stability with increasing jet processing pressure, with maximum stability achieved when chocolate milk was processed at 500 megapascals. We believe that structural changes in casein micelles   a kind of milk protein   and new casein-cocoa interactions induced by high-pressure jet processing increased cocoa stability in the chocolate milk,  Harte said.  Because milk protein seemed to be the major component enhancing cocoa stability in samples treated with this method, we conducted a second study to determine the effect of additional milk protein and high-pressure jet processing on the stability of fat-free chocolate milk. In findings recently published in the Journal of Dairy Science, the researchers reported that formulations with 4%  micellar casein  processed at 500 megapascals showed no phase separation over a 14-day storage period, stored at 39 degrees Fahrenheit. The addition of milk protein together with high-pressure jet processing at 500 megapascals resulted in a higher apparent viscosity that keeps cocoa particles suspended.Because the use of high-pressure jet technology to improve the dispersion stability of cocoa provides the industry with a processing alternative to produce clean label, yet stable, low-fat chocolate milk, Penn State has applied for a provisional patent on the process and is working with a dairy food manufacturer to develop and scale it up.High-pressure jet processing of food is a completely new concept, Harte pointed out, and he has been experimenting with the idea for about six years at Penn State. His work on the technology in a pilot plant in the Rodney A. Erickson Food Science Building is unique because it uses an intensifier pump the size of a subcompact car to spray milk through a diamond or sapphire nozzle. The liquid exits the nozzle as a jet of fine droplets that collide with the air, forming an aerosol. The equipment that we use for making these chocolate milks is not equipment that you find in the food industry   you would normally find it in an engineering services shop,  Harte said.  This equipment is used for cutting metals. It's a water jet instrument that is used for cutting tough materials such as marble or stainless steel. We are using it in a completely different application. Harte bought the equipment with funds from a National Institutes of Health grant a decade ago when he was a faculty member at the University of Tennessee and had it shipped to the University Park campus when he came to Penn State.  You won t find this type of instrument in any university food science department in the U.S.,  he said.  And I don't know of any in other parts of the world, either. To appreciate the pressure developed by the pump that processes the chocolate milk, Harte offers this comparison: At the bottom of the Mariana Trench   the deepest point in any ocean   the pressure is 100 megapascals.  We are applying five times that pressure, 500 megapascals,  he said.  The liquid, as it leaves the orifice, is moving at Mach 3   three times the speed of sound.

One of the fears that many scientists have is that a warming planet will liberate significant portions of the soil s carbon, turning it into carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, and so further accelerate the pace of planetary warming. One of the key players in this story is the microbe: invisible, and yet the predominant form of life on earth. Microbes are everywhere and in everything,  says Kristen DeAngelis, professor of microbiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and senior author of the study, recently published in ISME Communications.  There are billions of microbes in one teaspoon of soil; a trillion times more microbes than stars in the known universe. And yet, we don t know that much about them. It seems that microbial activity has a large effect on the atmosphere, especially in how microbes help convert organic carbon think of all the fallen leaves, rotting tree stumps, grasses and other organic matter into soil, keeping that carbon out of the atmosphere. It s this soil organic matter, or SOM, that acts not only as a carbon sink but also gives soil its ability to absorb water and prevent flooding as well as to be a nutritious source of energy for plant life.And yet, it s not entirely clear how microbes form SOM.  Our study sheds light on the relevance of microbial community composition and activity to shape the composition of SOM,  says lead author Luiz A. Domeignoz-Horta, now at the University of Zurich s department of evolutionary biology and environmental studies, but who completed his research for this paper as part of DeAngelis s lab at UMass Amherst.  Before our study, no one knew that the particular composition of microbial communities was important for the formation of SOM. The team conducted an experiment in which they inoculated  model soils,  or sterile mixtures of sand and clay, with different microbial communities, and then fed the microbes sugars and vitamins so that they could grow over the course of four months, building SOM the whole time. The group was then able to measure the SOM generated by these different communities, as well as to test how persistent the SOM was depending on the microbial community that created it.To do this, the team subjected the soils to a controlled process of pyrolysis or heating, up to 650 O C, in the absence of oxygen.  As we heated the soils, we recorded when the soil began to release carbon gas. More  thermally stable  samples of SOM reached temperatures above 400O C, while the less thermally stable samples emitted more carbon in the 200   300O C range,  says Domeignoz-Horta, who led the team s international collaboration.  This assay was performed by our soil biochemists  collaborators in Switzerland, and it is a great example of the importance of a multidisciplinary research team to advance science,  observes Domeignoz-Horta.What the researchers discovered is not only further evidence linking microbes to SOM formation, but that different microbial communities shaped the composition of SOM in distinct ways, including the SOM s ability to withstand being turned into CO2. While it seems that bacteria are primarily responsible for driving the creation of SOM in this model system, it is the presence of fungal communities that render soil able to withstand warming temperatures. I see this invisible world of bacteria and fungi, the microbial world, everywhere,  says DeAngelis.  Most microbes help us, and we need to know more about them to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our own world. Reference: Domeignoz-Horta LA, Shinfuku M, Junier P, et al.

There has been a huge effort to discover drugs aimed at improving metabolic health and ageing without requiring a change in diet, he said. Diet is a powerful medicine. However, presently drugs are administered without consideration of whether and how they might interact with our diet composition   even when these drugs are designed to act in the same way, and on the same nutrient-signalling pathways as diet,  said Professor Simpson.The researchers set out to discover whether drugs or diet were more powerful in remodelling nutrient-sensing and other metabolic pathways, as well as whether drugs and diet interacted in ways that made them more or less effective. We discovered dietary composition had a far more powerful effect than drugs, which largely dampened responses to diet rather than reshaped them,  said Professor Simpson. Given humans share essentially the same nutrient-signalling pathways as mice, the research suggests people would get better value from changing their diet to improve metabolic health rather than taking the drugs we studied.

But now a ground-breaking Macquarie University study has found a commonly used disinfectant may be a double agent, blocking antibiotics from working and even promoting antibiotic resistance.Antimicrobial resistance is a huge, ever-growing, challenge for global healthcare, and among the worst offenders is a group of resistant bacteria known as the ESKAPE pathogens. These common bacteria   Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species   are harmless enough in their natural habitats of gut, soil or water. However, if a patient who is already critically ill or immunocompromised comes into contact with one, it can result in life-threatening illness including pneumonia, sepsis and wound infections. One of the last lines of defence against the ESKAPE pathogens are aminoglycoside antibiotics, but now they, too, are under threat from friendly fire. Biocides are not regulated in Australia, and there isn t a lot of information on what they are doing to the bacteria they are being used on. A team led by Dr Francesca Short and Professor Ian Paulsen, from Macquarie University s Department of Molecular Science, tested the effects of the disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BAC) on aminoglycosides and the ESKAPE pathogens.  BAC is a biocide disinfectant valued for being non-toxic, and as a result is widely used in healthcare, food safety and agriculture, as well as in common household products such as antibacterial wipes, wound disinfectants, eyedrops and eardrops,  Dr Short said.  Our study found BAC could not only prevent aminoglycoside antibiotics from working, but also promote the evolution of resistant bacteria, which is extremely concerning given how widely BAC used. This study   funded by a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council   is the first time researchers have systematically examined the interaction between BAC and aminoglycosides. The team found even when administered at low levels, BAC can block aminoglycosides from doing their job, as it prevents the antibiotics from entering the bacterial cell.  It also dramatically increases the frequency at which new, potentially resistant mutants emerge.  Our results suggest that measures need to be taken to prevent the exposure of bacteria to lower levels of BAC   levels that are not high enough to kill bacteria but may be high enough to allow mutations to occur or help the bacteria gradually get used to the effects of the antibiotics. As consumers, though, we shouldn t choose antibacterial products as a default just because we think they re giving our families better protection.  While disinfectants like antibacterial wipes usually contain high levels of BAC that are sufficient to kill the bacteria they come into contact with initially, they still pose a risk as this compound has a long half-life, which means it remains in the environment for a long time before breaking down.  Our results also suggest that the effectiveness of aminoglycosides may be reduced by low levels of BAC taken at the same time, for example, if someone were using antibacterial eyedrops while taking a course of antibiotics.  Dr Short said further research would help guide us in using these products to best effect, while reducing the risk of them causing bacteria to become more resistant.  There are many different factors determining which disinfectants are best for hospitals, and obviously we can t simply stop disinfecting surfaces in healthcare settings,  she said.  If you re cleaning around the house, in general there s no need to use anything marked  antibacterial .  Ordinary soap and cleaning products will remove nearly all the germs. While it s a good idea to use a bleach-based product on your toilet, you simply don t need hospital-grade disinfectant for your bathroom sink or a wipe that leaves an antibacterial residue on your kitchen bench.  When it comes to personal care products like eyedrops, in future, it would be preferable to switch to single-use, pre-sterilised products instead of using chemical preservatives, as BAC not only reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics, but can also cause irritation and even eye damage with long-term use.

However, the drug could still be of benefit if prescribed for longer and if given to people with very early disease. The findings are from the phase 2 multi-centre clinical trial known as RADAR ((Reducing pathology in Alzheimer s Disease through Angiotensin taRgeting).The trial, part of the Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia, was awarded nearly  2 million by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, an MRC and NIHR partnership, and investigated whether losartan, compared with a placebo, could reduce brain volume loss, as a measure of disease progression in people clinically diagnosed with established AD.The research, published in The Lancet Neurology, is the first to evaluate the potential benefit of losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, which is a drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, in clinically diagnosed AD using brain imaging as a primary outcome.It found that 12-months  treatment with losartan in patients with clinically diagnosed and established mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer s disease did not significantly slow down the progression of AD. Two-hundred and sixty-one people aged 55 years or older diagnosed with AD, who had not been prescribed similar hypertension drugs, and who had capacity to consent, were recruited from 23 UK National Health Service hospital trusts between 22 July 2014 and 17 May 2018.The 211 eligible participants were then randomly allocated with 105 assigned to receive the study drug, 100 mg of losartan, and 106 to the placebo (an identical looking pill with no active medicine) once a day for 12 months.  From the 197 (93%) participants who completed the study, primary outcome data were available for 171 (81%) participants.The trial assessed the rate of whole brain shrinkage (i.e. atrophy) on MRI scan compared with participants on losartan and those on placebo. The researchers also examined differences in memory tests, day-to-day quality of life and in a subgroup of participants, changes in levels of vascular damage to the brain as measured by MRI.Professor Pat Kehoe, Gestetner Professor of Translational Dementia Research at the University of Bristol, who led the trial, said:  With the current lack of effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), this is an extremely disappointing result for participants, patients and researchers alike that losartan, although well tolerated, was not effective in reducing the rate of brain atrophy in people with clinically diagnosed AD in the 12 months it was given, especially after so much encouraging evidence to support the need for this trial. However, we cannot exclude the possibility, given other findings that are emerging, that losartan, or similar drugs, given to people earlier and for longer in their development of Alzheimer s, such as folk with certain types of mild cognitive impairment, might still be protective.   It is vitally important we continue to search for effective treatments for AD because with an ageing population there will continue to be many people diagnosed with the disease, which will greatly impact on our already overstretched health and social care costs and resources. The research team are now exploring options to carry out further studies using losartan or other ways of treating the same biochemical deficits losartan was chosen to address, particularly those that might be possible to target in people with even milder specific impairments that might be indicative of very early signs of developing AD.Reference:Kehoe,PG, Turner, N, Howden, B et al.

The procedure involves replacing a patient s own blood-forming stem cells with a donor s stem cells and, in the process, eradicating cancer cells in the blood, lymph nodes and bone marrow.But many patients with such deadly blood cancers are too fragile to undergo stem cell transplants. That s because a patient s stem cells first must be destroyed by intensive chemotherapy and sometimes total body radiation before a donor s stem cells are infused. This so-called conditioning regimen makes space for incoming donor stem cells, helps to remove cancer cells remaining in the body, and depletes the patient s immune system so it can t attack the donor s stem cells. However, toxicities and suppression of the immune system caused by conditioning regimens puts patients at high risk of infections, organ damage and other life-threatening side effects.Now, studying mice, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a method of stem cell transplantation that does not require radiation or chemotherapy. Instead, the strategy takes an immunotherapeutic approach, combining the targeted elimination of blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow with immune-modulating drugs to prevent the immune system from rejecting the new donor stem cells. With the new technique, mice underwent successful stem cell transplants from unrelated mice without evidence of dangerously low blood cell counts that are a hallmark of the traditional procedure. The data also suggested that such stem cell transplants can be effective against leukemia.The study, available online in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, opens the door to safer stem cell transplantation, meaning more patients with various types of blood cancers could receive this potentially curative therapy, and it could be considered as a treatment for other diseases, such as sickle cell anemia or other genetic disorders, that are less life-threatening. To be able to do a stem cell transplant without having to give radiation or chemotherapy would be transformative,  said senior author and medical oncologist John F. DiPersio, MD, PhD, the Virginia E. & Sam J. Golman Professor of Medicine and chief of the Division of Oncology at Washington University School of Medicine.  It could eliminate the dangerously low blood cell counts, bleeding complications, organ damage, and infections. It has particular implications for conducting bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy for patients with noncancerous diseases such as sickle cell anemia, where the toxicities of chemotherapy- or radiation-associated conditioning are important to avoid. We have more work to do before we re ready to translate these findings to people, but we re encouraged by the results of this study. As an alternative to high-dose chemotherapy and whole-body radiation, DiPersio, who also directs the Center for Gene & Cellular Immunotherapy, and his colleagues harnessed drugs that are toxic to cells, and attached these drugs to antibodies that target specific surface proteins that are expressed primarily on bone marrow stem cells. Only when these antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) bind to those specific proteins are they then internalized by the stem cells, which leads to release of the drug payload inside the cell and, ultimately, cell death. Using the ricin derivative saporin as the drug payload, the researchers generated two different ADCs to target two specific proteins found on the surface of blood stem cells, which minimizes the potential for them to cause damage to other cell types.To prevent the recipient s immune system from then rejecting the donor cells, the researchers treated the mice with immunosuppressive compounds called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. In this study, the investigators primarily used baricitinib, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat rheumatoid arthritis. They found that baricitinib prevented the recipient s immune cells, including T cells and natural killer cells, from attacking the donor stem cells. By combining the antibody-drug conjugates with JAK inhibitors, we were able to achieve a successful transplant between two completely unrelated strains of mice,  said first author Stephen P. Persaud, MD, PhD, an instructor in pathology & immunology.  A successful transplant across such a stringent immunological barrier is promising for eventually being able to harness this technique for patients with leukemia. The researchers also found that the new technique struck a balance between the donor immune cells attacking leukemia cells   called the graft-versus-leukemia effect   in a common mouse model of leukemia and not attacking the recipient s healthy tissues, a dangerous condition called graft-versus-host disease. The mice in this study did not develop graft-versus-host disease because the immune suppressing drugs prevented it, another unique and significant advantage of this approach, according to the researchers. When you give JAK inhibitors from the beginning, there is evidence that they prevent graft-versus-host disease from developing later,  said DiPersio, who serves as deputy director of Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine.  In addition, unlike a regular transplant using radiation and chemotherapy as transplant conditioning, none of the mice developed any reduction in their blood counts, which is the major life-threatening complication of traditional stem cell transplants. Chemotherapy and radiation destroy all the old cells at once. With the new strategy, the old cells were slowly replaced by donor cells, and so we never saw any drop in the blood cell counts in these mice. The blood cell counts looked normal the whole way, and in the end, we could see that all the blood cells originated from the new donor cells. After a period of time, the researchers found that they could gradually reduce the JAK inhibitors and, once the donor stem cells totally replaced the original cells, stop the immune suppression altogether. We ve shown that we can use this relatively simple regimen that is minimally toxic to transplant donor stem cells across immunologic barriers in mice,  Persaud said.  We need more research to see if the same strategy will be applicable to humans. We are working to optimize the technique in mice, and then we will likely test it in other animal models of leukemia before we would begin planning a clinical trial to investigate the strategy in patients. Working with Washington University s Office of Technology Management, DiPersio and Persaud have filed a patent application for the combination of antibody-drug conjugates with JAK inhibitors for transplant conditioning.Reference: Persaud SP, Ritchey JK, Kim S, et al.

It also helps ensure successful spawning as one male can mate with several females. This allows fisheries to maximize the size of their harvest without negatively impacting future returns. This management practice is also described in Coast Salish knowledge and, through archaeology, we were able to extend the time depth of this practice by 2,000 years,  says Thomas Royle, a postdoctoral fellow working in the lab.The research team applied the new palaeogenetic methods to archaeological salmon vertebrae to identify the sex of each sample, finding evidence to corroborate Coast Salish traditional knowledge that has been shared for centuries.The Tsleil-Waututh ancestors worked to keep salmon populations plentiful for millennia, passing their knowledge on from one generation to the next.  With current declines and collapses in many commercial fisheries, these traditional Tsleil-Waututh practices can potentially inform current management and conservation.This research collaboration included the Tsleil-Waututh Nation (Michael George, Michelle George), SFU (Thomas C.A. Royle, Hua Zhang, Miguel Alcaide, Ryan Morin, Dongya Yang), University of British Columbia (Jesse Morin, Camilla Speller, Morgan Ritchie), and McMaster University (Aubrey Cannon) as part of a Tsleil-Waututh Nation project to establish the state of pre-contact ecosystems in Burrard Inlet.The leadership of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation was an integral piece of the success of the collaboration and allowed cutting-edge science methods to be used to understand the traditional ecological knowledge of Tsleil-Waututh ancestors.Reference: Morin J, Royle TCA, Zhang H, et al.

A team of researchers led by Hong Chen at Washington University in St. Louis has developed a noninvasive diagnostic method that may one day replace the tissue biopsy with a simple blood test.Chen, associate professor of biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering and of radiation oncology in the School of Medicine; Eric Leuthardt, MD, professor of neurosurgery at Washington University School of Medicine and of biomedical engineering in McKelvey Engineering; and the team tested the method in both small and large animal models and found significantly improved detection and diagnostic sensitivity for brain tumors via a simple blood sample. Results of the study are published online in Theranostics Nov. 10, 2021.The method, known as sonobiopsy, uses focused ultrasound to target tumors deep in the brain. Once located, the researchers inject microbubbles into the blood that travel to the ultrasound-targeted tissue and pulsate, which safely opens the blood-brain barrier. The temporary openings allow biomarkers, such as DNA, RNA and proteins, from the tumor to pass through the blood-brain barrier and release into the blood.Chen, Leuthardt and the team have been working on their focused ultrasound-enabled liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) method for several years, first conducting a feasibility study in mice, followed by a safety evaluation study, and most recently, another study in pigs. While blood-based liquid biopsy has been used in human patients with other cancers for personalized medicine, progress in extending the method to human brain cancer has been limited.In the new research, the team, including Christopher Pacia, first author and a biomedical engineering doctoral student in the Chen Ultrasound lab, found that the sonobiopsy method boosted detection of genes highly expressed in the mouse model of glioblastoma, EGFRvIII. The DNA levels of EGFRvIII circulating in the bloodstream of the group that underwent sonobiopsy was 920 times greater than the group that underwent convention blood-based liquid biopsy. Further, detection of another circulating tumor genetic marker, TERT C228T ctDNA was 10-fold higher after sonobiopsy. In addition, the method improved diagnostic sensitive from 7.14% to 64.71% for EGFRvIII and from 14.29% to 45.83% for TERT C228T. The team found no increase in tissue damage in the tumor region of interest after the sonobiopsy.In the pig model, sonobiopsy boosted detection of EGFRvIII ctDNA by 270-fold and increased levels of TERT ctDNA nine-fold. It improved diagnostic sensitivity from 28.57% to 100% for EGFRvIII and from 42.86% to 71.43% for TERT C228T. No significant tissue damage was found.  Our study showed that sonobiopsy enriched tumor-specific ctDNA in the plasma and improved the detection sensitivity for two glioblastoma phenotypes without posing significant safety risks,  Chen said.  The integration of sonobiopsy with advanced blood analysis assays has the promise to provide minimally invasive, spatiotemporal-controlled, and sensitive diagnosis of brain cancer. This work is a collaborative effort involving members from both engineering and medical schools, including Eric Leuthardt, MD, chief of the Division of Neurotechnology and of the Center for Innovation in Neuroscience and Technology and professor of neurosurgery and of neuroscience at the School of Medicine, as well as of biomedical engineering and of mechanical engineering and of applied science in the McKelvey School of Engineering. Besides neuroimaging and surgically-acquired tissue for pathology and molecular profiling, sonobiopsy has the potential to become the third pillar for brain tumor management by substantially advancing brain cancer diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and recurrence detection,  Leuthardt said.  This enhanced capability could have an important impact throughout the continuum of patient care. Reference: Pacia CP, Yuan J, Yue Y, et al.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/are-scientists-contaminating-their-own-microplastics-experiments-355860,Are Scientists Contaminating Their Own Microplastics Experiments  More than     of microplastics found in samples from oceans and rivers could come from the scientists collecting them  data suggests  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A new paper by Staffordshire University and Rozalia Project, published in Marine Pollution Bulletin, investigates procedural contamination when sampling for microparticles in aquatic environments. The study shows that a significant amount of microplastics and microfibres from scientists  clothing and gear mixes with environmental pollution in the water samples.Claire Gwinnett, Professor in Forensic and Environmental Science at Staffordshire University, explained:  In the field this can occur due to the dynamic nature of the environment such as wind or weather, actions required to obtain samples and the close-proximity necessary for scientists to procure and secure samples whether in a medium-sized vessel, small boat or sampling from shore. In a mobile lab, this often occurs due to using small, multi-use spaces and similar requirements for scientists to be in close proximity to the samples while processing.  Data was collected during an expedition along the Hudson River from Rozalia Project s 60  oceanographic sailing research vessel, American Promise. The team tracked contamination by collecting fibres from every possible source of contamination on the vessel including clothing worn by both the science and boat teams, sail bags and tarps, sail and equipment control lines as well as interior textiles. By doing so, they created a catalogue to which every fibre and fragment found in environmental samples was first compared. If there was a match, that exact source of procedural contamination was noted. If there was not a match, that microparticle was considered pollution. The research found that when robust anti-contamination protocols were not used when taking water samples (using a metal bucket for surface samples and a Niskin bottle for mid-water column samples), 71.4% of the microparticles in the samples were contamination; similarly, when anti-contamination protocols were not used when processing water samples (using a vacuum filtration method), 68.4% of the microparticles in the samples were contamination. Co-lead author Rachael Z. Miller, Founder of Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean, said:  This is a study that was designed to strengthen the scientific process and has revealed the extent to which our clothing sheds, not just in the washing machine or dryer, but as we wear it and conduct ourselves in our everyday lives. It appears that we are all Pigpen, but instead of walking around in a cloud of dirt, we may be emitting clouds of microfibres.  Some take-aways for everyday people from this study are to: take care of the clothes we have   that can be done by adapting laundry routines to reduce fibre-breakage such as washing in cold water and air drying when possible; being mindful of the clothing we choose   more and more information is coming out about how much various types of fabrics shed, and supporting brands and organizations who are aware of and addressing the problem by working to better understand our textiles and who are innovating to make them both more resilient and out of materials that exert less pressure on our natural world, while still maintaining their ability to protect us from the elements.  The study also sets forth methods inspired by forensic science that could make a 37% reduction in the amount of procedural contamination mistakenly added to environmental samples during the collection phase of a study. This reduction can save research teams a significant amount of time by reducing the number of microparticles that must be analysed. Solutions for future studies include outfitting the whole team in the same low-shed, unusually colored garments ideally also with unusual fibre morphology. This would allow for rapid identification as contamination. It is important for the entire boat crew to be included in these quality control considerations since fibres from the captain and first mate were also found in samples during this study. The researchers also describe a workflow using a polarizing light microscope (PLM) that can save research teams both time and money when microparticle, in particular microfibre, identifications must be made. When paired with Easylift  tape, an innovation used for sampling and fixing microparticles after vacuum filtration, this study found that a PLM could produce a high-confidence/correct material identification in 93.3% of the microfibres found in the water samples. PLMs can be obtained for under $4,000 and take a fraction of the time to use compared to the other methods. Professor Gwinnett added:  Thinking like a forensic scientist during sampling for microplastics has its benefits as this study has shown. Forensic scientists are constantly thinking about how they might contaminate samples and how to prevent that. Forensic scientists also acknowledge that it is impossible to have zero contamination and instead focus on creating protocols to minimise and monitor.  By using forensic analysis techniques, which aim to fully profile a particulate, including its morphological, optical and chemical characteristics then these  layers  of information allow much more confident conclusions to be made as to whether it is from the environment or from procedural contamination.

Anavi Serna, a junior, spent the duration of a summer fellowship in the Rice lab of synthetic chemist L szl K rti chasing a sequence that would produce setigerumine I, an alkaloid molecule found in trace amounts in the poppy family Papaveraceae.That natural setigerumine is a molecule the researchers described as  obscure and elusive,  and so hard to isolate it s difficult for labs to study the molecule as a possible precursor for drugs or other products. But it was an apt target for K rti s lab, which develops or simplifies chemical paths for the synthesis of pharmaceutical building blocks used in drug design and manufacture.Ultimately, Serna and her mentor, Rice chemistry lecturer and corresponding author Juha Siitonen, produced the natural product in a three-step, room temperature process that started with oxidizing and rearranging a precursor molecule, noscapine, found in cough syrup.Siitonen, who will become an assistant professor of organic chemistry at Aalto University in his native Finland in January, had been looking at setigerumine I, first isolated in 1993, and several other rare poppy extracts for a while.  Because this molecule is isolated from poppies that also produce morphine, the likelihood that it has desirable biological properties is pretty significant,  Siitonen said.  We ve been facing an opioid crisis for years now, so we clearly need better painkillers that are non-addictive. We don t know if this is the one, because we ve only just made it, but it might prove practical. The team s paper appears in the journal Angewandte Chemie.Serna said her first exposure to synthetic chemistry came in K rti s class, co-taught by Siitonen.  I had a brief introduction to organic chemistry in high school, and I didn t like it,  she said.  It was all memorizing reactions and the products, and I didn t really understand why things were happening. It wasn t until I took this course that it started making more sense. Siitonen quickly saw her potential.  I showed the molecular structure to her and she said,  Oh, that s complicated,  he recalled.  But she wasn t deterred. Juha did what we should always do with talented students: Give them a challenge,  added K rti.  It took her less than half the summer to basically get the key results.  That was followed by verification of the results that involved obtaining the molecule s structure through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Siitonen compared synthetic chemistry to solving a Sudoku puzzle, though with more significant consequences.  We want to understand these chemical puzzles and see how the molecules should be made,  Siitonen said.  And because this molecule exists in nature, that it s a real thing, we know it must be possible to synthesize. After a lot of trial and error, the solution turned out to be relatively simple. Their environmentally friendly process produced 20 milligrams of setigerumine I, enough to serve as a proof-of-concept for the synthesis. We were very happy, because we didn t expect it would form so readily,  Serna said.  It was a really nice surprise. We basically showed that noscapine and setigerumine I are chemically connected,  Siitonen said.  If somebody wants to produce setigerumine I, our process can now be further optimized. He noted the process taught the researchers about how poppies produce setigerumine I.  We also managed to indirectly prove how this thing actually comes about in nature, which has a lot of implications,  he said.  That includes the fact that it might not be the only natural product that belongs to this family. There might be plenty of these types of molecules in nature with the same structural motif that we just haven t stumbled across yet,  he said.Reference: Serna AV, K rti L, Siitonen JH.

The rotation stage that they have developed opens up new possibilities for the retrieval of high-resolution fingerprints from the whole surface area of challenging shapes and materials like metal bullet casings. Retrieval of fingermark evidence from bullet casings is an area of major difficulty for forensic scientists. While both fired and unfired casings can often be found at the scene of violent crimes, retrieving fingermarks and linking the person that loaded the gun to the crime has consistently proven to be difficult because of the physical conditions that are experienced by the bullet casings during firing and techniques that are used to develop and image the fingermarks. When a bullet is fired, the casing experiences high temperatures, pressures and large friction forces inside the barrel of the gun. They can also be coated by the residues of propellant and the powder that are used to generate the reaction that forces the bullet out of the chamber. These combined effects often result in the removal, evaporation or degradation of the more volatile components of fingermark residue (such as water, amino acids and low molecular weight organics such as lipids), as well as potential smudging or obscuring the mark. These factors can make it difficult for conventional methods of fingermark retrieval such as cyanoacrylate (superglue) fuming and fluorescent staining approaches to work. ToF-SIMS is a sensitive surface-analysis technique that provides very detailed information about the locations of different chemical species on a surface. The technique uses high-energy (typically up to 30 keV) beams of positive ions directed at the sample s surface to free secondary ions from any material that they collide with. These ions are then accelerated into a time-of-flight analyser and separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, producing a spectrum that is indicative of the sample s chemical composition. Images generated using ToF-SIMS were shown to display evidence of friction ridge and sweat pore level detail on samples where fingermarks were not visible when developed using a conventional technique involving cyanoacrylate and the dye Basic Yellow 40 (BY40). Experiments were performed over a period of seven months to determine how fingermarks deposited on the surface of Webley MkII revolver rounds change over time. The ToF-SIMS technique is also non-destructive and no evidence of image degradation was observed over this period, even when samples were repeatedly exposed to UHV conditions. ""It s really exciting to be taking this research a step further by adding the rotational stage. We already proved in our previous research that ToF-SIMS imaging provides much more accurate and detailed fingerprint images on different types of surface. This new rotational capability allows us to image in even more detail and over whole surface areas of difficult materials and shapes whilst keeping the evidence intact. This could really pave the way for a new reliable way to analyse evidence, identify persons of interest and link them to the ammunition in a firearm"", commented Dr James Sharp, School of Physics and Astronomy.ReferenceLee CJ et al.

However, a basic requirement for this kind of targeted immunotherapy is to identify target molecules that are found exclusively on the tumor cells and are recognized by the immune system.Malignant gliomas are incurable brain tumors that spread in the brain and cannot be completely removed by surgery.  Gliomas are very difficult to treat, and the lack of suitable target structures is a considerable challenge for developing immunotherapies,  explained Lukas Bunse, an immunologist at the DKFZ and a doctor at University Hospital Mannheim (UMM).Using an experimental mouse model, Bunse and his team have now demonstrated for the first time that transgenic T cells targeting tumor neoepitopes can be used to treat gliomas.Tumor neoepitopes arise as a result of genetic mutations in cancer cells that lead to structural changes in the proteins produced. They therefore occur exclusively in the cancer cells. Using a prediction model, Bunse and his team identified a segment of the CIC protein (capicua transcriptional repressor) as a promising target structure for T cell attacks; around two percent of all gliomas show a recurrent mutation in this protein.Mice vaccinated with the CIC neoepitope developed a population of T helper cells that showed a high level of activation in response to the vaccine peptide. The researchers used particularly active T cells to isolate the gene for the T cell receptor (TCR) responsible for epitope recognition.They subsequently transferred the isolated TCR gene to cells and were thus able to grow large amounts of  transgenic  T cells in a petri dish that all had an identical, highly active TCR targeting the CIC neoepitope.In order to study their efficacy, the researchers injected the transgenic cells directly into the brain ventricles of glioma-bearing mice. In combination with radiotherapy, the T cell therapy led to glioma rejection in some of the animals. Here we have shown for the first time in an experimental model that a neoantigen-specific TCR-transgenic cell therapy can be effective against gliomas,  explained Michael Kilian, first author of the study.  These kinds of neoepitope-specific TCR-transgenic T cells could be used in future in cancer patients who cannot be treated using CAR T cells,  he added.Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which have already been approved for treating patients with B cell leukemia, can only attack tumor antigens present on the surface of the cancer cells. However, these proteins are not usually found exclusively on tumor cells, so CAR T cells could damage healthy tissue too.In contrast, the TCR-transgenic T cells can also attack mutated proteins from the cell interior, which must be exposed on the cell surface by special presentation molecules known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Most T cells respond solely to antigens presented by MHC molecules. To achieve results that can be transferred to humans, Lukas Bunse and his team therefore needed to work with mice transgenic for human MHC molecules. Our work suggests that TCR-transgenic T cells can also be used to treat patients with brain tumors,  remarked Michael Platten, head of the Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumor Immunology at the DKFZ and Medical Director of Mannheim University Hospital s Department of Neurology. In collaboration with Wolfgang Wick, Medical Director of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg s Department of Neurology, Platten and the team of neurooncologists hope to use comparable approaches to refine the TCR-transgenic T cell therapy and to study it in early clinical trials.Reference: Kilian M, Friedrich M, Sanghvi K, et al.

The new experiments distinguish the role of the protein, called lamin C, revealing its usefulness in diagnostics and treatments for a variety of genetic disorders linked to DNA disorganization, such as the rapid aging disease known as progeria, muscular dystrophy and heart disorders related to mutations in these and related proteins. The impact of these findings could extend beyond the known laminopathic diseases, since it appears that lamin C is important for genome organization generally. We just don t know at this point how lamin C is behaving in other diseases with dysregulation of the genome,  says Karen Reddy, Ph.D., assistant professor of biological chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.She continues,  many people are familiar with the idea that gene mutations   or errors in the genetic code  cause inherited diseases. However, genes that are highly disorganized could be as impactful as mutations in causing disease. Reddy notes that genetic tests generally do not consider the mechanics of how DNA is organized, which may be an important foundation to understanding genetic diseases.Reddy and her research team published results of their study published Nov. 14 in Genome Biology.Each human cell s nucleus packs about 6 feet of tightly coiled DNA that holds the genetic instructions for every structure and function in the body. To keep the cell working, these threads of DNA must be organized into useable parts. The lamin proteins, which attach to the surface of the nucleus, do that by grabbing onto segments of the DNA, keeping them separate and tidy. Each compartment created by a lamin acts like a kitchen utensil drawer, keeping knives, forks and spoons easy to access, and more rarely used items like serving pieces out of the way until needed,  Reddy says.In a bid to better understand how lamins influence how the cell uses and organizes its DNA, Reddy and her team used fluorescent dyes to follow three types of lamin proteins   A, B and C   through cell division, when DNA from one cell is duplicated then split between two offspring cells.While lamin B has been easy to distinguish in previous studies, lamin A and lamin C have historically been treated as duplicate proteins because they are created from the same gene, says Reddy. However, there was growing evidence that A and C type lamins had distinct roles.To sort them out, Reddy s research team genetically engineered mouse embryonic cells to remove either the gene that creates lamin B or the gene that contains both lamins A and C. Then the researchers used microscopes to watch the lamins  behaviors and whether the cells  nuclear DNA remained organized as it divided.The research team found that nuclear DNA in cells lacking lamin B looked nearly the same as normal cells dividing, implying that lamin B may not be essential to reorganizing DNA after cell division. However, nuclear DNA in cells lacking lamins A and C did not reorganize neatly, becoming tangled and unsorted from its normal compartments within the nucleus.""It looked like there was a rowdy party in the normally well-organized kitchen,"" says Reddy, of the cells lacking lamins A and C.  Things were not in their places and the strands of active and inactive DNA were intermingled and separated from the lamins at the edge of the nucleus. Next, the researchers used a series of specialized chemical reagents to disable either lamin A or lamin C in the mouse cells, enabling them to test each protein independently.Cells without lamin A seemed able to reorganize after cell division as efficiently as normal cells. However, the nuclear DNA organization again fell into disarray in cells without lamin C.Reddy says a reason for this distinction was revealed in the behavior of lamin C in dividing cells. Her team found that while lamins A and B quickly bind to the surface of a newly forming nucleus and begin grabbing sections of DNA, lamin C remains dispersed throughout the nucleus and retains a special molecular tag called phosphorylation. The researchers believe this suggests that this modified lamin C helps guide DNA into place during reorganization. Once the DNA is organized, lamin C loses its molecular tag and becomes associated with the rest of the lamins at the edge of the nucleus. There is this exquisite choreography of the different lamin proteins and DNA to get things just as they should be,  says ReddyThe findings suggest that new tests could be developed that distinguish between lamins A and C and should be considered when screening for some genetic diseases that involve lamin proteins or other proteins at the edge of the nucleus.The gene that codes for lamins A and C are associated with inherited diseases that include three forms of muscular dystrophy: familial partial lipodystrophy, a condition that causes abnormal distribution of fatty tissue; progeria; and several heart muscle disorders.The researchers note that these results bring up several new questions, including the role lamins have in organizing and regulating DNA during development. The team hopes to identify how lamin proteins and the genome behave when one specific type of lamin is mutated or disrupted, since there appears to be some cross-talk between the different forms of lamins. They also plan to investigate the cellular pathways that control the lamin proteins, particularly for lamin C, to further distinguish the importance of its role in controlling DNA.Reference: Wong X, Hoskins VE, Melendez-Perez AJ, Harr JC, Gordon M, Reddy KL.

The scientists used machine learning to evaluate 5,600 potential lncRNA biomarkers against nearly 9,500 cancer samples across 30 cancer types.Long non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs, are widely considered to be understudied in cancer research. In these latest findings, the team found that the 166 lncRNAs directly correlated with patient survival and these biomarkers could potentially be used to better forecast patient outcomes. Identifying novel biomarkers of patient survival and genes that regulate the aggressiveness of cancers, is of uttermost importance for our goal of precision oncology,  said Dr. Schramek, whose team led the functional analysis.  A deep understanding of the factors that drive cancer will help to identify new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. Within their catalogue, the researchers zeroed in on one lncRNA, called HOXA10-AS, that their initial machine learning analysis revealed was a strong candidate as a prognostic biomarker to classify patients as having either a low- or high-risk brain cancer.This biomarker was shown to be highly effective in categorizing gliomas, a common type of brain tumour, as low or high-risk. Dr. Reimand said these findings demonstrate the potential of lncRNAs as clinical biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets and break new ground in biomarker and cancer biology research. We are excited by the results of this study which not only yielded new biomarkers and insights into cancer biology, but also provides motivation to continue our exploration of the cancer transcriptome for new discoveries to help patients,  said Dr. Reimand, whose team led the machine learning analysis.  We have only begun to scratch the surface of the role of RNAs in cancer. Encouraged by the machine learning results, the team further validated their findings using cancer cells from patients, xenograft and organoid models. These steps not only confirmed that HOXA10-AS can act as a robust biomarker, but also as a potential therapeutic target since it plays a role in several important biological pathways in brain cancer.This research was partially funded by the OICR and the New Investigator Award of the Terry Fox Research Institute (TFRI).

For years, the mechanics behind this X chromosome inactivation have been murky, but scientists from the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA have now taken a major step forward in understanding the process.Their findings, based on research on mouse stem cells, upend previous assumptions about how X inactivation is initiated in female embryos and could lead to new ways to treat some genetic disorders, as well as a better understanding of how genes on other chromosomes are silenced.   X inactivation is one of the most fundamentally important processes in development, and I think this study is a slam dunk in finally understanding it,  said Kathrin Plath, a professor of biological chemistry and senior author of the paper, published in the journal Cell.Because female cells have two X chromosomes and male cells have only one X and a Y, the inactivation process prevents females from receiving a double dose of X-related proteins. In some female cells, the X inherited from the mother is silenced, while in others, the X from the father is shut off   in a seemingly random fashion.Scientists have known for nearly three decades that an RNA molecule known as Xist is required for X chromosome inactivation early in embryonic development. They ve also known that hundreds of other proteins interact with Xist. But in the absence of clear evidence, most in the field have assumed, mistakenly, that many copies of Xist coat the targeted X chromosome or constantly move around between locations on the X, interacting directly with each of the more than 1,000 genes on the chromosome to induce their silencing.In the new study, Plath and her colleagues tagged individual molecules with fluorescence and used super-resolution microscopy to observe their precise locations on the chromosome. The team was then able to watch the movements of Xist and dozens of interacting proteins as X chromosomes were being inactivated in the embryonic stem cells of female mice. They discovered that pairs of Xist were located at just 50 spots along the chromosome, for a total of 100 molecules of Xist. It was kind of shocking to us that from just 50 sites, Xist manages to silence a thousand genes,  said UCLA associate project scientist Yolanda Markaki, first author of the paper.Instead of interacting directly with every gene on the chromosome, Markaki and Plath showed, these Xist pairs act as hubs, or protein magnets, recruiting thousands of proteins to their spots on the chromosome. Then, specialized proteins pull the chromosome into a tightly condensed shape so that every section is in the vicinity of one of these 50 large clouds of proteins. From there, gene silencing proteins within these complexes bind to each gene, shutting it off. The key insight here is that Xist RNA is not acting directly on the X chromosome but is more of an architectural molecule that sets up proteins to do their job,  Plath said.The team also identified the proteins, called Polycomb group proteins, responsible for twisting the X chromosome into the necessary shape. Without the Polycomb proteins, only those sections of the X chromosome already near one of the 50 Xist sites become inactivated, the researchers found.The findings could help explain how molecules similar to Xist, called long non-coding RNAs, or lncRNAs, interact with genes other than those on the X chromosome. Many lncRNAs are present in only very low numbers in cells, which has made scientists puzzled about their function. Now we know that to silence an entire chromosome, you only need 100 Xist molecules, so it s easy to see how a few molecules are sufficient to set up little compartments of gene regulation,  Plath said.The observations also could point to new ways of treating diseases, she said. For example, the reactivation of the silenced X may serve as a strategy to treat diseases associated with the X chromosome in females, such as Rett syndrome. Understanding how silencing occurs opens the door to understanding how to reverse the process in differentiated cells if needed.Reference: Markaki Y, Chong JG, Wang Y, et al.

A new study shows that people who consumed an anti-inflammatory diet that includes more fruits, vegetables, beans, and tea or coffee, had a lower risk of developing dementia later in life. The research is published in the November 10, 2021, online issue of Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.  There may be some potent nutritional tools in your home to help fight the inflammation that could contribute to brain aging,  said study author Nikolaos Scarmeas, MD, PhD, of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.  Diet is a lifestyle factor you can modify, and it might play a role in combating inflammation, one of the biological pathways contributing to risk for dementia and cognitive impairment later in life.  The study looked at 1,059 people in Greece with an average age of 73 who did not have dementia. Each person answered a food frequency questionnaire that is commonly used to determine the inflammatory potential of a person s diet. The questionnaire sought information on the main food groups consumed during the previous month, including dairy products, cereals, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, legumes, which include beans, lentils and peas, added fats, alcoholic beverages, stimulants and sweets. A possible dietary inflammatory score can range from -8.87 to 7.98, with higher scores indicating a more inflammatory diet, which includes fewer servings of fruits, vegetables, beans and tea or coffee. Scarmeas notes that multiple nutrients in all foods contribute to the inflammatory nature of a person s diet. Researchers divided the participants into three equal groups: those with the lowest dietary inflammatory scores, medium scores and highest scores. Those in the group with the lowest scores of -1.76 and lower, indicating a more anti-inflammatory diet, ate an average per week of 20 servings of fruit, 19 of vegetables, four of beans or other legumes and 11 of coffee or tea per week. Those in the group with the highest scores, 0.21 and above, indicating a more inflammatory diet, ate an average per week of nine servings of fruit, 10 of vegetables, two of legumes and nine of coffee or tea. Researchers followed up with each person for an average of three years. Over the course of the study, 62 people, or 6%, developed dementia. The people who developed dementia had average scores of -0.06, compared to average scores of -0.70 for those who did not develop dementia.After adjusting for age, sex and education, researchers found that each one-point increase in dietary inflammatory score was associated with a 21% increase in dementia risk. Compared to the lowest third of participants who consumed the least inflammatory diet, those in the top third were three times more likely to develop dementia.  Our results are getting us closer to characterizing and measuring the inflammatory potential of people s diets,  Scarmeas said.  That in turn could help inform more tailored and precise dietary recommendations and other strategies to maintain cognitive health.  The study was an observational one, not a clinical trial. It does not prove that eating an anti-inflammatory diet prevents brain aging and dementia, it only shows an association.An additional limitation is the short follow-up time of three years. Longer studies are needed to confirm and replicate these findings.Reference: Charisis S, Ntanasi E, Yannakoulia M, et al. Diet inflammatory index and dementia incidence: A population-based study.

In a surprising new finding, MIT neuroscientists have shown that human neurons have a much smaller number of these channels than expected, compared to the neurons of other mammals.The researchers hypothesize that this reduction in channel density may have helped the human brain evolve to operate more efficiently, allowing it to divert resources to other energy-intensive processes that are required to perform complex cognitive tasks. If the brain can save energy by reducing the density of ion channels, it can spend that energy on other neuronal or circuit processes,  says Mark Harnett, an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences, a member of MIT s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the study.Harnett and his colleagues analyzed neurons from 10 different mammals, the most extensive electrophysiological study of its kind, and identified a  building plan  that holds true for every species they looked at   except for humans. They found that as the size of neurons increases, the density of channels found in the neurons also increases.However, human neurons proved to be a striking exception to this rule. Previous comparative studies established that the human brain is built like other mammalian brains, so we were surprised to find strong evidence that human neurons are special,  says former MIT graduate student Lou Beaulieu-Laroche.Beaulieu-Laroche is the lead author of the study, which appears today in Nature.","Published: November 15, 2021"

The finding could help explain an earlier outcome of the same study, in which the drug nilotinib was able to halt motor and nonmotor (cognition and quality of life) decline in the long term.The researchers say their finding, detailed in a study published November 12, 2021, in Neurology Genetics, suggests that blood vessel walls called the blood-brain barrier, which normally act as a crucial filter to protect the brain against toxins as well as allow passage of nutrients to nourish it, doesn t work correctly in some Parkinson s patients: It prohibits toxins from leaving the brain and inhibits nutrients such as glucose from entering. Perhaps even more damaging, the dysfunctional barrier allows inflammatory cells and molecules from the body to enter and damage the brain.The research, the first longitudinal study to use such advanced genomics, now provides investigators with a new target for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson s disease, says the study s senior author, Charbel Moussa, MBBS, PhD, director of the Medical Center s Translational Neurotherapeutics Program.The new discovery comes from the second part of a Phase II clinical trial that featured next-generation whole genome sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid of 75 Parkinson s patients, before and after treatment with a repurposed leukemia drug, nilotinib, or placebo.This study lasted 27 months; the initial trial was double-blinded and patients were randomized to either placebo, or 150 milligrams or 300 milligrams nilotinib for 12 months. The patients had severe Parkinson s disease; all were treated with optimal standard of care and many (30%) had also used the most sophisticated treatments possible, such as deep brain stimulation. The second part of the study employed an adaptive design, and all participants had a three-month drug washout period before re-randomization to either 150 milligrams or 300 milligrams for an additional 12 months. After 27 months, nilotinib was found to be safe, and patients who received nilotinib showed a dose-dependent increase of dopamine, the chemical lost as a result of neuronal destruction.   It appeared nilotinib halted motor and nonmotor decline in the patients taking the 300 milligrams higher dose,  says Moussa. The clinical outcomes of this study were published in Movement Disorders in March 2021. The current part of the study just published examined the cerebrospinal fluid of patients via epigenomics, which is a systematic analysis of the global state of gene expression, in correlation with continuing clinical outcomes. The new analysis helps explain the clinical findings.Nilotinib inactivated a protein (DDR1) that was destroying the ability of the blood brain barrier to function properly. When DDR1 was inhibited, normal transport of molecules in and out of the brain filter resumed, and inflammation declined to the point that dopamine, the neurotransmitter depleted by the disease process, was being produced again.Moussa and his team have long been working on the effects that nilotinib (Tasigna) may have on neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases. The drug was approved in 2007 for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but Moussa reasoned that its mechanism of action may help the brain destroy toxins that develop in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Not only does nilotinib flip on the brain s garbage disposal system to eliminate bad toxic proteins, but it appears to also repair the blood brain barrier to allow this toxic waste to leave the brain and to allow nutrients in,  Moussa explains.  Parkinson s disease is generally believed to involve mitochondrial or energy deficits that can be caused by environmental toxins or by toxic protein accumulation; it has never been identified as a vascular disease.   To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the body s blood brain barrier potentially offers a target for the treatment for Parkinson s disease,  Moussa says.  Much work remains to be done, but just knowing that a patient s brain vascular system is playing a significant role in the progression of the disease is a very promising discovery.

With air pollution being one of the top five risk factors for disease and premature death in Egypt and the cause of an estimated 10 per cent of premature deaths, the findings could save many lives.Greater Cairo is the sixth largest city in the world, according to the UN, with a population of over 20 million. Its roads are used by 4 million vehicles, 60 per cent of which are more than ten years old. The study uses local data and international case studies to predict the impact of various transport emission control measures, with the aim of proposing ways to protect the health of the local population, improve air quality and cut carbon emissions.The team benchmarked levels of toxin, pollutant and global warming emissions and looked at congestion levels in order to project emission levels in 2030 if no mitigating actions were adopted to tackle the transport pollution problem. They compared the results with five other scenarios, chosen based on local agendas and international best practice, including fuel subsidy removal, road expansions, public transport improvements, vehicle inspection and maintenance programmes, and fuel enhancements.They found that, in reference to the specific conditions of Greater Cairo, better inspection and maintenance of vehicles would be most effective at reducing health-damaging pollutants, with a predicted reduction of at least 35 per cent and possibly up to 55 per cent compared with doing nothing. Similarly, fuel enhancements would cut some health-damaging pollutants, with the potential of reducing sulphur oxide emissions by as much as 91 per cent. Improving the public transport infrastructure would reduce all types of emissions by nearly a third, but building more roads would most likely lead to a 37 per cent increase in emissions on the long run compared with doing nothing as it would induce more traffic.Currently, Egypt is rightly implementing a fuel subsidy removal plan that aims to reduce congestion and in turn traffic emissions. This study has shown that fuel subsidy removal greatly reduces global warming emission (especially CO2) by an average of 12.4 per cent compared to not implementing such plans. Also, public transport improvements are underway with the aim of reducing car reliance by offering reliable mass transport options. The study found that public transport improvements would reduce global warming emissions produced by cars by around 34 per cent in 2030 compared to doing nothing.This research, led by Surrey s Global Centre for Clean Air Research (GCARE), builds on previous studies which showed the high levels of pollution to which Cairo drivers are exposed.Professor Prashant Kumar, senior author of the article, Associate Dean (International) for the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of Surrey, and the Founding Director of the GCARE, said: The input data for emission modelling for cities such as Cairo are not abundantly available and many challenges need overcoming. Our emission modelling approach, using the International Vehicle Emissions modelling tool, shows how best to protect the people of Cairo. And how not to. A road expansion plan would encourage vehicle ownership and thus induce traffic, exposing more people to the risks of premature death caused by high pollution levels. In contrast, improvements to public transport would not only offer health and environmental benefits, but also potential quality-of-life benefits by cutting congestion and improving commuters  lifestyles. Rana Alaa Abbass, PhD student at the GCARE, said: Egypt has introduced many measures to tackle pollution and emissions with some excellent plans under implementation. Greater Cairo desperately needs such measures. A large-scale, centralised inspection and maintenance programme, properly organised and enforced, would make a real difference to people s health. This study also identifies effective ways to help the city cut its carbon emissions. Reference: Alaa Abbass R, Kumar P, El-Gendy A. Emissions control scenarios for transport in Greater Cairo.

But if you do set a deadline, make it short.Professor Stephen Knowles, from the Otago Business School, Department of Economics, and his co-authors tested the effect of deadline length on task completion for their research published in Economic Inquiry.Participants were invited to complete an online survey in which a donation goes to charity. They were given either one week, one month, or no deadline to respond.Professor Knowles says the research began because he and his team   Dr Murat Gen , from Otago s Department of Economics, Dr Trudy Sullivan, from Otago s Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, and Professor Maro  Serv tka, from the Macquarie Graduate School of Management   were interested in helping charities raise more money.However, the results are applicable to any situation where someone asks another person for help. This could be asking a colleague for help at work or asking your partner to do something for you, Professor Knowles says.The study found responses to the survey were lowest for the one-month deadline, and highest when no deadline was specified.No deadline and the one-week deadline led to many early responses, while a long deadline appeared to give people permission to procrastinate, and then forget.Professor Knowles wasn t surprised to find that specifying a shorter deadline increased the chances of receiving a response compared to a longer deadline. However, he did find it interesting that they received the most responses when no deadline was specified. We interpret this as evidence that specifying a longer deadline, as opposed to a short deadline or no deadline at all, removes the urgency to act, which is often perceived by people when asked to help,  he says. People therefore put off undertaking the task, and since they are inattentive or forget, postponing it results in lower response rates. He says it is possible that not specifying a deadline might still have led participants to assume that there is an implicit deadline.Professor Knowles hopes his research can help reduce the amount of procrastinating people do. Many people procrastinate. They have the best intentions of helping someone out, but just do not get around to doing it.

The study, published in Nature Communications, demonstrates a 3D-printed sand bridge that at 6.5 centimeters can hold 300 times its own weight, a feat analogous to 12 Empire State Buildings sitting on the Brooklyn Bridge. The binder jet printing process is cheaper and faster than other 3D-printing methods used by industry and makes it possible to create 3D structures from a variety of powdered materials, offering advantages in cost and scalability. The concept stems from inkjet printing, but instead of using ink, the printer head jets out a liquid polymer to bind a powdered material, such as sand, building up a 3D design layer by layer. The binding polymer is what gives the printed sand its strength. The team used polymer expertise to tailor a polyethyleneimine, or PEI, binder that doubled the strength of sand parts compared with conventional binders. Parts printed via binder jetting are initially porous when removed from the print bed. They can be strengthened by infiltrating the design with an additional super-glue material called cyanoacrylate that fills in the gaps. This second step provided an eight-fold strength increase on top of the first step, making a polymer sand composite stronger than any other and any known building materials, including masonry.  Few polymers are suited to serve as a binder for this application. We were looking for specific properties, such as solubility, that would give us the best result. Our key finding was in the unique molecular structure of our PEI binder that makes it reactive with cyanoacrylate to achieve exceptional strength,  said ORNL s Tomonori Saito, a lead researcher on the project. Parts formed with conventional binders are made denser with infiltrate materials, such as super glue, but none have reached close to the performance of the PEI binder. The PEI binder s impressive strength stems from the way the polymer reacts to bond with cyanoacrylate during curing. One potential application for the super-strength sand is to advance tooling for composites manufacturing. Silica sand is a cheap, readily available material that has been gaining interest in automotive and aerospace sectors for creating composite parts. Lightweight materials, such as carbon fiber or fiberglass, are wrapped around 3D-printed sand cores, or  tools,  and cured with heat. Silica sand is attractive for tooling because it does not change dimensions when heated and because it offers a unique advantage in washable tooling. In composite applications, using a water-soluble binder to form sand tools is significant because it enables a simple washout step with tap water to remove the sand, leaving a hollow composite form.  To ensure accuracy in tooling parts, you need a material that does not change shape during the process, which is why silica sand has been promising. The challenge has been to overcome structural weakness in sand parts,  said Dustin Gilmer, a University of Tennessee Bredesen Center student and the study s lead author. Current sand casting molds and cores have limited industrial use because commercial methods, such as washout tooling, apply heat and pressure that can cause sand parts to break or fail on the first try. Stronger sand parts are needed to support manufacturing at a large scale and enable rapid part production.  Our high-strength polymer sand composite elevates the complexity of parts that can be made with binder jetting methods, enabling more intricate geometries, and widens applications for manufacturing, tooling, and construction,  said Gilmer.

The research is published today in Molecular Psychiatry.Targeting soluble proteinAlzheimer s disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting more than half a million people in the UK. It is a brain disorder that slowly worsens   destroying memory, thinking and language skills. Sadly, there are currently no effective treatments to prevent, slow down or reverse the disease.One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer s disease is the build-up of abnormal structures called  amyloid plaques  in the brain. The amyloid beta protein exists naturally in several different forms in the Alzheimer s brain. One form can join together, eventually forming plaques that collect between nerve cells. But the same protein also comes in shorter or  truncated  soluble forms, which some scientists now believe are key to the development and progression of the disease.But the new antibody and vaccine developed in this study instead both target a different, soluble form of the amyloid beta protein, which may be more harmful to brain cells. Professor Thomas Bayer, from the University Medical Center G ttingen, said:  In clinical trials, none of the potential treatments which dissolve amyloid plaques in the brain have shown much success in terms of reducing Alzheimer s symptoms. Some have even shown negative side effects.   So, we decided on a different approach,  he explains  We identified an antibody in mice that would neutralise the truncated forms of soluble amyloid beta but would not bind either to normal forms of the protein or to the plaques. A novel hairpin-shaped structureDr Preeti Bakrania and colleagues at LifeArc generated a  humanised  version of the antibody, called TAP01_04, which was less likely to trigger an immune response in people. When the Leicester research group looked at how and where this antibody was binding to the truncated form of amyloid beta, they had a surprise. The team saw the amyloid beta protein was folded back on itself, in a distinctive hairpin-shaped structure   a structure which had never been seen before.The discovery of this unique structure enabled the team to engineer a stable fragment of this region of the protein, which they showed formed a similar hairpin-shaped structure. This engineered piece of amyloid beta could potentially be used as a vaccine to trigger a person s immune system to make TAP01_04 type antibodies   which could provide them with protection against the development of Alzheimer s disease.And when the team tested the engineered amyloid beta protein in mice, they found mice that received this  vaccine  did produce the required type of antibodies.The potential to transform livesThe G ttingen group then tested both the  humanised  antibody and the engineered amyloid beta vaccine, called TAPAS, in two different mouse models of Alzheimer s disease. Based on similar imaging techniques to those used to diagnose Alzheimer s in humans, they found that both the antibody and the vaccine helped to restore nerve cell function, increase glucose metabolism in the brain, restore memory loss and   even though they weren t directly targeted   reduce amyloid beta plaque formation. The TAP01_04 humanised antibody and the TAPAS vaccine are very different to previous antibodies or vaccines for Alzheimer s disease that have been tested in clinical trials, because they target a different form of the amyloid beta protein,  explains Preeti.  The results so far are very exciting and testament to the scientific expertise of the team. If this new approach proves successful, it could transform the lives of many patients. Professor Mark Carr, from the Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology at the University of Leicester added:  While the science is currently still at an early stage, if these results were to be replicated in human clinical trials, then it could be transformative. It opens up the possibility to not only treat Alzheimer s once symptoms are detected, but also to potentially vaccinate against the disease before symptoms appear. The researchers are now looking to find a commercial partner to take the therapeutic antibody and the vaccine through clinical trials.Reference: Bakrania P, Hall G, Bouter Y, et al.

Perhaps chief among these strategies is a sticky, armor-like goo, called the biofilm matrix, that encases clusters of disease-causing organisms.This defense works, sometimes in tragic ways. For example, biofilms form readily and invisibly on medical devices like catheters and implants and are highly resistant to drugs that might otherwise treat them. The infections they cause cost tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars a year in the U.S. There are no approved antimicrobials to treat biofilms. The only way to treat a biofilm is to physically remove it from the body,  says David Andes, a professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.In a new study designed to better understand and combat these structures, Andes and his collaborators identified some of the key proteins in biofilms of the fungus Candida albicans that control both how they resist antifungal drugs and how they become dispersed throughout the body.While more work is necessary, the newly identified proteins provide potential drug targets to impair a pathogen s antimicrobial defenses. In fact, the study found that Candida that could not make some of these proteins were much more sensitive to the existing antifungal fluconazole.However, interfering with some of these same proteins made the biofilms more likely to spread to the kidney in a rat model of infection. This is a shortcoming that further research will need to address.Andes and his team, which included University of Georgia professor of biology Aaron Mitchell, published their findings Oct. 29 in the journal Nature Communications.Candida is an enigmatic organism. The fungus often makes its home in and on healthy people, to no ill effect. But it can readily infect immunocompromised individuals, even those who are otherwise well.Biofilms are made up of a complex soup of materials secreted by individual cells within them, including proteins. The researchers used a machine-learning algorithm to screen through hundreds of these proteins to identify likely candidates involved in biofilm production and function. They identified 63 proteins to investigate further.When the researchers created Candida mutants unable to make these proteins, 13 of them became more susceptible to the antifungal fluconazole in lab tests.The Andes lab, which specializes in developing animal models to test drug resistance, also investigated the proteins in a rat model involving venous catheters. These catheters, inserted into large veins, are often left in place for months to help deliver drugs, such as during chemotherapy treatment. Because they spend a long time in the body, catheters are prone to becoming sources of infection.When the researchers tested four of the 13 drug-sensitive fungal mutants in the rat model, all four remained susceptible to fluconazole like earlier lab tests had demonstrated. While the antifungal barely affects normal Candida biofilms, it cut mutant fungal populations down by 30-fold or more.Biofilms don t just drive drug resistance. They affect the entire lifecycle of a pathogen.  The last step in the lifecycle of a biofilm is dispersion. Cells leave the biofilm and spread to other parts of the body,  says Andes. This body-wide dispersal greatly increases the risk from infections.The researchers found 17 mutants that affected this dispersion process; most of them dispersed more readily. Tested in rats, three of these high-dispersal mutants led to a more than 10-fold increase in the spread of Candida to the kidneys.Intriguingly, two of the mutants were both more susceptible to antifungals and more likely to disperse to the kidney, a mix of positive and negative clinical outcomes. Andes says this overlap of function   partly antimicrobial, partly controlling dispersal   suggests the proteins play complex roles in biofilms.The Andes lab has already identified a drug that can interfere with the fungus s defense. They recently found that the antifungal turbinmicin  which Andes and his collaborators discovered in 2020  can block Candida s ability to secrete these proteins and other components of biofilms, making the pathogen more susceptible to drugs.Reference: Zarnowski R, Noll A, Chevrette MG, et al.

One strategy involves injecting immune-stimulating molecules directly into the tumor, but this method can be challenging for cancers that are not easily accessible. Now, Stanford researchers have developed a new synthetic molecule that combines a tumor-targeting agent with another molecule that triggers immune activation. This tumor-targeted immunotherapy can be administered intravenously and makes its way to one or multiple tumor sites in the body, where it recruits immune cells to fight the cancer. Three doses of this new immunotherapy prolonged the survival of six of nine laboratory mice with an aggressive triple negative breast cancer. Of the six, three appeared cured of their cancer over the duration of the monthslong study. A single dose of this molecule induced complete tumor regression in five of 10 mice. The synthetic molecule showed similar results in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer.  We essentially cured some animals with just a few injections,  said Jennifer Cochran, PhD, the Shriram Chair of the Department of Bioengineering.  It was pretty astonishing. When we looked within the tumors, we saw they went from a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment to one full of activated B and T cells   similar to what happens when the immune-stimulating molecule is injected directly into the tumor. So, we re achieving intra-tumoral injection results but with an IV delivery.  A paper describing the study will be published online Nov. 12 in Cell Chemical Biology.

The technique uses light and nanoparticles to pry open temporarily these barriers   called tight junctions   to allow medication to reach its target.Qin and his colleagues in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and at other institutions demonstrated the approach in mice in a study published online Sept. 13 in the journal Nano Letters.Researchers synthesized gold nanoparticles to target the tight junction specifically and demonstrated that transcranial picosecond laser stimulation of the nanoparticles post-intravenous injection increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. (Illustration credit: Nano Letters)The findings are the result of five years of research funded in part by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). Qin said the approach could lead to treatments for brain tumors and Lou Gehrig s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; aid in stroke recovery; and deliver gene therapy. Qin said further development and testing is needed before it could be used in humans. Approaches to increase blood-brain barrier [BBB] permeability are essential to advance therapeutics for central nervous system diseases,  said Xiaoqing Li, the paper s co-lead author and a biomedical engineering doctoral student at UT Dallas.The technique involves injecting gold nanoparticles, which absorb light, into the bloodstream to target the blood-brain barrier. Researchers apply picosecond (one-trillionth of a second) laser pulses externally to activate the gold nanoparticles. The action produces a tiny mechanical force that temporarily breaks the barrier open so a drug can enter the blood flow into the brain,  Li said.The study demonstrated that the technique did not damage the blood-brain barrier or the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, called vasomotion. We demonstrated that the BBB permeability can be modulated without significant disruption to the spontaneous vasomotion or the structure of the neurovascular unit,  said Dr. Qi Cai, mechanical engineering research associate and co-lead author of the paper.In their experiments, the researchers tested the method with cargos of antibodies, liposomes and adeno-associated viral vectors, which can be used to carry gene-editing components.In August, Qin received a fourth CPRIT grant to study whether the method can be used to treat glioblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. He and his team aim to design and produce magnetic nanoparticles that can be stimulated to disrupt the blood-brain barrier using magnetic fields. Support from CPRIT has been instrumental in our work,  said Qin, who received grants from the state agency   the second-largest cancer research and prevention program in the world   in 2016, 2018 and 2019.  When we started, we had an idea, basically to use nanoparticles to target specific components of the blood-brain barrier with minimal injury. Reference: Li X, Vemireddy V, Cai Q, et al.

An article on the study s findings was published in Nature on Nov. 10.  Dr. Bunyamin Tar an (PhD) and Dr. Amit Deokar (PhD) of the USask College of Agriculture and Bioresources were involved in the overall research, sequencing the genetics of 200 Canadian chickpea plants, as well as performing associated data analyses.   Chickpeas are one of the main protein sources for hundreds of millions of people  especially in South Asia, Africa and other parts of the world,  said Tar an.  The research provides an avenue to support global efforts to develop chickpeas with even better nutritional value as well as more climate-resilient varieties.  Funding for the USask research involved in the study was provided by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture and the Saskatchewan Pulse Growers.  By employing whole genome sequencing, we have been able to affirm the history of chickpea s origin in the Fertile Crescent (a crescent-shaped region in the Middle East, known to be home to some of the earth s earliest civilizations) and identify two paths of diffusion or migration of chickpea to the rest of the world. One path indicates diffusion to South Asia and East Africa, and the other suggests diffusion to the Mediterranean region (probably through Turkey) as well as to the Black Sea and Central Asia (up to Afghanistan),  said Prof. Rajeev Varshney, a research program director at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics and leader of the study.

Therefore, rapid screening for COVID-19 is becoming increasingly crucial. However, existing nucleic acid tests are not time-efficient enough and carry the risk of giving false results, leading to further spreading of the virus. Therefore, relying solely on nucleic acid testing poses public health and safety risks, and new detection methods are urgently needed.Recently, Professor Maosheng Yao from College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University integrated breath sampling, Ion mobility spectrometry detection for gas chromatography, and machine learning models to develop a non-invasive exhaled breath screening system for COVID-19 (TestBreathNow-TBN) in collaboration with Chaoyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other research partners. The team used the system to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 patients, non-COVID patients with respiratory diseases, and medical staff and identified 12 key breath-borne VOC biomarkers. The sampling process is completely non-invasive, with subjects using a disposable breathing bag and exhaling for only 30 seconds to complete the sampling process. The system is easy to operate, does not require any testing reagents, and can be used with machine learning models to achieve rapid screening of COVID-19 patients in 5-10 minutes, with significantly lower costs for a single test.The system is expected to play a major role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission by providing rapid screening for COVID-19 in situations such as testing for false-negative results, granting permissions to custom entry, and deciding whether to discharge COVID-19 patients from hospitals. This technology will contribute to China s prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.Reference: Chen H, Qi X, Zhang L, et al. COVID-19 screening using breath-borne volatile organic compounds.

A new study led by University of Minnesota Medical School researcher Xavier Revelo, PhD, an assistant professor of integrative biology and physiology, in collaboration with Jop van Berlo, MD, PhD, an associate professor of medicine, was recently published in Circulation Research. They suggest that a type of white blood cells known as macrophages play a role in protecting the heart after injury. Their findings could lead to targeted therapies for heart failure.  The heart contains various types of immune cells that we studied simultaneously using advanced research techniques,  Revelo said.  We discovered a large increase in the number of macrophages early in the response to a cardiac injury similar to high blood pressure.  The research team s primary findings were: - A cardiac injury similar to high blood pressure leads to a quick increase in the number of cardiac macrophages. - These cardiac macrophages are important to stimulate new blood vessel formation in the heart. - Macrophages that reside in the heart are important to prevent scarring or fibrosis of the heart, a process where excessive proteins are deposited around cardiac muscle cells which leads to stiffening of the heart. - The early increase in macrophages was important to prevent the development of heart failure. Immune cells in the heart are important players in the progression of heart failure and scarring of the heart. While there is currently no cure for heart failure, immune cell targeted therapies hold promise for new treatment avenues for cardiac disease. The results of this study point to a critical role for macrophages in the heart s healing process.  Immune cells such as macrophages are integral components of the heart where they exert profound effects in healthy and diseased conditions,  van Berlo said.  Our new study shows that macrophages that reside in the cardiac tissue, but not those from blood origins, protect the failing heart.  Further research is required to identify the specific means by which the macrophages protect the heart and to determine if immunomodulatory therapies are a viable therapeutic option in treating heart failure. Revelo says their team has already begun working on those questions.ReferenceRevelo X et al. Cardiac Resident Macrophages Prevent Fibrosis and Stimulate Angiogenesis.

MACH-19 (Mushrooms and Chinese Herbs for COVID-19)   a multi-center study led by University of California San Diego School of Medicine and UCLA, in collaboration with the La Jolla Institute for Immunology   is among the first to evaluate these specific integrative medicine approaches using the gold standard of Western medicine: the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Three trials are currently recruiting for between 66 and 80 patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and who are quarantined at home with mild to moderate symptoms. Two are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Phase 1 clinical safety trials for investigational compounds to treat acute COVID-19.  Mushroom-Based Product for COVID-19,  which started December 2020 and is slated to run until December 2022, tests the safety and feasibility of a 50/50 blend of the mushrooms agarikon (Fomitopsis officinalis) and turkey tail (Trametes versicolor) in capsule form.  Chinese Herbal Formula for COVID-19,  which began in July 2021 and is projected to conclude in December 2022, tests the safety and feasibility of a formulation of 21 Chinese herbs from Taiwan called Qing Fei Pai Du Tang that is widely used as a COVID-19 remedy in China. We hope these treatments will reduce the need for hospitalization,  said MACH-19 principal investigator Gordon Saxe, MD, PhD, director of research at the Centers for Integrative Health at UC San Diego School of Medicine.According to Saxe, the mushrooms were chosen because of their long history of use and recent evidence of immune-enhancing and anti-viral effects. In a preclinical study published in the March 2019 issue of Mycology, agarikon was found to inhibit viruses including influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H5N1) and herpes. Saxe said he believes medicinal mushrooms inhibit the viruses  replication, a theory he plans to test against SARS-CoV-2 in a Phase II trial. Mushrooms have the advantage that they co-evolved with us,  Saxe said.  So bacteria, viruses and other fungi prey on mushrooms just like they prey on humans. And mushrooms have developed exquisite defenses against those pests, and we believe they can confer those to us when we eat them. MACH-19 s third ongoing trial,  RCT of Mushroom Based Natural Product to Enhance Immune Response to COVID-19 Vaccination,  measures whether the same medicinal mushrooms, given in capsules at the time of initial COVID-19 vaccination, can increase antibodies and other measures of immune response. It began in June 2021 and is scheduled for completion in June 2022.Saxe said his team is nearing launch of a fourth trial, which will look at whether medicinal mushrooms could provide a similar lift to COVID-19 booster shots as an adjuvant, a substance which enhances immune response. Vaccines lead to the production of antibodies that can destroy the virus in the blood,  Saxe said.  Mushrooms may not only increase the number of these antibodies, but also enhance T-cell immunity against virally infected cells. Further, because mushrooms bind to receptors on human immune cells, they can modulate our immunity   boosting it in some ways and calming it down in others. And this property of mushrooms may also reduce vaccine-related side effects. Other investigators in the study include Andrew Shubov, MD, director of inpatient integrative medicine at UCLA Center for East-West Medicine, and Lan Kao, a clinical Chinese medicine specialist at UCLA. Initial funding for MACH-19 was provided by the Krupp Endowed Fund at UC San Diego.Natural therapeutics have been used for centuries to treat infectious diseases, according to Saxe, who noted that herbs helped Chinese doctors manage 300 recorded epidemics, while the Greek pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides prescribed agarikon to treat pulmonary infections 2,300 years ago.Though Western medicine still regards much of integrative medicine as lacking empirical, evidence-based proof, some of its ideas are gaining wider acceptance, such as acupuncture to treat pain and the herbal extract artemisinin to treat malaria. MACH-19, which emerged as an idea by Saxe during a research conference at the beginning of the pandemic, presents the opportunity to provide more evidence.  If we can demonstrate success, it may open up interest in looking at other botanical formulas and approaches,  Saxe said.Initial safety data from the trials are expected by the end of this year, with efficacy data ready within a year. Whatever is found, Saxe said that he was happy just getting the FDA s approval, which he called a sign that Western scientific minds are broadening. Like the population as a whole, the FDA has, in recent years, become more aware of integrative, complementary medicine and has shown more of a willingness to find ways to study these approaches,  he said.  But they re still as rigorous as they are for pharmaceuticals.  To learn more or enroll in the MACH-19 trials, visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ and search for  MACH-19.

This raises the question of whether cell size is important for cellular physiology.The new study suggests that cellular enlargement drives a decline in function of stem cells. The researchers found that blood stem cells, which are among the smallest cells in the body, lose their ability to perform their normal function   replenishing the body s blood cells   as they grow larger. However, when the cells were restored to their usual size, they behaved normally again.The researchers also found that blood stem cells tend to enlarge as they age. Their study shows that this enlargement contributes to stem cell decline during aging.

They also recreate the bone marrow niche using our 3D culture system and use immunocompromised mice to enable use of human AML and T cells with nanoTCEs. It is shown that CD33 is ubiquitously present on AML cells. The CD33 nanoTCEs bind preferentially to AML cells compared to Isotype. It's also shown that nanoTCEs effectively activate T cells and induce AML killing in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that our nanoTCE technology is a novel and promising immuno-therapy for the treatment of AML and provides a basis for supplemental investigations for the validation of using nanoTCEs in larger animals and patients.Dr. Abdel Kareem Azab from The Washington University School of Medicine as well as The Washington University McKelvey School of Engineering said, ""Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia; it is characterized by the overproduction of immature myeloid stem cells in the bone marrow and has a 5-year survival rate of around 25%.""The survival curves for AML patients have remained stagnant in the past decades due to the lack of newly approved therapies for AML. However, recent development in novel therapeutics and technologies have shown promising results in preclinical and clinical settings.TCEs stimulate endogenous T cells and demonstrate high potency and efficacy against tumor cells, circumventing certain limitations of genetically engineering extracted patient T cells to express CARs. This immunotherapeutic option has been shown to be successful for both solid and liquid tumors, but is mostly known for the treatment of hematological malignancies. High CD33 expression has been reported on AML blasts; data show as much as 85 90% of blasts express CD33 in AML patients. Moreover, CD33 expression positively correlates with stage of the disease.The Azab Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output, ""Our nanoTCE platform uses nanoparticles to create a relatively simple to produce, reproducible, and off-the-shelf solution to overcome the major limitations associated with current immunotherapy techniques such as TCEs and CAR-T cells. Importantly, this technology is highly customizable and provides the flexibility to engage any immune cell for the treatment of the cancer of interest. In this study, we report a CD33/CD3 nanoTCE that targets the CD33 antigen with high specificity using mAbs, which enables a potent and efficacious immunotherapy treatment against AML. Future studies are warranted to investigate this therapy in combination with chemotherapy, the extent this technology eliminates minimal residual disease and relapse, as well as its efficacy in AML patients""Reference: Alhallak K, Sun J, Muz B. et al.

Do we interpret an emoji primarily as an image or as a word?

Whereas smoking and high blood pressure are the most well-known risk factors associated with the condition, the role of many other lifestyle risk factors as causes of SAH has been unclear.For a long time, obesity has been linked with a heightened risk of developing a number of diseases of the cardiovascular system, but findings pertaining to subarachnoid haemorrhage have been the opposite: the condition appears to occur at a lower frequency in overweight (body mass index 25 30) and obese individuals (body mass index >30) compared to underweight and normal-weight people. While the same observation has been repeatedly made in population-based follow-up studies, no explanation has been identified.A study carried out by Finnish and Norwegian researchers published in the distinguished Stroke journal investigated whether obesity actually protects against subarachnoid haemorrhage. Unlike in prior studies, this was the first time that researchers comprehensively considered factors that may confound the findings, including people s smoking habits and the prevalence of hypertension.The results were very clear: obesity does not protect against subarachnoid haemorrhage. According to Ilari Rautalin, the first author of the study, the findings provide a simple explanation of the previous observations. Smoking is much more common among underweight and normal-weight people than overweight and obese people. Neglecting to take smoking habits into account produces a false observation of subarachnoid haemorrhage occurring less often in obese people, since smoking is less common among them than others,  explains Rautalin, MD, from the University of Helsinki.","Published: November 12, 2021"

The world currently runs on a carbon fuel economy,  explains Christian Wallen, an author of the paper and a former postdoctoral researcher in the lab of UW Madison chemist John Berry.  It s not a great economy because we burn hydrocarbons, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We don t have a way to close the loop for a true carbon cycle, where we could transform carbon dioxide back into a useful fuel.  To move toward the United Nations  goal for the world to become carbon-neutral by 2050, scientists must consider environmentally responsible ways to create energy from elements other than carbon, and the UW Madison team is proposing a nitrogen energy economy based on interconversions of nitrogen and ammonia. The scientists were excited to find that the addition of ammonia to a metal catalyst containing the platinum-like element ruthenium spontaneously produced nitrogen, which means that no added energy was required. Instead, this process can be harnessed to produce electricity, with protons and nitrogen gas as byproducts. In addition, the metal complex can be recycled through exposure to oxygen and used repeatedly, all a much cleaner process than using carbon-based fuels.  We figured out that, not only are we making nitrogen, we are making it under conditions that are completely unprecedented,  says Berry, who is the Lester McNall Professor of Chemistry and focuses his research efforts on transition metal chemistry.  To be able to complete the ammonia-to-nitrogen reaction under ambient conditions   and get energy   is a pretty big deal.  Ammonia has been burned as a fuel source for many years. During World War II, it was used in automobiles, and scientists today are considering ways to burn it in engines as a replacement for gasoline, particularly in the maritime industry. However, burning ammonia releases toxic nitrogen oxide gases. The new reaction avoids those toxic byproducts. If the reaction were housed in a fuel cell where ammonia and ruthenium react at an electrode surface, it could cleanly produce electricity without the need for a catalytic converter.  For a fuel cell, we want an electrical output, not input,  Wallen says.  We discovered chemical compounds that catalyze the conversion of ammonia to nitrogen at room temperature, without any applied voltage or added chemicals. This is the first process, as far as we know, to do that.   To be able to complete the ammonia to nitrogen reaction under ambient conditions   and get energy   is a pretty big deal.   We have an established infrastructure for distribution of ammonia, which is already mass produced from nitrogen and hydrogen in the Haber-Bosch process,  says Michael Trenerry, a graduate student and author on the paper.  This technology could enable a carbon-free fuel economy, but it s one half of the puzzle. One of the drawbacks of ammonia synthesis is that the hydrogen we use to make ammonia comes from natural gas and fossil fuels.  This trend is changing, however, as ammonia producers attempt to produce  green  ammonia, in which the hydrogen atoms are supplied by carbon-neutral water electrolysis instead of the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. As the ammonia synthesis challenges are met, according to Berry, there will be many benefits to using ammonia as a common energy source or fuel. It s compressible, like propane, easy to transport and easy to store. Though some ammonia fuel cells already exist, they, unlike this new process, require added energy, for example, by first splitting ammonia into nitrogen and hydrogen. The group s next steps include figuring out how to engineer a fuel cell that takes advantage of the new discovery and considering environmentally friendly ways to create the needed starting materials.  One of the next challenges I would like to think about is how to generate ammonia from water, instead of hydrogen gas,  Trenerry says.  The dream is to put in water, air and sunlight to create a fuel. ReferenceTrenerry MJ, Wallen CM, Brown TR, Park SV, Berry JF.

It also shows how these features can be disabled. The findings, published in PLOS Pathogens, are a first step toward a new class of treatment aimed at not just suppressing virus replication, but killing cells harboring persistent virus that prevent us from curing HIV infection.  We identified a glyco-immune checkpoint interaction as a novel mechanism that allows HIV-infected cells to evade immune surveillance,  said Mohamed Abdel-Mohsen, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center at The Wistar Institute and coauthor on the paper.  And we developed a novel approach that selectively targets these interactions on the surface of these infected cells. A cure or long-term remission remains the holy grail of HIV research. Current treatments can reduce HIV to undetectable levels, but they can t eradicate it entirely. The disease typically returns quickly when treatment stops. And even when controlled, HIV increases risk for other health problems, including neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. For the new study, researchers looked at a type of sugar molecule called sialic acid on the surface of HIV-infected cells. These sugars bind with special receptors called siglecs on the surface of disease-fighting  natural killer  immune cells. When activated, these receptors act as inhibitors, restraining the killer cells and causing them to stop killing.  We thought,  is it possible that these HIV-infected cells are using this interaction   covering themselves with these sugars to evade the natural killer immune surveillance?  said Abdel-Mohsen.The Abdel-Mohsen lab found that was indeed the case and these infected cells can take advantage of this inhibitory connection to evade immune surveillance. Researchers then investigated whether they could manipulate this connection to make the killer cells more effective at killing HIV-infected cells. First, they looked at whether disabling the inhibitors from the killer cells would unleash their full killing power. However, this can cause the immune cells to attack indiscriminately, destroying both healthy and unhealthy cells. The researchers then turned their attention to the HIV cells. They used an enzyme called sialidase to remove the sialic acid sugars that were activating the immune inhibitors. However, this again affected all cells, causing the killer cells to attack indiscriminately. Finally, they developed a sialidase conjugate linked to HIV antibodies. This antibody-sialidase conjugate only targeted sialic acid on HIV cells. With the sialic acid removed from these cells, the killer immune cells attacked and killed the HIV-infected cells, leaving healthy cells alone.  The killer cells become a super killer for the HIV-infected cells and they now attack them in a selective manner,  said Abdel-Mohsen.  The discovery could be a missing link in the  shock and kill  approach to HIV treatment that has been a focus of research for the past several years,  he added. This two-step process involves first  shocking  the HIV out of latency so it can be detected, and then stimulating the immune system to  kill  the virus once and for all. However, while effective methods have been discovered to reverse latency, scientists haven t yet found a way to make HIV-infected cells more killable once reactivated.  We may have the shock, but we don t have yet the kill,  Abdel-Mohsen said.  Our method actually increases the susceptibility of HIV-infected cells to killing, which is one of the top unmet needs in the HIV field. First author Samson Adeniji, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at Wistar, noted that the team's approach could be tested in combination with broadly neutralizing antibody therapies currently being studied in clinical trials. ""By combining approaches, we could turn these immune cells from a cop into a kind of Robocop,"" he said.The researchers also noted that, in addition to HIV, the approach could have a clinical application in treating other infectious diseases that may evade the immune system, including hepatitis and COVID. Next, the team is moving forward with animal studies to test their findings in vivo. They re also investigating other sugar molecules on HIV that may play a similar role as sialic acid.  HIV-infected cells are likely evading immune surveillance through many potential glyco-immune checkpoints,  Abdel-Mohsen said.  We are investigating other mechanisms and how to break them.

Chicago who conducted the research. PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, often described as  forever chemicals  because they don t degrade naturally and persist as environmental pollutants. Studies have associated PFAS with harmful effects in laboratory animals. Our data suggest that exposure to PFAS synergizes with dietary fat to activate the protein-coding gene PPARa, altering cells  metabolism in ways that escalate the carcinogenic risk in normal prostate cells while driving tumor progression in malignant cells,  said food science and human nutrition professor Zeynep Madak-Erdogan, the principal investigator on the project. These alterations in cell metabolism that occur downstream of PPARa activation may underpin the increased prostate cancer risk observed in men who are exposed to PFAS,  said Madak-Erdogan, who also holds an appointment as a health innovation professor with the Carle Illinois College of Medicine.In their analyses of gene transcription activity, the scientists found that PPARa was expressed at significantly greater levels in the tumor cells of the PFAS-exposed mice that ate the high-fat diet. PPARa controls cell proliferation and differentiation, aids in immune and inflammatory responses and has been found to play a key role in the development of liver and kidney cancers, according to the study.Previous studies, including some conducted in humans, linked PFAS with a range of serious health problems such as prostate cancer, the most common male cancer in the U.S.Published in the journal Nutrients, the current study s findings are believed to be the first to shed light on the synergistic interactions of PFAS and dietary fat and the metabolic changes that shift benign prostate cells to a malignant state, triggering rapidly growing tumors.The scientists injected an aggressive form of malignant human prostate cells into the flanks of male mice that were fed either a high-fat diet intended to mimic the typical Western diet or a control diet. Some of the mice also received oral doses of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), one of the most common forms of PFAS that has been associated with various cancers. We observed an increase in the tumors  volume when exposed to either the high-fat diet or the PFOS,  said co-author Michael J. Spinella, a scientist in the Cancer Center at Illinois and professor of comparative biosciences.  However, at 40 days post-injection, we observed that the fastest tumor growth occurred in the group of mice that both ate the high-fat diet and received PFOS exposure, which suggested a synergistic interaction between the two. In cell culture, the scientists exposed benign prostate cells and a derivative line of aggressive malignant cells to PFOS and found that the malignant cells replicated at triple the rate of the cells in the control group.When the researchers exposed the benign and malignant cells to another form of PFAS, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid, the malignant cells  viability was five times greater than the cells in the control group.Studies have associated PFBS exposure   which can occur through polluted air or polluted drinking water   with diseases of the thyroid and other organs.The scientists hypothesized that metabolic energy pathways within the cells were undergoing changes to facilitate the rapid growth observed. We analyzed the metabolites that changed in response to PFOS treatment, and we found that the metabolic phenotype of the prostate cancer cells was altered, upregulating the proliferative energy pathways,  said co-author Joseph Irudayaraj, the associate director for shared resources at the Cancer Center at Illinois and a founder professor of bioengineering at the U. of I. Exposure to PFOS significantly upregulated genes associated with metabolism, particularly the molecule pyruvate, which is involved in glucose metabolism, and the precursor molecule acetyl-coenzyme A that facilitates the metabolism of fatty acids and steroids,  he said.Prior research, including a 2019 study led by Madak-Erdogan, found that changes in the metabolism of pyruvate and fatty acids were associated with various forms of cancer and other diseases. In that study, published in the journal Cancer Research, Madak-Erdogan s team found that free fatty acids caused estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cells to increase cell proliferation and tumor growth.Structurally, chemicals in the PFAS family resemble free fatty acids and bind to the same sites on serum proteins, Madak-Erdogan said.Reference: Imir OB, Kaminsky AZ, Zuo QY, et al.

This relationship is known as neurovascular coupling, or functional hyperemia, and it occurs via dilation of blood vessels in the brain called arterioles. Functional magnetic resource imaging (fMRI) is based on the concept of neurovascular coupling: experts look for areas of weak blood flow to diagnose brain disorders.However, previous studies of neurovascular coupling have been limited to superficial areas of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex) and scientists have mostly examined how blood flow changes in response to sensory stimuli coming from the environment (such as visual or auditory stimuli). Little is known about whether the same principles apply to deeper brain regions attuned to stimuli produced by the body itself, known as interoceptive signals.To study this relationship in deep brain regions, an interdisciplinary team of scientists led by Dr. Javier Stern, professor of neuroscience at Georgia State and director of the university s Center for Neuroinflammation and Cardiometabolic Diseases, developed a novel approach that combines surgical techniques and state-of-the-art neuroimaging. The team focused on the hypothalamus, a deep brain region involved in critical body functions including drinking, eating, body temperature regulation and reproduction. The study, published in the journal Cell Reports, examined how blood flow to the hypothalamus changed in response to salt intake. We chose salt because the body needs to control sodium levels very precisely. We even have specific cells that detect how much salt is in your blood,  said Stern.  When you ingest salty food, the brain senses it and activates a series of compensatory mechanisms to bring sodium levels back down. The body does this in part by activating neurons that trigger the release of vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone that plays a key role in maintaining the proper concentration of salt. In contrast to previous studies that have observed a positive link between neuron activity and increased blood flow, the researchers found a decrease in blood flow as the neurons became activated in the hypothalamus. The findings took us by surprise because we saw vasoconstriction, which is the opposite of what most people described in the cortex in response to a sensory stimulus,  said Stern.  Reduced blood flow is normally observed in the cortex in the case of diseases like Alzheimer s or after a stroke or ischemia. The team dubbed the phenomenon  inverse neurovascular coupling,  or a decrease in blood flow that produces hypoxia. They also observed other differences: In the cortex, vascular responses to stimuli are very localized and the dilation occurs rapidly. In the hypothalamus, the response was diffuse and took place slowly, over a long period of time. When we eat a lot of salt, our sodium levels stay elevated for a long time,  said Stern.  We believe the hypoxia is a mechanism that strengthens the neurons  ability to respond to the sustained salt stimulation, allowing them to remain active for a prolonged period. The findings raise interesting questions about how hypertension may affect the brain. Between 50 and 60 percent of hypertension is believed to be salt-dependent   triggered by excess salt consumption. The research team plans to study this inverse neurovascular coupling mechanism in animal models to determine whether it contributes to the pathology of salt-dependent hypertension. In addition, they hope to use their approach to study other brain regions and diseases, including depression, obesity and neurodegenerative conditions. If you chronically ingest a lot of salt, you ll have hyperactivation of vasopressin neurons. This mechanism can then induce excessive hypoxia, which could lead to tissue damage in the brain,  said Stern.  If we can better understand this process, we can devise novel targets to stop this hypoxia-dependent activation and perhaps improve the outcomes of people with salt-dependent high blood pressure.

The brain changes were also correlated with alterations in the autonomic nervous system that regulates basic body functions and is implicated in both intense meditation effects as well as sexual stimulation. In addition, patients reported profound spiritual experiences including intense feelings of oneness, unity and connectedness. The study was conducted by the Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences, as well as the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, at Thomas Jefferson University.Orgasmic meditation, or OM, is a specified practice that lasts 15 minutes and is a paired practice such that there is one participant who stimulates the clitoris (a male in this study), and one participant who receives that stimulation (always a female). This study of 20 pairs of meditators used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the changes in functional connectivity between the OM practice and a comparable  neutral  state. Importantly, there were significant changes in both the males and females separately, as well as when combined. This implies that certain general aspects of the practice can affect both the male and female participants in similar and different ways. Specifically, there were changes in frontal lobes which has also been observed in other meditation practices that involve intense focus as well as a sense of release or flow. There were changes in the parietal lobe, an area of the brain involved in the spatial representation of the self, and associated with feelings of oneness and connectedness during spiritual practices. Parts of the temporal lobe were also affected, including the emotional centers of the limbic system, which have been observed to be affected during meditation practices as well as sexual stimulation.""This is a ground-breaking study of a very unique practice,"" says senior author on the paper Andrew Newberg, MD, research director of the Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences and director of the Marcus Institute of Integrative Health at Thomas Jefferson University.  This study also suggests the possibility of an important link between sexuality and spirituality. It should be no surprise that there is such a relationship since both sexual and spiritual experiences can be referred to as  ecstatic  and spiritual traditions have long struggled with the potential problems and benefits of the sexual human being. It should also be emphasized that the findings may have implications for therapeutic applications in the future, helping with various neurological and psychological problems including emotional traumas, sexual dysfunction and even depression.Reference: Newberg AB, Wintering NA, Hriso C, Vedaei F, Stoner M, Ross R.

They report Nov. 11 in the journal Immunity that inhibiting or genetically deleting the enzyme, called MTHFD2, reduced disease severity in multiple inflammatory disease models. Jeffrey Rathmell, PhD, Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Immunobiology, and his team are interested in how metabolic pathways   the chemical reactions that sustain life   influence immune cell function. In the current studies, they focused on  one-carbon  metabolism, a series of reactions that generates chemical building blocks for the biosynthesis of DNA and other molecules.  One-carbon metabolism has been a target for drug development for years and years, but it really hasn t been explored in an unbiased way,  said Rathmell, who is also director of the Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology. The immunosuppressant drug methotrexate, for example, inhibits an enzyme in the one-carbon metabolism pathway, but it may not be the  right target or the right drug for optimal therapeutic activity, he said. To systematically study the pathway in T cells  white blood cells that respond to specific antigens (such as surface proteins on viruses) Ayaka Sugiura, an MD-PhD student in Rathmell s group, developed a screening strategy using the genome editing technology CRISPR. She designed CRISPR  guides  to selectively inactivate each gene in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and introduced this  library  into isolated T cells, carefully controlling the experimental conditions so that each cell had only one (or no) inactivated gene. By studying the modified cells in an animal model of asthma, Sugiura was able to identify genes important to T cell function during the disease process. She then examined the expression of each identified gene during T cell development and in patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases. MTHFD2 stood out. It was highly expressed in disease states and during embryonic development, but it was expressed at low levels, or not at all, in adult tissues, Sugiura said. MTHFD2 had previously been a target for anti-cancer drug development because of its overexpression in many tumors. Although preclinical studies did not support further anti-cancer development of MTHFD2 inhibitors, Sugiura was able to use a well-characterized inhibitor in her studies.  MTHFD2 is important for nucleotide synthesis not only for DNA, but also for proper signaling required for T cell function,  Sugiura said. Inhibiting MTHFD2 with a drug or genetically eliminating it reduced overall proliferation of CD4 T cells (a particular type of T cell the group studied) and blunted immune responses, she said. The researchers discovered, however, that the effects of MTHFD2 inhibition were different for subsets of CD4 T cells that are generated in response to antigen stimulation. Inhibiting MTHFD2 promoted the activity of regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg), which suppress the immune response. But inhibiting MTHFD2 blocked inflammatory CD4 T cells (Th17) and actually converted them to an anti-inflammatory phenotype.  This was pretty surprising,  Rathmell said.  Ayaka was able to show that inhibiting MTHFD2 doesn t just stop an immune response, it actually switches it from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory.  In animal models for multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and a general allergic response, inhibiting or eliminating MTHFD2 reduced disease severity, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory drug development. The Rathmell group is working with collaborators to develop inhibitors with improved clinical characteristics. The researchers also were encouraged to find that giving an MTHFD2 inhibitor in a vaccination model did not impair the immune response to a vaccine.  It was promising that while the inhibitor suppressed inflammation in multiple disease models of hyperactive T cell activity, it did not affect desirable T cell responses, such as the response to vaccination,  Sugiura said. The findings suggest that immune cell subsets rely on one-carbon metabolism  and MTHFD2 function  in different ways, the researchers noted. And although MTHFD2 inhibitors were not successful as anti-cancer agents in general, they might be useful for cancers driven by inflammation, such as colorectal cancer. An MTHFD2 inhibitor would be expected to slow down cancer cell proliferation and also block  the specific inflammatory T cells that can promote that type of cancer,  Rathmell said. The Rathmell group is using the CRISPR-based screen Sugiura developed to explore multiple sets of genes in various disease models and is working to build a core resource for other Vanderbilt investigators. This screening strategy and whole approach to look for important disease genes, which might be therapeutic targets, in an unbiased way is really valuable and has been very impactful for our group,  Rathmell said.

For example, although small krill are individually only one billionth of the weight of a large tuna, they also tend to be a billion times more numerous throughout the oceans. The idea, known as the Sheldon size spectrum theory, was first advanced in the 1970s, but has never been tested for a wide range of marine species and on a global scale until now. An international research team, including researchers from McGill, found that not only does the theory appear to have once held true, but that this natural balance has now been drastically altered by widespread industrial fishing.In a study published today in Science Advances, an international team involving researchers from McGill University, the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Germany, the Institut de Ci ncia i Tecnologia Ambientals in Spain, Queensland University of Technology in Australia and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have found that when oceans were in a more pristine state (before the 20th century and the advent of wide-scale industrial fishing) the size spectrum theory appears to have held true.  The fact that marine life is evenly distributed across sizes is remarkable,  says Eric Galbraith, the senior author on the paper and a professor in McGill s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.  We don t understand why it would need to be this way   why couldn t there be much more small things than large things? Or an ideal size that lies in the middle? In that sense, the results highlight how much we don t understand about the ecosystem. To gain a picture of the current numbers of a wide range of species, the researchers used a range of recent studies to construct a large global data set of marine organisms, including bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, and mammals. Their approach allowed them to differentiate the spatial distribution of 12 major groups of aquatic life over the entire ocean.  It was challenging to find a way to adequately compare measurements of organisms that span such a massive difference in scale,  recalls Ian Hatton, the first author of the study and an Alexander von Humboldt research fellow at the Max Planck Institute.  While microscopic aquatic organisms could be estimated from more than 200,000 water samples collected across the globe, larger marine animals can swim across whole ocean basins and needed to be estimated using entirely different methods.  The researchers also used historical reconstructions and marine ecosystem models to estimate marine biomass in pristine oceans (pre-1850) and compared this data to the present-day. They found that, despite exceptions at either extreme   whales and bacteria - there was once a remarkably constant biomass of approximately 1 gigaton over each order of magnitude range of body size. This means that the total amount of life in the oceans between any size and a size ten-fold larger   for example, from 1 g to 10 g   always adds up to about 1 billion tons, regardless of the starting size. But industrial fishing has significantly altered this picture.In contrast with a nearly constant biomass spectrum in the pristine ocean, the researchers  examination of the spectrum revealed a major impact of humanity on the distribution of biomass across the largest sizes. While fishing accounts for less than 3 percent of human food consumption, its effects on the biomass spectrum have been devastating. Large fish (meaning anything longer than 10 cm) have experienced a total biomass loss of roughly 2 Gigatons (a 60% reduction), dwarfing the 0.1 Gigatons that fishers catch every year. Historically, whaling was even more devastating for the largest end of the biomass spectrum, with the largest whales suffering a 90% loss. Indeed, the authors estimate that losses caused by industrial fishing and whaling over the past century are much greater than the potential biomass losses due to climate change scenarios over the next 80 years, even under pessimistic emissions scenarios.  The biggest surprise, when viewed from this global perspective, was the huge inefficiency of fishing. When industrial fishing fleets go out and catch fish in the ocean, they aren t acting like the large predatory fish, seals, or birds that they compete with, that just consume small quantities of the fish populations in a way that keeps the populations stable,  says Galbraith.  Humans have not merely replaced oceanic top-predators, but entirely altered the flow of energy throughout the marine ecosystem.  He adds:  The good news is that we can reverse the imbalance we ve created, by reducing the number of active fishing vessels around the world. Reducing overfishing will also help make fisheries more profitable and sustainable   it s a potential win-win, if we can get our act together.""ReferenceHatton IA et al.

9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/exploring-cancer-cell-similarity-within-a-single-patient-355789,Exploring Cancer Cell Similarity Within a Single Patient In order to correlate gene expression signatures with cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance  a team of scientists has introduced a new genetic technology  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Even within a single patient with cancer, there is a vast diversity of individual tumor cells, which display distinct behaviors related to growth, metastasis, and responses to chemotherapy. To carry out these behaviors, each cancer cell uses its genes to make the needed molecules in a unique way known as its  gene expression signature.  To correlate gene expression signatures with cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance, a team of scientists led by Rong Lu from USC and Akil A. Merchant from Cedars-Sinai have introduced a new genetic technology in a study published in Nature Communications.To develop the experimental system, first author Humberto Contreras-Trujillo from USC and his colleagues combined two existing technologies. The first enabled the researchers to read the gene expression signatures of individual cancer cells from patients with leukemia. The second technology, developed by the Lu Lab, allowed the scientists to label individual leukemia cells with heritable, DNA-based  barcodes,  offering a way to track not only the cells but also their progeny during disease progression.Using this experimental system, the team analyzed the gene expression signatures of a representative sample of barcoded leukemia cells, and then transplanted the remainder of the cells into mice.Distinct gene expression signatures correlated with the various organs where the cancer cells ended up in the mice. For example, cancer cells with high expression of a gene called CMC2 tended to colonize the ovaries, while cells with low levels of CMC2 expression established colonies in the blood and spleen.Other cancer cells with elevated expression of the genes BTK, DNAJC, and LRIF1 tended to generate progeny in discrete pockets of bone marrow. When the scientists deactivated these genes, leukemia cells accelerated migration, losing their ability to adhere to other cells in the bone marrow. In our study, we were able to identify previously unknown genes that are involved in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance. These genes may provide new targets for future therapies,  said Lu, who is a Richard N. Merkin Assistant Professor of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Medicine, and Gerontology at USC, and a Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Scholar. By demonstrating that cancer cells with distinct gene expression signatures tend to grow in different organs and bone marrow pockets, the study also underscored a major problem facing cancer researchers: studying non-representative samples of patient cells. For instance, if a physician collects patient cells via a standard blood draw, the sample would not include the non-circulating leukemia cells localized to pockets of the bone marrow. Even more concerning, since these pockets of cancer cells are not uniformly distributed, standard bone marrow biopsies may not accurately diagnose disease in the patient.  There are similar challenges when patient cells are transplanted into laboratory mice in order to conduct pre-clinical cancer research. Less than one percent of the patient cells grow and multiply in mice.These problems are compounded if patient cells are collected from one mouse, and subsequently transplanted into another mouse. This practice, known as serial transplantation, is a standard technique for allowing small samples of patient cells to expand into the larger quantities needed for research. However, the new Nature Communications study shows that serial transplantations also favor the survival of cancer cells with particular gene expression signatures.In addition, cells from relapsed patients seemed less likely to survive when transplanted into mice, compared to the cells derived from the same patients prior to any therapeutic treatments. In most cases, the progeny of one or two leukemia cells from the relapsed phase dominated in transplanted mice. Our new system laid bare glaring limitations in the leukemia models that are currently used to carry out the final stages of testing before potential therapeutic treatments advance to human clinical trials,  said Merchant, who is a physician-scientist at Cedars-Sinai.  These leukemia models do not capture the full diversity of individual tumor cells within a single patient, let alone within the broader population of patients affected by this disease.  The researchers also exposed their mice to different variations of the standard leukemia treatment regimen: short-term intensive chemotherapy, followed by long-term maintenance therapy. There were distinct gene expression signatures in leukemia cells that eventually died from intensive treatment, ceased growing due to maintenance therapy, or only responded to a combination of both. Accordingly, in actual clinical practice, combination therapy has proven to be the best overall approach for patients.  By using our experimental system, we learned a lot about how the gene expression of individual leukemia cells influence their progression and treatment resistance,  said Lu.  The same system can provide similar insights about many other types of cancer, and help identify and characterize the particular cells that drive the disease and underlie treatment resistance.

Sneak in and slam the gate before they arrive.That s the central idea of a new strategy by Rice University scientists who seek to avoid gene-editing errors by fine-tuning specific CRISPR-base editing strategies in advance.Rice chemical and biomolecular engineer Xue Sherry Gao and chemist Anatoly Kolomeisky and their labs combined theory and experimentation for a comprehensive approach to building better base editors, molecular machines that target and fix faulty DNA at single-base resolution.Their work appears in Nature Communications.The paper describes the molecular processes that base editors use to manipulate strands of DNA, cutting them where necessary and making way for replacement code. When it works, as it increasingly does to treat genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia and some cancers, the editor only edits the intended nucleotide.And when it doesn t, that s because bystander edits can cause undesired effects.The Rice strategy primarily seeks to eliminate wayward edits to bystanders, nucleotides adjacent to the base editor s target. Gao s lab previously introduced tools to improve the accuracy of CRISPR-based edits of cytosine mutations up to 6,000-fold.For the new project, she engaged the Kolomeisky lab to help create a theoretical framework to eliminate trial and error in the design of a library of editors. These would better target mutations that cause disease while avoiding bystanders. In the process, the framework could help scientists better understand the chemical and physical processes that take place during base editing. Sherry and other experimental scientists already had results that worked,  Kolomeisky said, referring to the earlier paper, in which the lab used its editor to convert cytosines to thymines, correcting the DNA mutations while avoiding otherwise vulnerable cytosines upstream.  But despite these amazing developments, there s been no microscopic understanding of what we have to do with these protein systems to improve editing. He said Qian Wang, a former postdoctoral researcher in Kolomeisky s lab and now an assistant professor at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, took on the challenge, using Gao s cytosine experiment as a baseline. We applied the model for that result and got some important parameters we then used to design what mutations and where are needed to get precise editing,  Kolomeisky said.  Ultimately, this symbiosis of theory and experiment allows us to work in a smart way. Their strategy combines molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic (aka random) models that pinpoint the binding energies between molecules required to achieve maximum editing selectivity. Experiments in Gao s lab validated the results.Critically, the framework includes a way to characterize the binding affinity between deaminases -- enzymes that catalyze the removal of an amino group from a molecule -- and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).Ideally, they said, the deaminase stays on the ssDNA just long enough to complete the primary edit, and releases before inadvertently editing a bystander site. The important thing here is that one mutation doesn't work for different systems,  Kolomeisky said.  So, for every system, you have to do this procedure again, but at least it's clear what should be done. The model has been very successful in reflecting what has already been done experimentally,  Gao said.  But since then, we ve been able to turn down bystander effects in other base-editing systems. Because the number of mutants could be in the thousands, it s unrealistic for experimentalists alone to verify individual base editors,  she said.  Only this multidisciplinary approach will allow us to build a huge library of editors computationally, then narrow the numbers down to the most promising candidates for further experimental verifications. That s what we re working toward. Reference: Wang Q, Yang J, Zhong Z, Vanegas JA, Gao X, Kolomeisky AB. A general theoretical framework to design base editors with reduced bystander effects.

In a new study, researchers administered a single injection to tissues surrounding the spinal cords of paralyzed mice. Just four weeks later, the animals regained the ability to walk.The research will be published in the Nov. 12 issue of the journal Science.By sending bioactive signals to trigger cells to repair and regenerate, the breakthrough therapy dramatically improved severely injured spinal cords in five key ways: (1) The severed extensions of neurons, called axons, regenerated; (2) scar tissue, which can create a physical barrier to regeneration and repair, significantly diminished; (3) myelin, the insulating layer of axons that is important in transmitting electrical signals efficiently, reformed around cells; (4) functional blood vessels formed to deliver nutrients to cells at the injury site; and (5) more motor neurons survived.After the therapy performs its function, the materials biodegrade into nutrients for the cells within 12 weeks and then completely disappear from the body without noticeable side effects. This is the first study in which researchers controlled the collective motion of molecules through changes in chemical structure to increase a therapeutic s efficacy. Our research aims to find a therapy that can prevent individuals from becoming paralyzed after major trauma or disease,  said Northwestern s Samuel I. Stupp, who led the study.  For decades, this has remained a major challenge for scientists because our body s central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, does not have any significant capacity to repair itself after injury or after the onset of a degenerative disease. We are going straight to the FDA to start the process of getting this new therapy approved for use in human patients, who currently have very few treatment options. Stupp is Board of Trustees Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Chemistry, Medicine and Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern, where he is founding director of the Simpson Querrey Institute for BioNanotechnology (SQI) and its affiliated research center, the Center for Regenerative Nanomedicine. He has appointments in the McCormick School of Engineering, Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and Feinberg School of Medicine.Life expectancy has not improved since the 1980s According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, nearly 300,000 people are currently living with a spinal cord injury in the United States. Life for these patients can be extraordinarily difficult. Less than 3% of people with complete injury ever recover basic physical functions. And approximately 30% are re-hospitalized at least once during any given year after the initial injury, costing millions of dollars in average lifetime health care costs per patient. Life expectancy for people with spinal cord injuries is significantly lower than people without spinal cord injuries and has not improved since the 1980s. Currently, there are no therapeutics that trigger spinal cord regeneration,  said Stupp, an expert in regenerative medicine.  I wanted to make a difference on the outcomes of spinal cord injury and to tackle this problem, given the tremendous impact it could have on the lives of patients. Also, new science to address spinal cord injury could have impact on strategies for neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Dancing molecules  hit moving targets The secret behind Stupp s new breakthrough therapeutic is tuning the motion of molecules, so they can find and properly engage constantly moving cellular receptors. Injected as a liquid, the therapy immediately gels into a complex network of nanofibers that mimic the extracellular matrix of the spinal cord. By matching the matrix s structure, mimicking the motion of biological molecules and incorporating signals for receptors, the synthetic materials are able to communicate with cells. Receptors in neurons and other cells constantly move around,  Stupp said.  The key innovation in our research, which has never been done before, is to control the collective motion of more than 100,000 molecules within our nanofibers. By making the molecules move,  dance  or even leap temporarily out of these structures, known as supramolecular polymers, they are able to connect more effectively with receptors. Stupp and his team found that fine-tuning the molecules  motion within the nanofiber network to make them more agile resulted in greater therapeutic efficacy in paralyzed mice. They also confirmed that formulations of their therapy with enhanced molecular motion performed better during in vitro tests with human cells, indicating increased bioactivity and cellular signaling. Given that cells themselves and their receptors are in constant motion, you can imagine that molecules moving more rapidly would encounter these receptors more often,  Stupp said.  If the molecules are sluggish and not as  social,  they may never come into contact with the cells. One injection, two signals Once connected to the receptors, the moving molecules trigger two cascading signals, both of which are critical to spinal cord repair. One signal prompts the long tails of neurons in the spinal cord, called axons, to regenerate. Similar to electrical cables, axons send signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Severing or damaging axons can result in the loss of feeling in the body or even paralysis. Repairing axons, on the other hand, increases communication between the body and brain.The second signal helps neurons survive after injury because it causes other cell types to proliferate, promoting the regrowth of lost blood vessels that feed neurons and critical cells for tissue repair. The therapy also induces myelin to rebuild around axons and reduces glial scarring, which acts as a physical barrier that prevents the spinal cord from healing.  The signals used in the study mimic the natural proteins that are needed to induce the desired biological responses. However, proteins have extremely short half-lives and are expensive to produce,  said Zaida  lvarez, the study s first author and former research assistant professor in Stupp s laboratory.  Our synthetic signals are short, modified peptides that   when bonded together by the thousands   will survive for weeks to deliver bioactivity. The end result is a therapy that is less expensive to produce and lasts much longer. Universal application While the new therapy could be used to prevent paralysis after major trauma (automobile accidents, falls, sports accidents and gunshot wounds) as well as from diseases, Stupp believes the underlying discovery   that  supramolecular motion  is a key factor in bioactivity   can be applied to other therapies and targets. The central nervous system tissues we have successfully regenerated in the injured spinal cord are similar to those in the brain affected by stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease,  Stupp said.  Beyond that, our fundamental discovery about controlling the motion of molecular assemblies to enhance cell signaling could be applied universally across biomedical targets.

This more aggressive profile drives the activation Schwann cells associated with the tumor and the secretion of an extracellular tissue which, when blocked, impedes the metastatic capacity of the tumour. Ninety per cent of cancer deaths are caused by metastasis, that is to say, the spread of the primary tumour to other organs. Scientists led by ICREA researcher Dr. Salvador Aznar-Benitah at IRB Barcelona have described the mechanism by which a diet rich in palmitic acid makes tumour cells more aggressive, conferring them a greater capacity to metastasize. The authors have identified several  memory  markers left in tumour cells after exposure to palmitic acid: a change that causes cells to conserve greater metastatic capacity, even months after exposure to the fatty acid and that it could be related to a greater capacity of these tumor cells to promote innervation.  In 2017, we published a study indicating that palmitic acid correlates with increased risk of metastasis, but we didn t know the mechanism responsible for this. In this study, we detail the process and reveal the involvement of a metastatic capacity  memory  factor and we point to a therapeutic approach to reverse it. This is promising,  says Dr. Aznar-Benitah. In this work, oral tumour cells and melanomas from patients were exposed to a diet rich in palmitic acid. When transplanted into mice, it was observed that they showed a greater capacity to metastasize, even when this diet was administered for a short period prior to the transfer.  The alterations of the genome (known as epigenetic modifications) of metastatic cells caused by the fatty acid are permanent and, consequently, the cells maintain the most  aggressive  properties in a stable manner. The authors describe this behaviour as a  stable memory . Our results indicate that a diet rich in palm oil would favour the development of cancer, even if exposure to this fatty acid occurs in a very early stage of the disease in which the primary tumour may still not have been detected. The scientists have observed that this expansive and colonising capacity is acquired as a result of the consumption of palmitic acid (predominant in palm oil), but not of oleic acid (abundant in olive oil) or linoleic acid (characteristic of flaxseed). These results suggest that aggressiveness is linked not only to fat metabolism but also to epigenetic modifications that occur in tumour cells in response to exposure to palmitic acid. For a tumour cell to metastasize, first it must detach from the tumour of origin, enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system, reach another organ, and survive and grow there. In this study, the authors have identified that a diet rich in palmitic acid allows tumour cells to form a neural network around the tumour. The tumour cells with the most metastatic capacity (i.e. with memory) get the capacity to attract the nervous system, and the neural network that forms around the tumour produces a regenerative environment, which the cells use to their advantage to grow and spread. One of the key elements in the formation of the neural network that favours metastasis are the so-called Schwann cells, which surround and protect neurons. The study published in the journal Nature demonstrates that various approaches to block Schwann cells inhibit the development of this neural network, thereby preventing metastasis.  This discovery paves the way for research into and the development of therapies that specifically block cancer metastasis, a process that is almost always the cause of death by cancer,  concludes Dr. Gloria Pascual, associate researcher in the Stem Cells and Cancer lab at IRB Barcelona and co-first author of the paper together with Dr. Diana Dom nguez. This work has been carried out using the latest single-cell RNA sequencing and positional RNA sequencing technologies, which have allowed detailed characterisation of the composition of the distinct cells that form the tumour. This is one of the first times that positional RNA-sequencing technology has been used to study the cell composition of metastases.ReferencePascual G, Dom nguez D, Elos a-Bayes M, et al.

Drug discovery for chronic pain is at the forefront of this research, and it's being amplified by the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid epidemic,  said Rajesh Khanna, PhD, associate director of the UArizona Health Sciences Comprehensive Pain and Addiction Center, professor of pharmacology in the UArizona College of Medicine   Tucson and a member of the BIO5 Institute.  Drug discovery is a very arduous process. Our lab looked at a fundamental mechanism of pain, came up with a way to differentiate it from those before us and found a compound that has potential as a new non-opioid treatment for pain.  The paper,  Selective targeting of NaV1.7 via inhibition of the CRMP2-Ubc9 interaction reduces pain in rodents,  was published today in Science Translational Medicine.The biological mechanism at the heart of the research is NaV1.7, a sodium ion channel that previously was linked to the sensation of pain through genetic studies of people with rare pain disorders. Nerve cells, or neurons, use electrical currents to send signals to the brain and throughout the body, and sodium ion channels are vital to a cell's ability to generate those electrical currents. When a neuron is stimulated, the NaV1.7 channel opens and allows positively charged sodium ions to cross the cell membrane and enter the previously negatively charged cell. The change in charge across the cell membrane generates an electrical current, which increases the excitability of the neuron and sets in motion a cascade of events that leads to pain.Using a compound they designed and dubbed 194, the team successfully regulated NaV1.7 activation in the laboratory using nerve cells from four different species, including humans. In animal models, 194 was effective in reversing pain in six different pain models in both sexes.Researchers also found that 194 may promote pain relief by activating the body s endogenous, or naturally occurring, opioid system. Once produced, endogenous opioids activate receptors that produce physiological changes such as pain relief. And 194 did so without causing motor performance issues, depressive behaviors or addiction.Finally, Dr. Khanna and the team observed a synergistic effect when 194 was combined with morphine and gabapentin. This is a promising sign that 194 could be used in a dose-reduction strategy for painkillers that have negative side effects, including opioids, while maintaining high levels of pain relief.Dr. Khanna s prior research identified a protein, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), and an enzyme, Ubc9, that both play a role in NaV1.7 activation. CRMP2 is a protein that binds to NaV1.7 and transports it to the cell membrane, where sodium ions are then transferred into the cell. Ubc9 is an enzyme that tags CRMP2 with another protein   a small ubiquitin-like modifier protein   to specifically direct control of NaV1.7. Building on this knowledge, Dr. Khanna and the team set out to determine if they could directly regulate the activity of NaV1.7 by blocking Ubc9 from interacting with CRMP2. Team members including May Khanna, PhD, associate professor of pharmacology and BIO5 Institute member, Vijay Gokhale, PhD, associate research professor in the BIO5 Institute, and Samantha Perez-Miller, PhD, researcher and scientist in the Department of Pharmacology, examined 50,000 existing small molecules to identify the ones with a structure similar to Ubc9. They selected less than 50 of the closest matches, which were then tested in Dr. Khanna s laboratory to see if their presence would suppress the influx of sodium through NaV1.7. The findings were promising, so the team set their sights on developing a unique, more effective compound.The result was 194, which UArizona patented and licensed to startup Regulonix LLC through Tech Launch Arizona, the UArizona office that commercializes inventions stemming from university research. Drs. Khanna and Gokhale founded Regulonix LLC in 2016 to address the growing opioid epidemic by developing new, non-addictive ways to treat pain and commercializing those innovations.While 194 shows great promise for pain relief, Dr. Khanna and the team have been working with the National Institutes of Health s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences to optimize the compound. In this case, an NCATS team is primarily focusing on improving 194 s half-life   the time it takes for a drug to reduce by half in your body   and its drug-like properties.It is an important step in optimizing the compound s potential as a pain-relieving drug and advancing to the next stage, where researchers will file for Food and Drug Administration approval to begin clinical trials.Reference: Cai S, Moutal A, Yu J, et al.

Our research shows that humans were a crucial and chronic driver of population declines of woolly mammoths, having an essential role in the timing and location of their extinction,  said lead author Associate Professor Damien Fordham from the University of Adelaide s Environment Institute. Using computer models, fossils and ancient DNA we have identified the very mechanisms and threats that were integral in the initial decline and later extinction of the woolly mammoth.  Signatures of past changes in the distribution and demography of woolly mammoths identified from fossils and ancient DNA show that people hastened the extinction of woolly mammoths by up to 4,000 years in some regions. We know that humans exploited woolly mammoths for meat, skins, bones and ivory. However, until now it has been difficult to disentangle the exact roles that climate warming and human hunting had on its extinction,  said Associate Professor Fordham.The study also shows that woolly mammoths are likely to have survived in the Arctic for thousands of years longer than previously thought, existing in small areas of habitat with suitable climatic conditions and low densities of humans. Our finding of long-term persistence in Eurasia independently confirms recently published environmental DNA evidence that shows that woolly mammoths were roaming around Siberia 5,000 years ago,  said Associate Professor Jeremey Austin from the University of Adelaide s Australian Centre for Ancient DNA.Associate Professor David Nogues-Bravo from the University of Copenhagen was a co-author of the study which is published in the journal Ecology Letters. Our analyses strengthens and better resolves the case for human impacts as a driver of population declines and range collapses of megafauna in Eurasia during the late Pleistocene,  he said. It also refutes a prevalent theory that climate change alone decimated woolly mammoth populations and that the role of humans was limited to hunters delivering the coup de gr ce . And shows that species extinctions are usually the result of complex interactions between threatening processes. The researchers emphasise that the pathway to extinction for the woolly mammoth was long and lasting, starting many millennia before the final extinction event.Reference: Fordham DA, Brown SC, Ak akaya HR, et al.

Newborns with drug-resistant seizures often develop childhood epilepsy and cognitive disabilities. The findings were published online this week in the journal Science Signaling. The study was led by Shilpa Kadam, Ph.D., a research scientist at Kennedy Krieger s Hugo W. Moser Research Institute, who is also director of the mouse in-vivo electrophysiology laboratory at Kennedy Krieger.In the paper, Targeting ischemia-induced KCC2 hypofunction rescues refractory neonatal seizures and mitigates epileptogenesis in a mouse model, Dr. Kadam and colleagues from Kennedy Krieger and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine showed that increasing the activity of an ion transporter in nerve cells, namely KCC2, by CLP290, a novel KCC2-selective activator, reduced seizures in mice.Neonatal seizures typically occur within first two days after birth and in some cases as the result of impaired blood flow during a complicated birth. Babies receive phenobarbital or other common medications for seizures, but for about 50 percent of newborns seizures remain intractable.  At this time, there is no FDA-approved medication to effectively prevent these treatment-resistant seizures. These treatment-resistant seizures come on very severely, and can sometimes be lethal. Those children that survive often develop epilepsy,  said Dr. Shilpa Kadam,  We needed out-of-the-box thinking to tackle this problem and this is our approach at Kennedy Krieger. This kind of work is a fundamental part of our mission. According to the study authors, their findings are the first to validate the strategy of using KCC2 as a potential drug target for treatment-resistant seizures.  The findings provide important insights for future drug development. However, more work is needed to determine how best to translate these preclinical findings into human populations. We hope that a simple add-on intervention could effectively change the trajectory of a child s life and may prevent the onset of lifelong epilepsy. We will be continuing to study these results and their potential application to improve child health,  Kadam said.Recognizing the importance of the work, Kennedy Krieger s President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Brad Schlaggar, noted  Dr. Kadam and her colleagues have made a valuable contribution to begin tackling the long-recognized problem of drug-resistant seizures in newborns.  The study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).Reference: Sullivan BJ, Kipnis PA, Carter BM, et al.

The study suggests the reverse is true   a restricted diet in autism may instead alter the gut microbiota.The microbiome is in vogue. Academic conferences are filled with new discoveries on how this community of microbes that call our bodies home may affect our health. Much of that excitement is warranted   new sequencing techniques have made it possible to interrogate in unprecedented depth the teeming life within our gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Many discoveries have revealed an incredible variation in bacterial species between individuals. The  Gut Brain Axis  has become an especially popular topic. This suggests that links between microbiota in our gut (which contains its own branch of the nervous system) and our brain might explain some of the variation we see in our mental health.The field has been further encouraged by the advent of  fecal microbiota transplants , which aim to supplement an affected individual s gut bacteria with species from a healthy volunteer by, to use formal scientific terminology, putting their poop into pills. Many brain conditions and diseases have proved so stubbornly resistant to treatment, their origins so slippery to pin down, that the idea that a simple tweak in the gut could provide a solution has proved a potent motivator for research.In recent years, the influence of the gut brain axis has been investigated in a dizzying range of conditions such as dementia, irritable bowel syndrome, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and even mood disorders such as depression.But a new study by researchers at Mater Research and the University of Queensland suggests that researchers formulating links between the microbiome and the neurodevelopmental condition ASD might have things somewhat back-to-front.Restricted dietary preferences influence food choice, which influences microbiota, suggests the model. Credit: Chloe Yap  Rather than the microbiome contributing to autism, really, it looks like it's the other way around; it's characteristics of autism that contribute to the microbiome,  Gratten explains. How might a condition like autism tweak kids  gut bacteria? Gratten proposes an intuitive answer.  What we see is that autistic children are more likely to have a highly selective diet, consistent with the fact that children with a diagnosis are more likely to have some sensory sensitivities. If food doesn't smell great, or doesn't feel nice in your mouth, then you're less likely to eat that and more likely to focus on a smaller number of foods that you really enjoy. But it's really that restricted diet we see in autistic children compared to those without a diagnosis that appears to be driving the changes that we see in in the microbiome,  says Gratten.The finding represents a blow against the idea that changing the microbiome might influence behaviors accompanying autism that might be beneficial to reduce, such as stress-induced self-harm. What will the impact of that finding be for autistic children and their families? Could we improve autism-related GI issues via their microbiome, not by changing their autism, but by compensating for their restricted diet? Gratten says more research is needed:  I think that's plausible. What we see is a pretty strong relationship between microbiome diversity and stool consistency, which is a proxy for these [GI] conditions. However, we didn't really have very good data on whether the children were suffering from constipation or diarrhea or some other kind of functional GI disorder. And so really, more research is needed. ","Published: November 11, 2021"

Samples were collected from 77 mothers - 47 in the infected group, 30 in the vaccine group   to determine the level of antibodies in breast milk over time. Mothers who had disease-acquired immunity produced high levels of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against the virus in breast milk, while vaccine-acquired immunity produced robust Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.Both antibodies provided neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, the first time such evidence has been discovered for both IgA and IgG antibodies, according to study co-author Bridget Young, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at URMC. It s one thing to measure antibody concentrations, but it s another to say that antibodies are functional and can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus,  said Young,  One of the exciting findings in this work is that breast milk from both mothers with COVID-19 infection, and from mothers receiving mRNA vaccination contained these active antibodies that were able to neutralize the virus. Previous studies from URMC had shown evidence of antibodies in breast milk from COVID positive mothers. This follow-up study represents the longest time period that disease-acquired antibodies have been examined post-illness, and the results showed that these antibodies exist for three months after infection.For vaccinated mothers, the study found evidence of a mild-to-modest decline in antibodies   on average - three months post-vaccination. The trend in breast milk antibodies aligns with what we see in vaccination sera,  said study co-author Kirsi Jarvinen-Seppo, PhD, M.D., Chief of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at URMC,  after a few months, the antibodies trend downward, but the levels are still significantly above what they were pre-vaccine. Both Young and Jarvinen-Seppo emphasize, however, that while the antibody response exists, it s not yet shown whether these breast milk antibodies can provide protection against COVID for nursing children. The study does not imply that children would be protected from illness,  said Jarvinen-Seppo,  and breast milk antibodies may not be a substitute for vaccination for infants and children, once approved. For the next phase of the study, URMC researchers are looking to find evidence whether both vaccination and illness-acquired immunity provide antibodies against other seasonal coronaviruses.Reference: Young BE, Seppo AE, Diaz N, et al.

This movement is made possible by the connections between individual cells. These connections, in turn, are established by various protein molecules which transfer the necessary forces and information between neighbouring cells. A research team led by the University of G ttingen, and including researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, has shown that particularly close connections   known as  tight junctions    play an important role in cell movement. In addition, they investigated the consequences of losing these connections. The results were published in the journal Advanced Science.The researchers investigated the connections between the cells using a range of biophysical techniques. Employing video microscopy and automated analyses, they examined the properties of thousands of living cells in motion for over twenty hours. Their investigations included observing the size, shape, and mobility of the cells. Specific proteins were also stained to find out what happens at a molecular level when the ""tight junction"" connections are lost.If these special connections are missing, neighbouring cells can no longer couple with each other as they usually would. The individual cells start to contract very strongly and a kind of  tug of war  develops between the cells. Lead author Professor Andreas Janshoff, University of G ttingen, says: ""Some cells win and contract to tiny sizes, while other cells lose and get stretched apart. The loser cells even start dividing more in the process, creating more and more small winner cells."" The contracted cells hardly move at all, so that the whole tissue behaves as if it is frozen. If, on the other hand, these special connections between the cells are present, the cell layer remains very mobile, similar to liquid water. For example, in healthy tissue, wounds can heal efficiently in this way, while the epithelial cells simultaneously maintain their barrier function.""We were surprised to find such a mechanism which creates an extremely unequal tug of war between cells that are essentially identical,"" says first author Mark Skamrahl at the University of G ttingen. ""The negative influence of this tug of war on cell movement is another new finding about how cell mechanics can critically determine biological functions.""In previous research, only the mechanical role of a type of connection known as ""adherens junctions"" in collective cell movement was known. The importance of  tight junctions  is not only essential to the understanding of cell movement, it could also contribute to the understanding of cancer.Reference: Skamrahl M, Pang H, Ferle M, et al.

We ve been puzzled for years now, trying to work out why some children never develop chronic ear disease, despite being in a high-risk category for contracting it,  Dr Bialasiewicz said. By focusing on the microbiomes in the upper respiratory tracts of disease-resistant kids, we could investigate the ecological networks of bacterial interactions that seemed to be working together to protect against the condition. It was clear that these two groups of bacteria needed to not only be present, but to be interacting with each other, to provide protection from middle ear infections. Dr Bialasiewicz said they were hoping to use this information to figure out what the exact mechanism of protection is, and then mimic it in the very young children, as a therapy or a preventative measure. This could take the form of a molecule that can be used as a drug for treatment, or as a protective probiotic so that these  good  bacteria can be seeded in the nose early enough to offer protection against the incoming  bad  bacteria,  he said.Dr Andrea Coleman, who completed her PhD work on the project this year, said the research provided a new perspective on how middle ear infections develop and could pave the way for new treatments. Chronic middle ear infections can affect between one third to one half of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, which is far above the four per cent threshold that the World Health Organisation considers as a disease needing urgent public health action,  Dr Coleman said. This disease can cause hearing loss and can have life-long impacts on speech and language development, education, and future employment prospects, and in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations contributes to the wide gap in educational and employment outcomes. The study investigated the microbiomes of 103 children aged two to seven  from two north Queensland communities. Dr Bialasiewicz said chronic middle ear infections resulting in hearing loss was a major problem with Indigenous and other disadvantaged populations globally. Our discovery could be applied across the world, helping improve health and reducing the disadvantage gap for a wide range of people,  he said.Reference: Coleman A, Zaugg J, Wood A, et al.

Most crop species only have a few varieties sequenced, so it was a massive undertaking by the international team to analyse more than 3000 cultivated and wild varieties,  Professor Hayes said.The landmark international study was led by Dr Rajeev Varshney from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in Hyderabad, India.The study confirmed chickpea s origin in the Fertile Crescent and provides a complete picture of genetic variation within chickpea. ""We identified 1,582 novel genes and established the pan-genome of chickpea, which will serve as a foundation for breeding superior chickpea varieties with enhanced yield, higher resistance to drought, heat and diseases,"" Dr Varshney said.Professor Hayes said the UQ team used the data to model a chickpea with perfect genetics for seed weight, a trait linked to yield. This additional data led to the increase in yield predicted by our model, which is still being fine-tuned,  he said. We are using our AI  FastStack  technology platform to design a chickpea with the ultimate genetics for maximum seed weight, and we think this will ultimately be a valuable tool for chickpea breeders. FastStack combines AI with genomic prediction technology to identify the combinations of genes most likely to improve crop performance.Chickpea is the largest pulse crop in Australia after lupin, both in terms of planting area and production.It ranks second in area and third in production among the pulses worldwide.UQ plant breeder and crop geneticist, Associate Professor Lee Hickey, said the global demand for protein-rich pulses was increasing. Improving the productivity of chickpea for Australia offers opportunities for our farmers to supply local food industries and export markets,  he said. Using this AI-generated chickpea model for increased seed weight in the field will be challenging, given the number of generations it will take in cross-breeding for optimal chickpea genetics, and the impact of different environments and management practices on crop growth.""But we do have tools like speed breeding that can speed this process up and allows us to test and put into practice these theoretical scenarios. Dr Hickey said new genomic breeding approaches, including the haplotype model, are expected to redefine chickpea breeding strategies for developing high-yielding and nutritious chickpea varieties.Chickpea is an important rotation crop in farming systems, as it is self-fertilising for nitrogen, reducing the need for nitrogen fertiliser.Reference: Varshney RK, Roorkiwal M, Sun S, et al.

Today there are more than 10,000 species of lepidosaurs, and much of their recent success is a result of fast evolution in favourable circumstances. But this was not always the case.Mr Herrera-Flores explained:  Lepidosaurs originated 250 million years ago in the early Mesozoic Era, and they split into two major groups, the squamates on the one hand, leading to modern lizards and snakes, and the rhynchocephalians on the other, represented today by a single species, the tuatara of New Zealand. We expected to find slow evolution in rhynchocephalians, and fast evolution in squamates. But we found the opposite. We looked at the rate of change in body size among these early reptiles,  said Dr Tom Stubbs, a collaborator.  We found that some groups of squamates evolved fast in the Mesozoic, especially those with specialised lifestyles like the marine mosasaurs. But rhynchocephalians were much more consistently fast-evolving. In fact, their average rates of evolution were significantly faster than those for squamates, about twice the background rate of evolution, and we really did not expect this,  said Dr Armin Elsler, another collaborator.  In the later part of the Mesozoic all the modern groups of lizards and snakes originated and began to diversify, living side-by-side with the dinosaurs, but probably not engaging with them ecologically. These early lizards were feeding on bugs, worms, and plants, but they were mainly quite small. Prof Mike Benton added:  After the extinction of the dinosaurs, 66 million years ago, at the end of the Mesozoic, the rhynchocephalians and squamates suffered a lot, but the squamates bounced back. But for most of the Mesozoic, the rhynchocephalians were the innovators and the fast evolvers. They tailed off quite severely well before the end of the Mesozoic, and the whole dynamic changed after that. This work confirms a challenging proposal made by the famous palaeontologist George Gaylord Simpson in his 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution. He looked at the fundamental patterns of evolution in a framework of Darwinian evolution and observed that many fast-evolving species belonged to unstable groups, which were potentially adapting to rapidly changing environments.Prof Benton continued:  Slow and steady wins the race. In the classic Aesop s fable, the speedy hare loses the race, whereas the slow-moving tortoise crosses the finishing line first. Since the days of Darwin, biologists have debated whether evolution is more like the hare or the tortoise. Is it the case that big groups of many species are the result of fast evolution over a short time or slow evolution over a long time? In some cases, they can stabilise and survive well, but in many cases the species go extinct as fast as new ones emerge, and they can go extinct, just like the napping hare. On the other hand, Simpson predicted that slowly evolving species might also be slow to go extinct, and could in the end be successful in the longer term, just like the slow-moving but persistent tortoise in the fable.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/taking-a-look-at-whats-in-the-water-355743,Taking a Look at What s In the Water Researchers take a granular look at global inputs and impacts of human wastewater in coastal ecosystems  The results aren t pretty  but they are enlightening  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The tendency for most of us when it comes to human wastewater is out of sight, out of mind. Rarely do we consider what happens after we flush that toilet or turn off that tap.However, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have turned their attention and considerable computational power to the subject and its impacts on global coastal ecosystems. The results aren t pretty, but they are enlightening.  The motivation behind this research was a desire to have a fine-grain understanding of how wastewater is impacting coastal waters worldwide,  said Cascade Tuholske, the lead author of a paper(link is external) that appears in the journal PLOS One. While research on terrestrial threats to coastal marine ecosystems often focuses on agricultural runoff and what happens when fertilizer and livestock waste winds up in the ocean, he said, few studies investigate what happens when human sewage does the same.  This isn t the first study to produce a global wastewater model, but it is the first study to map the inputs of nitrogen and pathogens from wastewater across 130,000 watersheds across the planet,  Tuholske said.  And this is important because there are trade-offs in the intervention space.  Information from this model, he added, could make those trade-offs clearer and management decisions easier to make.The majority of human wastewater is discharged into the ocean around the world in a variety of treated and untreated states from sewage, septic and direct input sources. Not surprisingly, major human wastewater sources are also places with dense human populations, which tend to aggregate around major watersheds.  We estimate that 25 watersheds contribute approximately 46% of global nitrogen inputs from wastewater into the ocean,  said Tuholske, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University who conducted this study as a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara.  Nearly half as much nitrogen comes from wastewater as agricultural runoff globally,  he added,  which is a huge fraction.  Coastlines all around the world are affected by increased nitrogen, according to the paper. Tuholske and an interdisciplinary group of fellow scientists at UCSB   Ben Halpern, Gordon Blasco, Juan Carlos Villasenor, Melanie Frazier and Kelly Caylor   have created a data visualization(link is external) that maps globally the sources and destinations of nitrogen, a common element in both agricultural and human wastewater that causes eutrophication. It s a phenomenon in which excessive nutrients create phytoplankton blooms just offshore that produce toxins and deprive the waters in the area of oxygen. These so-called  dead zones  not only suffocate the sea life unfortunate enough to be trapped in them, but also can cause problems in the food chain, including for humans.  Many coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs and seagrass beds, are particularly sensitive to excess nutrients, even if you don t have a dead zone,  said Halpern(link is external), a professor in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and the director of the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis at UCSB.  The whole ecosystem can tip into a highly degraded state when nutrient levels are too high. Coral reefs can be converted into fields of algae that overgrow and kill the corals below them. Our work here helps map where nutrients from wastewater are likely putting these ecosystems at greatest risk.  For Tuholske, whose research focuses on food systems, the model puts into stark relief the impact of modern diets on coastal ecosystems.  What was really surprising through this research is how diets shifting to animal-based proteins are impacting marine ecology,  he said. As countries get wealthier and incorporate more meat into their food systems, he explained, the more nitrogen shows up in the wastewater, in addition to the already high levels generated by agriculture.  The more burgers people are eating, the more nitrogen is getting into the ocean,  he said.Excessive nitrogen isn t the only concern with the growing amount of human wastewater being discharged into the ocean; where wastewater goes, so too go pathogens. But the removal of nitrogen or pathogens can require very different methods, which can make it difficult for decisionmakers with finite resources and varying priorities to weigh their options between improving public health and protecting coastal ecosystems. With the fine-scale estimates of nutrient and pathogen inputs provided by this model, the aim is to provide information that can lead to local solutions that together can tackle a complex global problem.  These top-down, fine resolution hotspot maps can be matched with bottom-up approaches, and we can transfer knowledge across geographies,  Tuholske said.  Adaptation and mitigation really come from the bottom up, and having a global map helps to target priorities and share knowledge.  While we map the scale of this problem, we can do something about it,  he added.  We can protect both public health and coastal ecosystems.

And how do they make it happen?In 1990, University of California San Diego biologist William McGinnis conducted a seminal experiment that helped scientists unravel how high-level control genes called Hox genes shape our appearance features. The  McGinnis experiment  helped pave the way for understanding the role of Hox genes in determining the uniform appearances of species, from humans to chimpanzees to flies.McGinnis, a professor emeritus of Cell and Developmental Biology and former dean of the Division of Biological Sciences, helped discover a defining DNA region that he termed the  homeobox,  a sequence within genes that directs anatomical development. Since the now-famous McGinnis experiment, evolutionary and developmental biologists have pondered how these highly influential Hox genes determine the identities of different body regions.More than three decades later, a study published Nov. 10 in Science Advances and led by Ankush Auradkar, a UC San Diego postdoctoral scholar mentored by coauthor McGinnis and study senior author Ethan Bier, helps answer questions about how Hox genes function.The now-textbook McGinnis experiment tested whether the proteins produced by a human or mouse Hox gene could function in flies. Following in these footsteps, the new study leveraged modern CRISPR gene editing to investigate whether all aspects of Hox gene function, which consists of both protein coding and control regions, could be replaced in a common laboratory fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) with its counterpart from a rarer Hawaiian cousin (Drosophila mimica), which has a very different face.The gene in question, proboscipedia, would plainly reveal itself since it directs the formation of strikingly different mouth parts smooth and spongy in D. mel but more grill-like (resembling the face of the alien in Predator science fiction films) in D. mim.Study coauthor Emily Bulger first collected the notoriously difficult-to-breed D. mim samples from Hawai i Volcanoes National Park, along with the only native fruit (Sapindus saponaria - Hawaiian soapberry) that the insects are known to eat, in order to establish a temporary colony in Bier s laboratory. Auradkar then collaborated with coauthor Sushil Devkota to decipher the genome sequence of the D. mim proboscipedia gene, which was nearly 44,000 bases long. The researchers then deleted the D. mel proboscipedia gene and replaced it with the D. mim version of the same.As McGinnis had predicted, the new results revealed that the graceful facial structure of D. mel emerged as the  winner  over the rough features of D. mim. One trait of D. mim, however, did surface during the experiment: Sensory organs called maxillary palps that stick out from the face in D. mel instead ran parallel to feeding mouthparts as they do in D. mim. Auradkar used sophisticated genetic tools to determine the basis for this difference and tracked it down to a change in the pattern by which the proboscipedia gene is activated (control region changes).The experiment s results help answer longstanding questions about whether Hox genes function as  master  regulatory genes that dictate different body parts in organisms. Or, as McGinnis proposed, whether Hox genes instead provide abstract positional codes and serve as scaffolds for downstream genes that best benefit the organism. Other than the maxillary palps, the new results demonstrated that McGinnis  scaffolding idea proved to be the case.McGinnis says that beyond the implications for evolutionary biology, the results could help explain developmental issues rooted in fundamental human genetic processes. These fly studies provide a window into deep evolutionary time and inform us about the mechanisms by which body plans change during evolution,  said Bier.  These insights may lead to a better of understanding of processes tied to congenital birth defects in humans. With the advent of powerful new CRISPR-based genome editing systems for human therapy on the horizon, new strategies might be formulated to mitigate some of the effects of these often debilitating conditions.

These tests give public health officials reliable new ways to track the legacy of contamination that still persists in some urban soils decades after federal bans ended the widespread use of lead-based paint and gasoline,  said Avner Vengosh, Distinguished Professor of Environmental Quality at Duke s Nicholas School of the Environment. We developed these tests to assess lead contamination in soils around Durham, N.C., but they could be used in similar cities anywhere,  Vengosh said.The new study builds upon another Duke-led study of lead contamination in Durham soils, published earlier this year, that showed while lead levels in urban soils around Durham are declining overall, hotspots of contamination remain, especially in foundation soils around older houses and apartment buildings -- likely the legacy of lead paint use in these homes.The new tests can distinguish between the isotopic ratio, or unique geochemical  fingerprint,  of lead contamination from different sources, including pre-1970s vehicle exhaust fumes, lead paint from that era, or lead from more recent atmospheric sources. Measuring the radioactive isotope Caesium-137 -- caused by fallout from Cold War-era atomic tests -- in the lead provides an added indication if the lead pre-dates the 1970s and stems from legacy contamination rather than recent sources.This allows health officials to zero in on the origin of the contamination even at sites where there are many potential sources, said Zhen Wang, a doctoral student in Vengosh s lab who was lead author of the study.The tests are designed to detect the presence of other potentially harmful metals, such as zinc, cadmium and antimony, often found in soils with elevated lead levels, Wang added. We also evaluated if any of these metals are bioavailable; that is, if they are in a form that can be readily absorbed into the human body after they are ingested. Our tests showed that the isotopic fingerprint of the bioavailable lead is identical to the isotopic fingerprint of the soil source and therefore can be used to track human exposures,  he said.Exposure to elevated levels of bioavailable lead in soil has been linked to long-term health risks in children, including possible damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, learning and behavior problems, and hearing and speech problems. More than half of the lead we detected in a field test of 99 soil samples from Durham, N.C., was bioavailable,  Vengosh said.  So, although levels of contamination from historical sources are declining overall, serious risks from legacy lead contamination do remain. The new test could help doctors or public health officials track the source of lead found in children s blood or urine samples and identify where remediation efforts should be focused to prevent further exposures.Reference: Wang Z, Wade AM, Richter DD, Stapleton HM, Kaste JM, Vengosh A.

More than one in 300 people have LS but most don t know it   that s more than 2,300 new cases every year in the UK. LS patients are at high risk of bowel and endometrial cancers. The risk of urothelial cancer is less well recognised, with a lifetime risk of up to 28.5%, depending on which gene is involved. This means that those LS patients who have an underlying defect in the MSH2 gene are more than ten times as likely to get a potentially curable cancer in their urinary tract than the general population. Failure to screen for these cancers means that even after being diagnosed with the condition, one in 20 LS patients will die of urothelial cancer, often at a young age.Sir John Burn, Professor of Clinical Genetics at Newcastle University, UK, and Chair of Newcastle Hospitals, told the NCRI Festival:  People with Lynch Syndrome can benefit from screening programmes that enable cancers to be found at an early stage when they can be cured. LS carriers are at high risk of cancers of the bowel and womb, and screening is available for these using colonoscopy for the large bowel and ultrasound for the womb. Unfortunately, the urinary tract has been ignored because there are currently no cheap, non-invasive screening methods that can reliably detect tumours here. Cancer of the upper urinary tract is the third most common cancer associated with LS. Sir John and his colleagues, including Ms Rachel Phelps, a research PhD student in the Cancer Research UK-funded Cancer Prevention Group at Newcastle University, redesigned the Newcastle MSI-Plus Assay. This has recently become the standard test in North East England to find people with LS among those diagnosed with bowel cancer. MSI, which stands for microsatellite instability, shows that an important DNA repair system isn t working. Most LS patients are in this group. The test is being evaluated for national rollout. Dying cells within the human body shed small fragments of DNA into the surrounding tissues and circulation. These fragments are known as cell-free DNA and can be extracted from urine,  said Sir John.  LS is caused by inherited changes that affect the cells  ability to repair DNA damage. As a result, almost all cancers that develop within individuals with LS have a characteristic pattern of errors called microsatellite instability. Microsatellites are regions of repetitive DNA that often change their length if not repaired correctly. Our test uses this  signature  to identify DNA from tumour cells that are shedding into the urine. To see if the test could be used for urothelial cancers as well as bowel cancer, the researchers tested blood and urine samples in a LS patient who had been diagnosed with urothelial cancer in the upper urinary tract. They tested the urine before and after surgery to remove the tumour. Before surgery, the test detected a clear signal for microsatellite instability in the patient s urine. After removing the tumour, we tested the patient s urine again and the signal had disappeared. Nor was it present in blood samples,  said Sir John. A big question we need to answer now is how sensitive is our test? What proportion of urothelial cancers in LS patients shed DNA into urine, and how early in the course of the disease can this be detected? The earlier the cancer can be detected, the more likely it is to be treated successfully. The researchers are setting up a regional pilot study in which they will collect urine samples from LS patients between the ages of 40 and 75 who have a confirmed diagnosis of LS based on DNA testing their blood, either after they present with cancer or because they have an affected relative. Initially, the researchers will target patients with LS that is caused by a mutation in the MSH2 gene, as this is the group of patients with the greatest risk of cancer.Next year funding will be requested to roll out the urine screening test nationwide. To help establish the test s sensitivity, international researchers will be invited to send in urine samples from LS patients before they are treated for urothelial cancers.LS is caused by mutations affecting MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 genes.  Men with the MSH2 variant are at the greatest risk of developing cancer, with a higher than one in four risk of developing cancer of the kidney, ureter or bladder between the ages of 45 and 75. As we improve management of the high risk of bowel cancer, the importance of urothelial cancers rises as it accounts for 5% of all deaths in Lynch syndrome patients,  said Sir John.In a review of 10,243 urothelial cancers in England in 2018, the researchers found that only 43 patients (0.4%) had undergone testing for genetic variants that could identify whether or not they carried the variants for LS. We estimate that around 2% of urothelial cancers are in people with the LS genetic mutations and at least 5% should be tested to identify LS cases, so there is an urgent need to improve screening for this disease,  he concluded.Rob Jones, Chair of the NCRI Bladder & Renal Group and Professor of Clinical Cancer Research at the University of Glasgow, UK, who was not involved in the research, said:  Early detection is key to reducing cancer deaths. This is a particular challenge in cancers of the bladder and kidney because there are no simple screening tests. However, if we know a patient has Lynch Syndrome, we know they are at high risk, so should be targeted for screening. This important discovery means that these high-risk individuals could undergo a simple, regular urine test to check if they are developing one of these cancers, in the hope that it might be caught early with a better chance of cure.

These proteins   required for the earliest stage of the virus s life cycle, as soon as it enters a cell - are common to all coronaviruses and remain  highly conserved , so are unlikely to change or mutate. A vaccine that can induce T cells to recognise and target infected cells expressing these proteins, essential to the virus s success, would be more effective at eliminating early SARS-CoV-2, and may have the added benefit that they also recognise other coronaviruses that currently infect humans or that could in the future. Researchers say next generation vaccines could be developed to induce both memory T cells to target replication proteins and antibodies to target the spike protein.Professor Maini added:  T cells recognising the virus  replication machinery would provide an additional layer of protection to that provided by the spike-focused immunity that is generated by the already highly efficacious current vaccines. This dual-action vaccine would provide more flexibility against mutations, and because T cells can be incredibly long-lived, could also provide longer-lasting immunity. By expanding pre-existing T cells, such vaccines could help to stop the virus in its tracks at a very early stage.  ","Published: November 11, 2021"

The work was led by investigators at the Healey Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and is published in Molecular Neurobiology.ALS, a degenerative condition without a cure, attacks brain and spinal cord nerve cells to progressively affect individuals  ability to move, speak, eat, and even breathe. Previous studies have implicated dysfunction within mitochondria, which generate energy within cells, as playing an important role in the development of ALS. Also, studies in Alzheimer s disease have linked changes in mitochondrial function to interactions between an abnormal form of tau, which accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer s disease, and a mitochondrial protein called dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Piecing these bits of information together, Ghazaleh Sadri-Vakili, PhD, director of the NeuroEpigenetics Laboratory at the MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease and the Healey Center for ALS at MGH, and her colleagues examined whether interactions between this abnormal tau with DRP1 might also promote mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS, and whether reducing tau could be a novel and promising therapeutic approach to fight the disease.The team found that in brain tissue from deceased patients who had ALS, the abnormal form of tau is present, is located where tau is not normally found, and interacts with DRP1. When cells were grown in contact with deceased ALS patients  brain tissue that contained abnormal tau, the cells  mitochondria fragmented and oxidative stress increased. Importantly, reducing tau with a specific degrader reversed these effects, reducing mitochondrial fragmentation and lowering oxidative stress. We demonstrated for the first time that targeting tau with a new class of small molecules that selectively degrade it can reverse the ALS-induced changes in mitochondria s shape and function, highlighting tau as a potential therapeutic target,  says Sadri-Vakili.Reference: Petrozziello T, Bordt EA, Mills AN, et al.

Consumers increasingly demand product variety, so companies coat such snack foods with fruit and vegetable powders to enhance taste and sensory appeal.A new study from the University of Illinois explores the drying process of coated and uncoated apple chips using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to measure moisture content in real time. NIR technology greatly enhances the speed and accuracy of measurements, the researchers say.The purpose of coating is to make dried apple chips more functional and nutritional, as well as more appealing to eat, explains Ragya Kapoor, graduate student in Food Science and Human Nutrition (FSHN) at U of I and lead author on the paper. The idea is to get school-aged children to include apple chips in their diet. We use a cranberry powder coating to make the apple slices more attractive in terms of color and taste,  Kapoor says.  We dip the apple slices in a liquid-based solution for 60 seconds twice, and then conduct the hot air-drying operation. The researchers check the moisture content at various points throughout the drying process with miniature NIR spectroscopy to ensure the chips are dry enough.NIR technology offers many advantages compared to standard monitoring techniques, says Mohammed Kamruzzaman, assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE) at U of I and co-author on the paper.  In traditional methods, you take samples from the production for lab analysis. The process takes at least 24 hours, the samples are destroyed, and some analyses require harsh chemicals,  Kamruzzaman notes.NIR spectroscopy takes a few seconds, does not require the removal of samples, and uses no chemicals. NIR is highly accurate, it is very fast, does not destroy the samples, and does not use chemicals. It is sustainable, green technology. Traditional lab techniques need experts to handle the equipment and interpret the data. NIR is easy to use, and almost anyone can handle the instrument and take the measurement with just a few minutes of training. And the equipment is small and portable. NIR works by scanning the product with invisible light, Kamruzzaman explains.  With our eyes we can see the size, shape and color of food, but we cannot see the nutritional composition. The near-infrared light reads the chemical bonds in the food, so you can analyze any biological matter and determine features such as moisture content, protein, fat, fiber, or carbohydrates. The NIR spectroscopy will give you many data points; we extract the data and use machine learning to interpret the results,  he states. The combination of NIR spectroscopy and machine learning is very powerful. Kapoor, Kamruzzaman, and study co-authors Amir Malvandi, graduate student in ABE, and Hao Feng, professor of food and bioprocess engineering at U of I, had two main research goals. They wanted to explore edible coating on apple slices and test the use of NIR spectroscopy to monitor the drying process for coated versus uncoated slices. The moisture content is different for coated and uncoated samples, and we wanted to see how drying behavior differs for them. We found that with NIR technology we are able to differentiate between the two samples based solely on the difference in their composition,  Kapoor explains.The researchers say NIR spectroscopy can greatly enhance production efficiency.  NIR allows you to see your product s changing moisture content in real time. You can continuously monitor the drying process, observe the amount of dry matter, and decide the right time to stop,  Kamruzzaman states.Reference: Kapoor R, Malvandi A, Feng H, Kamruzzaman M.

The thickness of growth marks in primary (or  baby ) teeth may help identify children at risk for depression and other mental health disorders later in life, according to a ground-breaking investigation led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using data from a world-renowned health study in Bristol and published in JAMA Network Open.The team analysed 70 primary teeth collected from 70 children enrolled in the Children of the 90s study (also known as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) based at the University of Bristol. Parents donated primary teeth (specifically, the pointed teeth on each side of the front of the mouth known as canines) that naturally fell out of the mouths of children aged 5 to 7. The results of this study could one day lead to the development of a much-needed tool for identifying children who have been exposed to early-life adversity, which is a risk factor for psychological problems, allowing them to be monitored and guided towards preventive treatments, if necessary. The origin of this study traces back several years, when senior author Erin C. Dunn, ScD, MPH, learned about work in the field of anthropology that could help solve a longstanding problem in her own research. Dunn is a social and psychiatric epidemiologist and an investigator in MGH s Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit. She studies the effects of childhood adversity, which research suggests is responsible for up to one-third of all mental health disorders. Dunn is particularly interested in the timing of these adverse events and in uncovering whether there are sensitive periods during child development when exposure to adversity is particularly harmful. Yet Dunn notes that she and other scientists lack effective tools for measuring exposure to childhood adversity. Asking people (or their parents) about painful experiences in their early years is one method, but that s vulnerable to poor recall or reluctance to share difficult memories.  That s a hindrance for this field,  says Dunn. However, Dunn was intrigued to learn that anthropologists have long studied the teeth of people from past eras to learn about their lives.  Teeth create a permanent record of different kinds of life experiences,  she says. Exposure to sources of physical stress, such as poor nutrition or disease, can affect the formation of dental enamel and result in pronounced growth lines within teeth, called stress lines, which are similar to the rings in a tree that mark its age. Just as the thickness of tree growth rings can vary based on the climate surrounding the tree as it forms, tooth growth lines can also vary based on the environment and experiences a child has in utero and shortly thereafter, the time when teeth are forming. Thicker stress lines are thought to indicate more stressful life conditions. Dunn developed a hypothesis that the width of one variety in particular, called the neonatal line (NNL), might serve as an indicator of whether an infant s mother experienced high levels of psychological stress during pregnancy (when teeth are already forming) and in the early period following birth. To test this hypothesis, Dunn and two co-lead authors postdoctoral research fellow Rebecca V. Mountain, PhD, and data analyst Yiwen Zhu, MS, who were both in the Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit at the time of the study led a team that analysed the teeth. The width of the NNL was measured using microscopes. Mothers completed questionnaires during and shortly after pregnancy that asked about four factors that are known to affect child development: stressful events in the prenatal period, maternal history of psychological problems, neighbourhood quality (whether the poverty level was high or it was unsafe, for instance), and level of social support. Several clear patterns emerged. Children whose mothers had lifetime histories of severe depression or other psychiatric problems, as well as mothers who experienced depression or anxiety at 32 weeks of pregnancy, were more likely than other kids to have thicker NNLs. Meanwhile, children of mothers who received significant social support shortly after pregnancy tended to have thinner NNLs. These trends remained intact after the researchers controlled for other factors that are known to influence NNL width, including iron supplementation during pregnancy, gestational age (the time between conception and birth) and maternal obesity. No one is certain what causes the NNL to form, says Dunn, but it s possible that a mother experiencing anxiety or depression may produce more cortisol, the  stress hormone,  which interferes with the cells that create enamel. Systemic inflammation is another candidate, says Dunn, who hopes to study how the NNL forms. And if the findings of this research can be replicated in a larger study, she believes that the NNL and other tooth growth marks could be used in the future to identify children who have been exposed to early life adversity.  Then we can connect those kids to interventions,  says Dunn,  so we can prevent the onset of mental health disorders, and do that as early on in the lifespan as we possibly can.

Early laboratory research at IGFS has shown promising results using native Irish and UK seaweeds.Previous research in Australia and the USA generated headline results   up to 80% reductions in methane emissions from cattle given supplements from a red seaweed variety. These red seaweeds grow abundantly in warmer climates; however, they also contain high levels of bromoform   known to be damaging to the ozone layer. Seaweed indigenous to the UK and Ireland tends to be brown or green and does not contain bromoform. UK and Irish seaweeds are also rich in active compounds called phlorotannins, found in red wine and berries, which are anti-bacterial and improve immunity so could have additional health benefits for animals. Now the IGFS science is moving into the field, with trials on UK farms about to begin, using seaweed sourced from the Irish and North Seas as a feed supplement for cattle. One 3-year project is in partnership with the UK supermarket Morrisons and its network of British beef farmers who will facilitate farm trials. The project also includes the Agrifood and Biosciences Institute (AFBI), in Northern Ireland, as a partner. A second project sees IGFS and AFBI join a  2million, international project - led by Irish agency An Teagasc - to monitor the effects of seaweed in the diet of pasture-based livestock. Seaweed will be added to grass-based silage on farm trials involving dairy cows in NI from early 2022. As well as assessing methane emissions of the beef and dairy cattle, these projects will assess the nutritional value of a variety of homegrown seaweeds, their effects on animal productivity and meat quality. IGFS lead Sharon Huws, Professor of Animal Science and Microbiology within the School of Biological Sciences, said she expected the combined research to evidence a reduction in GHG emissions of at least 30%. She said:  The science is there. It s simply a matter of providing the necessary data and then implementing it. Using seaweed is a natural, sustainable way of reducing emissions and has great potential to be scaled up. There is no reason why we can t be farming seaweed   this would also protect the biodiversity of our shorelines.  If UK farmers are to meet a zero-carbon model, we really need to start putting this kind of research into practice. I hope IGFS and AFBI research can soon provide the necessary data and reassurance for governments to take forward.  Agriculture accounts for around 10% of all UK GHG emissions. Within this, beef farming is the most carbon-intensive, with methane, which cows produce as they digest, a major component. At a NI level, methane accounts for almost a quarter of GHG emissions, with 80% of that from agriculture. The above projects form part of the Queen's-AFBI Alliance   a strategic partnership between Queen s University and AFBI to maximise science and innovation capacity in NI to meet global challenges, such as carbon-neutral farming. Morrisons supermarket plans to be completely supplied by net-zero-carbon British farms by 2030. Sophie Throup, Head of Agriculture at Morrisons said:  As British farming's biggest customer, we re very mindful of our role in supporting and inspiring the farmers we work with to help them achieve goals in sustainable farming.  By supporting this research at Queen s and AFBI, we are trialling this natural approach to reducing environmental emissions and improving the quality of beef products.

The interactions between these molecules drive the cell s activities. But when scientists study these interactions, they use a highly simplified system that doesn t capture the complexity.Now, researchers at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) have created membraneless droplets in which the density and movement of molecules is similar to that in living cells. The method, described in Nature Communications, allows researchers to study cellular reactions in a way that more closely reflects how molecules behave in a living cell, said Professor Paola Laurino, of OIST s Protein Engineering and Evolution Unit, who led the work.One key class of molecules in a cell is a type of protein called an enzyme. Enzymes  job is to spark chemical reactions and regulate the rate at which they proceed. To study enzymes, researchers generally add them to a large volume of water-based buffer free of other molecules. Then they add the substrate   the protein upon which the enzyme acts   and watch the process run. In such a set-up, the buffer is extremely dilute.  It s a good system because the enzyme is purified and we know 100% what s inside,  Prof. Laurino said.  But we wanted to create a system that resembles the high macromolecular crowding of the cytosol and to see how this influences the activity of the enzymes. To create the droplets, Prof. Laurino and her collaborators, including scientists from ETH Z rich, Switzerland and Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, Germany, mixed a polymer called polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a protein in an aqueous buffer. The PEG creates crowding in the fluid, which pushes tiny protein-rich droplets to separate out in the buffer. Then, the scientists added an enzyme to the mixture, which diffuses into the droplets. Because their contents are so concentrated, the droplets acted as reaction chambers in which the enzymes could do their jobs. The researchers tracked how quickly the reaction progressed in the droplets, as well as the physical properties of the molecules inside them.When they added the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase to the solution, they found that the reaction occurs very efficiently that is, at a very high metabolic rate, similar to that observed in microorganisms.  That means we can have a lot of energy in our droplets,  said Dr. Mirco Dindo, a researcher in Prof. Laurino s laboratory.The researchers then switched to a different enzyme called urease, which drives a change in pH during reaction.  This created a pH gradient inside the droplets that generated a strong flow of molecules within it.  This phenomenon in cells is called cytoplasmic streaming, and it is a very important mechanism to mix and move things inside the cell,  said Dr. Dindo.  It s very interesting for us that we can reproduce it in the lab. Because the researchers know how much protein and enzyme they added to the buffer, it is still a well-controlled reaction.  It is a step closer to the real picture  of what happens in the cell, said Prof. Laurino.  Now we have a controlled system which reproduces some of the characteristics of the cytosol. We can use it to methodically study different enzymes to see how features like protein crowding and metabolic rate influence their activity. Reference: Testa A, Dindo M, Rebane AA, et al.

While these diets have purported health benefits, they can also lack essential nutrients, such as vitamins B12 and D3, if not well-planned or supplemented correctly. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Food Science & Technology have packed a strawberry-flavored gummy with these vitamins, formulating it without any animal products so vegans and vegetarians can reach their recommended daily allowances (RDA).Some essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12, are found exclusively in animal products, while others can be obtained from other sources. For example, humans can make vitamin D3 when their skin is exposed to sunlight, but many people aren t outside enough to meet the requirement for this vitamin. Therefore, it is primarily consumed through fish, eggs and organ meats, which are not eaten by vegans and some vegetarians. To avoid the pitfalls of vitamin deficiencies, people who adhere to plant-based diets often take supplements, but it s been challenging to put both vitamin B12 and vitamin D3 in one pill because of their differing solubilities. One solution could be to put them into emulsion-filled gels, such as gummy candies. Previous researchers have shown that pectin, a plant-based polysaccharide, can be used as a gelling agent in animal product-free foods. So, Samantha Pinho and colleagues wanted to see if they could use only plant-based ingredients, such as pectin, to produce a gummy candy enriched with vitamins B12 and D3 that would be acceptable to consumers. The researchers first made an emulsion, combining citrate buffer, inulin, gum arabic, flaxseed oil and vitamin D3, and separately made the pectin gel, dissolving a type of pectin, calcium chloride and vitamin B12 in a citrate buffer. Then, by rapidly stirring the emulsion into the pectin gel with sugar, the team produced an emulsion-filled gel. The gel became a reddish gummy material after it dried. To develop this into a suitable food product, the researchers added a natural strawberry flavor and molded the gel into half-inch-wide candies. In sensory tests, 120 untrained panelists gave the gummies high scores for taste, color, aroma and overall acceptability. About half of the panelists said they would buy the enriched gummy, with another 36% saying they might buy the product. The researchers say their results pave the way to make food products more nutritious. ReferenceGhiraldi M, Franco BG, Moraes ICF, Pinho SC.

The results illuminate one of the central problems of drug discovery and point to new strategies for solving it.Any class of drug can have side effects, but those that interact directly with cellular membranes have been especially problematic. ""Those drugs tend to affect many membrane proteins, and we suspected that there's some kind of non-specific mechanism at work,  said first author Dr. Radda Rusinova, assistant professor of research in physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine.  We wanted to see whether it could be linked to the cell membrane.""In the study, published Nov. 9 in PNAS, Dr. Rusinova and her colleagues used sensitive assays that allowed them to compare how different drugs affected the activities of two channel proteins that span membranes: the gramicidin ion channel and a potassium channel called KcsA. Gramicidin was used to measure the magnitude of drugs  effect on the membrane while KcsA reflected effects these drugs could have on typical membrane proteins.  They found that membrane-associated drugs can affect KcsA in at least three ways: by interacting directly with the proteins, by interfering with the proteins' structural connections to the membrane, or by causing broad changes in membrane characteristics such as thickness or elasticity.Changes in membrane characteristics have well-known effects on the gramicidin ion channel, an antibiotic isolated from bacteria that has long been used as a standard tool for studying such changes. ""Gramicidin is a probe essentially for changes in bilayer and membrane properties, and will report on the magnitude of the changes,"" said Dr. Rusinova. But we needed to go further to see how a more typical cell membrane protein would react,  Dr. Rusinova said. KcsA belongs to a class of proteins - potassium channels - that drive many aspects of cell physiology in everything from bacteria to humans, making it a good comparative probe.Results from the comparative assays revealed a more nuanced process than the straightforward model currently in use for explaining how membrane-binding drugs can affect membrane-spanning proteins.""The more data that Dr. Rusinova got, the more it became apparent that this simple model did not actually cover the full spectrum of effects that we saw,  said Dr. Olaf Andersen, professor of physiology and biophysics and senior author on the study. The investigators who are looking into molecules that can move into the cell membrane need to worry about at least three mechanisms for off-target effects,  Dr. Rusinova said.The news isn't all bad, though. In some cases, off-target effects at the cellular level cause no trouble to the organism, while in a few instances they can even be beneficial. To highlight the diversity of possible outcomes, Dr. Rusinova points to two of the drugs her team tested: amiodarone, a heart medication whose membrane-mediated effects actually boost its efficacy, and troglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug whose side effects included liver toxicity, ultimately forcing regulators to pull it from the market.The investigators hope to extend their work by developing more predictive models for such off-target effects.

Prof Wang, a world-renowned cancer researcher, is now hoping to recruit pancreatic cancer patients for a clinical trial of the drug.The University has launched a matched-funds campaign to seek support for the trial.Both these cancers share an insidious reputation for being two of the hardest to treat, with low survival rates and late diagnosis. Pancreatic cancer is extremely difficult to diagnose at an early stage because there are very few symptoms,  Prof Wang says. If it is caught early the malignant tumour can be surgically removed, but once it spreads into other organs it is lethal, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy only buy patients a little extra time. Auceliciclib has been designed to specifically target CDK4/6 enzymes, which have impaired function in pancreatic cancer, making it more effective with fewer side effects compared to the current therapy. Cancer doesn t always discriminate. Rich, healthy and young people, including those with access to the best medical treatment, can all fall victim to it,  says Prof Wang.Her team is also working on a novel biomarker for pancreatic cancer, hoping to undertake genetic profiling of patients to see if they have any common characteristics.The matched-funding campaign has been kickstarted with $350,000 from UniSA with the same amount needed by the end of the year to progress planning for the trial.Further information about the project and how to make donations is available at: https://giving.unisa.edu.au/causes/cancer-researchThis article has been republished from the following materials.

This represents a new target for drug development that could fill a major gap in care for depression.The research was led by Lisa Monteggia, professor of pharmacology and director of the Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Ege Kavalali, professor and acting chair of the Department of Pharmacology and William Stokes Professor of Experimental Therapeutics, and first author Kanzo Suzuki, research instructor in pharmacology. We examined the functional role of eEF2K, a protein involved in ketamine s rapid antidepressant action, in neurons,  Monteggia said.  We found that inducing similar synaptic effects independent of eEF2K resulted in rapid behavioral effects analogous to ketamine in preclinical models. This is the first study that directly examines whether the synaptic effects are producing the antidepressant behavioral activity of ketamine. Uncovering this pathway is a significant step toward understanding ketamine s action in the brain and exploring whether a new class of therapeutics targeting this pathway can provide rapid antidepressant treatment.","Published: November 11, 2021"

The new language model, developed by researchers at the University of Waterloo s David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, begins to fill that gap by enabling computers to analyze text in African languages for many useful tasks.The new neural network model, which the researchers have dubbed AfriBERTa, uses deep-learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art results for low-resource languages.The neural language model works specifically with 11 African languages, such as Amharic, Hausa, and Swahili, spoken collectively by more than 400 million people. It achieves output quality comparable to the best existing models despite learning from just one gigabyte of text, while other models require thousands of times more data. Pretrained language models have transformed the way computers process and analyze textual data for tasks ranging from machine translation to question answering,  said Kelechi Ogueji, a master s student in computer science at Waterloo.  Sadly, African languages have received little attention from the research community. One of the challenges is that neural networks are bewilderingly text- and computer-intensive to build. And unlike English, which has enormous quantities of available text, most of the 7,000 or so languages spoken worldwide can be characterized as low-resource, in that there is a lack of data available to feed data-hungry neural networks. Most of these models work using a technique known as pretraining. To accomplish this, the researcher presented the model with text where some of the words had been covered up or masked. The model then had to guess the masked words. By repeating this process, many billions of times, the model learns the statistical associations between words, which mimics human knowledge of language. Being able to pretrain models that are just as accurate for certain downstream tasks, but using vastly smaller amounts of data has many advantages,  said Jimmy Lin, the Cheriton Chair in Computer Science and Ogueji s advisor.  Needing less data to train the language model means that less computation is required and consequently lower carbon emissions associated with operating massive data centres. Smaller datasets also make data curation more practical, which is one approach to reduce the biases present in the models. This work takes a small but important step to bringing natural language processing capabilities to more than 1.3 billion people on the African continent. Reference: Ogueji K, Zhu Y, Lin J.

Scientific understanding of mindfulness goes beyond mere stress-relief and requires a willingness to engage with stressors, said Igor Grossmann, corresponding author of the project and a professor of social psychology at Waterloo.  It is, in fact, the engagement with stressors that ultimately results in stress relief. More specifically, mindfulness includes two main dimensions: awareness and acceptance. Grossmann and colleagues compared critics  claims to popular interpretations of mindfulness to evaluate how people understand and apply the concept in their daily lives. They found that in practice, most people conflate acceptance with passivity or avoidance.The research team conducted an extensive empirical project that examined the meaning of mindfulness in three parts: analyses of the semantic meaning of the term mindfulness in the English language, meta-analysis of the results from a widely used mindfulness measure, and empirical tests of association with markers of wisdom and effective emotion regulation.  While we found that people seem to conceptually understand that mindfulness involves engagement, the general public is not walking the talk. Our results suggest that laypeople may understand what awareness is, but the next step of acceptance may not be well understood   limiting potential for engaging with problems,  said Ellen Choi, lead author on the paper and an assistant professor of organizational behaviour at Ryerson University.Using social media as a topical example, Grossmann says that with algorithms curating increasingly hateful content, the ability to be mindful of others  perspectives has never been more critical.  Mindfulness might not provide an easy answer to the divisiveness that surrounds us, but an accurate understanding that includes the practice of acceptance may herald the re-emergence of sincere discussion and authentic connection.

The unpredictable nature of seizures is severely limiting. If seizures could be reliably forecast, people with epilepsy could alter their activities, take a fast-acting medication or turn up their neurostimulator to prevent a seizure or minimize its effects.A new study in Scientific Reports by Mayo Clinic researchers and international collaborators found patterns could be identified in patients who wear a special wristwatch monitoring device for six to 12 months, allowing about 30 minutes of warning before a seizure occurred. This worked well most of the time for five of six patients studied.""Just as a reliable weather forecast helps people plan their activities, so, too, could seizure forecasting help patients living with epilepsy adjust their plans if they knew a seizure was imminent,"" says Benjamin Brinkmann, Ph.D., an epilepsy scientist at Mayo Clinic and the senior author. ""This study using a wrist-worn device shows that providing reliable seizure forecasts for people living with epilepsy is possible without directly measuring brain activity.""In the study, patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and an implanted neurostimulation device that monitors electrical brain activity were given two wrist-worn recording devices and a tablet computer to upload data daily to cloud storage. Patients were instructed to wear one wristband while the other charged. They switched devices at a set time each day. They used the devices while participating in their normal activities, providing unique long-term data for the study.Information collected from the wearable device included electrical characteristics of the skin, body temperature, blood flow, heart rate and accelerometry data that tracks movement. Data were analyzed with a deep learning neural network approach to artificial intelligence, using an algorithm for time series and frequency analysis. Because the research participants already had an implanted deep brain stimulation device to treat their epilepsy, those neurostimulation devices were used to confirm seizures, allowing the team to measure the accuracy of forecasting by the wrist-worn devices.While the ability to forecast seizures previously has been shown using implanted brain devices, many patients don't want an invasive implant, Dr. Brinkmann notes.""We hope this research with wearable devices paves the way toward integrating seizure forecasting into clinical practice in the future,"" says Dr. Brinkmann, noting that this was a preliminary study and additional patients are recording data to expand this test.Reference: Nasseri M, Pal Attia T, Joseph B, et al.

The researchers said assessing a similar therapy should now be considered in people with Usher syndrome to see if this therapy might slow vision loss.Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F) causes deafness, progressive vision loss, and balance issues. Among Ashkenazi Jews, there is a 2% chance each person is a carrier of the Usher syndrome type 1F mutation, accounting for approximately 60% of their Usher syndrome type 1 cases. There are no approved therapies to prevent vision loss or restore vision in people with Usher syndrome. The drug we used in mice may provide a first step to improve eye health in people with Usher syndrome type 1F, said Zubair M. Ahmed, PhD, Professor of Otorhinolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery and Ophthalmology at UMSOM. Unfortunately, these drugs will not permanently cure loss of vision, as the drug does not repair damage or prevent degeneration of the eyes. However, it should improve the function of the tissue that these patients still have. First author of the study Saumil Sethna, PhD, Instructor in Otorhinolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery, said,  There are currently FDA-approved relatives of these retinoid drugs that are available and have passed clinical trials for safety, along with others that are in phase II clinical trials to treat other types of vision loss disorders. The team hopes to partner with one of the companies testing these drugs to launch a clinical trial in patients with Usher syndrome type 1F to see if it can help by preventing continuing vision loss. The identification of a key mutation in the PCDH15 gene nearly two decades ago was a critical breakthrough, facilitating the diagnosis of and carrier screening for a certain form of Usher syndrome, now resulting in the discovery of a potential preventative therapy for vision loss associated with the syndrome, said Thomas B. Friedman, Ph.D., Chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics at the NIDCD.  This work exemplifies the value of basic science research in driving the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. Prior to this study, only anecdotal data had been reported for Usher syndrome type 1F without any detailed data analysis of the worsening eye abnormalities over time. In the early 2000s, co-authors on this study, including Dr. Friedman at NIDCD, initiated an Usher syndrome natural history project and enrolled 13 study participants with Usher syndrome 1F to follow the natural progression of their accompanying blindness over 20 or more years. Dr. Ahmed was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Friedman s laboratory at the time. Wadih Zein, MD, an NEI Ophthalmologist with expertise in inherited retinal degenerations, served as principal investigator on the natural history study and summarized patient findings collected over the years. Based on analysis of vision tests, Dr. Zein found that the Usher syndrome type 1F mutation led to 50% of the study participants being legally blind by age 50.Separately, Dr. Ahmed created a mouse with an Usher syndrome found in 13 of Dr. Friedman s patients. This mutation in the gene PCDH15 leads to a shortened version of the protein protocadherin-15. However, the mechanism for how this mutant protocadherin-15 led to blindness was unknown. To unravel this, Dr. Friedman s Dr. Zein s, and Dr. Ahmed s teams decided to collaborate and compare the eye characteristics from humans and mice with this genetic condition that they had independently collected over the years.Comparing the Usher syndrome mouse model to healthy mice, Dr. Ahmed s team identified two functions of protocadherin-15. First, protocadherin-15 helps light-dark cycle proteins move back and forth between the different compartments of the light-detecting photoreceptors in the eye. Second, protocadherin-15 is also required for recycling molecules essential for functioning eye tissue, known as retinoids. The Usher syndrome type 1F mutant mice had reduced levels of retinoids in a certain kind of eye cell.Next, the researchers gave a retinoid drug to the Usher syndrome mice to see if it improved their vision. Retinoid injections into the Usher syndrome mice increased the electrical activity in the eyes of both younger and adult mice, indicating improved vision function. Aside from retinoid replacement, we can also think about developing more permanent therapies to treat or prevent blindness in people with Usher syndrome type 1F that may correct or replace the other functions of protocadherin-15, as well, said Dr. Ahmed.E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, UM Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean, University of Maryland School of Medicine said, People born with deafness, like individuals with Usher syndrome, rely on their other senses to communicate with and understand the world. Subsequent vision loss can pose significant challenges and can be isolating.

It is the reading and writing of this code   the  turning on  and  turning off  of specific genes in specific cells   that gives the cells their identities. Imagine, for example, the disastrous situation wherein the genes that encode the digestive enzymes of the stomach would be turned on in the retinal cells of the eye and begin to devour the surrounding tissue. One of the ways by which a cell turns off specific genes is by the reversible addition to the DNA of a minuscule chemical called a methyl group at the precise location of that specific gene.Scientists know that genes with more of this  DNA methylation  tend to be  turned off  and that genes with less of this methylation tend to be  turned on . But because until now it hasn t been possible to manipulate the levels of DNA methylation at specific genes, there remain many questions about what specific instances of DNA methylation do, how they contribute to normal cellular function, and how their dysregulation contributes to disease.In a recent study, published in Nature Communications, McGill University researchers demonstrate how they have managed to remove specific instances of DNA methylation at specific genes in mouse and human cells grown in culture by using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. They show that this DNA  de-methylation  activity can be targeted to anywhere in the DNA   any gene of interest   without editing the genetic code, and with no off-target activity at undesired locations in the DNA. The researchers also describe the approaches needed to produce complete removal of DNA methyl marks in the hopes that scientists around the world can use this new technique to start to discover actionable instances where genes that should be on have been turned off by DNA methylation   such as, for example, the insulin gene in diabetes   and use this technique to establish new paradigms for disease treatment.Reference: Sapozhnikov DM, Szyf M.

These energetic half-ounce birds hide thousands of food items every fall and rely on these hidden stores to get through harsh winters in the mountains of the West. To find these caches, chickadees use highly specialized spatial memory abilities. Although the genetic basis for spatial memory has been shown for humans and other mammals, direct evidence of that connection has never before been identified in birds.These findings were just published in the journal Current Biology. The research is a collaboration among scientists from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Oklahoma.""We all use spatial memory to navigate our environment,"" says lead author Carrie Branch at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. ""Without memory there s no learning and an organism would have to start from scratch for every task. So, it really is life and death for these birds to be able to remember where they stashed their food. We've been able to show that natural selection is shaping their ability to remember locations.""If natural selection (survival of the fittest) is shaping chickadee memory, certain criteria have to be met. There has to be variation in the trait: some chickadees are indeed better than others at re-finding their stores. There has to be a fitness advantage: birds that perform better on a spatial memory task are more likely to survive and produce offspring. Importantly, variation in the trait must have a genetic basis.""Environment does still matter a lot in terms of shaping behavior, but our work here suggests that genes may create the brain structures, and then experience and learning can build on top of that,"" Branch explains.How do you measure a chickadee s memory? Senior author Vladimir Pravosudov and his team at the University of Nevada, Reno, designed arrays of ""smart"" feeders to measure memory in a population of wild Mountain Chickadees in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Each feeder is equipped with radio frequency identification sensors. The 42 birds tested were fitted with leg tags the size of a grain of rice which give off an identifying signal. Each bird was assigned to one of the eight feeders in each array. The feeder sensor reads the bird's ID tag and if it's the matching feeder for that individual, a mechanism opens the door, and the bird gets a seed. The scientists then tracked how many tries it took before the birds consistently went to the correct feeder. ""This is an effective system to test spatial learning and memory in hundreds of wild chickadees in their natural environment,"" said Pravosudov. ""We have previously shown that even very small variations in performance are associated with differences in survival.To understand the connection between spatial memory and genetic architecture, co-authors Georgy Semenov and Scott Taylor at the University of Colorado Boulder, sequenced Mountain Chickadee genomes.""We used two methods to link genetic variation with spatial memory in chickadees,"" said Semenov. ""In the traditional genome-wide approach, we compared genetic data across individuals, from those that performed well on the spatial learning and memory task to those that performed poorly. We did the same comparison with a new machine learning algorithm. Both methods showed hundreds of differences associated with spatial memory. Many of the variations in the genomes turned up in areas known to be associated with learning, memory, and neuron development in the brain.""The authors say many questions remain about the influence of spatial memory itself, including what role it may play in the female s choice of a mate.Reference: Branch CL, Semenov GA, Wagner DN, et al.

What to do with all these retired electric vehicle batteries is going to be a huge issue,  said Fengqi You, professor in energy systems engineering at Cornell, who used advanced modeling to examine environmental and economic tradeoffs in how batteries are built, used and recycled.The life-cycle analysis, which considered a variety of options for battery materials and technologies, is detailed in research published in Science Advances. Lithium-ion batteries are designed today for performance and not for recycling or second life,  said You, noting that electric vehicle batteries typically last five to 12 years before they lose the energy capacity needed to power a vehicle.  There s very little discussion right now about these environmental dimensions of improving battery design for recycling or reuse. One finding is that a battery s chemistry can affect its overall environmental impact. For instance, cobalt is a common battery material that, when mined, is energy-intensive and damaging to the environment. Replacing cobalt with nickel can alleviate those concerns, but most life cycle scenarios reveal there are tradeoffs. Cobalt s presence, even at relatively small amounts, in a battery cathode leads to a much less oxidative environment for other components, extending the lifespan of the battery and increasing options for second-life use and materials recycling,  said Lynden Archer, dean of engineering at Cornell and co-author of the study.But, Archer said, cobalt s expense   and association with exploitative child labor   has led the material to be  conventionally thought of as undesirable in the low-cost batteries needed for an  electrify-everything  future. The analysis also found that an electric vehicle battery s overall carbon footprint can be reduced by up to 17% if it can be reused before it is recycled. One choice for battery reuse is power stations that store wind and solar energy. Such energy storage is growing in demand and can make use of retired batteries with reduced energy capacity. And as the share of renewable energy contributing to the power grid grows, a reused battery s carbon footprint shrinks by around a quarter.Most of today s recycling facilities have difficulty breaking apart heavily fortified car batteries and recovering the raw materials within. Yanqiu Tao, a doctoral student who co-authored the study, said policymakers should consider ways to incentivize recycling techniques that optimize the battery s sustainability. In the study we consider the commonly used graphite as the anode-active material, which is hard to recycle and emits carbon dioxide when it s combusted,  Tao said.  If policymakers can promote graphite separation or emerging recycling methods, it would reduce the environmental impact. Reference: Tao Y, Rahn CD, Archer LA, You F.

Half of the patients had lived with anxiety for at least ten years. Their average age was 39 years, and 70 percent were women.Through drawing of lots, participants were assigned to group exercise sessions, either moderate or strenuous, for 12 weeks. The results show that their anxiety symptoms were significantly alleviated even when the anxiety was a chronic condition, compared with a control group who received advice on physical activity according to public health recommendations.Most individuals in the treatment groups went from a baseline level of moderate to high anxiety to a low anxiety level after the 12-week program. For those who exercised at relatively low intensity, the chance of improvement in terms of anxiety symptoms rose by a factor of 3.62. The corresponding factor for those who exercised at higher intensity was 4.88. Participants had no knowledge of the physical training or counseling people outside their own group were receiving. There was a significant intensity trend for improvement   that is, the more intensely they exercised, the more their anxiety symptoms improved,  states Malin Henriksson, doctoral student at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, specialist in general medicine in the Halland Region, and the study's first author.

However, unlike other types of white blood cells, neutrophils are extremely short-lived and cannot be frozen and thawed like other immune cells, making them extremely difficult to examine, said study lead Shokrollah Elahi. Neutrophils live for hours to a day or two maximum,  Elahi said.  The body produces a lot of neutrophils, and they do their job and then they die and have to be regenerated in the bone marrow. But despite the fact that neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the blood circulation, their role in the context of HIV has not been very well defined. In the study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, Elahi and his team examined the fresh blood of 116 people living with HIV and 60 individuals without the virus. They ran comprehensive sequencing on all the genes expressed in the neutrophils from both groups to determine any differences between them. We found that not all HIV-infected individuals have similar types of neutrophils,  said Elahi.  As the HIV disease progresses, neutrophils become more activated and more potent, and in turn activate the body s T cells, which likely causes some of the problems associated with HIV infection such as inflammation and rapid aging. Elahi, a member of the Women and Children s Health Research Institute, the Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta and the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, said neutrophils act like an early alarm system. When they detect a dangerous entity such as an invading microbe, they release proteins to signal other immune cells to the danger. This activation can be high or low, or more or less potent, depending on the severity of the danger and the reaction of other immune cells.","Published: November 10, 2021"

Adding water to the reaction can address certain challenges, but it also complicates the process. Now a team at the U.S. Department of Energy s Brookhaven National Laboratory has identified a new approach using a common industrial catalyst that can complete the conversion effectively both with and without water. The findings, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, suggest strategies for improving catalysts for the water-free conversion. Water is like a trick that people have been using for a long time to get this reaction going and it definitely helps. It improves the selectivity and it aids the ability to extract the methanol,  said Jos  Rodriguez, a leader of Brookhaven Lab s Catalysis Group, who has an adjunct appointment at Stony Brook University (SBU) in the departments of Chemistry and Materials Science and Chemical Engineering. As shown in a recent related study by this group, adding water keeps the reaction from running away to transform the desired product, methanol, into carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). But adding water also adds complexity and cost. Plus, at the temperatures and in the amounts required for this reaction, the water exists as large quantities of steam, which would have to be controlled in an industrial setting. So, the Brookhaven team set out to explore if they could run the reaction without water by changing the catalyst the substance that brings the reactants together and helps guide them along a particular reaction pathway.The new paper describes how a common copper-zinc oxide catalyst can steer the reaction along different pathways depending on whether water is present.  Copper-zinc oxide is a commercial catalyst that is readily available and not too expensive,  said Sanjaya Senanayake, one of the study co-authors.  We wanted to see whether it might work for methane-to-methanol conversion.  According to their study results, copper-zinc oxide has the best selectivity of any catalyst tested for this reaction without the addition of water about 30%. That means methanol, the desired product (instead of CO or CO2), makes up 30% of the products of the reaction when it runs without water. (When run with water, the copper-zinc oxide catalyst had 80% selectivity for methanol production.) For comparison, the team s earlier studies of this reaction using a cerium oxide catalyst produced almost no methanol without water.  One of the big challenges of this methanol synthesis reaction in the presence of just methane and oxygen (and no water) is overoxidation the transformation of the methanol into carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide,  said study co-author Ping Liu. She noted how the earlier studies of the cerium catalyst revealed how water helped to block that overoxidation by removing the produced methanol before it could be further transformed. To find out how the copper-zinc catalyst achieves 80 and 30 percent specificity with and without water, respectively, the team conducted detailed studies using a variety of techniques that worked hand-in-hand with theoretical calculations to reveal crucial details of the reaction mechanism. Two of our SBU graduate students, Ivan Orozco and Feng Zhang, and one of our postdocs, Zongyuan Liu, worked with Slavom r Nem k, a long-time collaborator, at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) a DOE Office of Science user facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to find evidence of methanol formation on the surface of the catalyst,  Senanayake said.  The technique, called  ambient-pressure x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS),  uses ALS s bright beams of x-rays to detect the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and the metal-oxygen combinations at the active sites of the catalyst as the reaction is taking place. The scientists studied the samples under different reaction conditions. They varied the amount of methane, oxygen, and water (including no water), as well as the pressure and temperature tracking which chemical species were present at different stages of the reaction. Each compound has a unique  chemical fingerprint,  so we can see how these reactants are transformed into intermediates and final products under different conditions,  Rodriguez said. The XPS fingerprints clearly showed that methanol was forming. But to find out exactly which sites on the catalyst were involved in the reactions, the team turned to theoretical modeling.The team used a scanning tunneling microscope in Brookhaven s Chemistry Department to study the atomic-level structure of the catalyst, and then used those structural details to build computational models of the atomic arrangements.  There are many diverse active sites on the surface of the catalyst,  said Liu. To understand those sites and determine whether and how they interacted with the reactants and products, another SBU graduate student Erwei Huang and Liu ran  density functional theory  (DFT) calculations and kinetic modeling on computing clusters at Brookhaven Lab s Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. DFT calculations identify how the reactants (methane, oxygen, and water) evolve as they interact with one another and the catalyst, as well as how much energy it takes to get from one atomic arrangement to the next. Kinetic modeling tries out all the possible pathways for those transformations to take place under reaction conditions. This combination of techniques allowed the team to identify the most energy-efficient (and therefore most likely) path for how methane is transformed into methanol with and without water. The results included details about which catalytic sites were involved and which intermediates should be present at different stages during the reaction. The team then verified these catalytic interactions and intermediates with  chemical fingerprinting  measurements at ALS.Together, the data indicate that the reaction proceeds along two different pathways involving two different sites of the copper-zinc-oxide catalyst one for the reaction with water and one for the reaction without water.  The particular configuration of active sites for the reaction with water is different from the configuration without water, and the mechanism is different, too it s practically two different processes,  Rodriguez said. But in both cases, even without water,  the binding between the methanol and the catalyst is strong enough to allow the methanol to form from methane, but weak enough to enable the methanol to come off the surface as a gas before it is further oxidized to CO or CO2,  Liu said.  As soon as the methanol goes into the gas phase you can condense the whole thing and then separate liquid methanol,  Rodriguez said. That quick  desorption  of methanol from the surface of the catalyst, which keeps the methanol from reacting further with oxygen, also eliminates a potentially explosive step. The team is already using their new knowledge of the reaction mechanisms to look for ways to further improve the catalyst. Their goal is to achieve a selectivity of at least 60-70% without water.  The atomic level understanding is much more advanced than what we ve ever had before. We know really atom by atom that copper zinc oxide is much better for the preferred no-water reaction condition,  Senanayake said. In the next step, DFT calculations and kinetic modeling will start to test out other compositions, aiming to further improve the methane conversion and methanol selectivity.  We ll use the theory to narrow down the candidates based on the mechanistic understanding acquired from the previous studies,  Liu said.  Then the experimentalists will do the synthesis and characterization studies to see if these other compositions will work. ReferenceHuang E et al.

CO2 can, for example, be captured from large industrial companies and from incineration plants.However, like all other technologies, carbon capture leaves its own imprint on the outside world. DTU Environment has therefore conducted a life cycle analysis, which has systematically assessed the impact from a possible carbon capture plant installed at the Amager Bakke incineration plant in Copenhagen. Not just from the pilot plant currently installed by DTU, but from a plant that would cover the entire Amager Bakke facility. The assessment has made it possible to examine the advantages and disadvantages of the carbon capture plant from the point of view of the climate impact. Amager Bakke incineration plant burns, among other things, household waste that has not been sorted for recycling. The energy generated is used to produce electricity and heat. During incineration, CO2 is released from the waste, which includes food waste and textiles.The focus of the life cycle assessment has been to investigate the impact of the carbon capture plant on the energy generated by the incineration plant as well as other environmental impacts. The analysis looked at a number of waste composition scenarios.  Carbon capture reduces CO2 emissions from the incineration plant. However, electricity production is reduced by approx. 50 per cent. For some incineration plants, this would have a considerable impact on their overall CO2 accounts, but at Amager Bakke, the steam from the carbon capture in fact increases the heat output utilized in the district heating system by 20 per cent. The overall net energy efficiency is thus not affected, but there is a shift from less electricity to more heat,  explains Assistant Professor Valentina Bisinella, DTU Environment, who carried out the analysis.The other drawbacks for the climate highlighted by the analysis are primarily associated with the transport and storage of the captured CO2 in the subsoil. These activities may cause unintentional emissions of the greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, while sea transport also causes CO2 emissions.  Even when factoring in the CO2 emissions that may occur both during transport and storage in the subsoil, carbon capture clearly results in net climate benefits,  says Valentina Bisinella. In the past, Valentina Bisinella has conducted life cycle analyses of incineration plants across Europe, leading to the same overall conclusions. Those analyses also included the recycling of the captured CO2, which currently only takes place at three incineration plants in the world, two in the Netherlands and one in Japan. Use of the captured CO2 to produce, for example, chemicals and fuels such as methanol and DME would naturally increase the overall climate gain further, provided there is access to green electricity. Such use may also be an option for Amager Bakke in the future.ReferenceBisinella V et al.

This would allow patients to receive personalised treatment and could avoid some people experiencing side effects from a treatment that may not work for them. Although immunotherapy has transformed survival for a subset of cancer patients, durable treatment effects are still only seen in a minority,  says Zhihui Wang, Associate Research Professor of Mathematics in Medicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, US, and one of the co-first and co-senior authors of the study.  Mathematical models can qualitatively or quantitatively discern the underlying complex biological and physical processes in cancer which may otherwise be missed and can help optimise treatment approaches. We wanted to demonstrate how standard clinical measures, such as images from scans and analysis of tissue biopsies, could be used to build a model that predicts who might benefit from immunotherapy. The team focused on looking at how patients respond to a class of immunotherapy drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors. They designed a model to determine changes in relative tumour mass over time after patients start their checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The change in tumour mass is influenced by a complex biological cross-talk between the immune system and cancer cells. They simplified this cross-talk by focusing on three measurements that can be combined into an equation: the ability of malignant tumour cells to grow, the ability of immune cells to kill cancer cells within the tumour environment and the potential effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy treatment.They first calibrated this model using clinical data from clinical trials evaluating a class of checkpoint inhibitors that specifically target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. The trials measured changes in tumour volumes over time in 189 patients with common types of tumours.The team then checked the results from this model calibration against data from an additional group of 64 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with an immunotherapy drug called pembrolizumab.They found that the ratio of immune to tumour cells within the tumour environment, and the potential effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitor treatment, were both significantly different between responding versus non-responding patients. Importantly, the model correctly predicted the treatment response that occurred in 81.4% of patients using only tumour volume measurements and within two months of treatment initiation. This high sensitivity of the model to predict a response at early time points (less than 60 days) suggests that the model could provide valuable early identification of cancer patients most likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibition therapy. There were also minimal false-negative results from the model related to the group of patients predicted to receive the least benefit from therapy. This is important to ensure the model does not wrongly predict that a patient will not benefit from a treatment that might be effective. The model introduced here retrospectively investigates the molecular, cellular and biophysical mechanisms behind a patient s individual response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,  concludes Eugene Koay, Associate Professor at the Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and a co-senior author of the study.  We have demonstrated that this model can reliably use information from routine scans or tissue biopsy analysis, which are easily obtainable as early as the start of treatment. Together, these measurements may serve as early and accurate indicators of the effectiveness of immunotherapy treatment on an individual patient basis. Reference: Butner JD, Martin GV, Wang Z, et al.

These are transported via the bloodstream to various organs in the body and even absorbed and processed by nerve cells in the brain. This has now been shown for the first time by a team of researchers from Goethe University, FAU (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg) and the University of California in San Francisco. The newly established research method will help to better understand the influence of intestinal bacteria on diseases and could support the development of innovative forms of drug or vaccine delivery.In the human body, bacteria are in the majority: According to estimates, there are 1.3 bacterial cells for each human cell. Our bacteria are correspondingly superior to us in their genetic diversity. All intestinal bacteria together   the intestine s microbiome   have 150 times as many genes as humans. The intestinal bacteria s metabolic products have a variety of effects on our body: For example, they train our immune cells and contribute to their maturation, they control metabolic processes in the body and how often intestinal mucosa cells renew themselves. It is highly probable that changes in the microbiome s composition contribute to the development and course of diseases, e.g. neurological disorders or cancer. The bacterial metabolites act on the cells of the intestinal mucosa via direct contact. However, how such bacterial substances travel to peripheral organs, such as the liver, kidney or brain, had not yet been explained. It was assumed that small capsules (membrane vesicles), released by bacteria into their environment during normal growth or as a reaction to stress and filled with bacterial lipids, proteins or also hereditary RNA molecules, were the means of transport. An international research team led by Dr Stefan Momma from the Neuroscience Centre of Goethe University, Professor Claudia G nther from FAU (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg) and Professor Robert Raffai from the University of California has now investigated in mice how bacteria distribute their metabolic products in such vesicles. For this purpose, the researchers colonized the intestines of mice with E. coli bacteria, which produced a specific type of gene scissors (Cre) and released these into their environment via vesicles. The mice cells contained a gene for a red fluorescent protein, which could be activated by the Cre gene scissors (Cre/LoxP system). The result: In the subsequent examination of the mouse tissue, the bacterial vesicles had been absorbed by individual cells in the intestine, liver, spleen, heart and kidneys as well as by immune cells. Consequently, functional Cre contained in the vesicles could enter the cells and lead to the expression of the red marker protein. Even individual nerve cells in the brain glowed red. Stefan Momma:  Particularly impressive is the fact that the bacteria s vesicles can also overcome the blood-brain barrier and in this way enter the brain   which is otherwise more or less hermetically sealed. And that the bioactive bacterial substances were absorbed by stem cells in the intestinal mucosa shows us that intestinal bacteria can possibly even permanently change its properties.  The fluorescence images indicate, says Momma, that the vesicles were probably distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream.  The further study of these communication pathways from the bacterial kingdom to individual mammalian cells will not only improve our understanding of conditions such as autoimmune diseases or cancer, in which the microbiome quite obviously plays a significant role. Such vesicles are also extremely interesting as a new method to deliver drugs or develop vaccines, or as biomarkers that point to a pathological change in the microbiome. ReferenceBittel M et al.

The findings, published online Aug. 13 in npj Breast Cancer, could help explain why obese patients with breast cancer often experience worse outcomes, and may eventually lead to more effective treatments for this group. Obese women may not get the full benefit of tamoxifen, one of the most widely prescribed medications for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treatment and prevention,  says study leader Dipali Sharma, Ph.D., professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  With obesity increasing worldwide and 40% of the U.S. population already obese, there are a lot of breast cancer patients at risk for poor outcomes.  Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer, and relies on the hormone estrogen to grow and spread. As a result, it usually responds well to hormone therapies that interfere with the body s production of estrogen.Researchers have long known that obesity is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, as well as larger tumors, more metastatic progression, a higher risk of recurrence and worse overall survival. However, Sharma says, the reasons for these connections have been unclear.She and her colleagues suspected that some of these poor outcomes may be due to a worse response to cancer therapies, an effect influenced by endocrine molecules   cytokines   produced by fat cells. They focused on leptin in particular, a fat-secreted hormone that plays a role in producing feelings of satiety and has been linked to cancer growth and progression.To see whether leptin might affect therapeutic response, the researchers fed mice a high-fat diet for eight weeks, causing these animals to become obese   which increased the animals  circulating leptin levels. They then implanted human estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, a type responsible for nearly 70% of breast cancer cases, in the mammary pads of the obese mice and in lean animals.When Sharma and her team gave these mice tamoxifen, the lean animals  tumors responded well, regressing quickly. But the obese animals  tumors didn t shrink; rather, they responded as if they hadn t been treated at all. Administering leptin along with tamoxifen caused the same poor response in lean animals, suggesting that leptin was somehow negating tamoxifen s cancer-fighting effects.Searching for a mechanism for this phenomenon, Sharma and her colleagues found that leptin appears to activate the estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells, even when estrogen isn t present, in turn setting off a cascade of cancer-promoting genes. One key gene in this cascade is Med1, which associates with dozens of obesity-related genes. When the researchers silenced this gene, rendering it nonfunctioning, implanted tumors responded to tamoxifen even in the presence of leptin. The researchers were able to achieve this same effect by giving mice another fat-secreted molecule called adiponectin or a compound called honokiol that s derived from magnolia trees. Both agents target Med1 and were previously known to have a protective effect on cancers.Sharma says interventions that can lower leptin, such as losing weight, or target Med1, such as adiponectin or honokiol, could eventually be used to improve tamoxifen s success in obese patients with breast cancer. She and her team are studying some of these potential treatments in mice, a step toward testing them in human clinical trials.Reference: Nagalingam A, Siddharth S, Parida S, et al.

Then researchers identified safety concerns with the experimental drug that have implications for current clinical trials in adults. The study appears today in Nature Communications.CX-5461 is a small molecule that has been studied for more than a decade. It has been widely described as a first-in-human inhibitor of the enzyme RNA polymerase 1. Phase II clinical trials of CX-5461 are underway in adults with leukemia, lymphoma and breast cancer.St. Jude researchers demonstrated in this study that CX-5461 killed neuroblastoma tumor cells primarily by targeting and disrupting the activity of the enzyme topoisomerase II beta (TOP2 ) and not by inhibiting RNA polymerase 1. These new details of CX-5461 s mechanism of action in cancer treatment have potentially important safety implications for patients,  said Paul Geeleher, Ph.D., St. Jude Department of Computational Biology.

However, some patients are resistant or acquire resistance to docetaxel.Ms Caitlin Davies, a PhD research student at Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK, and colleagues investigated if it would be possible to identify docetaxel resistance and predict survival from the number and types of cancer cells that have detached from the tumour and entered the bloodstream; these are called circulating cancer cells or CTCs.They took blood samples from 56 patients with advanced prostate cancer who were being treated at St Bartholomew s Hospital, London. The samples were taken before they started docetaxel treatment, after their first dose of chemotherapy, before their fifth dose, and once they d finished all doses   a period of approximately six to eight months. Depending on the availability of the patients, the number of samples per patient ranged from two to four. A total of 205 samples were available for analysis. Our ability to collect and analyse CTCs before, during and after treatment meant that we could monitor changes in CTCs in response to treatment,  said Ms Davies.The researchers used a blood filtration system called Parsortix to identify CTCs based on their larger size compared to other components in the blood, such as white blood cells. It also captures different subtypes of CTCs. We then looked for patterns in the data from men who responded or did not, or whose disease progressed sooner than others after treatment. Using these patterns, we can apply them to future patients with the goal to predict whether they will respond to therapy and pre-emptively decide on the best course of action that will have maximal benefit. For instance, an increase in CTC numbers may indicate a lack of response to treatment. Furthermore, by monitoring the appearance of potentially drug-resistant CTCs, we can change treatment tactics early on and in a patient-personalised and timely manner. The researchers found that men were less likely to respond to docetaxel, their disease was more likely to recur or progress within three months, and they were more likely to die within 18 months if more than six CTCs per 7.5mL of blood were detected before their first docetaxel dose. This compared to progression-free survival of 17 months and an overall survival time of three years for men with fewer than six CTCs detected per 7.5mL of blood.Among the several subtypes of CTCs, the researchers found that having more than one  classic  type of CTC (epithelial, cytokeratin positive cells or E-CTCs) before docetaxel treatment predicted that the disease would progress within two months following treatment, instead of more than a year later. It also predicted survival: nine months versus 32 months for those without E-CTCs.High numbers of CTCs towards the end of treatment predicted a shorter time to disease progression and death. The disease was eight times more likely to progress within six months in patients who showed an increase in another type of CTC (CTCs without epithelial features) than those who did not have an increase. This insight into how CTC dynamics lead to reduced progression-free and survival times is vital for clinicians. It will enable them to make early changes of treatment from docetaxel to an alternative, which may significantly improve patients  chances of long-term survival,  said Ms Davies.The researchers also discovered that a protein encoded by a gene called KLK2 was significantly better at predicting time to disease progression and death than the current gold standard protein, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is encoded by the KLK3 gene. There were high levels of the KLK2 gene expression in patients who did not respond to docetaxel, and this elevated expression was also associated with a shorter time to disease progression and death. These are important findings as they highlight KLK2 as a possible alternative and better biomarker for prostate cancer prognosis,  said Ms Davies.  Analysis of CTC gene expression and detection of genes associated with resistance to docetaxel may aid the development of a new generation of therapies. This way of testing for CTCs in blood samples is known as liquid biopsy.  It is minimally invasive, painless and easily repeatable, so patients can avoid undergoing painful tissue biopsies. It takes a matter of minutes for the patient, and we can get results within two to three days, whereas a tissue biopsy can take up to ten days. Liquid biopsies are very cost-effective compared to tissue biopsy, CT scans or MRI,  said Ms Davies.She concluded:  Although these results are highly promising, they require further validation in a larger group of patients, perhaps in a clinical trial.""The researchers are continuing to research and validate the use of CTCs as biomarkers for prostate cancer. They are investigating a number of genes in CTCs that may be involved in resistance to docetaxel in order to understand the mechanisms and identify new targets for anti-cancer drugs.Hashim Ahmed, Chair of the NCRI Prostate Group and Professor of Urology at Imperial College London, UK, who was not involved in the research, said:  These are promising results and have the potential to change clinical practice, if they are confirmed by further research. Assessing the responsiveness of an individual patient s tumour to docetaxel treatment by means of blood tests will enable clinicians to personalise cancer treatment more easily and effectively, without the patient having to undergo invasive procedures such as tissue biopsies. It could also help to avoid patients undergoing unpleasant systemic treatments that are going to be unsuccessful.

Results from a new study in cells from patients with type 2 diabetes and mice show that this effect is caused by low levels of an important molecule in the red blood cells. The study by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden has been published in the journal Diabetes.It is well known that patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Overtime type 2 diabetes may damage blood vessels, which could lead to life-threatening complications such as heart attack and stroke. However, the disease mechanisms underlying cardiovascular injury in type 2 diabetes are largely unknown and there is currently a lack of treatments to prevent such injuries.In recent years, research has shown that the red blood cells, whose most important job is to transport oxygen to bodily organs, become dysfunctional in type 2 diabetes and can act as mediators of vascular complications. In the current study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have in cells from patients with type 2 diabetes and mice examined which molecular changes in the red blood cells could explain these harmful effects in type 2 diabetes.The researchers found that levels of the small molecule microRNA-210 were markedly reduced in red blood cells from 36 patients with type 2 diabetes compared with red blood cells of 32 healthy subjects. Micro-RNAs belong to a group of molecules that serve as regulators of vascular function in diabetes and other conditions. The reduction in microRNA-210 caused alterations in specific vascular protein levels, and impaired blood vessel endothelial cell function. In laboratory experiments, restoration of microRNA-210 levels in red blood cells prevented the development of vascular injury via specific molecular changes. The findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized cause of vascular injury in type 2 diabetes,  says Zhichao Zhou, researcher at the Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, who conducted the study in collaboration with among others Professor John Pernow at the same department.  We hope that the results will pave the way for new therapies that increase red blood cell microRNA-210 levels and thereby prevent vascular injury in patients with type 2 diabetes.

When they get too short, they tell the cell to stop dividing, thus preventing damage to its DNA. Made dormant, the cell enters senescence.For this model to be valid, the inactivation of a single telomere should be sufficient to activate the senescence program. Rodier s laboratory and many others had already observed that several dysfunctional telomeres were necessary. What s most surprising is that, before really entering senescence, the cells divide one last time,  said Rodier.  In fact, the cell division caused by telomere dysfunction is so unstable that it ends up creating genetic defects. Contrary to what was believed, senescent cells have an abnormal genome. That s what we show in our study. ","Published: November 10, 2021"

Nevertheless, the search for the cause and the assessment of the effects is highly complex and difficult. J rg Menche, Adjunct Principal Investigator at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Professor at the University of Vienna and Research Group Leader at the Max Perutz Labs (a joint venture of the University of Vienna and the Medical University of Vienna), and his team have now developed a multiplex network that maps all genes and their interactions on multiple levels and improves the identification of genetic defects and the assessment of their consequences.In contrast to common diseases, which are usually characterized by a complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors, rare diseases can often be traced back to a single defective gene. Targeted decoding and analysis of a gene defect and its phenotypic consequences therefore provides important information for understanding underlying mechanisms in the body and helps in choosing targeted treatment strategies. However, the individual search for the cause of disease is usually lengthy and costly. A new, systematic approach to the study of rare, uncharacterized diseases using a so-called multiplex network is now presented by the research group of network scientist J rg Menche at CeMM and the Max Perutz Labs in their latest study, published today in the journal Nature Communications. Three times higher probability of identifying causative genetic defectMenche's research group has been dedicated for several years to better understanding genetic interactions using molecular network analysis to improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. For their current study, first author Pisanu Buphamalai, a CeMM PhD student in Menche's research group, built a multilayer network mapping more than 20 million gene relationships with information ranging from protein interactions to phenotypic similarities. To do this, the scientist integrated a comprehensive dataset of more than 3,700 rare diseases with a known genetic basis. Study leader Menche explains, ""The multiplex network integrates different network layers that map different levels of the biological organization of our body, from the genome to the transcriptome, proteome and phenotype. By mapping protein interactions and mechanisms, we can also better characterize those proteins whose roles in diseases were previously unknown and thus track down gene defects more quickly."" Pisanu Buphamalai adds, ""We are guided by the interactions among proteins at both physical and functional levels. This allows us to draw conclusions about the potential defective gene as well as associated effects. Our network approach increases the probability of finding the crucial gene aberration threefold compared to when these networks are considered separately.""Progress for network medicine: more accurate analysis, better prognosisOn the one hand, the multiplex network's modular design makes it possible to quantify the impact of a particular rare disease on a specific level of biological organization. This means determining whether certain cells, tissue forms, organs, etc. are particularly affected by a genetic defect. On the other hand, the importance of certain molecular processes for a disease can also be measured. ""It is precisely because of its complexity, the linking of molecular sequences and processes, that our multiplex network is significantly more powerful and successful than looking at each network individually. It also makes it easier to make predictions about possible consequences of the genetic defect,"" Menche says. The network was successfully tested for functionality in collaboration with Vanja Nagy, Principal Investigator at the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases and CeMM Adjunct Principal Investigator, using data from patients with neurological diseases whose underlying genetic defect was already known. ""Our study shows how a huge dataset can be used in the context of network medicine to address several practical and conceptual challenges in rare disease research to improve diagnosis and treatment for the benefit of patients,"" Menche says.Reference: Buphamalai P, Kokotovic T, Nagy V, Menche J.

Scientific understanding of mindfulness goes beyond mere stress-relief and requires a willingness to engage with stressors,  said Igor Grossmann, corresponding author of the project and a professor of social psychology at Waterloo.  It is, in fact, the engagement with stressors that ultimately results in stress relief. More specifically, mindfulness includes two main dimensions: awareness and acceptance. Grossmann and colleagues compared critics  claims to popular interpretations of mindfulness to evaluate how people understand and apply the concept in their daily lives. They found that in practice, most people conflate acceptance with passivity or avoidance.The research team conducted an extensive empirical project that examined the meaning of mindfulness in three parts: analyses of the semantic meaning of the term mindfulness in the English language, meta-analysis of the results from a widely used mindfulness measure, and empirical tests of association with markers of wisdom and effective emotion regulation. While we found that people seem to conceptually understand that mindfulness involves engagement, the general public is not walking the talk. Our results suggest that laypeople may understand what awareness is, but the next step of acceptance may not be well understood   limiting potential for engaging with problems,  said Ellen Choi, lead author on the paper and an assistant professor of organizational behaviour at Ryerson University.Using social media as a topical example, Grossmann says that with algorithms curating increasingly hateful content, the ability to be mindful of others  perspectives has never been more critical.  Mindfulness might not provide an easy answer to the divisiveness that surrounds us, but an accurate understanding that includes the practice of acceptance may herald the re-emergence of sincere discussion and authentic connection.

A new study shows the effect was four times higher for patients with high expectations of the medication compared with patients with low expectations. This was true even though the groups received the same medical treatment. Although SSRIs influence levels of serotonin in the brain, the effects on dopamine had the greatest impact for improvement.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are an established and effective medication for treating depression and anxiety. The placebo effect, where the positive effects of a treatment can increase when a patient expects to be helped, is a well-known phenomenon. The effect can be significant, and it is unclear how much of the improvement results from expectations of the SSRI treatment. It is also unclear whether the expectations use the same mechanism in the brain as SSRI medications (the inhibiting of the transporter protein for serotonin) or whether other neurotransmitters are involved. The new study points to the transporter protein for dopamine being the key.Researchers at Uppsala University confirmed in a study on social anxiety published in Translational Psychiatry that the placebo effect had a major impact on the anti-anxiety effect of the SSRI drug escitalopram. The surprising finding in the study was that the improvement after SSRI treatment can largely be linked to effects on dopamine rather than to the serotonin transporters.In the study, all the participants were treated with the same clinical dose of escitalopram for nine weeks, but they had different expectations. Half received accurate information about the drug and its effectiveness, while a cover story was used for the other half. Participants in the second group were told that the drug was an  active placebo  that causes similar side effects as SSRIs but was not expected to alleviate their social anxiety. The results showed that almost four times as many patients responded to the treatment when correct information about the drug was given. This is consistent with previous research showing that expectations affect treatment outcome,  says researcher Olof Hjorth.Positron emission tomography (PET) brain scanning showed that the SSRI drug had the same effect on serotonin and blocked about 80 per cent of serotonin transporters in both groups. This was true even for the group that had low expectations and did not improve. This indicates that the pharmacological effect was identical in both groups and that this cannot explain why correct information gave better treatment results. So, inhibiting serotonin transporters is insufficient for achieving good clinical relief from social anxiety using SSRI drugs. When assessing the transporter protein for dopamine after treatment, however, a clear difference between the groups was observed. Participants who began the treatment knowing that it was an effective drug showed a reduced availability of dopamine transporters in the striatum, a part of the cerebrum, while the opposite was true in the group that was given the cover story. One explanation may be that expectations affected the release of dopamine in the brain s reward pathways. This may have led to differences in the two groups in the proportion of dopamine transporters available after treatment. The results indicate that positive expectations arising in the relationship between doctor and patient affect dopamine and enhance the effect of SSRI treatment,  says Professor Tomas Furmark, who led the study.Reference: Hjorth OR, Frick A, Gingnell M, et al.

The researchers compared soils with various moisture content and found agricultural soils are capable of high nitrous oxide emissions across a wide range of environmental conditions. Nitrous oxide has 298 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide over 100 years, according to previous research, suggesting that climate change mitigation efforts must account for nitrous oxide, said Steven Hall, an associate professor of ecology, evolution and organismal biology at Iowa State University and the study s senior author.  In this study, we show that the climate warming effects of nitrous oxide emissions from local corn and soybean soils are two-fold greater than the climate cooling that might be achieved by increasing soil carbon storage with common agricultural practices,  Hall said. Researchers, farmers and policymakers are considering strategies that might encourage producers to store carbon, also a greenhouse gas, in the soil, where it can t contribute to climate change. Hall said storing carbon in agricultural soils is a valuable tactic to mitigate climate change, but the new research indicates any such policies should first take into account nitrous oxide emissions. Failure to do so could result in policies that are much less effective in addressing climate change. Instead, Hall said management plans also should encourage nitrous oxide mitigation strategies in concert with carbon sequestration. Examples of such strategies include more precise and efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer. New products known as enhanced efficiency fertilizers, as well as the application of biochar to fields, might also help to limit nitrous oxide emissions. Microorganisms in the soil give off nitrous oxide as a byproduct as they cycle nitrogen. Nitrogen stimulates nitrous oxide production, so adding nitrogen fertilizers to soil tends to result in more emissions.  If we want to maximize our climate benefit, we want to be strategic about it,  Hall said.  We re not simply going to flip the switch on climate just by putting more carbon in the soil. Nitrous oxide emissions need to be a priority as well.  Hall and his fellow researchers developed a new means of measuring nitrous oxide emissions from corn and soybean fields to help gather data for the study. The scientists tweaked previously existing technologies to measure nitrous oxide emissions every four hours. The technology utilizes small containers placed at various locations on top of the soil of ISU research farms in central Iowa. The containers pump air samples into a central shed where an analyzer automatically measures nitrous oxide content. This method hadn t been used before to measure nitrous oxide, and Hall said the researchers had to design the system to withstand the wet conditions often present in agricultural fields.

Sticky, fluffy, brown, or white? These qualities, in addition to grain length, width, appearance, and other traits, are hugely important predictors of rice sales and consumption worldwide. And region matters. Rice preferences in Latin America, for example, are very different from those in West Africa, Japan, India, and elsewhere.Given the importance of eating quality and regional preference, it s somewhat surprising how little time rice breeders spend improving and refining these traits. But it s expensive and time consuming to test and select lines based on how sticky the grain is after cooking or how long it takes to cook. And breeders have other important traits to think about, like yield and disease resistance.New research from the University of Illinois and the Latin American Fund for Irrigated Rice (FLAR) allows Latin American rice breeders to select regionally relevant eating-quality traits from the outset of a breeding program, saving time, effort, and money. Traditionally, selection for eating quality was done at the end of the breeding program. You could end up with a variety that had good yield and good disease resistance, but poor grain quality. That would be the end of that variety. So, by having a more targeted approach at the beginning, you can concentrate your efforts on other traits,  says Juan Arbelaez, assistant professor in the Department of Crop Sciences at Illinois and co-author on the new study in The Plant Genome.Arbelaez and his collaborators identified genetic markers associated with 10 grain-quality traits in a sample of 284 rice lines, representing 20 years of breeding in Latin America and the Caribbean. From previous studies, we knew these markers were associated with these traits. But this was the first time they were identified in Latin American germplasm. We validated our results in an independent sample of 2,000 separate rice lines, so we know they work,  Arbelaez says.  These markers are now deployed via a service provider in Sweden and can be routinely used by every partner of FLAR's in Latin America. The markers strongly predicted amylose content (a determinant of stickiness), gelatinization temperature (cooking time), and setback viscosity (texture), but were also associated with milling quality and appearance traits. We explored the potential of using genome-wide prediction strategies for more complex grain quality traits, such as milling quality. That's where we see a really exciting new field of research with the implementation of more complex prediction models that incorporate genomics and high-throughput phenotyping,  Arbelaez says.The advancement will make rice breeding in Latin America much more efficient.Arbelaez describes the traditional breeding process like a large funnel. At the wide end, many thousands of rice lines are grown and evaluated for obvious red flags, such as susceptibility to diseases or stunted growth. Vigorous plants with desired visual characteristics are harvested, starting the next generation. And so it goes, culling poor performers, advancing promising plants, gathering seed, year-upon-year until a hearty, desirable new variety remains at the end of the funnel.Some traits, such as setback viscosity, require seed and special machines to test. It s expensive. That s why breeders often wait until the end of the funnel to test these traits.With marker-assisted selection, the cycle is abbreviated. At the wide end of the funnel, thousands of lines can be grown as seedlings in a greenhouse. A snip of leaf material and a trip to the lab is all it takes to determine if a given seedling should be given the chance to grow up to maturity and move forward in the process.Arbelaez is excited for the future of Latin American rice, especially in niche markets like Peru, where Japanese immigrants shifted rice preference toward the stickier end of the spectrum. He also sees the markers being applied beyond Latin America. There is a lot of potential for these markers to be validated in different breeding programs around the world that are looking to identify or characterize their germplasm,  he says.  You can see if these markers can help you to target early stages and use them for marker assisted selection purposes. Reference: Cruz M, Arbelaez JD, Loaiza K, Cuasquer J, Rosas J, Graterol E.

The study involved a global partnership synthesizing scientific data on air pollution, neuroimaging, brain gene expression, and additional data gathered from an international genetic consortium from more than 40 countries.   The bottom line of this study is that air pollution doesn t only impact climate change, it s affecting how your brain works,  said Daniel R. Weinberger, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Lieber Institute and a co-author of the study.  The effects on liability for depression may just be the tip of the iceberg where brain health is concerned. The major challenge in medicine today is a deeper understanding how genes and the environment interact with one another. This study sheds bright light on how this happens. The key message in this study, which has not been shown before, is that air pollution is affecting important cognitive and emotional circuitry of the brain by changing the expression of genes that are conducive to depression,  said Hao Yang Tan, M.D., an investigator at the Lieber Institute, who led the research in collaboration with Peking University.  More people in high-pollution areas will become depressed because their genes and pollution in their environment exaggerate the individual effects of each. All people have some propensity for developing depression, the researchers say, but certain people have higher risk written into their genes. This predisposition does not mean that a person will develop depression, but it elevates a person s risk above the average population. This study shows that depression is far more likely to develop in otherwise healthy humans who have these key genes and who live in environments with high levels of particulate-matter in the air. Our results are the first to show a direct, neurological link between air pollution and how the brain works in processing emotional and cognitive information and in risk for depression,  said Zhi Li, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at the Lieber Institute and lead author of the study.  What is most intriguing is that the two factors are linked in such a way that they have a multiplier effect on one s risk of depression. That is, together, risk genes and bad air raise the risk of depression much more than either factor does in isolation. The brain circuits involved in the effects of genetic risk and air pollution control a wide range of important reasoning, problem-solving, and emotional functions, suggesting potentially widespread brain effects of air pollution.The study recruited 352 healthy adults living in Beijing, a city with well-documented daily pollution levels. Participants first underwent genotyping from which the researchers calculated each person s polygenic depression risk score the mathematical likelihood that a person will suffer depression based on genes alone. The researchers then collected detailed information about each participant s relative exposure to air pollution over a prior six-month period.Next, the participants engaged in a series of simple cognitive tests while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showing which parts of the brain were activated during the cognitive processing.  While doing the tests, participants were also subjected to social stress (unexpected negative feedback about their performance), which affected how a widespread network of brain circuits operated during the tests. The researchers then showed that this brain network was disproportionately degraded by the combination of the genes for depression and the relative degree of exposure to air pollution.To directly examine how genes for depression operated in the human brain, the researchers examined data from a gene atlas of postmortem human brain tissue. They then mapped the postmortem brain networks to the very same networks in living subjects to test whether those genes underwrite the effects of air pollution.Using that sophisticated model, the team found that  people who had high genetic risk for depression and high exposure to particulate matter had brain function predicted by a tighter integration with how genes for depression operated together. The researchers also found that a subset of genes driving these associations were implicated in inflammation, as well a finding that could provide new pharmacological insights into mitigating the effects of air pollution on brain function and depression.Tan said that this new understanding has implications for policymakers around the world.  The role of air pollution on the brain is no longer a matter of conjecture.  Armed with this knowledge, leaders and public health officials around the globe have ample evidence that additional air pollution controls will lead to improved cognitive function and lower rates of depression particularly in densely populated urban areas where air pollution is highest, and stress from socioeconomic and racial inequities is greater,  Tan said.  Given the long-term costs of neuropsychiatric disorders, there is an urgent need for scientific and policy strategies to better identify and protect vulnerable individuals from the deleterious brain impacts of air pollution.

Infection of the gut, which expresses high levels of the ACE2 receptor protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells, is correlated with more severe cases of COVID-19, but the exact interactions between the virus and intestinal tissue is difficult to study in human patients. Animal models, while useful, do not fully reflect how human organs react to infection by pathogens, further limiting our current understanding of how coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 affect the gut.To solve that problem, a team of scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and several other Wyss partner organizations in Boston used a human Intestine Chip previously developed at the Institute to study coronavirus infection and potential treatments in an environment that mimics the human intestine more effectively than cells grown in a dish.The research team infected the Intestine Chip with a coronavirus called NL63 that causes the common cold and, like SARS-CoV-2, uses the ACE2 receptor to enter cells, and then tested the effects of various drugs that have been proposed for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. They found that a drug called nafamostat reduced infection while the drug remdesivir, which has been used to treat COVID-19 patients, did not reduce infection and actually damaged the intestinal tissue. This new preclinical model, which could be used to identify drugs that can target GI symptoms associated with both the common cold and SARS-CoV-2 virus infections in the future, is described in Frontiers in Pharmacology.","Published: November 9, 2021"

These mesh-like fibrin deposits occur outside blood vessels in the brain, contributing to the death of certain central nervous system cells (neurons) that eventually leads to impaired memory.Now for the first time, a team at the University of South Florida Health (USF Health) Morsani College of Medicine, reports that before soluble fibrinogen is converted into insoluble fibrin molecules that can adversely accumulate, it can connect directly with neurons and cause a damaging inflammatory reaction. The researchers further discovered that fibrinogen specifically binds to two fibrinogen receptors on the surface of neurons: cellular prion protein (PrPC) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).Their preclinical study was published Sept. 18 in a special issue entitled ""Prions and Prion-Like Mechanisms in Disease and Biological Function"" in MDPI-Biomolecules.The findings have implications for identifying targeted therapies to help prevent or stop neurodegeneration in Alzheimer s disease, traumatic brain injury, or other chronic neuroinflammatory diseases associated with abnormal vascular permeability (leakage) in the brain. Fibrinogen is one of the overlooked culprits involved in the processes of neurodegeneration and resulting memory loss,  said principal investigator David Lominadze, PhD, a USF Health professor of surgery, and molecular pharmacology and physiology.  Our study shows that fibrinogen is not only a marker (biological indicator) of inflammation but can be a cause of inflammation in the brain. Fibrinogen is a protein naturally produced in the liver and travels throughout the bloodstream to other organs and tissues. Outside of blood vessels, fibrinogen is converted by the enzyme thrombin into fibrin during blood clot formation, playing a key role in wound healing.Dr. Lominadze s laboratory focuses on understanding molecular changes affecting circulation of blood in the body s smallest blood vessels -- including how microvascular changes induced by inflammation may damage cognition, in particular short-term memory.Dr. Lominadze and others have shown that inflammatory disease is associated with a higher concentration of fibrinogen in the blood, increased generation of potentially damaging free radicals, neuronal cell activation and microvascular permeability. In previous studies using their mouse model for mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury, Dr. Lominadze s group reported that fibrinogen after crossing the vascular wall accumulated in spaces between the microvessels and astrocytes (another brain cell type connecting vessels and neurons) and activated the astrocytes. This activation coincided with increased neurodegeneration and reduced short-term memory.In this latest study the USF Health researchers tested whether fibrinogen, beside interacting with astrocytes, could connect directly with neurons -- nerve cells critical for carrying information throughout the human body and coordinating all necessary functions of life.They treated healthy mouse brain neurons grown in a petri dish with fibrinogen. Fibrinogen increased the death of these neurons, a process that was not influenced by the presence or absence of a thrombin inhibitor preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The finding suggests that soluble fibrinogen and, at later stages, fibrin can have similar toxic effects on neurons.Furthermore, blocking the function of PrPC and ICAM-1 fibrinogen receptors on the surface of neurons (essentially stopping fibrinogen from binding tightly to these receptors) reduced inflammatory reactions resulting in neurodegeneration. The study revealed that an interaction between fibrinogen and neurons induced an increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), enhanced oxidative damage, and neuronal death, in part due to its direct association (contact) with neuronal PrPC and ICAM-1,  the study authors wrote.More research is needed. But altogether the USF Health study suggests that short-term memory problems stemming from neurodegenerative diseases with underlying inflammation may be alleviated by several interventions, Dr. Lominadze said. These include  dampening general inflammation, decreasing fibrinogen concentration in the blood by reducing the synthesis of fibrinogen, and blocking the binding of fibrinogen to its neuron receptors,  he said.Reference: Sulimai N, Brown J, Lominadze D.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-symptoms-of-pancreatic-cancer-identified-355597,New Symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer Identified  Researchers have identified a series of symptoms associated with pancreatic cancer  including two previously unrecognized symptoms  feeling thirsty and having dark urine  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers have identified a series of symptoms associated with pancreatic cancer, including two previously unrecognised symptoms   feeling thirsty and having dark urine   in a study presented today (Monday) at the NCRI Festival.[1]The study has confirmed a further 21 signs of pancreatic cancer and shown that patients often have some symptoms of the disease up to a year before their cancers are diagnosed, and other alarming symptoms three months before diagnosis.The researchers hope their findings could improve survival by helping GPs diagnose the disease earlier, especially when patients present with several seemingly non-specific symptoms.Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival among all common cancers, with five-year survival around 7% in the UK. Unfortunately, most people with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed at a late stage.Researchers want to better understand the early signs of pancreatic cancer because if patients and GPs are more aware of symptoms, they could be diagnosed earlier when their chance of survival is better.The research is presented by Dr Weiqi Liao, a data scientist at the University of Oxford, UK. He and his colleagues looked at data from 24,236 patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in England between 2000 and 2017 using a large electronic database (QResearch). The researchers looked at patients  symptoms at different time points before they were diagnosed with cancer and compared them to other patients  symptoms who were not diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and bleeding in the stomach or intestine were the two serious symptoms most associated with being diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic cancer, and in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNEN), a rarer form of pancreatic cancer. In addition, researchers identified thirst and dark urine as previously unknown symptoms for PDAC.Dr Liao said:  When pancreatic cancer is diagnosed earlier, patients have a higher chance of survival. It is possible to diagnose patients when they visit their GP, but both patients and GPs need to be aware of the symptoms associated with pancreatic cancer. The research, which is the largest study of its kind, found 23 symptoms linked with the diagnosis of PDAC (yellowing of the skin, bleeding in the stomach or intestine, problems swallowing, diarrhoea, change in bowel habits, vomiting, indigestion, abdominal mass, abdominal pain, weight loss, constipation, fat in stool, abdominal swelling, nausea, flatulence, heartburn, fever, tiredness, appetite loss, itching, back pain, thirst, and dark urine). Nine symptoms were linked with PNEN (yellowing of the skin, blood in stool, diarrhoea, change in bowel habits, vomiting, indigestion, abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and weight loss).While most symptoms were not specific to pancreatic cancer and could be due to other benign conditions, the researchers found patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer had a higher chance of experiencing some of these non-specific symptoms one year before diagnosis.Dr Liao said:  These new findings enable us to conduct further work on understanding symptoms that could suggest pancreatic cancer. This will help GPs to make decisions about who to refer for urgent tests, especially when patients have several seemingly non-specific symptoms. Although this study is one of the largest of its kind, the oldest data did not include what stage the patients  cancer was when they were diagnosed, meaning the researchers were not able to explore which symptoms were associated with early-stage disease and which with late-stage disease. In addition, as PNEN is a rarer cancer, there is only a small amount of data available in the study period, meaning it is harder for researchers to detect other potential symptoms.Dr Liao is also working with other researchers to compare these findings with symptom data from other groups of patients.Dr Pippa Corrie is chair of the pancreatic workstream of the NCRI Upper Gastrointestinal Group and Consultant Medical Oncologist at Addenbrooke s Hospital, Cambridge, UK, and was not involved with the research. She said:  Being aware of the early symptoms of pancreatic cancer is crucial if we are to diagnose patients earlier and improve pancreatic cancer survival. This research could help GPs and their patients know more about the signs of pancreatic cancer. It s vital that people speak to their GP if they notice these symptoms. Future research could help us develop tools for GPs to help them make referrals, especially when patients present with several non-specific symptoms. Professor Julia Hippisley-Cox, who led the study and is based at the University of Oxford, said:  We thank the many hundreds of GPs using EMIS   an electronic patient record system widely used in the UK   who contribute anonymised data to the QResearch database, without whom this novel research in such a rare but important condition, would not have been possible. These results could now be used to update QCancer, a risk prediction model that has been created from the QResearch database to help GPs identify high-risk patients for further tests to diagnose cancer.Dr Chris Macdonald, Head of Research at Pancreatic Cancer UK, which funded the research, said:  This new analysis, and the QCancer tool itself, is filling a gaping hole in the way that pancreatic cancer is diagnosed. It could give GPs a much-needed way of identifying patients who are at risk of the disease so that they can be referred for diagnostic tests earlier and, ultimately, get treatment before it s too late. This research is an important component of our Early Diagnosis Research Alliance, which has brought together leading researchers across the UK to make earlier diagnosis a reality for the deadliest common cancer. Their efforts mean a new diagnostic test for pancreatic cancer is now on the horizon. However, we also need vital risk assessment tools like QCancer optimised and in the hands of GPs, if we re to ensure that anyone who might have this devastating disease has the very best chance of survival.

Clicking Zoom links erased time spent walking to meeting rooms, and Netflix spilled into time otherwise dedicated to the gym.In short, a lot of people suddenly became more sedentary during the onset of the pandemic. Recently published research found people who continued to spend a higher amount of time sitting between April and June 2020 were likely to have higher symptoms of depression. A closer investigation into this association could play a role in helping people improve their mental health. Sitting is a sneaky behavior,  said Jacob Meyer, assistant professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University and lead author of the paper.  It s something we do all the time without thinking about it. As the director of the Wellbeing and Exercise Laboratory at ISU, Meyer and his team look at how physical activity and sedentary behaviors are related to mental health, and how changes to those influence the way people think, feel and perceive the world. In March 2020, we knew COVID was going to affect our behavior and what we could do in lots of weird, funky ways that we couldn't predict,  Meyer said.To get a snapshot of those changes, Meyer and a team of researchers received survey responses from more than 3,000 study participants from all 50 states and the District of Colombia. Participants self-reported how much time they spent doing activities, like sitting, looking at screens and exercising, and how those behaviors compared to pre-pandemic times. Using standard clinical scales, they also indicated changes to their mental wellbeing (e.g., depression, anxiety, feeling stressed, lonely). We know when people's physical activity and screen time changes, that's related to their mental health in general, but we haven't really seen large population data like this in response to an abrupt change before,  Meyer said.Survey data showed participants who were meeting the U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines (i.e., 2.5-5 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity each week) before the pandemic decreased their physical activity by 32%, on average, shortly after COVID-19-related restrictions went into effect. The same participants reported feeling more depressed, anxious and lonely. Meyer and his fellow researchers published their findings in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health last year.Meyer s latest paper in Frontiers in Psychiatry served as a follow up to see whether the participants  behaviors and mental health changed over time. Participants filled out the same survey each week between April and June. In the second study, we found that, on average, people saw their mental health improve over the eight-week period,  Meyer said.  People adjusted to life in the pandemic. But for people whose sitting times stayed high, their depressive symptoms, on average, didn't recover in the same way as everyone else s. The participants who continued to spend a large portion of their day sitting experienced blunted mental health improvements.Meyer emphasized that finding an  association  between sitting and mental health is not the same as saying more sitting causes depression. He said it s possible people who were more depressed sat more or that people who sat more became more depressed. Or there could have been some other factor that the researchers did not identify. It s certainly worthy of more investigation,  Meyer said, adding that monthly survey data from June 2020 to June 2021 are intended to become publicly available soon.  I think being aware of some of the subtle changes we ve made during the pandemic and how they might be beneficial or detrimental is really important as we look to the other side of pandemic life. Meyer said both starting and stopping a habit is very difficult, even when someone wants to change their behavior. But he hopes more people will recognize that even a little bit of movement can improve their mood and mental health, and try to find ways to build it into their day.Meyer recommended people take breaks when sitting for long periods of time. If you re no longer walking down the hall for in-person meetings, you can still incorporate that break from sitting by taking a short walk before and after your Zoom call,  Meyer said.People working from home can try walking around the block before and after the workday to mimic their pre-pandemic commute, which Meyer said can benefit people physically and mentally, and help add structure to the day.Reference: Meyer JD, O Connor J, McDowell CP, Lansing JE, Brower CS, Herring MP.

Questions that have bogged down scientists about these disorders include: Does autism lead to an increase in epilepsy? Or does epilepsy alter the brain circuit, which then leads to autism?Viji Santhakumar, an associate professor in the Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology at the University of California, Riverside, in collaboration with Tracy Tran at Rutgers University have tackled these questions in a paper published in the journal Translational Psychiatry. One hypothesis is that during brain development, inhibitory neurons, which regulate brain rhythms, develop in an abnormal manner,  Santhakumar said.  If this is true, then how the brain circuit gets set up is abnormal, which may lead to both autism and epilepsy. Santhakumar and her team focused on inhibitory neurons in mice. She explained that unlike excitatory neurons that lead to a forward propagation of information, inhibitory neurons work like a brake by suppressing and sculpting the activity of downstream neurons.The researchers generated mice with a global mutation in all cells that prevented the inhibitory neurons from migrating to their normal location in mature brain circuits. Not surprisingly, they found a reduction in inhibitory currents in the hippocampus, a region of the brain known for memory function. Notably, the mutant mice showed behavioral traits associated with ASD and were more prone to seizures. We found fewer inhibitory neurons in the brain circuit,  Santhakumar said.  There may be a developmental abnormality in establishing inhibitory neuron circuits. If we can identify what the molecular pathways are, we may be able to intervene early and make sure the inhibitory circuit is maintained. How the circuit develops may play a key role in the co-occurrence of autism and epilepsy. Understanding these mechanisms may help develop more targeted cures. Results of the study suggest that a common underlying defect in circuit formation could contribute to both ASD and epilepsy. The findings of the current study open the doors for future work to test whether mutations, when restricted to specific cell types and developmental periods, can help distinguish between the role of inhibitory neuron migration and maintenance of circuit connections in the development of ASD or epilepsy.

Adding herbs and spices to your food is a great way to add flavor without adding extra sodium, sugar or saturated fat,  Kris-Etherton said.  And, if you go a step further and add these seasonings to foods that are really good for you, like fruits and vegetables, you can potentially get even more health benefits by consuming that extra produce. According to the researchers, cardiometabolic diseases like heart disease, strokes and type two diabetes continue to be one of the leading causes of death in the United States. One of the ways health professionals aim to improve heart health is by monitoring and improving blood pressure.One way people can improve their blood pressure is by limiting their sodium intake, usually by adding less salt to their meals. Petersen said that while people have long been encouraged to season their food with herbs and spices instead of salt to boost flavor without added sodium, less was known about whether herbs and spices have health benefits of their own. As nutritionists, we re interested in new ways we can use diet to benefit health, and cardiovascular health in particular,  Petersen said.  We were curious about how herbs and spices could affect heart health, since they are versatile and can be added to many different types of food. For the study, the researchers recruited 71 people with risk factors for heart disease. Every participant consumed every spice diet   one low, one moderate, and one high in herbs and spices   in a random order for four weeks each, with a two-week break between each diet period. Blood samples were drawn from each participant at the beginning of the study as well as after each diet period.All three diets were based on an average American diet   reflective of what a typical American consumes in a day   but with three different doses of herbs and spices added. The low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose diets included approximately 0.5 grams, 3.2 grams and 6.5 grams of herbs and spices, respectively, a day.The doses included a blend of 24 different herbs and spices, ranging from basil and thyme to cinnamon and turmeric, designed to simulate the way people use different herbs and spices throughout the day while cooking.The researchers found that after consuming the diet including a high dose of herbs and spices, participants had lower systolic blood pressure than after the diet with the medium dose. Participants also had lower diastolic blood pressure after the diet with a high dose of herbs and spices than after the diet with a low dose.Kris-Etherton said the results   recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition   were especially exciting to her because the diets in the study were not designed to be specifically heart healthy, and only differed from an average diet by the amount of herbs and spices added. I think it s really significant that participants consumed an average American diet throughout the study and we still found these results,  Kris-Etherton said.  We didn t decrease sodium, we didn t increase fruits and vegetables, we just added herbs and spices. It begs the next question that if we did alter the diet in these ways, how much better would the results be? The researchers said that in the future, additional studies designed to incorporate herbs and spices into a healthy dietary pattern lower in salt, added sugars and solid fats could help guide future dietary recommendations.Reference: Petersen KS, Davis KM, Rogers CJ, Proctor DN, West SG, Kris-Etherton PM.

The results and outcomes of the experiments and description of the properties of the crystals are published in Nanomaterials.Metal-organic polymers, or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are crystals composed of metal ions interconnected by organic molecules, i.e. organic linkers. Various concentrations of the metal ions and organic linkers can be used to synthesise materials with different structures and properties. MOFs are widely used to design electro-chemical sensors as reaction catalysts in chemical industry or propellant additives.Some of the MOFs are luminescent MOFs. They emit light caused by UV rays, electromagnetic field, or other disturbances. Luminescent MOFs are actively used as LED components and luminescent thermometers. Additionally, they are used in diagnosis of cancer. Luminescent MOFs are also used as luminescent sensors for pollutants.St Petersburg University chemists synthesised the smallest nano-sized crystals by the ultrasound-assisted wet-chemical method. They were synthesised by a slow mixing of sodium terephthalate and europium chloride aqueous solutions by using the ultrasound-assisted wet-chemical method, precipitated in the form of a polycrystalline solid. Ultrasonication ensured a better mixing of solution, slowed growth of particles, prevented the aggregation of the microparticles, and resulted in the formation of individual microparticles.The scientists synthesised particles of various sizes. The average particle size can be equal 8 nm up to hundreds micrometres. Today, the reported europium(III) terephthalate tetrahydrate (Eu2bdc3 4H2O) metal-organic frameworks nanoparticles are the smallest nano-sized rare-earth-based MOF crystals. We did not expect that a twofold decrease in the concentration of reagents could lead to size reduction for several orders. Presumably, this effect may be due to europium-terephthalate 1:1 complex. This can accelerate the growth process of the particles. Earlier, scientists could synthesise nano-sized particles of terephthalate that were equal to 40 nm or even more. We managed to synthesise particles with the fivefold smaller size,  said the head of the research, Associate Professor in the Department of Laser Chemistry at St Petersburg University and Doctor of Chemistry Andrey Mereshchenko.The developed method to synthesise nanoparticles can make a positive contribution to nanotechnology and coordination chemistry. By using this method, we can synthesise nanoparticles from other MOFs. The experiments also reported the selective luminescence quenching by heavy metal ions. As a result, the synthesised nanoparticles can be used as sensors to detect heavy metal ions in water.  This discovery has a potential to develop efficient sensors to monitor heavy metal ions in drinking water. Our luminescent MOFs demonstrate significantly lower limits of detection on heavy metal ions. This will ensure more accurate measurements of pollutants in water, even in small concentrations , said Viktor Nosov, a co-author of the article and a student in Chemistry at St Petersburg University.The reported nanoparticles can also be used as luminescent sensors to detect Cu2+, Cr3+, and Fe3+ ions in water. The presence of these metals in water poses a threat to human beings and animals. Heavy metal accumulation in the body can effect human metabolism and lead to nervous system diseases, vascular diseases, and digestive disorders. The chemists are planning to continue the research and develop an express test to detect heavy metal ions in drinking water and waste.Reference: Kolesnik SS, Nosov VG, Kolesnikov IE, et al.

The trial   known as the Tau Next Generation Trial (Tau NexGen)   originally was announced with a focus on drugs that target tau, but with increasing evidence that targeting amyloid can reduce biomarkers of Alzheimer s disease, the trial s leaders have revised the first arm to include an experimental therapy targeting amyloid as well.Tau NexGen is part of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), led by investigators at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The DIAN-TU is an international network of academic centers focused on finding therapies for Alzheimer s disease by studying people who have rare, inherited mutations that almost certainly guarantee they will develop the disease at an early age. With growing evidence that removing amyloid plaques has biologically beneficial effects on amyloid and tau, we believe that targeting both Alzheimer s disease pathologies   amyloid plaques and tau tangles   at the same time can provide the highest chance of success,  said principal investigator Randall J. Bateman, MD, director of DIAN-TU and the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at Washington University.The DIAN-TU launched in 2012 as the first prevention trial platform for Alzheimer s disease. A trial platform allows multiple treatments to be evaluated using a single master protocol. The first therapies evaluated on the DIAN-TU platform were designed to target the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain. Such plaques are thought to contribute to problems with memory and thinking. With the initiation of the Tau NexGen trial, the DIAN-TU has extended its focus to another Alzheimer s disease pathology, tau tangles, that has been closely linked to cognitive decline.The Tau NexGen trial is designed with three arms. Each arm will evaluate an investigational drug that targets tau; each drug is designed to work in different ways.The first arm of the Tau NexGen trial will evaluate an experimental anti-amyloid drug called lecanemab (designed to target forms of amyloid called oligomers and protofibrils) and an investigational tau drug known as E2814 that is designed to target the spread of tau. Both drugs are developed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai Co., Ltd. This will be the first Alzheimer s prevention trial to target both amyloid and tau with two drugs at the same time.For the other two arms, the research team plans to choose from two classes of tau drugs that act in different ways: by targeting other mechanisms of tau pathology, including small molecule drugs that inhibit tau aggregation; and genetic treatments that reduce the production of tau protein. Future tau drug arms may also be combined with amyloid drugs such as lecanemab.The Tau NexGen trial is primarily funded by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with significant support from Eisai, as well as the Alzheimer s Association and philanthropic donations. Eisai is contributing E2814 and lecanemab to the trial.Earlier this year, DIAN-TU leaders announced that the first arm of Tau NexGen would evaluate the experimental tau drug E2814 alone. As the trial was still in the process of being launched when the design change was made, no participants had yet begun drug treatment under the tau-based protocol.Under the revised protocol, all participants will receive the amyloid drug, while half also will receive the tau drug and half the placebo. The timing of each drug depends on whether the participant has begun experiencing cognitive changes. Symptomatic participants will receive the amyloid drug for six months before being randomly assigned to also receive the tau drug or a placebo. Since amyloid plaques accumulate before tau tangles in Alzheimer s disease, this study design allows the researchers to assess whether amyloid removal clears the way for the tau drug to function most effectively.At the same time, presymptomatic participants will be randomly assigned to receive the tau drug or a placebo for a year before beginning the amyloid drug. By staggering the drugs in this way, the researchers will be able to evaluate the effects of the tau drug alone before assessing the effects of the two drugs together.The primary endpoint is a slowing of tau accumulation in the brain in symptomatic participants, as seen on PET brain scans. As a secondary endpoint, the researchers will evaluate whether the drugs affect levels of a specific kind of tau   phosphorylated tau 217   in the cerebrospinal fluid of presymptomatic participants. Bateman and colleagues have shown that levels of phosphorylated tau 217 in the cerebrospinal fluid rise steadily as the disease silently advances before symptom onset. The researchers will assess whether drug treatment slows the rise in levels of this form of tau in the presymptomatic group.If these primary and secondary endpoints are positive, the trial will be extended for another two years to assess whether the drug slows cognitive decline and has further effects on tau pathology.The DIAN-TU trial platform is the first trial platform aimed at identifying drugs to prevent or slow Alzheimer s in people who are nearly certain to develop the disease due to genetic mutations. People who inherit such mutations tend to develop symptoms at around the same age their affected parents did, often in their 50s, 40s or even 30s. While devastating for families, such mutations allow researchers to identify and study people in the earliest stages of the disease before their behavior and memory begin to change.Three trial arms were previously launched on the DIAN-TU trial platform to evaluate experimental drugs targeting amyloid. One, gantenerumab, reduced molecular markers of disease and slowed neurodegeneration in a phase 2/3 clinical trial. These promising results led the researchers to launch an exploratory open-label extension of the trial, meaning that participants in both the drug and placebo groups have been offered the drug, and the researchers continue to monitor their progress.Although the trial focuses on people with rare mutations, drugs that are successful in this population would be promising candidates for preventing or treating the forms of Alzheimer s that occur more commonly in older adults. The destructive molecular and cellular processes in the brain are similar in all types of the disease. This article has been republished from the following materials.

SnS has already shown great promise as a material for use in photovoltaics, field effect transistors and catalysis. Now, members of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science, based at Monash University and RMIT University, have shown that SnS nanosheets are also excellent candidates for use as soft X-ray detectors. Their research, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, indicates that SnS nanosheets possess high photon absorption coefficients, allowing them to be used in making ultrathin soft X-ray detectors with high sensitivity and a rapid response time. These materials were found to be even more sensitive than another emerging candidate (metal halide perovskites), boasting a faster response time than established detectors and are tuneable for sensitivity across the soft X-ray region. The SnS X-ray detectors created by the team are less than 10 nanometres thick. To put things in perspective, a sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometres thick, and your fingernails grow about one nanometre every second. Previously, the thinnest X-ray detectors created were between 20 and 50 nanometres. Considerable work remains to explore the full potential of the SnS X-ray detectors, but Professor Jacek Jasieniak, the senior author of the paper, believes it s possible this could one day lead to real-time imaging of cellular processes.  The SnS nanosheets respond very quickly, within milliseconds,  he said.  You can scan something and get an image almost instantaneously. The sensing time dictates the time resolution. In principle, given the high sensitivity and high time resolution, you could be able to see things in real time.  You might be able to use this to see cells as they interact. You re not just producing a static image, you could see proteins and cells evolving and moving using X-rays.  Why are such sensitive and responsive detectors important? X-rays can be broadly divided into two types:  Hard  X-rays are the kind used by hospitals to scan the body for broken bones and other illnesses. Perhaps less well known but just as important are  soft  X-rays, which have a lower photon energy and can be used to study wet proteins and living cells, a crucial component of cellular biology. Some of these measurements take place in the  water window , a region of the electromagnetic spectrum in which water is transparent to soft X-rays. Soft X-ray detection can be conducted using a Synchrotron, a particle accelerator like the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, but access to this type of hugely expensive infrastructure is difficult to secure. Recent advances in non-synchrotron soft X-ray laser sources may allow lower cost, portable detection systems to be designed, providing an accessible alternative to Synchrotrons for researchers around the world. But for this approach to work, we will need soft X-ray detector materials that are highly sensitive to low energy X-rays, provide excellent spatial resolution, and are cost effective. Some existing soft X-ray detectors use an indirect mechanism, in which ionizing radiation is converted into visible photons. This approach allows for multiple energy ranges and frame rates to be studied, but is difficult to prepare and offers limited resolutions. Direct detection methods are easier to prepare and offer better resolutions, because the detector material can be thinner than indirect approaches. Good candidate materials need a high X-ray absorption coefficient, which is calculated using the atomic number of the absorbing atoms, X-ray incident energy, density and atomic mass of an atom. High atomic mass and low energy X-rays favour high absorption, and soft X-rays are more strongly absorbed in thin materials compared to hard X-rays. Nanocrystal films and ferromagnetic flakes have shown promise as certain types of soft X-ray detectors, but they are not well equipped to handle the water region. That s where the SnS nanosheets come in. One of the lead authors, Dr Nasir Mahmood of RMIT University, said the sensitivity and efficiency of SnS nanosheets depends greatly on their thickness and lateral dimensions, which are not possible to control through traditional fabrication methods. Using a liquid metal-based exfoliation method allowed the researchers to produce high quality, large area sheets with controlled thickness, which can efficiently detect soft X-ray photons in the water region. Their sensitivity can be further enhanced by a process of stacking the ultrathin layers. They represent major improvements in sensitivity and response time compared to existing direct soft X-ray detectors. The researchers hope their findings will open new avenues for the development of next-generation, highly sensitive X-ray detectors based on ultrathin materials. First author Dr Babar Shabbir said:  In the long run, to commercialise this, we need to test a many-pixel device. At this stage we don t have the imaging system. But this provides us with a knowledge platform and a prototype. ReferenceShabbir B, Liu J, Krishnamurthi V, et al. Soft X-ray Detectors Based on SnS Nanosheets for the Water Window Region.

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/selecting-the-best-placental-model-355581,Selecting the Best Placental Model Despite its crucial role in healthy pregnancies  the placenta is one of the least understood organs in the human body  In a new study  researchers compared the two main experimental models of the human placenta   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. About four to five days after fertilization, the human embryo is a hollow ball of cells surrounding an inner cell mass. The inner cells grow into the fetus, while the outer layer of cells, called trophectoderm, gives rise to the trophoblast, the main cell type of the placenta. As the placenta starts to form, some trophoblast stem cells differentiate into extravillous trophoblast, which infiltrate the uterus and open up maternal blood vessels to provide blood supply to the fetus. Stem cells also differentiate to form the syncytiotrophoblast, a cell layer that is in contact with maternal blood and is the principal site of nutrient and oxygen exchange.By nourishing the fetus in the womb, the placenta plays a key role in a healthy pregnancy. However, studying placental formation in humans has been difficult due to a scarcity of good experimental models. Now, FMI group leader Margherita Yayoi Turco and her colleagues at the University of Cambridge, Megan Sheridan and Ashley Moffett, compared the two main models of the human placenta: 2D cultures of trophoblast stem cells and 3D clusters of placental cells called trophoblast organoids.Both models are derived from placental tissues, grown in a laboratory dish, and resemble normal first-trimester placentas. However, unlike trophoblast stem cells, trophoblast organoids undergo spontaneous differentiation into syncytiotrophoblast and mimic the portion of the placenta that mediates the exchange of nutrients, hormones and oxygen between the mother and the fetus. In contrast, two-dimensional trophoblast cultures resemble more closely cells located in the region from where extravillous trophoblasts are derived.The researchers also found that, unlike trophoblast stem cells, trophoblast organoids maintain the expression of important cell-surface molecules responsible for interacting with the immune system. This suggests that mechanical cues are key for placental development, and that culturing trophoblast in three dimensions allows the cells to maintain important characteristics that they would have in the womb.The findings, published in Development, will help scientists to choose the best model to study how the placenta develops and functions, and what happens when something goes wrong, the researchers say. The results also suggest that trophoblast organoids are best suited for studying maternal-fetal interactions. Understanding such processes will help investigate pregnancy complications that can lead to miscarriage and other conditions.Reference: Sheridan MA, Zhao X, Fernando RC, et al.

Today cancer treatments have grown more accurate, and scientists at West Virginia University are working to level-up their accuracy even more.Mark McLaughlin a researcher with the WVU Cancer Institute and Modulation Therapeutics Inc. and his colleagues are developing a cancer treatment that zeroes in on the diseased cells with more precision. Based on extensive preclinical research, they have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin human trials of a new drug to treat eye-cancer.The team designed the drug called MTI-201 to treat uveal melanoma after the cancer has traveled to another part of the body.Uveal melanoma is the most common form of eye cancer, but it s a rare disease overall. About 2,500 people in the United States get uveal melanoma per year, and only half of those people get the metastatic disease,  said McLaughlin, a professor in the School of Pharmacy and researcher supported by the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute.  Unfortunately, they all die. There s no available treatment that significantly extends life. MTI-201 achieves its precision by homing in on a specific biomarker. This biomarker is a protein or  receptor that is overabundant in uveal melanoma cells. Because the receptor isn t as plentiful in healthy cells, the drug doesn t destroy them. The invention, really, is a targeting ligand that seeks out and interacts with that overexpressed receptor,  said School of Pharmacy professor Lori Hazlehurst.Hazlehurst is the associate director of basic research for the Cancer Institute, a WVCTSI-supported researcher and, along with McLaughlin, a cofounder of Modulation Therapeutics. It has a cytotoxic payload,  she said.  In this case, the cytotoxic payload is actinium. So, you re bringing a very cytotoxic payload right to that cancer cell. Attacking those metastatic sites in this way has not been tried in uveal melanoma before. Once the actinium reaches the surface of a tumor cell, it penetrates the cell within seconds. It irradiates the cell from the inside out,  McLaughlin said. Fortunately, this molecule is small, as far as drugs go, and it can be internalized into the cell or cleared relatively rapidly from the normal tissue,  he said.  It has a 10-day half-life, which means that 10 days after the treatment, over half of the actinium that didn t get to the tumor is gone. That makes it safer. They founded Modulation Therapeutics a WVU-based startup company in 2011. An early discovery and translational drug development company, Modulation Therapeutics is housed in the Cancer Institute and received funding from the National Cancer Institute s Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Program.This is the first investigational new drug application that the FDA has awarded Modulation Therapeutics.Down the line, it s possible that MTI-201 could even be used to treat localized cases of uveal melanoma before it spreads. The current therapy for primary uveal melanoma is irradiation of the eye,  McLaughlin said.  Because the radiation is coming from the outside, it causes all sorts of collateral damage while it s going into the site where the tumor actually is. Our drug could be injected right into the eye at a very, very low dose. It wouldn t be circulating throughout the body. It would reach the target immediately. And years and years in the future it could even potentially save that person s sight in that eye.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

In a study reported in the journal Chemical Science, researchers developed a new method to determine how antibiotics with specific chemical properties thread their way through tiny pores in the otherwise impenetrable cell envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotic resistance is a major clinical problem now in the world,  said University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign biochemistry professor Emad Tajkhorshid, who led the study with biophysics Ph.D. students Nandan Haloi and Archit Kumar Vasan, and biochemistry research scientist Po-Chao Wen.  Tens of thousands of people die each year in the U.S. as a result of untreatable bacterial infections, and the problem is even worse in other parts of the world.  Most of these infections are attributable to Gram-negative bacteria, which have a hard outer cell membrane that many antibiotics fail to penetrate, Tajkhorshid said. In 2017, U. of I. chemistry professor and current study co-author Paul Hergenrother reported in the journal Nature that his team had determined a set of chemical rules for antibiotic compounds that could pass through Gram-negative bacterial membranes. Using this guidance, Hergenrother and his colleagues successfully converted antibiotics that worked only against Gram-positive bacteria into effective killers of Gram-negative microbes, which are much harder to treat. One key to that discovery was that some antibiotics could use specific membrane pores to penetrate the cell membranes of Gram-negative bacteria if chemists added a positively charged group, for example an amine, to them, Tajkhorshid said. While experiments proved the idea worked, the researchers did not understand precisely why it worked. To gain a better understanding, the scientists had to determine at a microscopic level how the antibiotic interacted with different parts of the bacterial pore as it passed through. One approach to tracking molecular interactions involves the use of supercomputers to model the chemical characteristics of every atom in a system and run simulations that reveal how the system behaves. This technique, called  molecular dynamics simulation,  is computationally intensive, however, and may not track the molecular behavior of a complex system in full, Tajkhorshid said. To reduce the computational load, Haloi and Vasan developed a method that generated the most likely pathway for the antibiotic as it wriggled through the pore, then allowed their molecular dynamics simulations to help them calculate the energetics of each potential step. They ran the simulations for the antibiotic with and without the amine group attached.  Every potential pathway through the pore has an energy associated with it, and we are looking for the pathway that is energetically most favorable,  Tajkhorshid said. This effort revealed that the positively charged amine group on the antibiotic interacted favorably with negative charges lining the bacterial pore, he said. These attractive forces allowed the antibiotic with the amine group to line up in an energetically more favorable manner as it threaded its way through the narrowest part of the pore, called the constriction zone. The antibiotic without the amine faced a higher energy barrier to passage through the pore. Mutation experiments   performed by chemistry Ph.D. student Emily Geddes in the Hergenrother lab with U. of I. microbiology professor William Metcalf    confirmed that the interaction between the amine and negatively charged regions of the pore enabled passage of the antibiotic into the bacterium.  Understanding the precise mechanisms that allow potential antibiotics to penetrate Gram-negative bacterial cell membranes will allow scientists to design new drugs   or modify old ones   to attack and kill microbes that are otherwise resistant to treatment with antibiotics,  Vasan said. The technique developed to lessen the computational resources needed to address complex problems like this one also will be useful for other explorations of molecular biology, Tajkhorshid said.  We can use these methods to explore other disease-related processes that involve, for example, interactions between chemical compounds and proteins, how drugs bind their receptors in the body or how specific chemical groups in an antibody bind to surface antigens on a virus,  Haloi said.  Although we developed our method to study barrel-shaped proteins, this approach should be generally applicable to many other systems,  Wen said.ReferenceHaloi N, Vasan AK, Geddes EJ, et al.

Why have some patients presented as completely asymptomatic, while others have ultimately lost their lives to the virus? Across the globe, researchers have been conducting genomic studies in large numbers of COVID-19 patient and non-patient samples to see if the answer lies in our DNA.   By reading and analyzing human genomes, we can search for differences, or variants, in the DNA code (genotype) across populations that may contribute to observed phenotypes. An example of a phenotype is an individual's susceptibility to specific diseases, i.e., COVID-19.In 2020, two separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by Ellinghaus et al and Pairo-Castineira et al identified a particular region of DNA on chromosome three that appeared to be associated with severe forms of COVID-19. However, the mechanisms by which this region of DNA conferred the increased risk were unclear from these initial studies. New research from Professors James Davies and Jim Hughes  at the University of Oxford s MRC   published in Nature Genetics   has used artificial intelligence (AI) to shed some light. The researchers say that the genetic signal on chromosome three has proven difficult to analyze thus far because it impacts a part of the genome often referred to as ""dark matter"" or ""junk"" DNA. This part of our DNA make-up earned such names due to the fact it contains introns, genes that do not encode proteins. For many years, the purpose of this non-coding region remained elusive, however growing research is demonstrating its importance in gene regulation, i.e., turning specific genes ""on"" and ""off"". Variants in this region therefore lead to differences in the genes that are expressed in specific cells.","Published: November 8, 2021"

They published their findings today in Science Advances.The study, led by Hande Karahan, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in medical and molecular genetics, and Jungsu Kim, PhD, the P. Michael Conneally Professor of Medical and Molecular Genetics, found that deleting the gene called ABI3 significantly increased amyloid-beta plaque accumulation in the brain and decreased the amount of microglia around the plaques. This study can provide further insight into understanding the key functions of microglia contributing to the disease and help identify new therapeutic targets,  Karahan said.Karahan based her research on a human genetics study of more than 85,000 people fewer than half were Alzheimer s patients that identified the mutation in the ABI3 gene. Researchers concluded this mutation increased the risk of late-onset Alzheimer s. However, there was no investigation into the function of ABI3 gene in the brain or about how this gene affects microglia function,  Karahan said, a fact that led to her research.The team deleted the ABI3 gene from an Alzheimer s disease mouse model and tested the functions of the gene in microglia in cell cultures. In the mouse model, they saw increased levels of plaques and inflammation in the brain and signs of synaptic dysfunction characteristics associated with learning and memory deficits of the disease.Additionally, Karahan said the deletion of the gene impaired the movement of microglia. The immune cells cannot move closer to plaques to try to clear up the proteins. Amyloid plaques are commonly found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer s; amyloid beta proteins clump together and form plaques, which destroy nerve cell connections. Our study provides the first in vivo functional evidence that the loss of ABI3 function may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer s disease by affecting amyloid beta accumulation and neuroinflammation,  Karahan said.Over the past few years, Karahan has been building upon her Alzheimer s disease research. In 2019, Karahan received the Sarah Roush Memorial Fellowship in Alzheimer s Disease Research, established by the Indiana Alzheimer s Disease Research Center and funded through a generous donation from James and Nancy Carpenter and a matching contribution from Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, where Karahan conducts her research. Karahan and Kim received three separate grants supporting this research from the National Institute on Aging, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) branch for Alzheimer s research, resulting in $7.8 million over the next five years. One grant will fund the creation of a mouse model that will allow us to delete the ABI3 gene in any cell types in the body, such as brain microglia and peripheral immune cells,  Kim said.  Once we validate this new model, we will make it available to others in the research community to use this model for their own investigations. The other grants will fund additional mouse and cell models for the team to further investigate how the ABI3 gene in microglia affects Alzheimer s disease pathologies as well as fund state-of-the-art techniques, including brain imaging using the Bruker BioSpec 9.4T PET-MRI scanner, located in the Roberts Translational Imaging Facility at Stark Neurosciences Research Institute.Each of these projects has an end goal of identifying druggable targets for the treatment of the disease, Karahan and Kim said.

All neurons require a constant environment in order to function reliably. To ensure this, the brain is surrounded by the so-called blood-brain barrier. It ensures, for example, that the nutrient balance always remains the same and that harmful influences do not reach the neurons. This applies to all animals including humans. For insects, a team led by Nicole Pogodalla and Prof. Dr. Christian Kl mbt from the Institute of Neuro- and Behavioral Biology at the University of M nster (Germany) has now shown that there is also a second barrier in the brain. Here glial cells, too, ensure a spatial separation of different functional compartments, which is essential for reliable functioning of the nervous system. The work was published in the prestigious online journal Nature Communications.The research team studied the insect brain using larvae of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) as an example and focused on the role of glial cells. Early in development these cells help to establish the correct neuronal network and later glial cells play important roles in controlling the transmission of signals between neurons. In all invertebrates, as well as in primitive vertebrates, glial cells also define the outer boundary of the nervous system   the blood-brain barrier.Deep in the fly brain, all synapses are located in a special region called the neuropil. The neuropil is separated from the zone containing the cell bodies of the neurons by a small set of surrounding glial cells, that were in the focus of Nicole Pogodalla. She developed a new experimental approach - dye injections into living larval brains - and combined this with cell type specific ablation experiments to show that these glial cells actually form a diffusion barrier, i. e. regulate the distribution of molecules.Since all other cellular barriers in the body are formed by polarized cells that have an ""up"" and a ""down,"" the research team next examined glial cell polarity. Using advanced confocal image analysis as well as electron microscopy work in combination with state-of-the-art molecular genetics, the researchers uncovered that the ensheathing glial cells are indeed polarized. They showed that this polarization is functionally important, as defects in polarity lead to both an altered cell shape and cause a significant behavioral phenotype in fly larvae: Movement of larvae with defective or absent glial cells is impaired, and crawling speed is reduced.Reference: Pogodalla N, Kranenburg H, Rey S, Rodrigues S, Cardona A, Kl mbt C.

These are the results of a pilot study of the process known as whole genome sequencing.The study also shows how whole genome sequencing, which is currently being rolled out for all childhood cancer patients in England, could be refined to bring maximum benefits to children with cancer.The study was presented by Dr Patrick Tarpey, lead scientist for solid cancer in the East Genomic Laboratory Hub, based at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK.He said:  Whole genome sequencing can sometimes unravel unexpected results that may not have been considered via routine investigations. We ve already learned a lot about using this type of test in our pilot study, both in terms of its benefits for children and in terms of how to optimise the results. The study, part of the 100,000 Genomes Project, involved 36 children treated at Addenbrooke s hospital in Cambridge and included 23 different types of solid tumour. For each child, a sample of their tumour and a sample of their blood were sent to a lab where the full DNA sequence could be read. Scientists then looked for genetic differences, called variants, that might offer clues about how the cancer developed, the specific cancer type and which treatments might be most effective.This process revealed several potentially important variants. In two cases, the information refined children s diagnosis, and in four cases, it changed their diagnosis. In eight cases, it revealed new information about children s prognoses (the likely course of their disease). In two cases, it showed possible hereditary causes of the cancers. In seven cases, it revealed treatments that might not have been considered but were likely to be effective for treating the children.For example, in one child, scientists found that two genes had become stuck together (known as gene fusion), and this was probably encouraging the tumour to grow. Knowing this meant that doctors could offer a different treatment, called a MEK inhibitor, that would not normally be used to treat this type of cancer.Dr Tarpey said:  Our results from this relatively small pilot group of children with cancer, show how diagnosis and treatment can be improved. It suggests that offering whole genome sequencing to all children with cancer will provide more accurate information on diagnosis and prognosis, show whether there could be any hereditary cancer risk and help inform treatment options. The pilot study also showed that some of the important variants were difficult to spot among all the data produced by whole genome sequencing. Their significance might have been missed without the careful analysis and interpretation provided by an expert panel called a Genomic Tumour Advisory Board.Dr Tarpey added:  As we scale up whole genome sequencing to complement current standard-of-care testing for children with cancer, we need to ensure we optimise all the steps in this process to reduce turnaround times and keep financial costs down. Dr Julia Chisholm is Chair of the NCRI s Children s Group, based at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK, and was not involved in this research. She said:  Cancer is rare in children and thanks to research and better treatments, survival rates in the UK have doubled since the 1970s. This research shows that it s feasible and beneficial to analyse the whole genetic code in children diagnosed with cancer. Whole genome sequencing helps us to be more precise in tumour diagnosis and to tailor treatments to suit individual patients as accurately as possible. As this innovation is introduced more widely, we hope that even more children will survive cancer. This article has been republished from the following materials.

Diagnosis is usually made after considering other possible conditions (such as Crohn s disease or bowel cancer), with clinical tests coming back  normal . The condition often runs in families and is also more common among people who are prone to anxiety. The causes of IBS are not well understood, but an international team of researchers has now identified several genes that provide clues into the origins of IBS.The research team, including more than 40 institutions and coordinated by scientists in UK and Spain, looked at genetic data from 40,548 people who suffer with IBS from the UK Biobank and 12,852 from the Bellygenes initiative (a world-wide study aiming to identify genes linked to IBS) and compared them to 433,201 people without IBS (controls), focusing on individuals of European ancestry. The findings were repeated with de-identified data from the genomics company 23andMe Inc., provided by customers who have consented to research, by comparing 205,252 people with IBS to 1,384,055 controls.The results showed that overall, heritability of IBS (how much your genes influence the likelihood of developing a particular condition) is quite low, indicating the importance of environmental factors such as diet, stress and patterns of behaviour that may also be shared in the family environment.However, 6 genetic differences (influencing the genes NCAM1, CADM2, PHF2/FAM120A, DOCK9, CKAP2/TPTE2P3 and BAG6) were more common in people with IBS than in controls. As IBS symptoms affect the gut and bowel, it would be expected that genes associated with increased risk of IBS would be expressed there   but this is not what the researchers found. Instead, most of the altered genes appear to have more clear-cut roles in the brain and possibly the nerves which supply the gut, rather than the gut itself.Researchers also looked for overlap between susceptibility to IBS and other physical and mental health conditions. They found that the same genetic make-up that puts people at increased risk of IBS also increases the risk for common mood and anxiety disorders such as anxiety, depression, and neuroticism, as well as insomnia. However, the researchers stress that this doesn t mean that anxiety causes IBS symptoms or vice versa.Study co-senior investigator and consultant gastroenterologist Professor Miles Parkes from the University of Cambridge explained:  IBS is a common problem, and its symptoms are real and debilitating. Although IBS occurs more frequently in those who are prone to anxiety, we don t believe that one causes the other   our study shows these conditions have shared genetic origins, with the affected genes possibly leading to physical changes in brain or nerve cells that in turn cause symptoms in the brain and symptoms in the gut. The study also found that people with both IBS and anxiety were more likely to have been treated frequently with antibiotics during childhood. The study authors hypothesise that repeated use of antibiotics during childhood might increase the risk of IBS (and perhaps anxiety) by altering the  normal  gut flora (healthy bacteria that normally live in the gut) which in turn influence nerve cell development and mood.Current treatments for IBS vary widely and include dietary changes, prescription medications targeting the gut or brain, or behavioural interventions. Lead author Chris Eijsbouts from the University of Oxford suggests that discovering genes which contribute to IBS may aid in the development of new treatments in the long term. He said: ""Even genetic changes that have only subtle effects on IBS can provide clues about pathways to target therapeutically. Unlike the individual genetic changes themselves, drugs targeting the pathways they tell us about may have a considerable impact on the condition, as we know from other disease areas.""Co-senior investigator Dr Luke Jostins from the University Oxford commented:  We anticipate that future research will build on our discoveries, both by investigating the target genes identified and exploring the shared genetic risk across conditions to improve understanding of the disordered brain-gut interactions which characterise IBS. IBS represents a remarkable challenge for genetic studies. These initial findings have been long awaited, and finally tell us this type of research is worth the struggle,  added Ikerbasque Professor Mauro D Amato from CIC bioGUNE, co-senior investigator and coordinator of the Bellygenes initiative.This research received funding and support from National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centres in Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham and Manchester.

As a result, the doses administered must be high and only a small fraction reaches the brain, which can lead to significant systemic side effects.  To solve this issue, the postdoctoral researcher Jean-Michel Rabanel, under the supervison of Professor Charles Ramassamy, at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (NRS), is optimizing polymer-coated nanoparticles to increase their permeability across this barrier and consequently the delivery of encapsulated drugs in the brain.In their recent study, the team demonstrated the effectiveness of a specific polymer with zwitterion properties. These molecules are neutral overall, and have an equal number of positive and negative charges to mimic the molecules on the cell s surface. The researchers compared the characteristics of two polymer coatings on the polylactic acid (PLA) nanoparticles, a biocompatible material easily cleared by the body.Promising coatingsThe first coating, made of polyethylene glycol (PEG), had already been tested on the zebrafish, whose transparent body makes it possible to see the distribution of nanoparticles virtually in real time. The second coating, made of zwitterionic polymer, was compared under the same conditions. With this type of experiment, we demonstrated that the zwitterionic polymer, which in theory is more biocompatible since it s similar to molecules at the cell s surface, have a better access to the brain. However, it is more rapidly absorbed by blood vessel walls, which reduces their circulation time,  explained Professor Ramassamy.Thus, PEG remains the most attractive coating polymer with respect to the bloodstream, while the zwitterionic polymer would potentially result in a weaker immune system response. Professor Ramassamy pointed out that a mixture of both polymers could be considered to leverage the benefits of each.  Our findings demonstrate that the drug coating is a very important factor in the therapeutic use of nanoparticles. It s an interesting avenue for delivering drugs directly to the brain and improving the treatment for neurodegenerative diseases,  According to Soci t  Alzheimer de Qu bec, neurodegenerative diseases currently affect more than 565,000 Canadians, including 152,121 in Qu bec.Reference: Rabanel JM, Faivre J, Zaouter C, Patten SA, Banquy X, Ramassamy C.

Their latest research  Visible Light-driven conjunctive olefination  has been published today in Nature Chemistry.The invention of novel drugs and agrochemicals often involves investigation of several structural analogues to refine their bioactivity or other key chemical properties. Chemists often access these analogues through chemical modification of complex bioactive molecules, a process defined as  late-stage functionalisation . However, only a fraction of the possible analogues is accessible through traditional chemical methods, which often use toxic or expensive reagents and catalysts. Many catalysts rely on using heavy metals which are well-known environmental pollutants due to their toxicity, persistence in the environment, and bioaccumulative nature. Late-stage functionalisation is an important tool for drug design. This research offers a new approach that is very modular, practical and sustainable. This new approach will significantly expand the structures available to scientists and has the potential for extensive application in the design and production of new drugs.Dr Mattia Silvi led the research and said:  We have now discovered a fundamentally new approach to structurally modify bioactive molecules handling them as practically as if they were Lego building blocks. Our approach exploits the sustainable energy of visible light, avoids the use of heavy metals and has general applicability, thereby opening access to exceptional room for the design of new derivatives. The results of our study could significantly impact the way scientists design new analogues of complex bioactive molecules, providing a new a new powerful tool for the development of the medicines of tomorrow. This research also further demonstrates the exceptional potential of the use of visible-light energy in organic synthesis, that has impressively grown in the last decade, and is expected to continue to grow in the future, thereby opening new avenues for sustainable chemistry.

Danger signals released by damaged cells during inflammation play a role during this process.  Rewiring  the mitochondria in the macrophages protects them against overloading and can thus improve the way in which parts of damaged cells are eliminated and resolve the inflammatory reaction. The results were recently published in the journal  Immunity .Inflammation is a natural and vital response of our immune system to danger signals and tissue damage. Inflammatory processes help the body to eliminate the triggers, for example bacteria, and to initiate repair mechanisms. Terminating this inflammatory reaction quickly and in a coordinated manner is just as important, however, as otherwise there is a risk of developing chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn s disease. One of the important factors for resolving the inflammatory reaction is the elimination of damaged and dead cells, a process that was not very well understood until now. New inflammation can occur if these cells are allowed to accumulate.The findings of the FAU team could pave the way for new approaches for treating chronic inflammatory conditions.  It may be possible to accelerate and support the resolution of inflammatory processes in the long term by influencing the cell metabolism of the macrophages and deliberately uncoupling their mitochondria,  explains Prof. Gerhard Kr nke. Interestingly, substances that positively influence the cell metabolism of macrophages have already been discovered. However, they have not yet been approved for use in chronic inflammatory conditions and must undergo further clinical trials. The investigations and experiments were conducted as part of the DFG collaborative research centre CRC 1181  Switching points for resolving inflammation  and the DFG research group FOR2886 PANDORA (Pathways triggering Autoimmunity and Defining Onset of early Rheumatoid Arthritis).

The findings were published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study was led by Kelly Ten Hagen, Ph.D., a senior investigator at NIH s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR).Since the coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020, several more-infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have emerged. The original, or wild-type, virus was followed by the alpha variant, which became widespread in the United States in early 2021, and the delta variant, which is the most prevalent strain circulating today. The variants have acquired mutations that help them spread and infect people more easily. Many of the mutations affect the spike protein, which the virus uses to get into cells. Scientists have been trying to understand how these changes alter the virus s function. Throughout the pandemic, NIDCR researchers have applied their expertise in the oral health sciences to answer key questions about COVID-19,  said NIDCR Director Rena D Souza, D.D.S., Ph.D.  This study offers fresh insights into the greater infectivity of the alpha and delta variants and provides a framework for the development of future therapies. The outer surface of SARS-CoV-2 is decorated with spike proteins, which the virus uses to attach to and enter cells. Before this can happen, though, the spike protein must be activated by a series of cuts, or cleavages, by host proteins, starting with the furin enzyme. In the alpha and delta variants, mutations to the spike protein appear to enhance furin cleavage, which is thought to make the virus more effective at entering cells.Studies have shown that in some cases protein cleavage can be decreased by the addition of bulky sugar molecules a process carried out by enzymes called GALNTs next to the cleavage site. Ten Hagen s team wondered if this happens to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and if so, whether it changes the protein s function.To find out, the scientists studied the effects of GALNT activity on spike protein in fruit fly and mammalian cells. The experiments showed that one enzyme, GALNT1, adds sugars to wild-type spike protein, and this activity reduces furin cleavage. By contrast, mutations to the spike protein, like those in the alpha and delta variants, decrease GALNT1 activity and increase furin cleavage. This suggested that GALNT1 activity may partially suppress furin cleavage in wild-type virus, and that the alpha and delta mutations overcome this effect, allowing furin cleavage to go unchecked.Further experiments supported this idea. The researchers expressed either wild-type or mutated spike in cells grown in a dish. They observed the cells  tendency to fuse with their neighbors, a behavior that may facilitate spread of the virus during infection. The scientists found that cells expressing mutated spike protein fused with neighbors more often than cells with the wild-type version. Cells with wild-type spike also fused less in the presence of GALNT1, suggesting that its activity may limit spike protein function. Our findings indicate that the alpha and delta mutations overcome the dampening effect of GALNT1 activity, which may enhance the virus s ability to get into cells,  said Ten Hagen.To see if this process might also occur in people, the team analyzed RNA expression in cells from healthy volunteers. The researchers found wide expression of GALNT1 in lower and upper respiratory tract cells that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that the enzyme could influence infection in humans. The scientists theorized that individual differences in GALNT1 expression could affect viral spread. This study suggests that GALNT1 activity may modulate viral infectivity and provides insight into how mutations in the alpha and delta variants may influence this,  Ten Hagen said. The knowledge could inform future efforts to develop new interventions.Reference: Zhang L, Mann M, Syed ZA, et al. Furin cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is modulated by O-glycosylation.

Roffo Cancer Institute.The study, published Nov. 5 in Science Advances, reported the results of administering arginine, which can be delivered in oral form, prior to standard radiation therapy in 31 patients who had brain metastases. Nearly 78 percent had a complete or partial response in their brain tumors over the follow-up period of up to four years, while only 22 percent of the 32 patients who received a placebo prior to radiotherapy had such a response.The trial was designed to gauge the effectiveness of arginine as a  radiosensitizer  that enhances the effects of radiation treatment. However, the results, and arginine s apparent mechanism of action, suggest that the amino acid might be useful more broadly as an anticancer therapy. Based on these findings we should continue to investigate arginine in combination with radiotherapy but also in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and even arginine on its own,  said senior author Dr. Leandro Cerchietti, an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, who participated in designing and implementing the trial at Angel H. Roffo Cancer Institute in Argentina where he was an attending oncologist. The trial was co-led by Dr. Alfredo Navigante at the Roffo Cancer Institute.Arginine, also called L-arginine, is inexpensive and widely available, generally considered safe, and can get relatively easily from the bloodstream into the brain. The idea of using it to treat cancer arose from observations that tumors often aid their own survival by producing high levels of the related molecule nitric oxide (NO). The latter regulates multiple processes in the body including the flow of blood through blood vessels, and tumors cells often make more NO by upregulating their production of special enzymes called NO synthases, which synthesize NO from arginine.Reducing NO production is one possible way of exploiting tumors  dependence on this molecule, but hasn t worked well, in part because of adverse side effects. The investigators hypothesized that boosting NO production instead by adding its precursor arginine might be beneficial, because while tumors can use NO to aid their growth and survival, they must keep its production below certain limits. Nitric oxide is a reactive molecule that on its own, or through other reactive molecules derived from it, can stress and damage a cell so a cell can tolerate only so much of it,  said study lead author Dr. Rossella Marullo, an instructor in medicine in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Weill Cornell Medicine.Overloading a high-NO tumor with much more NO prior to radiation treatment could weaken the tumor s ability to repair radiation-induced DNA damage, she added and indeed her preclinical experiments in mice confirmed this effect.In the clinical trial, patients were treated with high-dose arginine or placebo oral suspensions an hour before radiotherapy for their brain metastases tumors in the brain that represent the spread from primary tumors elsewhere, such as the lungs.Six months after their courses of radiotherapy, 82 percent of the arginine group had improvement, or at least no worsening, of their neurological symptoms, compared with 20 percent in the placebo group. Most of the arginine-treated patients who died during the study did so because of their cancers  spread elsewhere in the body.Moreover, although metastatic cancer usually has a dire prognosis, there were some arginine-treated patients whose tumors in and outside the brain disappeared, suggesting the possibility of cures.Evidence from this study and prior research also suggests that arginine can not only directly hobble tumor cells but also boost the activity of antitumor immune cells, Dr. Cerchietti said.The promising results have prompted the team to start and plan further studies of arginine on its own or in combination with other anticancer treatments. In principle any tumor that overexpresses NO-producing enzymes would be vulnerable to arginine treatment and such tumors are very common,  said Dr. Cerchietti, who is also a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine. He cautions that further studies are needed and patients should consult their doctor about the use of any supplements outside of a clinical trial. The doses of arginine used in this study are available in formulations that can be only obtained at a medical facility.Reference: Marullo R, Castro M, Yomtoubian S, et al.

We found that suicidal ideation is not just related simply to severity of depression,  said J. John Mann, MD, senior author and the Paul Janssen Professor of Translational Neuroscience (in Psychiatry and in Radiology) at Columbia University.  There are other reasons, including cognitive improvements that are related to a decline in suicidal ideation and thereby make those who are suicidal safer.  When they began the five-year trials, Columbia researchers knew that anesthetic ketamine, in much lower doses where it has no anesthetic effect, rapidly reduced depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in some patients. But they wanted to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind this effect and decided to examine the drug s impact on neurocognitive performance. Study found improved cognition appeared quicklyResearchers followed 78 participants suffering with major depressive disorder and clinically significant suicidal ideation and found that a standard dose of ketamine given intravenously produced a rapid improvement of suicidal thoughts in some individuals, and part of this improvement was correlated with and improvement in problem-solving and thinking more clearly.  This improvement in neurocognition and suicidal ideation occurred even when some of these individuals did not show comparable improvement in depressive symptoms.  Our study helped us gain a better understanding of how ketamine works in the brain and how quickly it can improve distorted thinking,  said Ravi. N. Shah, MD, Chief Innovation Officer, Columbia Psychiatry.  Being able to think more clearly can make someone feel less suicidal. The study compared the effects of intravenously administered ketamine not yet approved by the FDA but provided off-label at treatment centers throughout the country to midazolam, a sedative prescribed for anxiety and depression. It found greater cognitive improvements in thinking and reasoning in those who were given the ketamine. Suicidal thinking diminished for six weeks with one ketamine treatmentParticipants in the study who responded positively to the ketamine treatment continued to do well for up to six weeks after they were given an initial infusion in conjunction with other antidepressants that were tailored to the needs of each specific patient. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for those ages 10-34 and the 10th leading cause of death overall in the United States. Dr. Mann said since 90 percent of those who die by suicide in the U.S. have a psychiatric illness and 60 percent of those people suffer a major depressive episode before a suicide attempt, it would be a major benefit if ketamine could be used to lessen suicidal risk.Approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use in 1970, ketamine was first used as an anesthetic to treat injured soldiers during in the Vietnam War, but it soon became notorious as a party drug, nicknamed Special K, used illicitly in clubs for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. But research into the drug's potential as a treatment for depression and antidote to suicidal thoughts continued, and in 2019 the FDA approved intra-nasal spray esketamine, derived from ketamine, to be used in conjunction with an oral depressant in adults with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine is clearly changing functioning of important neurotransmitter systems in many key areas of the brain, and further study of ketamine and other drugs like it could lead to new mental health treatments, the researchers said. However, more research is needed to determine why some people respond to ketamine which alters the release of glutamate that regulates much of the nervous system and helps the brain rewire itself by creating new connections and pathways and other patients do not. Since neuropsychological risks of long-term repeated ketamine treatments are unknown, researchers said further study is needed. Designing rapid-acting antidepressants like ketamine without the side effects of  tripping  or out-of-body experiences that could be taken in pill form at home instead of in a clinical setting, is also important, Mann said.Reference: Keilp JG, Madden SP, Marver JE, et al.

The findings could help improve many important processes in energy, environmental, and industrial sectors from oil recovery to groundwater remediation.The fluids in question are called polymer solutions. These solutions everyday examples of which include cosmetic creams and the mucus in our noses contain dissolved polymers, or materials made of large molecules with many repeating subunits. Typically, when they're put under pressure, polymer solutions become less viscous and flow faster. But when going through materials with lots of tiny holes and channels, the solutions tend to become more viscous and gunky, reducing their flow rates. To get at the root of the problem, the Princeton researchers devised an innovative experiment using a see-through porous medium made of tiny glass beads a transparent artificial rock. This lucid medium allowed the researchers to visualize a polymer solution s movement. The experiment revealed that the long-baffling increase in viscosity in porous media happens because the polymer solution's flow becomes chaotic, much like turbulent air on an airplane ride, swirling into itself and gumming up the works. ""Surprisingly, until now, it has not been possible to predict the viscosity of polymer solutions flowing in porous media,"" said Sujit Datta, an assistant professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Princeton and senior author of the study appearing Nov. 5 in the journal Science Advances. ""But in this paper, we've now finally shown these predictions can be made, so we've found an answer to a problem that has eluded researchers for over a half-century."" ""With this study, we finally made it possible to see exactly what is happening underground or within other opaque, porous media when polymer solutions are being pumped through,"" said Christopher Browne, a Ph.D. student in Datta's lab and the paper s lead author. Browne ran the experiments and built the experimental apparatus, a small rectangular chamber randomly packed with tiny borosilicate glass beads. The setup, akin to an artificial sedimentary rock, spanned only about half the length of a pinky finger. Into this faux rock, Browne pumped in a common polymer solution laced with fluorescent latex microparticles to help see the solution's flow around the beads. The researchers formulated the polymer solution so the material s refractive index offset light distortion from the beads and made the whole setup transparent when saturated. Datta's lab has innovatively used this technique to create see-through soil for studying ways to counter agricultural droughts, among other investigations. Browne then zoomed in with a microscope on the pores, or holes between the beads, which occur on the scale of 100 micrometers (millionths of a meter) in size, or similar to the width of a human hair, in order to examine the fluid flow through each pore. As the polymer solution worked its way through the porous medium, the fluid's flow became chaotic, with the fluid crashing back into itself and generating turbulence. What s surprising is that, typically, fluid flows at these speeds and in such tight pores is not turbulent, but  laminar : the fluid moves smoothly and steadily. As the polymers navigated the pore space, however, they stretched out, generating forces that accumulated and generated turbulent flow in different pores. This effect grew more pronounced when pushing the solution through at higher pressures. ""I was able to see and record all these patchy regions of instability, and these regions really impact the transport of the solution through the medium,"" said Browne. The Princeton researchers used data gathered from the experiment to formulate a way to predict the behavior of polymer solutions in real-life situations. Gareth McKinley, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the study, offered comments on its significance. ""This study shows definitively that the large increase in the macroscopically observable pressure drop across a porous medium has its microscopic physical origins in viscoelastic flow instabilities that occur on the pore scale of the porous medium,"" McKinley said. Given that viscosity is one of the most fundamental descriptors of fluid flow, the findings not only help deepen understanding of polymer solution flows and chaotic flows in general, but also provide quantitative guidelines to inform their applications at large scales in the field. ""The new insights we have generated could help practitioners in diverse settings determine how to formulate the right polymer solution and use the right pressures needed to carry out the task at hand,"" said Datta. ""We're particularly excited about the findings' application in groundwater remediation."" Because polymer solutions are inherently goopy, environmental engineers inject the solutions into the ground at highly contaminated sites such as abandoned chemical factories and industrial plants. The viscous solutions help push out trace contaminants from the affected soils. Polymer solutions likewise aid in oil recovery by pushing oil out of the pores in underground rocks. On the remediation side, polymer solutions enable ""pump and treat,"" a common method for cleaning up groundwater polluted with industrial chemicals and metals that involves bringing the water to a surface treatment station. ""All these applications of polymer solutions, and more, such as in separations and manufacturing processes, stand to benefit from our findings,"" said Datta. Overall, the new findings on polymer solution flow rates in porous media brought together ideas from multiple fields of scientific inquiry, ultimately disentangling what had started out as a long-frustrating, complex problem. ""This work draws connections between studies of polymer physics, turbulence, and geoscience, following the flow of fluids in rocks underground as well as through aquifers,"" said Datta. ""It's a lot of fun sitting at the interface between all these different disciplines.""ReferenceBrowne CA, Datta SS. Elastic turbulence generates anomalous flow resistance in porous media. Sci.

While highly accurate and sensitive, such diagnostics are time consuming and require specialized laboratory equipment, limiting their use to health and specialized facilities. SENSR is designed to simplify the SARS-CoV-2 detection process with a goal of eventual adaptation for in-home use.While the Cas9 enzyme has been used extensively in CRISPR genetic engineering research, scientists have recently employed other enzymes such as the Cas12a and Cas13a for the development of highly accurate CRISPR-based diagnostics. Developed in a similar vein, SENSR is the first SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic to leverage the Cas13d enzyme (specifically a ribonuclease effector called  CasRx ).The researchers believe that in order to maximize CRISPR s capabilities and expand the genetics-based diagnostics pipeline, any Cas enzymes that can complement or supplement existing systems should be explored. CRISPR has significantly advanced our capabilities for rapid identification of infected individuals and offers point-of-care testing in low-resource settings that previously wasn t possible,  said UC San Diego Biological Sciences Professor Omar Akbari, the study s senior author.  SENSR further opens the toolbox for CRISPR diagnostic systems and will help detect emerging pathogens before they become pandemics. In developing SENSR, Akbari s molecular genetics lab worked in conjunction with Professor Elizabeth Komives  lab in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry (Division of Physical Sciences) to purify SENSR proteins and Rob Knight s lab in the Department of Pediatrics (School of Medicine and Center for Microbiome Innovation) to test SARS-CoV-2 samples.SENSR is one of the latest developments in UC San Diego s innovative approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The university s nationally recognized science-based Return to Learn strategy for campus safety includes Knight s groundbreaking wastewater screening program that enabled early detection of 85% of COVID-19 cases on campus. With nearly 10,000 students on campus in the current academic year, the Return to Learn program s strategy, which includes high vaccination rates, has led to a COVID-19 case rate of less than 1%, becoming a model for other academic institutions.Early tests in SENSR s development demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 detection in less than an hour. The researchers note in the paper that further development is needed, but the technology has the potential to become a  powerful molecular diagnostic with numerous applications. Eventually, Akbari envisions SENSR becoming important in locations such as airports so that passengers can quickly determine whether they might be carrying a virus. We need to keep innovating in the detect-and-protect arena to come up with more tools so when there is another pandemic, we will have scalable point-of-care diagnostics systems in place for rapid distribution,"" said Akbari.Reference: Brogan DJ, Chaverra-Rodriguez D, Lin CP, et al.

Cut back on sweets, pastries, fried foods and processed meat. According to a new study published this month, reducing these foods in our diet is not only better for our health but also the planet.Australia and New Zealand households eat more discretionary and junk foods than recommended by dietary guidelines, contributing to food-related greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) and other environmental impacts. University of South Australia (UniSA) dietitian Sara Forbes, who led a review examining 20 studies on the environmental impacts of food consumption in both countries, says the findings highlight the need for more sustainable dietary choices. According to a Federal Government report released in 2020,  Australia emitted an estimated 510 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, with food-related emissions accounting for 14.2 per cent of this total. The report found that the average Australian produces the equivalent of 19.7kg of carbon dioxide each day via their diets. Another report from 2017 found that food waste comprises approximately six per cent of Australia s GHGe, considering the water, energy and pesticides used in food production and packaging that ends up in landfill, where it releases even more methane as it decomposes. Unlike New Zealand, current Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) do not consider environmental impacts of food and need to be updated, researchers say. These core foods are estimated to contribute between 67-73 per cent of total food-related GHGe in Australia, with meat, grains and dairy contributing the most emissions. Fruit and vegetables are two of the lowest contributors. Non-core or  discretionary  foods include sugar-sweetened drinks, alcohol, confectionary and processed meats, accounting for between 27-33 per cent of food-related GHGe. While the percentage is lower than core food emissions, the fact that Australians are consuming large amounts of avoidable energy-rich, nutrient-poor foods is not helping the environment. In New Zealand, the highest greenhouse gas emitters are meat, seafood and eggs (35 per cent), followed by highly processed foods such as pastries and ice cream (34 per cent). Other studies examined the environmental impacts of water use in food production. Australian irrigators soak up eight million megalitres of water each year to grow crops, but the majority are exported, making it difficult to accurately reflect the nation s water footprint. The researchers assessed 20 articles in their study, published in the past decade, with varying findings. Despite the differences, clear trends emerged.  Discretionary foods have a higher cropland, water scarcity and Ecological Footprint. Meat also emits greenhouse gases, although its water scarcity footprint is lower compared to dairy products, cereals, grains, fruit and vegetables,  Forbes says.  It is time we better acknowledged the environmental impacts of the type and amount of food we eat, considering the planet as well as our health.  By 2050, the world s population is projected to reach 10 billion people. There is no way we can feed that amount of people unless we change the way we eat and produce food.  Worldwide, food consumption and production account for one quarter of total global emissions. Half of the world s habitable land is used for agriculture which has led to a 60 per cent biodiversity loss. Furthermore, an estimated two thirds of the world s freshwater is used for irrigation.ReferenceForbes S, Bicknell E, Guilovica L, Wingrove K, Charlton K.

The ""Panoramix"" research project is inter alia looking into whether mixtures of different substances have harmful effects on unborn and developing children that are not adequately covered by the existing assessment system. The project, led by the Technical University of Denmark, will run for four years and is supported by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 programme with  4.4 million. Panoramix does not involve animal testing.In the project, extracts from drinking water, food and umbilical cord blood, are inter alia examined for possible harmful effects using in vitro methods that do not involve animal experiments. The focus is on effects that impair the child's development of the nervous system or reproductive ability before and also after birth. Samples, in which the in vitro tests indicate an effect, are analysed further and the substances in the sample that contribute most to a possible health hazard are identified.The information obtained in this way will inter alia be compared with data obtained in the ""Odense Child Cohort"" project. The aim of this long-term project is to study environmental influences on early child development. Between 2010 and 2012, blood samples were taken from the parents of over 2,500 pregnancies at the University Hospital in the Danish municipality of Odense. The development of the children born from these pregnancies has been monitored medically ever since. The researchers want to use Panoramix to find out whether certain environmental mixtures already affecting the unborn child in the womb can cause long-term effects that are not adequately covered by the existing system of risk assessment based on the testing of individual substances. At the same time, for a number of substances analytical limit values shall be derived at which, if complied with, damage to health   also via possible combination effects   is unlikely.

The most basic of these molecules are amino acids, the building blocks for peptides, which in turn combine to form proteins. However, there is still much to learn about how  and where   a particular set of instructions are encoded.Now, bringing a computer science approach to a life science problem, an interdisciplinary team of Penn researchers have used a carefully designed algorithm to discover a new suite of antimicrobial peptides, hiding deep within this code.The study, published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, was led by C sar de la Fuente, Presidential Assistant Professor in Bioengineering, Microbiology, Psychiatry, and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, spanning both Penn Engineering and Penn Medicine, and his postdocs Marcelo Torres and Marcelo Melo. Collaborators Orlando Crescenzi and Eugenio Notomista of the University of Naples Federico II also contributed to this work. The human body is a treasure trove of information, a biological dataset. By using the right tools, we can mine for answers to some of the most challenging questions,  says de la Fuente.  We use the word  encrypted  to describe the antimicrobial peptides we found because they are hidden within larger proteins that seem to have no connection to the immune system, the area where we expect to find this function. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, naturally occurring molecules, produced by almost every living organism. Because of their ability to defend the body from infection, identifying new AMPs has been an active area of research, but traditional search methods, mostly based on chemical intuition and experimentation, have limited the discovery of peptide antibiotics beyond conventional AMPs. In this study, we applied a new way of using AI for antibiotic discovery in previously unrecognized places. What better place to start than by exploring our very own biological information, the collection of genes and proteins that make us who we are,  says de la Fuente.The researchers  approach started with the physiochemical characteristics all AMPs have in common: They are 8 to 50 amino acids in length, positively charged, and possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. This new method operates like a search function to identify peptides with antimicrobial properties in genomes and proteomes. Imagine you want to find a specific word in a huge Word document such as an encyclopedia. You would simply use the search function, set the parameters for the text you are looking for, and the algorithm would rapidly highlight all of the areas in the document that match,  says de la Fuente.  That s essentially the approach we took when searching for new antibiotics. We knew the sort of molecules we were looking for, and utilized the algorithm to act like a search function to find them throughout the human body .The algorithm searched the proteome, the complete set of proteins in the body, and returned 43,000 peptides of 8 to 50 amino acids in length, many of which were found in a new region of the proteome all together. This wide scope of potential antimicrobials was then filtered to 2,603 peptides based on their fitness function inclusive of all the parameters.To validate the antimicrobial properties of these algorithm-derived peptides, 55 were synthesized and exposed to eight different pathogens including E. coli and bacteria that cause staph infection and pneumonia. We found that 63.6% of these 55 encrypted peptides displayed antimicrobial activity,  says de la Fuente.  Interestingly, these peptides not only fought off infection by some of the most harmful bacteria in the world, they also targeted gut and skin commensal organisms that are beneficial to us. We speculate that this could be indicative of a microbiota modulating role that these peptides may possess as well. The team also tested the ability of the peptides to act synergistically and found that cocktails of peptides derived from the same biogeographic area within the body were able to potentiate their individual ability to fight off infection by 100-fold. This synergistic effect is likely already happening in our bodies,  says de la Fuente.  Some of the peptides discovered by our algorithm exhibited antimicrobial activity at levels that are physiologically relevant. These molecules are found throughout the body, including the immune system. A surprising finding was that these peptides were not only encoded in the immune system but were also found in the digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems, for example, indicating that fighting off infections caused by invading organisms may be a more holistic approach than previously thought. When tested in vivo in relevant preclinical mouse models, these peptides again proved to fend off infection, decreasing the bacterial load by three orders of magnitude, an ability on par with known potent antibiotics and AMPs. Additionally, using these peptides as antibiotics in the mouse models did not lead to any signs of toxicity.As one of the main concerns of antibiotic discovery, bacterial resistance was the next challenge the researchers addressed. Because these encrypted peptides have potential to be applied as natural antibiotics, we need to understand how they influence the mutation of bacteria to understand if they will promote resistance,  says de la Fuente.  What we found was that these encrypted molecules attack bacteria by permeating their outer membranes, an integral organelle for survival. This more damaging membrane permeation would require a great amount of energy and multiple generations of mutations to create resistance in bacteria, indicating that these newly discovered peptides are good candidates for sustainable antibiotics. By understanding that certain proteins under certain circumstances can be cleaved to secrete encrypted peptides, we can improve our understanding of the human body s ability to naturally protect itself against infection while conserving energy at the genomic level, where one gene encodes for one protein, which can perform many useful functions beyond its initial physiological role. This work highlights that every organism is a dataset of code to which AI can be applied to find relevant molecules,  says de la Fuente.  This tool can potentially be applied to  omes  other than the genome and proteome, such as the transcriptome and metabolome, to quickly and thoroughly search a wide range of places for those molecules, whether they be antimicrobial, anti-cancer or anti-viral, opening new doors in many areas of drug discovery and molecular research.

The research team examined underwater photos, video, drone footage, and witness reports to find 47 instances of fish rubbing themselves against a shark s skin. The chafing events, which were documented in 13 locations around the world, varied in duration from eight seconds to over five minutes. They recorded 12 fin fish chafing against eight different species of shark, including great whites. The team even documented silky sharks chafing on the head of a whale shark. The number of fish chafing against sharks ranged from one to over 100 individuals at a time. While chafing has been well documented between fish and inanimate objects, such as sand or rocky substrate, this shark-chaffing phenomenon appears to be the only scenario in nature where prey actively seek out and rubs up against a predator,  said UM Rosenstiel School graduate student Lacey Williams, who co-led the study with fellow graduate student Alexandra Anstett.Using aerial drone surveys in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, Williams and Anstett documented 25 occurrences of a leervis fish turning to chafe against a passing great white shark. While we don t exactly know why it s happening, we have a few theories. Shark skin is covered in small tooth-like scales called dermal denticles, which provide a rough sandpaper surface for the chafing fish,  said UM Rosenstiel School research associate professor and study co-author Neil Hammerschlag.  We suspect that chafing against shark skin might play a vital role in the removal of parasites or other skin irritants, thus improving fish health and fitness.

One of the most common is neuropathic pain, or pain caused by damage to the nervous system. Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most prevalent neurological problem in HIV infection, affecting 50 percent of all HIV patients. Most persons with DSP describe sensations of numbness, tingling, burning and stinging in their hands or feet, which impair daily functioning and can lead to unemployment and depression.Previous research on DSP has mostly focused on the peripheral nervous system, but nerve injury cannot fully explain the wide variability in DSP symptoms. Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and University of California San Francisco instead looked at the brain to see how it may be contributing to patients  pain.In a new study, published online October 29, 2021 in Brain Communications, the team observed unique patterns of brain activity in HIV-DSP patients when they experienced a painful stimulus. Compared to other patients with HIV, those with DSP showed increased activity in the anterior insula, a brain area involved in predicting and emotionally processing pain. The anterior insula is trying to predict the future for you,  said senior author Alan Simmons, PhD, professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and research scientist at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.  It s forming expectations about what is about to happen to you and how you re going to feel. These expectations of pain play an important role in determining how much pain you then actually experience. Participants in the study received painful thermal stimuli on their feet or hands while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A visual cue let them know when a painful stimulus was coming, and once it began, a numerical countdown displayed how much longer the stimulus would last. Heat was delivered for either six or 16 seconds at a temperature that participants deemed to be similarly painful in prior tests.First author Irina Strigo, PhD, professor of psychiatry at UC San Francisco and research biologist at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, compared the patients  brain activity at the start of the short and long pain trials. The stimulus intensity was no different in either case, but when patients knew it was going to last longer, the anterior insula became more active. This enhanced insular activity and reduced pain relief was also specific to the trials when pain was delivered to the neuropathic limb. This lets you know that a key aspect of pain in neuropathy is your reaction to the idea that the pain is going to last,  said Simmons.  If you know the pain will be short, you brace and absorb it but it doesn t dramatically burden you. On the other hand, if you learn the pain will be ongoing and inescapable, your brain will react to that and perceive the pain as overwhelming. Simmons suggests that these patients  brains have been conditioned by their repeated pain to become increasingly emotionally distressed by it, and these differences in how they perceive their pain and expect it to manifest contribute to why it becomes a chronic experience.What does this mean for HIV-DSP patients? Another finding in the study may hint at a solution. The researchers found a different pattern in the patients  anterior cingulate cortex, a brain area involved in regulating subjective feelings of pain unpleasantness. The higher their cingulate activity was, the less they said their pain interfered with their daily lives. Reducing anterior insula activity or increasing cingulate activity may thus improve pain outcomes for HIV-DSP patients. Once the pain signal reaches the brain, the insula starts telling you,  This is going to be long and overwhelming,  but the cingulate can turn down the dial on that,  said Simmons. Physicians may eventually use advanced tools to modulate brain activity in these areas, but in the meantime, Simmons says simple breathing and mindfulness practices may help. Perhaps even just being more aware that your emotions and expectations affect your experience of pain will help people engage these regulators in their brain.

The study suggests that the built environment, green space and air pollution can affect cognitive and motor function in children.According to numerous studies, the urban environment can influence neurodevelopment from conception onwards, for example through exposure to air pollution. However, previous research has not evaluated the impact of multiple exposure groups simultaneously using an early-life exposome approach.A team from the European HELIX project, coordinated by ISGlobal, set out to analyse the impact of 13 urban exposures on the cognitive and motor function of nearly 5,500 children in seven European urban areas Bradford, United Kingdom; Nancy and Poitiers, France; Gipuzkoa, Sabadell and Valencia, Spain; and Heraklion, Greece using data from the birth cohorts Born in Bradford, EDEN, the INMA Environment and Childhood Project, and RHEA, respectively.The new study, published in Environment International, analysed urban residential exposures from pregnancy until age three years. The analysed factors include the built environment (building density, proximity to public transport, facility richness, etc.), natural spaces, and air pollution from nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Cognitive function (verbal and non-verbal abilities) and motor function (fine and gross motor functions) were assessed using validated tests when the children were four to five years old.The findings showed that exposure to some built environment design factors, natural spaces and air pollution was associated with children s cognitive and motor function at five years of age. Specifically, higher exposure to greenness within 300 metres of the home during pregnancy was associated with higher verbal abilities. In contrast, greater connectivity (density of street intersections) and land use diversity during pregnancy were associated with lower verbal abilities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the negative impact of some factors of the built environment on children s verbal abilities  commented ISGlobal researcher Anne-Claire Binter, lead author of the study. ""In previous studies, the land use diversity has been associated with positive health effects, so more studies are needed to interpret these results,"" she adds.As for air pollution, in line with previous research, greater exposure to fine particulate matter during pregnancy was associated with lower scores on tests of fine motor function.  During pregnancy, the placenta and the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain and spinal cord, are still immature defence systems and provide only partial protection to the foetus against environmental pollutants,  explained Binter.The study also confirmed the mediating effect of air pollution on the association between green space and verbal skills. In other words,  natural environments could have a beneficial effect on cognitive development by reducing the harmful effects of air pollution,  explained study coordinator M nica Guxens, director of the INMA Project. Beyond urban green space the health benefits of which have already been demonstrated by previous research our findings suggest that other urban characteristics should be considered when studying environmental exposures that may affect children s cognitive function,  noted Guxens.  The health of the population especially the most vulnerable groups, such as children should form the basis of urban planning,  she concluded.Reference: Binter AC, Bernard JY, Mon-Williams M, et al.

But a new study from Weill Cornell Medicine researchers, in collaboration with the University of Arizona, suggests that greater cumulative exposure to estrogen in life, for example from having had more children or from having taken menopause hormone therapy, may counter this brain-shrinking effect.The findings, reported Nov. 3 in Neurology, come from an analysis of personal histories, MRI scans and cognitive tests on 99 women in their late 40s to late 50s. The researchers confirmed an earlier finding linking menopause to lower gray matter volume (GMV) in brain areas that are also vulnerable to Alzheimer s. But they also linked indicators of higher overall estrogen exposure, such as a longer span of reproductive years (menarche to menopause), more children and the use of menopause hormone therapy and hormonal contraceptives, to higher GMV in some of these brain areas.The study was an observational study rather than a clinical trial, but it adds to the evidence that estrogen may have a protective effect on the female brain, limiting the loss of gray matter that normally comes with menopause, and thereby potentially reducing Alzheimer s risk. Our findings suggest that while the menopause transition may bring vulnerability for the female brain, other reproductive history events indicating greater estrogen exposure bring resilience instead,  said study senior author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, an associate professor of neuroscience in neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine and director of the Women s Brain Initiative, and associate director of the Alzheimer s Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.Researchers estimate that nearly two thirds of those living with Alzheimer s in the United States are women. The higher prevalence of Alzheimer s in women may be due in part to women s greater longevity, among other reasons. A leading hypothesis is that that vulnerability relates to estrogen.Receptors for estrogen molecules are found in cells throughout women s brains, and the sex hormone has long been known not just to help steer brain development and behavior but also generally to have a nourishing and protecting role in the central nervous system. That protection doesn t last forever, though. Estrogen levels decline steeply during the transition through menopause, and as recent research from Dr. Mosconi and others has shown, women tend to experience significant GMV loss during this transition.The volume loss occurs especially in brain regions that are the most heavily affected in Alzheimer s, and at roughly the same time of life when the long, slow process of late-onsetAlzheimer s is believed to start. Thus, women s mid-life loss of estrogen may be a key factor behind the higher risk of Alzheimer s.The flip side of this hypothesis is that more estrogen, in particular a cumulatively greater estrogen exposure, could serve as a counter to the brain-weakening effect of menopause. That possibility is what Dr. Mosconi and her team sought to investigate in the new study.The analysis covered 99 women aged 46-58 and a comparison group of 29 similarly aged men. It confirmed that the post-menopausal and peri-menopausal (starting menopause) women, compared with the pre-menopausal women and the men, had significantly lower GMV adjusted for age and head size in brain areas such as the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and temporal lobe regions, which are heavily affected by Alzheimer s.By contrast, among the women, having more estrogen exposure as implied by various factors was associated with greater GMV in certain brain areas. Longer reproductive span, for example, was significantly linked to more GMV in a cluster of regions near the top of the brain including the superior parietal lobule and precuneus of the left hemisphere. Having had more children was significantly associated with more GMV in inferior and middle frontal gyri, and middle and inferior temporal gyri. Having used hormone replacement therapy was associated with more GMV in superior frontal gyrus and several other brain regions. All these brain regions are known to be affected by aging and Alzheimer s.The results support the idea that estrogen can be protective, the researchers say, and suggest that further investigation of the specific biological pathways underlying this effect could yield medical or lifestyle changes that help women reduce their risk of cognitive decline with aging as well as Alzheimer s dementia risk. We re hoping now to get further into the details of these links between estrogen and GMV, for example by comparing the effects of surgical menopause and spontaneous menopause, and by focusing specifically on certain types of estrogen exposure, such as menopause hormone therapy,  said study first author Eva Schelbaum, research assistant in Dr. Mosconi s laboratory.  The goal as always is to understand why Alzheimer s affects more women than men, and how we can reduce that risk.Reference: Schelbaum E, Loughlin L, Jett S, et al.

The researchers published their proof-of-concept in Science today. The new single-molecule peptide reader marks a breakthrough in protein identification, and opens the way towards single-molecule protein sequencing and cataloguing the proteins inside a single cell.Proteins are the workhorses of our cells, yet we simply don t know what proteins we all carry with us. A protein is a long peptide string made of 20 different types of amino acids, comparable to a necklace with different kinds of beads. From the DNA blueprint, we are able to predict of which amino acids a protein consists. However, the final protein can greatly differ from the blueprint, for example due to post-translational modifications. Current methods to measure proteins are expensive, limited to large volumes, and they cannot detect many rare proteins. With nanopore-based technology, one is already able to scan and sequence single DNA molecules. The team led by Cees Dekker (TU Delft) now adapted this technique to instead scan a single protein, one amino acid at a time. Over the past 30 years, nanopore-based DNA sequencing has been developed from an idea to an actual working device,  Cees Dekker explains.  This has even led to commercial hand-held nanopore sequencers that serve the billion-dollar genomics market. In our paper, we are expanding this nanopore concept to the reading of single proteins. This may have great impact on basic protein research and medical diagnostics.  ","Published: November 5, 2021"

Last year, researcher Randi Gr nnestad received a great deal of attention for her research carried out at the Gran sen Ski Centre in Trondheim, Norway. She found hormonal disorders and changes in the brains of bank voles in the area and linked them to fluorine-containing compounds called PFAS. Previously we showed that these PFAS most likely originate from the use of fluorinated glide wax,  said Gr nnestad, who took her PhD from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU) Department of Biology.The fluorinated compounds end up in the environment at the popular ski area, and the substances never degrade and disappear. They are also linked to several adverse health effects in humans. Bank voles can ingest PFAS through food, such as earthworms. The voles at Gran sen had higher levels of PFAS in their bodies along with higher levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in their brains. The male voles also had lower levels of the hormone testosterone. This article has been republished from materials provided by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

This is the Doppler effect. When a jet aircraft s speed exceeds the speed of sound (about 760 mph), the pressure it exerts upon the air produces a shock wave which can be heard as a loud supersonic boom or thunderclap; this is the Mach effect. Scientists from Loughborough, Nottingham, Manchester, Lancaster and Kansas universities have discovered that a quantum mechanical version of these phenomena occurs in an electronic transistor made from high purity graphene. Their new publication, Graphene s non-equilibrium fermions reveal Doppler-shifted magnetophonon resonances accompanied by Mach supersonic and Landau velocity effects, has been published today in Nature Communications. Graphene is frequently referred to as a  wonder  material. It is over 100 times stronger than steel while being extremely light, over 100 times more conductive than silicon and has the lowest electrical resistivity at room temperature of all known materials. These properties make graphene well suited for a range of applications, including coatings to improve touch screens in phones and tablets and to enhance the speed of electronic circuits. The research team used strong electric and magnetic fields to accelerate a stream of electrons in an atomically-thin graphene monolayer composed of a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms. At a sufficiently high current density, equivalent to around 100 billion amps per square meter passing through the single atomic layer of carbon, the electron stream reaches a speed of 14 kilometers per second (around 30,000mph) and starts to shake the carbon atoms, thus emitting quantised bundles of sound energy called acoustic phonons. This phonon emission is detected as a resonant increase in the electrical resistance of the transistor; a supersonic boom is observed in graphene. The researchers also observed a quantum mechanical analogue of the Doppler effect at lower currents when energetic electrons jump between quantised cyclotron orbits and emit acoustic phonons with a Doppler-like up-shift or down-shift of their frequencies, depending on the direction of the sound waves relative to that of the speeding electrons. By cooling their graphene transistor to liquid helium temperature, the team detected a third phenomenon in which the electrons interact with each other through their electrical charge and make  phononless  jumps between quantised energy levels at a critical speed, the so-called Landau velocity. Loughborough's Dr Mark Greenaway, one of the authors of the paper, said:  It is fantastic to observe all of these effects simultaneously in a graphene monolayer.  It is due to graphene s excellent electronic properties that allow us to investigate these out-of-equilibrium quantum processes in detail and understand how electrons in graphene, accelerated by a strong electric field, scatter and lose their energy.  The Landau velocity is a quantum property of superconductors and superfluid helium. So it was particularly exciting to detect a similar effect in the dissipative resonant magnetoresistance of graphene.  The devices were fabricated at the National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester. Dr Piranavan Kumaravadivel, who led device design and development notes,  the large size and high quality of our devices are key for observing these phenomena.  Our devices are sufficiently large and pure that electrons interact almost exclusively with phonons and other electrons.  We expect that these results will inspire similar studies of non-equilibrium phenomena in other 2D materials.  Our measurements also demonstrate that high-quality graphene layers can carry very high continuous current densities which approach those achievable in superconductors. High purity graphene transistors could find future applications in nanoscale power electronic technologies. ReferenceGreenaway MT, Kumaravadivel P, Wengraf J et al.

Inflammation and oxidative stress go hand in hand,  says Dr. Pamela Martin, cell biologist and biochemist in the MCG Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Vision Discovery Institute at Augusta University.  If you impact one, you generally impact the other. At the right dose, carbon monoxide can impact both.While we likely think of chirping detectors in our homes, toxic fumes from cars and trucks and even death when we think of carbon monoxide, many of our own cells and tissues are actively and regularly producing small amounts of the colorless, odorless gas to protect themselves from the damage of high and/or chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, says Dr. Ravirajsinh Jadeja, MCG biochemist.He s talking about the enzyme heme oxygenase 1, a common component of many tissues including oxygen-carrying hemoglobin and immune cells, whose jobs include reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and one of the ways it does that is by releasing small amounts of carbon monoxide. In fact heme oxygenase 1 is naturally upregulated in our cells in response to increased levels of the destructive states. Basically what the enzyme does is produce a very low amount of carbon monoxide, 1,000 times lower than what we inhale outside,  Jadeja says. Unlike in our homes when fuel-burning furnaces can cause high levels to accumulate, the small, steady production and the cell machinery that use it also mean the carbon monoxide we make doesn t accumulate in our body. When you introduce diseases like diabetes, then these natural mechanisms fail, and we have to think of ways to enhance, or reestablish, those mechanisms that would normally protect us,  Martin says. The scientists have early evidence that HBI-002, a liquid that converts to the familiar gas when it hits our intestines, can help our retinas, which are damaged in nearly half of people with diabetes, do that.Martin and Jadeja are co-principal investigators on a $300,000 grant (1R41EY033264-01), for the first phase of an R41/R42, Small Business Technology Transfer Grant from the National Institutes of Health that is enabling them to further explore HBI-002 s potential.For the new studies, they are looking at the impact of the compound in both an acute ischemic model, when the retina suddenly is not getting sufficient oxygen because of oxidative stress followed by its normal companion inflammation, as well as a model of more natural disease progression.The retina, which is considered an extension of the brain, is comprised of intricate layers of nerves that line the back part of the eye and sense light, which the brain transforms into images. Cell types in the retina are among the highest metabolically active cell types, which means they naturally generate a lot of oxidative stress, Martin says.One of her many long-term interests is identifying noninvasive methods to get help to the retina, like oral antihypertensives help reduce blood pressure.Their preliminary studies indicate HBI-002 can make the trip. The liquid turns into carbon monoxide s more familiar gaseous state in the intestines, where it naturally binds to hemoglobin  the oxygen-carrying component of blood   then travels up to the eye in the blood, Jadeja says. Carbon monoxide is good at finding hemoglobin, the scientists note. In fact, it s strong affinity for hemoglobin is what makes it deadly since oxygen can no longer bind to hemoglobin when carbon monoxide has made the connection, Jadeja says. It s bad, it s deadly. When you first hear carbon monoxide, that is everyone s reaction,  says Martin.  That is true in a broad, uncontrolled setting. But this is in a very controlled setting where you are getting minimal concentrations that target specific cellular processes. Once in the retina, the small dose of carbon monoxide finds the heme oxygenase enzyme in retinal cells and helps induce the steps that normally yield its desired antioxidant, anti-inflammatory action.To objectively measure its impact, the scientists have functional tests that    much like an electrocardiogram of the heart,  but in this case it s an electroretinogram   produce peaks and waves, which indicate how different cells are firing and signaling. They can also look directly at the retina for telltale signs of damage: Diabetes prompts cell death and a thinning of the retina, and can cause retinal detachment. RNA and protein analysis will give more evidence of whether they are getting increased expression of good genes and decreased expression of the problematic ones in response to treatment.Meanwhile, levels of the complex carboxyhemoglobin, which forms inside red blood cells when hemoglobin is exposed to carbon monoxide and whose levels can be easily monitored with a blood test, are a good indicator of whether carbon monoxide levels remain safe.  The unique liquid to gas transformation of HBI-002 enables more targeted dosing since the amount needed can vary between individuals and, if one day approved for humans, will help ensure dosing accuracy and the ability of patients eventually to easily and safely use the compound at home, the scientists and its developers say.It also effectively leaves nothing behind, while a pill form previously studied left behind metal complexes that had to be cleared by the kidneys, which also are often compromised in people with diabetes, Jadeja says.If the evidence of HB1-002 s benefit continues to hold in their studies over the next 12 months, it will lead to another grant and more studies honing in on how this carbon monoxide compound is working against the ravages of diabetic retinopathy, exploring optimal doses, how often it should be given and more.While they and other scientists studying the compound have reported no side effects, the sickle cell trial just getting underway should provide more insight. Martin notes they expect to see minimal impact, if any.Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave Hillhurst approval to move forward with a first-phase trial of their HBI-002 for sickle cell disease. Phase 1 trials are intended to test safety and are done in healthy individuals. The company has preclinical evidence that the compound will prevent the classic pain crises that result when adequate blood flow is disrupted by sickled red blood cells in the arms, legs, bones, joints and other tissues.While the causes of sickle cell and diabetes may be disparate, they have in common players like oxidative stress and inflammation, Martin notes. While we are generating this data, they will be continuing with this trial,  Jadeja says.  We are working on something that is very close to clinical usage. The back of the eye has been a tough target for drugs to reach. For example, using eye drops as a mechanism of delivery typically is not effective because often the drug doesn t reach the retina, and if you give sufficient doses to help it make the journey, it can damage the front of the eye, Martin says. So diabetic retinopathy therapies tend to be invasive, like intravitreal injections of drugs that help reduce the destructive, abnormal blood vessel growth that happens in response to blockage of existing blood vessels but which ultimately instead contributes to vision loss.  Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among those age 20-74, and is strongly related to how long the individual has had diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.Carbon monoxide also has been shown to have important, natural roles in helping blood vessels dilate and repairing cell powerhouses called mitochondria, the scientists say.Hillhurst Biopharmaceuticals is a clinical stage company that focuses on blood and inflammatory disorders. Preclinical studies of their HBI-002, like the ones Martin and Jadeja are doing in diabetic retinopathy, also are underway in conditions like Parkinson s and acute pain.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Cholesterol is an indispensable component of myelin sheaths. The cholesterol for the regenerated myelin sheaths must therefore either be recycled from damaged myelin or produced again locally. In a recent study, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in G ttingen, led by Gesine Saher, found that in the case of chronic damage, unlike in acute damage, hardly any cholesterol is recycled. Instead, the new production of cholesterol determines the efficiency of the repair. Unexpectedly, not only the myelin-forming cells themselves but also nerve cells make an important contribution to regeneration. Cholesterol synthesis in nerve cells ensures the replenishment of newly myelin-forming cells. This could impact the therapeutic success for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis.When lesions develop in myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis, the cholesterol- and lipid-rich insulating layer around the nerve fibres is lost. In order to prevent permanent damage, the now unmyelinated nerve fibres must be protected again as quickly as possible by newly regenerated myelin. In the acute phase of the disorder, defective myelin is abundant. Cholesterol is taken up from defective myelin by phagocytes and reprocessed and made available to the myelin-forming cells. This repair process often proceeds quickly and smoothly in younger patients.However, the longer the disorder lasts, the less efficient this critical process becomes. Phagocytes of the brain can turn into foam cells that are no longer involved in the recycling of cholesterol. The chronic and repeated degradation of myelin sheaths eventually leaves nerve fibres permanently unmyelinated. Degenerated myelin and cholesterol are thus scarce in chronic lesions.  We suspected that in the low-cholesterol environment of chronic lesions, the production of this important lipid kicks in , explains lead researcher Gesine Saher from the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in G ttingen. Impaired repair of chronic lesions in neuronal cholesterol mutants (NcKO). The mutants form less myelin (brown), and the proliferation of oligodendrocytes (green) is reduced. Credit: MPI for Experimental Medicine/ BerghoffIn order to investigate the relevance of this observation, the researchers genetically inactivated the synthesis of cholesterol in neurons and in the myelin-forming cells (oligodendrocytes) of mice. In the neuronal and oligodendroglial mutants, the regeneration of myelin sheaths was severely reduced in chronic lesions. However, unlike in glial mutants, neuronal cholesterol also enhanced the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Treatment with a cholesterol-enriched diet had a similarly positive effect on these progenitor cells.  We assume that neurons provide this extra production of cholesterol , says Berghoff.  This benefits all other cells in chronic lesions, which have greatly reduced their own production of cholesterol . Although acute and chronic lesions and their endogenous repair mechanisms differ greatly, the availability and management of cholesterol and other lipids ultimately makes a considerable contribution to the efficiency of regeneration.  The challenge of the next studies will be to develop therapy concepts for patients with myelin disorders in which acute and chronic lesions can be treated simultaneously , says Saher, leader of the research team.Reference: Berghoff SA, Spieth L, Sun T, et al.

The findings, from researchers at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc., provide early evidence that the drug could jump-start an immune response against pancreatic cancer, a disease that has so far been resistant to immunotherapy.The data come from experiments of BXCL701, an experimental dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) inhibitor developed by BioXcel Therapeutics, and appear in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer on November 4, 2021. This combination treatment not only cured some mice but also demonstrated having instilled an immune-cell memory so that, when the cured mice were injected with cancer cells months later, the immune systems in 10 of 13 mice recognized and killed the cancer cells, leaving the mice cancer-free again,  says Allison Fitzgerald, Ph.D., at Georgetown Lombardi and co-first author.  If this result holds true in humans, it means the therapy may have the potential to offer long-lasting remissions for patients with pancreatic cancer. The National Cancer Institute estimates there will be 60,430 new cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed in 2021 with an estimated 48,220 deaths. Only about 10 percent of pancreatic cancer patients live five years or more, making it one of the deadliest cancers.The microenvironment surrounding most pancreatic tumors is very effective at blocking immune system attacks, so researchers turned to BXCL701, an experimental oral DPP inhibitor. The drug candidate has been observed to help boost the effectiveness of immunotherapies in some early-phase clinical trials. (Research directed to evaluating the compound s ability to promote immunotherapy in preclinical models was sponsored by BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. through a research agreement with Georgetown Lombardi). While our success in mice is promising, we hold out additional hope due to the benefits of this DPP inhibitor seen in other types of cancer,  says the study s corresponding author Louis M. Weiner, MD, director of Georgetown Lombardi and director of the lab where the research was conducted.  What we found to be unique in our study was how this drug candidate seems to enhance the effectiveness of immune response in pancreatic cancer, which is remarkable as standard immunotherapies have been unsuccessful to date. Scientists studied two sets of mice that were injected with cells that closely mimic human pancreatic cancer. The mice were then given the immunotherapy, along with BXCL701. The combination of therapies enhanced immunotherapy effectiveness by boosting two key immune system components: T cells and natural killer cells. Investigators found that natural killer cells contributed importantly to longer survival.Natural killer cells play a key role in an immune defense against cancer in two ways: they recognize and kill cancer cells directly, similar to T cells, but also release small signaling molecules that can influence and regulate other parts of the immune system. Investigators believe that, based on this and other research, many immune cell types work together to keep cancer cells at bay. We would like to conduct additional studies in mice to better understand the biology of why this treatment is working so well and how we can make it work even better,  says Fitzgerald.  We are also hoping to develop a clinical trial based on the results of this study to see if this combination treatment works as well in humans as it does in mice.

The technology is already being progressed by commercial partners toward pilot-scale production of drinking water.Dark-colored materials that strongly soak up sunlight to drive seawater desalination are a long-standing research interest of KAUST's Andrea Fratalocchi. While reading about the economic challenges of ending coal s use for power generation, Fratalocchi was struck by a novel possible use for coal.  The two ideas clicked together: why don t we use coal for a new economy in water desalination?  Fratalocchi recalls.Fratalocchi and his team began to explore blocks of carbonized compressed powder (CCP), a microporous material produced by forcing powdered coal together under pressure. To assist water flow into and through the CCP, the team incorporated cotton fibers through the material.The team placed a block of this material over a saltwater-filled container so that the cotton fibers touched the water. When the CCP was warmed by sunlight, water was drawn up through the device and evaporated from its hot surface. A condenser over the device captured the freshwater. The salt left behind in the CCP can be washed off with seawater. CCP is abundant in nature and low cost, as well as lightweight, versatile and highly scalable from a fabrication point of view,  says Marcella Bonifazi, who worked on it as a postdoc in Fratalocchi s lab.  The device produced fresh water for around one-third the cost of current state-of-the-art solar desalination technologies,  she adds.The device could provide fresh water to the 1.6 billion people around the globe facing economic water shortages,  adds Valerio Mazzone, who also developed the device as a postdoc.  According to the UN, access to water for agricultural production, even if only for supplemental watering of a vegetable garden or small crops, can make the difference between farming as a mere means of survival and a reliable source of livelihoods,  he says. A 16 square meter CCP desalination system could produce enough water to meet the drinking, cooking and vegetable-watering needs of a typical family of four, the team has calculated.The researchers are working with a commercial partner, Netherlands-based PERA, to develop the device toward commercialization.  PERA is developing a pilot in Brazil for brackish water desalination as a permanent solution not only for drinking and cooking needs but also for basic food production, benefiting millions of people in Brazil s semiarid northeast region,  Bonifazi says.Reference: Mazzone V, Bonifazi M, Aegerter CM, Cruz AM, Fratalocchi A.

In a new study, Rockefeller scientists identify a key molecule that ferries glutathione, the body s major antioxidant, into the cell s mitochondria, where free radicals are produced en masse. The discovery, published in Nature, opens new possibilities for investigating oxidative stress and its damaging effects.

They are amongst the most common inherited diseases but are difficult for clinicians to diagnose, not least because they can affect many different organs and resemble many other conditions.Current genetic testing regimes fail to diagnose around 40% of patients, with major implications for patients, their families and the health services they use.A new study, published in the BMJ, offers hope to families with no diagnosis, and endorses plans for the UK to establish a national diagnostic programme based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) to make more diagnoses faster.While previous studies based on small, highly selected cohorts have suggested that WGS can identify mitochondrial disorders, this is the first to examine its effectiveness in a national healthcare system   the NHS.The study, led by researchers from the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit and Departments of Clinical Neuroscience and Medical Genetics at the University of Cambridge, involved 319 families with suspected mitochondrial disease recruited through the 100,000 Genomes Project which was set up to embed genomic testing in the NHS, discover new disease genes and make genetic diagnosis available for more patients.In total, 345 participants   aged 0 to 92 with a median age of 25 years   had their whole genome sequenced. Through different analyses, the researchers found that they could make a definite or probable genetic diagnosis for 98 families (31%). Standard tests, which are often more invasive, failed to reach these diagnoses. Six possible diagnoses (2% of the 98 families) were made. A total of 95 different genes were implicated.Surprisingly, 62.5% of the diagnoses were actually non-mitochondrial disorders, with some having specific treatments. This happened because so many different diseases resemble mitochondrial disorders, making it very difficult to know which are which.Professor Patrick Chinnery from the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit and the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge, said: We recommend that whole genome sequencing should be offered early and before invasive tests such as a muscle biopsy. All that patients would need to do is have a blood test, meaning that this could be offered across the whole country in an equitable way. People wouldn t need to travel long distances to multiple appointments, and they would get their diagnosis much faster. Dr Katherine Schon from the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit and the Departments of Clinical Neuroscience and Medical Genetics, said: A definitive genetic diagnosis can really help patients and their families, giving them access to tailored information about prognosis and treatment, genetic counselling and reproductive options including preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis. The researchers made 37.5% of their diagnoses in genes known to cause mitochondrial disease. These diagnoses were nearly all unique to a particular participant family, reflecting the genetic diversity found in these disorders. The impairment of mitochondrial function tends to affect tissues with high energy demand such as the brain, the peripheral nerves, the eye, the heart and the peripheral muscles. The study offers a valuable new resource for the discovery of future mitochondrial disease genes.The majority of the team s diagnoses (62.5%) were, however, of non-mitochondrial disorders which had features resembling mitochondrial diseases. These disorders would have been missed if the participants had only been investigated for mitochondrial disorders through muscle biopsy and/or a specific mitochondrial gene panel. These participants were living with a range of conditions including developmental disorders with intellectual disability, severe epileptic conditions and metabolic disorders, as well as heart and neurological diseases.Chinnery said:  These patients were referred because of a suspected mitochondrial disease and the conventional diagnostic tests are specifically for mitochondrial diseases. Unless you consider these other possibilities, you won't diagnose them. Whole genome sequencing isn t restricted by that bias. A small number of newly diagnosed participants are already receiving treatments as a result. The team identified potentially treatable disorders in six participants with a mitochondrial disorder and nine with a non-mitochondrial disorder, but the impact of the treatments has yet to be determined.Chinnery said:  Diagnostic services are fragmented and unevenly distributed across the UK, and that creates major challenges for people with rare diseases and their families. By delivering a national programme based on this genome-wide approach, you can offer the same level of service to everyone.""Schon said:  If we can create a national platform of families with rare diseases, we can give them the opportunity to engage in clinical trials so we can get definitive evidence that new treatments work. The study points out that the relatively high number of patients with probable or possible diagnoses reflects the need for greater investment into the analysis of functional effects of new genetic variants which could be the cause of disease, but it is not certain at present.It also argues that rapid trio whole genome sequencing should be offered to all acutely unwell individuals with suspected mitochondrial disorders, so that results can help guide clinical management. Currently in the UK, this is only available for acutely unwell children.Dr Ellen Thomas, Clinical Director and Director of Quality at Genomics England, said: We are very pleased to see significant research like this being enabled by data generously donated by participants of the 100,000 Genomes Project. It is clear from these results how their contributions to a rich and, importantly, secure dataset is critical in facilitating the genomic research that leads to insights like these that then have the potential to return value to the NHS and their patients. We look forward to seeing how these findings could support future care for patients with suspected mitochondrial disorders. Reference: Schon KR, Horvath R, Wei W, et al.

In the northern hemisphere, most of these species are moving northward, to escape the warming climate in the south.  New habitat colonisation occurs first with only a few establishing individuals. Consequently, the new populations are usually genetically poorer than the more central populations.  Other factors can also lead to genetic diversity loss. One of these may be the spread of the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia in the quite common blue-tailed damselfly Ischnura elegans.  Wolbachia is a common endosymbiotic bacterium in insects, and it is naturally present in more than 40 per cent of all insect species across the globe. Wolbachia is highly prevalent in the damselfly populations in Western Europe and Fennoscandia, but less common in East Europe and the Mediterranean. ""Blue-tailed damselfly has been the study system of over 6,000 scientific studies, but until now, no one had ever investigated whether the species was hosting endosymbiotic bacteria. This is important to study because if the symbionts remain hidden in this system, research studies could be associating some results directly to the host ecology or evolutionary biology, when they are actually linked to the bacterium and only indirectly to the host,"" says study author Junchen Deng, MSc, now doing his PhD at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland. In a new study, the researchers used genetic markers to show that the Ischnura elegans populations carrying Wolbachia were genetically less diverse than the uninfected populations.  ""In addition, the more central populations had reduced genetic diversity, not just the populations at the edge of the species  range,"" explains Dr Anne Duplouy, Academy Fellow at the Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki. She also supervised Junchen Deng s master s thesis at Lund University, Sweden. A Wolbachia infection is often beneficial to infected insect females and can lead the Wolbachia-free host lineages to extinction.   The goal of a symbiont is extremely selfish: it has to spread in its host population. Microbial symbionts have thus evolved a huge diversity of phenotypes to improve their spread in the host populations. For example, they can kill the brothers to release food resources to their sisters, they can make infected males incompatible with uninfected females but compatible with infected females, they can change males into females, they can improve the resistance of infected females against pathogens such as viruses, and so on,  Anne Duplouy describes. As to damselflies and Wolbachia, there is much that is yet unknown. ""We still have no clear idea of how the bacterium manipulates the infected damselflies to its own benefit. But maybe, more importantly, this study shows how the bacterium could tamper with the success of its host in escaping and surviving a changing environment,"" Erik Svensson, professor in evolutionary biology at Lund University points out.  Indeed, if the source population is already low in genetic diversity, for example due to a hidden factor such as an infection with Wolbachia, the success of new colonisation might be reduced. With that comes a reduced ability of the host species to expand their range and escape climate change in their native habitats,"" concludes Anne Duplouy.

One promising solution may be found in renewable raw materials, according to research published in Advanced Materials. In their paper, the international research group has taken a close look at how lignocellulose   or plant biomass   can be used for optical applications, potentially replacing commonly used materials like sand and plastics. We wanted to map out as comprehensively as possible how lignocellulose could replace the unrenewable resources found in widely used technology, like smart devices or solar cells,  says Jaana Vapaavuori, assistant professor of functional materials at Aalto University, who carried out the analysis with colleagues at the University of Turku, RISE   Research Institute of Sweden, and University of British Columbia.Lignocellulose, the term that encompasses cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, is found in nearly every plant on Earth. When scientists break it down into very small parts and put it back together, they can create totally new, usable materials.In their extensive review of the field, the researchers assessed the various manufacturing processes and characteristics needed for optical applications, for example, transparency, reflectiveness, UV-light filtering, as well as structural colours. Through combining properties of lignocellulose, we could create light-reactive surfaces for windows or materials that react to certain chemicals or steam. We could even make UV protectors that soak up radiation, acting like a sunblock on surfaces,  explains Vapaavuori. We can actually add functionalities to lignocellulose and customise it more easily than glass. For instance, if we could replace the glass in solar cells with lignocellulose, we could improve light absorption and achieve better operating efficiency,  says Kati Miettunen, professor of materials engineering at the University of Turku.","Published: November 5, 2021"

Although the contamination of one such lake, Lake Onuma on Mount Akagi, was measured for a few years after the accident, its long-term contamination has been uncertain. Now, a research team from Japan has shed light on this issue.In a study published last month in Scientific Reports, researchers led by the University of Tsukuba have predicted the 137Cs radioactivity concentration of Lake Onuma for up to about 30 years after the disaster. Lake Onuma is an example of a closed lake, in which the amount of inflow and runoff water is limited. The radioactivity concentration of such lakes declines sharply just after a nuclear accident but then can begin to decrease more slowly. ""Previous investigations have used the two-component decay function model, which is the sum of two exponential functions, to fit the measured 137Cs radioactivity concentration,"" says author of the study, Professor Yuko Hatano. ""Our work is instead based on the fractional diffusion model, a framework that captures the complex diffusion processes occurring in the lake water. These processes include convection-induced circulation, turbulent mixing, and absorption by plankton and other organisms."" The research team used the fractional diffusion model to derive a long-term prediction formula for the 137Cs radioactivity concentration of both the lake water and pond smelt a typical fish species in Lake Onuma. Given this prediction formula, they then estimated the radioactivity concentration for up to 10,000 days following the Fukushima accident. ""Both models fit the radioactivity concentration of the lake water and pond smelt measured in the first few years after the accident,"" explains Professor Hatano. ""However, our results show that the decrease in radioactivity concentration is slowed down if the fractional diffusion model is used rather than the conventional two-component decay function model."" The researchers' formula will enable the long-term prediction of radioactive contamination in closed lakes and provide long-term prospects for residents living close to these bodies of water. However, the authors note that the validity of such a prediction for more than 5,000 days after the Fukushima incident would need to be evaluated using future measurements.ReferenceSuetomi E, Hatano Y, Fujita M, Okada Y, Suzuki K, Watanabe S.

But if a machine learning model takes a shortcut, it might fail in unexpected ways.In machine learning, a shortcut solution occurs when the model relies on a simple characteristic of a dataset to make a decision, rather than learning the true essence of the data, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. For example, a model might learn to identify images of cows by focusing on the green grass that appears in the photos, rather than the more complex shapes and patterns of the cows.  A new study by researchers at MIT explores the problem of shortcuts in a popular machine-learning method and proposes a solution that can prevent shortcuts by forcing the model to use more data in its decision-making.By removing the simpler characteristics the model is focusing on, the researchers force it to focus on more complex features of the data that it hadn t been considering. Then, by asking the model to solve the same task two ways   once using those simpler features, and then also using the complex features it has now learned to identify   they reduce the tendency for shortcut solutions and boost the performance of the model.One potential application of this work is to enhance the effectiveness of machine learning models that are used to identify disease in medical images. Shortcut solutions in this context could lead to false diagnoses and have dangerous implications for patients. It is still difficult to tell why deep networks make the decisions that they do, and in particular, which parts of the data these networks choose to focus upon when making a decision. If we can understand how shortcuts work in further detail, we can go even farther to answer some of the fundamental but very practical questions that are really important to people who are trying to deploy these networks,  says Joshua Robinson, a PhD student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and lead author of the paper.Robinson wrote the paper with his advisors, senior author Suvrit Sra, the Esther and Harold E.

If cities want these policies to be effective, they need to regulate how these sugary drinks are labeled at the stores where they are sold   and they currently don t do that,  said Grant Donnelly, lead author of the study and assistant professor of marketing at The Ohio State University s Fisher College of Business.The findings suggest that price tags should mention the tax, but not the amount, because consumers tend to overestimate how much the tax is, Donnelly said. If they know the true size of the tax, they are more willing to pay it.Among the cities that currently have a tax on sugary drinks are Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Boulder.The study was published online recently in the journal Psychological Science.The research included a field study at two convenience stores in San Francisco, which currently has a tax on sugary drinks of 1 cent per ounce   an added 12 cents to a 12-ounce drink.Researchers varied the price tags placed on the sugary drinks over the eight-week study. There were three price tags that were rotated: One that simply said the price for the 12-ounce drink ($1.52); one that had the price and the message  Includes SF Sugary Drink Tax ; and one that included the same message and added that the proceeds of the tax would support local university student programs.All non-sugary drinks, which were not subject to the tax, simply had the price of the drink, which was $1.40.The researchers compared sales of the drinks during the study period to the two immediately preceding weeks. During this time, the sugary drink tax was in effect, but there were no price tags on any drinks. They also compared sales to the two years preceding the tax.Results showed that sales of sugary drinks were not lower during the two weeks before the study began, compared to sales in the two years before the tax. In other words, the tax itself did not reduce purchases of sugary drinks.The researchers then looked at the effects of the three different price tags during the course of the study.Results showed that the share of sugary drinks bought when the tags simply showed the price (47%) was not significantly different from the two-week period before the study.But the share of sugary drinks purchased did decline slightly (45%) when the tags mentioned the price included the added tax.Results showed that most consumers who chose to avoid sugary drinks with the added tax chose a drink that was not subject to the tax. Consumers are averse to taxes, so when they learn that their favorite drink has this sugary beverage tax, some are less interested in buying it,  Donnelly said. They generally substitute for healthier beverages, like bottled water. So the taxes do not seem to hurt the stores that sell drinks. Tags that noted where the taxes would be spent had no significant effect beyond the tags that simply noted the added tax.In a separate online study, the researchers asked participants who drank sugary beverages to estimate what the tax would be on a 12-ounce can of their favorite beverage that cost $1.52. The average estimate was 40 cents   much higher than the 12 cents actually levied in San Francisco.Another study found that when consumers were told the tax was only 12 cents, they reported they were much more likely to still purchase the drink. People don t like taxes, but they think this tax is much higher than it actually is,  Donnelly said.  If you tell consumers the true cost of the tax, it is no longer effective in reducing purchases. The bottom line, he said, is that if cities want these policies to be effective at reducing consumption of unhealthy beverages, they must mandate that tags mention the added tax   but not reveal how much it is.Reference: Donnelly GE, Guge PM, Howell RT, John LK.

It usually develops slowly and the majority of cancers will not require treatment in a man s lifetime.The most commonly-used tests for prostate cancer include blood tests, a physical examination known as a digital rectal examination (DRE), an MRI scan and an invasive biopsy.However, doctors struggle to predict which tumours will progress to a more aggressive form, making it hard to decide on treatment for many men.Lead researcher Dr Jeremy Clark, from UEA s Norwich Medical School, said:  While prostate cancer is responsible for a large proportion of all male cancer deaths, it is more commonly a disease men die with rather than from. Therefore, there is a desperate need for improvements in diagnosing and predicting outcomes for prostate cancer patients to minimise over-diagnosis and overtreatment whilst appropriately treating men with aggressive disease, especially if this can be done without taking an invasive biopsy. Here at UEA, we have developed a urine test for prostate cancer called the Prostate Urine Risk Test   or PUR for short. The  risk  here refers to the aggressiveness of the cancer and its potential to spread to other organs, which would eventually kill the patient. But prostate cancer is very complex and risk levels vary widely between men.  Previously we have shown that PUR can identify men with high-risk cancer which requires immediate treatment and also low-risk cancer that has a very low rate of progression and does not generally need treatment. But there is a third category of men with  intermediate-risk , which falls in between these extremes. Around half of men diagnosed with prostate cancer fall into this group and the treatment pathways for them have been less clear, until now. It is known that disease progression in intermediate-risk men is associated with the presence of increasing amounts of Gleason pattern 4 cancer in their prostate. Our study shows that the PUR test can assess the amount of Gleason pattern 4 without the need for a biopsy. So not only can PUR measure the presence of aggressive cancer, but it can also measure increasing amounts of aggressive cancer in a prostate.  This means that it can show us which men at intermediate risk may require treatment and which may instead be managed conservatively with surveillance. PUR will also be useful for monitoring disease in men that do not currently require treatment, and flag up the emergence and expansion of aggressive disease,  he added.The results of this pilot study will be further investigated in a much larger cohort of men using samples collected with a prostate screening box which the patients receive by mail and return samples by post directly for analysis at UEA.Prof Daniel Brewer, also from UEA s Norwich Medical School and a visiting worker at the Earlham Institute, said:  Prof Dan Brewer, also from UEA s Norwich Medical School and a visiting worker at the Earlham Institute, said:  We have recently developed a urine biomarker test for prostate cancer named PUR that can distinguish whether men should be placed on active surveillance or have radical treatment. In this research we examine in more detail what biological change PUR is detecting. This is an exciting finding that helps explain why PUR works so well. This test is currently being validated in a large multiple site study supported by Prostate Cancer UK and Movember,  he added.Dr Sarah Hsiao, Director, Biomedical Research and Impact at Movember, said:  This new research from Dr Clark s team shows that the PUR test can be used to estimate the level of a specific pathological characteristic (Gleason Pattern 4) that is linked to increased risk of disease progression in men with prostate cancer.  This is important because, for men whose prostate tumour contains varying levels of Gleason Pattern 4, a prostate biopsy is necessary to determine whether men should receive active treatment or be managed by active surveillance.  We look forward to seeing further validation of this research in a larger study cohort. If successful, this non-invasive PUR test may be able to support decision-making process without needing an invasive prostate biopsy that is associated with discomfort and risk of infection.

Its findings indicate that language switching is natural for those who are bilingual because the brain has a mechanism that does not detect that the language has switched, allowing for a seamless transition in comprehending more than one language at once. Our brains are capable of engaging in multiple languages,  explains Sarah Phillips, a New York University doctoral candidate and the lead author of the paper, which appears in the journal eNeuro.  Languages may differ in what sounds they use and how they organize words to form sentences. However, all languages involve the process of combining words to express complex thoughts. Bilinguals show a fascinating version of this process--their brains readily combine words from different languages together, much like when combining words from the same language,  adds Liina Pylkk nen, a professor in NYU s Department of Linguistics and Department of Psychology and the senior author of the paper.An estimated 60 million in the U.S. use two or more languages, according to the U.S. Census. However, despite the widespread nature of bi- and multilingualism, domestically and globally, the neurological mechanisms used to understand and produce more than one language are not well understood. This terrain is an intriguing one; bilinguals often mix their two languages together as they converse with one another, raising questions about how the brain functions in such exchanges.To better understand these processes, Phillips and Pylkk nen, who is also part of the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute, explored whether bilinguals interpret these mixed-language expressions using the same mechanisms as when comprehending single-language expressions or, alternatively, if understanding mixed-language expressions engages the brain in a unique way.To test this, the scientists measured the neural activity of Korean/English bilinguals. Here, the study s subjects viewed a series of word combinations and pictures on a computer screen. They then had to indicate whether or not the picture matched the preceding words. The words either formed a two-word sentence or were simply a pair of verbs that did not combine with each other into a meaningful phrase (e.g.,  icicles melt  vs.  jump melt ). In some instances, the two words came from a single language (English or Korean) while in others both languages were used, with the latter mimicking mixed-language conversations.In order to measure the study subjects  brain activity during these experiments, the researchers deployed magnetoencephalography (MEG), a technique that maps neural activity by recording magnetic fields generated by the electrical currents produced by our brains.The recordings showed that Korean/English bilinguals, in interpreting mixed-language expressions, used the same neural mechanism as they did while interpreting single-language expressions. Specifically, the brain s left anterior temporal lobe, a brain region well-studied for its role in combining the meanings of multiple words, was insensitive to whether the words it received were from the same language or from different languages. This region, then, proceeded to combine words into more complex meanings so long as the meanings of the two words combined together into a more complex meaning. These findings suggest that language switching is natural for bilinguals because the brain has a combinatory mechanism that does not  see  that the language has switched. Earlier studies have examined how our brains can interpret an infinite number of expressions within a single language,  observes Phillips.  This research shows that bilingual brains can, with striking ease, interpret complex expressions containing words from different languages. Reference: Phillips SF, Pylkk nen L.

Using the power of large data sets and advanced computational approaches, the researchers were able to identify peptides that are presented on the surface of tumor cells and can be targeted with  peptide-centric  chimeric antigen receptors (PC-CARs), a new class of engineered T cells, stimulating an immune response that eradicates tumors.The discovery, which was described today in Nature, opens the door to treating a broader array of cancers with immunotherapy as well as applying each therapy across a greater proportion of the population. This research is extremely exciting because it raises the possibility of targeting very specific tumor molecules, expanding both the cancers that can be treated with immunotherapy and the patient population who can benefit,  said Mark Yarmarkovich, PhD, an investigator in the Maris Laboratory at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia and first author of the paper.  By using a multi-omics approach, we were able to identify peptides specific to neuroblastoma tumors, but this method could be used in any cancer, allowing for a more personalized approach to cancer treatment. The development of CAR T cell-based cancer immunotherapy marked a breakthrough in the treatment of leukemia, but the approach has not yet made significant strides against solid tumors due, at least in part, to a lack of tumor-specific targets. In these cancers, most of the proteins responsible for tumor growth and survival are in the nuclei of tumor cells, not on the cell surface, where they would generally be accessible to CAR T cells. Instead, fragments of these proteins may be presented on the tumor cell surface through the presentation of peptides on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which evolved to present viral and bacterial peptides to the immune system. Cancer cells can also present intracellular proteins on MHC, and if these are mutant peptides, they may be recognized as foreign. However, all pediatric cancers and many adult malignancies have few mutations and are rather driven by other factors like dysregulated developmental pathways.Neuroblastoma is an explosively aggressive pediatric cancer that is driven by modifications of gene expression that promote uncontrolled tumor growth. Historically, neuroblastoma has been treated with chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, but patients often relapse with forms of the disease that are chemotherapy resistant. Additionally, the low mutational burden of the cancer, combined with its low MHC expression, have made it difficult to target with immunotherapies.Despite these obstacles, the researchers hypothesized that some of the peptides presented on the surface of neuroblastoma tumor cells come from proteins that are essential for tumor growth and survival and could be targeted with synthetic CARs. These PC-CARs would allow for direct targeting and killing of tumor cells. The challenge was differentiating tumor-specific peptides from other, similar looking peptides or peptides that exist in normal tissues to avoid cross-reactivity and lethal toxicity.To do so, the researchers stripped the MHC molecules off neuroblastoma cells and determined which peptides were present and at what abundance. They used a large genomic dataset that the Maris lab has generated to determine which peptides were unique to neuroblastoma and not expressed by normal tissues. They prioritized peptides that were derived from genes essential to the tumor and had characteristics required to engage the immune system. To weed out any potential antigens that might have cross reactivity with normal tissue, the researchers filtered the remaining tumor peptides against a database of MHC peptides on normal tissues, removing any peptide with a parent gene represented in normal tissue.Using this multi-omics approach, the researchers pinpointed an unmutated neuroblastoma peptide that is derived from PHOX2B, a neuroblastoma dependency gene and transcriptional regulator that was previously identified and characterized at CHOP. The next major hurdle was developing a PC-CAR that specifically recognized just the peptide, which makes up 2-3% of the peptide-MHC complex. In collaboration with antibody-discovery company Myrio Therapeutics, the researchers developed a PC-CAR targeting this peptide and showed that these PC-CARs recognized the tumor-specific peptide on different HLA types, meaning the treatment could be applied to patients of diverse genetic lineages. We are excited about this work because it allows us to now go after essential cancer drivers that have been considered  undruggable  in the past. We think that PC-CARS have the potential to vastly expand the pool of immunotherapies and significantly widen the population of eligible patients,  said senior author John M. Maris, MD, pediatric oncologist and Giulio D'Angio Chair in Neuroblastoma Research at CHOP.  Thanks to the Acceleration grant we received through the Cell and Gene Therapy Collaborative at CHOP, we will bring our PHOX2B PC-CAR to a clinical trial at CHOP in late 2022 or early 2023.

A new study identifies tumor features linked with resistance to radiotherapy, an important advance toward developing individualized cancer treatments.In the study, published today in Nature Communications, a team led by UPMC Hillman Cancer Center researchers used mouse and lab-based human cell experiments to pinpoint mutations in two genes that drive radiation resistance in head and neck tumors and identified a drug that rendered resistant cancer cells sensitive to radiotherapy. In the future, treatments could be tailored to patients with specific tumor types to improve responses to radiotherapy. Each year, radiation cures a huge number of patients with solid tumors, but precision radiotherapy is, unfortunately, an understudied area,  said senior author Heath Skinner, M.D., Ph.D., radiation oncologist at UPMC Hillman and associate professor of radiation oncology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.  The goal of this study was to link tumor genomics with response to radiation to figure out how we can make radiotherapy work better for patients. With the aim of developing more tailored approaches to enhance radiotherapy outcomes, Skinner and his team developed a technique to quickly screen head and neck cancer tumors to identify genetic targets linked with resistance to radiation. After generating tumors in mice, the researchers treated the animals with radiation and measured tumor growth. They found that inhibiting proteins called CBP and p300 dramatically increased tumor sensitivity to radiation and improved mouse survival, but only when tumors had certain mutated versions of these proteins, indicating that these mutations may drive radiotherapy resistance.CBP and p300 are histone acetyltransferases, a type of protein that adds an acetyl chemical group to proteins at specific times. According to Skinner, in cells with mutated proteins, this process is disrupted. This has profound implications for the cell,  he added.  The mutated proteins jumpstart DNA damage repair, which makes cells more resistant to radiation because radiation kills cells by causing DNA damage. But these mutations can also be an Achilles heel, the researchers found. It s like the cells are addicted to the mutated proteins for DNA damage repair,  explained Skinner.  So, when that function is removed, those cells are even more susceptible to radiation than cells that lack the mutation. When the team inhibited the acetyltransferase function of these mutated proteins with drugs currently in development for clinical use, radiotherapy was far more effective at killing tumor cells than those with wild type, or non-mutated, versions of the protein. This lab-based experiment suggests that this class of drugs could improve radiotherapy response in patients harboring this specific type of mutation   but this remains to be tested.To explore whether the discovery could have clinical relevance, the researchers examined a database of patients with head and neck cancer as well as lung and cervical cancer, which can harbor the same mutations. Of patients who received radiotherapy, those whose tumors had mutations in genes that encode CBP or p300 had lower survival rates than those patients whose tumors did not, an important clue that the mutations relate to radiation resistance in patients.According to Skinner, the next step is to build a library of mutations linked with resistance to radiotherapy. To build this library, they will study other types of mutations that could drive radiotherapy resistance in different ways. They also plan to expand their analysis beyond head and neck cancers to see whether these mutations have similar effects in other tumors.  Precision oncology is all about the right tumor and the right target at the right time,  said Skinner.  The idea is that if you have mutation X, you get drug Y; If you have mutation Z, you get drug A. We re not there yet, but this study brings us one step closer.

But is it? Perhaps. If that same witness was also confident the very first time their memory was tested   write a team of psychological scientists and criminologists led by memory expert John Wixted of the University of California San Diego. Otherwise, there s too high a chance that a contaminated memory will convict an innocent person.As most of us also know, people have been convicted of crimes they didn t commit on the basis of eyewitness memory. Some of these wrongful convictions have later been overturned by DNA or other physical evidence. But that type of evidence doesn t always exist. To reduce the likelihood of injustice, the researchers suggest a simple, no-cost reform to our system of jurisprudence.  Test a witness s memory of a suspect only once,  the researchers urge in a paper published by Psychological Science in the Public Interest, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. The first test is the most reliable test,  says Wixted, a professor of psychology at UC San Diego, who has been working on memory for more than 30 years and eyewitness memory specifically for the past decade.  The first test probes the witness s memory but also unavoidably contaminates the witness s memory. All tests beyond that very first one only serve to test contaminated memory and to contaminate it further. And once a memory is contaminated, there is no way to decontaminate it. In their paper, Wixted and his co-authors   Gary Wells of Iowa State University, Elizabeth Loftus of UC Irvine and Brandon Garrett of the Duke University School of Law   explain how many wrongful convictions of innocent prisoners in which a witness conclusively identified the defendant in court began with something other than a conclusive initial eyewitness identification.It s not that witnesses are vindictive or malicious, or that anyone else in the process is either. Nor is it the case that eyewitness memory is so hopelessly faulty that it shouldn t be admitted as evidence at all. But our system of jurisprudence ignores the confidence with which first identifications are made and relies too often on subsequent identifications, usually the very last one made in the courtroom. At that point, at trial, perhaps a year or more after the crime has been committed, witnesses have usually become so familiar with a suspect s face that they are certain they re remembering the face. And in fact, they are remembering   but very possibly not from the time the crime was committed. Rather, they re remembering having seen the person in a line-up (sometimes multiple times) or even on news or social media. Memory is malleable,  Wixted says.  And because it s malleable, we must avoid repeated identification procedures with the same witness and suspect. This recommendation applies not only to additional tests conducted by police investigators but also to the final test conducted in the courtroom. In their paper, the researchers describe the latest science on eyewitness memory, including findings based on signal detection theory, elaborative processing and source misattribution. To make a decision about a face in a lineup (signal detection theory), the witness has to compare that face to their memory of the perpetrator (elaborative processing). Doing so automatically creates a memory of that face. Even if the initial decision is  no, that is not him,  the face will seem more familiar on any later test. Often, the witness loses sight of the fact that the face is familiar because of the previous lineup test and comes to believe that the face is familiar because it is in fact the face of the perpetrator (source misattribution).The researchers also detail three real-life cases to underscore the theoretical and experimental points: The cases of John Jerome White and Steven Gary Titus, both of whom were convicted of rape on the basis of witness memories and whose convictions were later overturned, and the case of Charles Don Flores.The Flores case is especially instructive, Wixted says. It inspired him to assemble the research team for this paper   outlining the latest scientific understanding of eyewitness memory and calling for reform.On January 29, 1998, in a suburb of Dallas, two men entered the home of Elizabeth Black, who was later found shot dead. A neighbor saw the men enter Black s home shortly before the murder, and she became a key witness. When the police captured suspected triggerman Richard Childs, the witness immediately identified Childs from a photo lineup as one of the two men she saw that morning. Childs also confessed to the murder and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. The police suspected Flores as the accomplice because he was engaged in a drug deal with Childs only hours before the murder, and at his 1999 trial, the same witness confidently identified Flores as the other man she saw enter her neighbor s house. However, on the day of the crime in January of 1998, the witness told police that the accomplice was a white male with shoulder-length hair. After being hypnotized to calm her nerves, she helped to make a composite sketch of the perpetrator with a police artist. Consistent with her initial description, the sketch was that of a white male with shoulder-length hair. The police then showed her a photo lineup containing Flores   a Hispanic male with a crew cut   along with five similar-looking Hispanic males. She rejected the lineup, presumably because none of the faces even remotely matched her memory of the accomplice. Yet, Wixted says, while examining the faces on that first and only uncontaminated test of her memory for Flores, she became unavoidably familiarized with his face. By the time of the trial, she no longer had any doubt that he was the man she saw that morning.The witness s initial description of the accomplice and her rejection of the lineup mean that the eyewitness evidence in this case, properly understood, Wixted says, points in the direction of innocence. Instead, her confident courtroom testimony was interpreted as evidence of guilt and helped persuade the jury to convict Flores. He has been on death row ever since, and a governor s clemency now seems to be his last hope.To hear more from John Wixted about the paper:  Under the Cortex  podcast from APS.Reference: Wixted JT, Wells GL, Loftus EF, Garrett BL.

A meticulous single-cell analytical approach to study the repair process in an animal model revealed that the damaged epithelium contains a variety of cell types involved in repairing it through broad coordinated responses that ultimately heal the damaged tissue.The researchers also unexpectedly discovered that, in addition to enterocytes, which are the cell type typically infected by rotavirus, tuft cells, another cell type in the intestinal epithelium, also are infected and may contribute to the repair response of the epithelium following damage. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, not only provide a better understanding of the healing process following rotavirus infection, but also may contribute new clues about how the virus causes disease. Diseases of the digestive tract affect about 60 million Americans each year. These conditions often are associated with damage to the epithelium, which compromises its functions, including digestion of food and absorption of nutrients, and affects overall health,  said co-corresponding author Dr. Sarah Blutt, associate professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor.The researchers  goal on this project was to contribute a better understanding of the repair process following damage to the intestinal epithelium caused by rotavirus in a mouse model. This virus causes approximately 179 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and about 128,000 deaths annually, particularly in children.

Scientists worldwide are racing for objective biomarkers of DBS treatment efficacy so that this experimental approach can be optimized, approved and disseminated to those in need. New research published November 3 in Translational Psychiatry, presents new evidence that brief intraoperative exposure to therapeutic stimulation at the time of implantation surgery induces rapid and consistent electrophysiological brain state change   indexed by a decrease in beta power measured at the site of stimulation. These intraoperative brain state changes are seen in individual subjects and are correlated with a significant and sustained decrease in depressive symptoms outside of the operating room without additional stimulation, establishing reduction in beta power as a novel biomarker for DBS treatment optimization.The data presented are from a collaborative study at Emory University and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Led by Helen S. Mayberg, MD, Mount Sinai Professor in Neurotherapeutics and Founding Director of the Nash Family Center for Advanced Circuit Therapeutics at Mount Sinai, this research is part of an ongoing National Institutes of Health (NIH) BRAIN Initiative-funded grant.Deep brain stimulation is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat essential tremor, Parkinson s disease, epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is a neurosurgical procedure involving placement of a neurostimulator (sometimes referred to as a  brain pacemaker ), which sends high-frequency electrical impulses through implanted electrodes deep in the brain to specific areas responsible for the symptoms of each disorder. While still an experimental treatment, DBS of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC, Area 25), a brain area that has been implicated as playing a major role in depression, has been repeatedly demonstrated as a promising intervention for patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression.Acute behavioral changes and long-term antidepressant response can be reliably elicited with stimulation of this well-defined, surgically-targeted depression circuit, using individualized neuroimaging guidance. While the clinical effectiveness of DBS over the course of six months of treatment has been repeatedly demonstrated, there are differences in the timeline of recovery across different patients. Understanding the mechanisms of these initial rapid and reproducible behavioral effects and their role in predicting the more critical long-term response trajectories will be key to effective treatment and future study design. What we found was that within minutes of stimulation inside the operating room, there was a change in the beta brain rhythm. Patients who showed larger changes then experienced greater relief from their depression in the week after surgery,"" said Allison C. Waters, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, and Neuroscience, at Icahn Mount Sinai and co-first author of the paper. ""The beta rhythm is conventionally associated with the brain's determination of whether to stop or keep going with a course of action, which is why neurologists target beta with DBS to treat disorders of movement. We haven't had a clear signal to target with DBS for depression, but now we can speculate as to how the beta signal might function in this context: a release of the brake that generates fatigue and slowness, or interrupting a habitual cycle of negative self-focused thought."" We were able to leverage machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence approaches to explore unknown (hidden) changes in brain state that would explain the obvious behavioral changes previously observed,  said Mohammad Sendi, MSc, PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering Department of Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology and co-first author of the paper. Eight treatment-resistant depression patients underwent electrophysiological recording in the operating room during their DBS lead implantation surgeries. Using patient-specific tractography models prior to surgery, investigators identified the  optimal  target within the SCC for lead placement. Stimulation was then delivered in the operating room over the course of an hour while local field potentials (LFPs) electrical signals between neurons deep in the brain were simultaneously recorded. A machine learning classification method was subsequently used to discriminate between intracranial LFPs recorded at baseline (stimulation-na ve) and after the first exposure to stimulation inside the operating room. Spectral inputs (theta, 4-8Hz; alpha, 9-121Hz; beta, 13-30Hz) to the model were then evaluated for importance to classifier success and tested as predictors of the antidepressant response. A decline in depression scores by 45.6 percent was observed after one week and this early antidepressant response correlated with a decrease in the SCC LFP beta power, which most contributed to classifier success. We generally think of depression treatment as taking weeks to months to show stable and meaningful changes in core clinical features of the illness,  said Dr. Mayberg.  This study shows reproducible and consistent changes in a brain readout over the first minutes of optimized stimulation in the operating room in individual patients.  This provides new mechanistic understanding of the 'depression switch' that moves a patient from a state of sustained mental pain and immobility to relief and the renewed capacity to move and engage. This research provides individuals who have struggled with depression a sense of hope through advancements in existing technology,  said John Ngai, PhD, Director of the NIH BRAIN Initiative.  We are making immense strides in better understanding debilitating brain and mental health conditions through these discoveries and look forward to seeing how deep-brain stimulation will continue to improve people s lives. Studies that continue to track these brain state biomarkers during ongoing DBS therapy are ongoing at the Nash Family Center for Advanced Therapeutics at Mount Sinai West in New York.

The findings are detailed in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  An as-needed approach to pesticide treatment can benefit farmers,  said Ian Kaplan, professor of entomology at Purdue University, who led the project.  With reduced pesticide use, we saw within the first year wild bees returned to the fields, and our findings showed an average 26% increase in watermelon yield.  The team of researchers from Purdue s College of Agriculture studied fields at five different locations in Indiana and the Midwest over a period of four years to compare conventional pest management with an integrated pest management, or IPM, approach. The IPM approach relied on scouting the fields and applying pesticides only when pest levels reached previously established thresholds for damage that would lead to economic losses. In the last few decades, pesticides have been used preemptively, beginning with treated seed and followed by applications on a set schedule, said Christian Krupke, professor of entomology and member of the research team.  Using these potent insecticides, more often, increases the potential for unintended consequences and harm to insects, animals and human health. This study shows that we may not need such powerful weapons to control pests, and, at a minimum, we don t need to use them as frequently as we do,  Krupke said. Agricultural sustainability and the benefits of IPM are gaining attention. Walmart recently announced a policy requiring all global fresh produce and floral providers to adopt IPM practices by 2025.  It is important for people to know that there is another option between conventionally grown produce and organic produce,  said Kaplan who leads Purdue s Insect Ecology Lab.  IPM can greatly reduce the amount of pesticides used to grow food without taking the tool entirely away from farmers or putting the food supply at risk.  Midwest growers also are attuned to the issue and want solutions to protect their crops and their pollinators, said Laura Ingwell, assistant professor of entomology. Indiana is one of the major watermelon production states in the U.S. and the pollinator-dependent crop accounts for an average of 7,000 acres of land annually.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find untreated corn or soybean seed,  she said.  Across the Midwest watermelon fields are like islands in a sea of corn and soybeans. We need to understand how the management of one impacts the other because many Indiana farmers have all of these crops in rotation.  The team worked with farm staff at the Purdue research fields to grow both corn, which is wind pollinated, and watermelon, which is insect pollinated, to replicate a real agricultural ecosystem in Indiana. Each site had a pair of 15-acre fields, one with untreated seed and using IPM, and the other using treated seed and conventional pest management practices like calendar-based insecticide sprays. The crops were rotated over the course of the study, and the different locations allowed the team to examine the impact of different soil types and environmental conditions, said Jacob Pecenka, a graduate student who performed much of the study.  We used weekly scouting to monitor pests at the IPM fields, which means we would go into the field, look for pests and take a sample count of the numbers of different pests present,  he said.  It was surprising that the pests rarely reached the established threshold for economic risk to the crops. Only four times during the course of the study did pests reach a threshold that triggered pesticide application. That is a huge reduction from the 97 treatments of the conventionally managed fields.  Pecenka and his team also monitored the flowers and counted the number of visits by bees in the watermelon fields.  The IPM fields had a 130% increase in the number of flower visits over the conventional fields,  he said.  The biggest players in pollination were native, wild bees. They are efficient pollinators and serious foragers.  Due to watermelon crops being grown in the middle of the cornfields, any wild pollinators had to travel at least 100 feet to get to the watermelon flowers. Despite this challenge, wild pollinators made up 80% of the flower visits while honeybees were only 20%, even though their colonies were placed within a few feet of the watermelon field, Pecenka said.  We don t have a great understanding of the biology of many wild bee species, but this study suggests they are important and resilient,  he said.  Within the first year these bees were a significant presence in the fields with low levels of pesticide, which can kill the bees, confuse their navigation and repel them.  The team also observed an increase in the number of beneficial insects in the IPM fields, Ingwell said.  Wasps, ladybugs and other natural predators of watermelon pests step in when the pest levels rise,  she said.  It is tempting to pretreat with pesticides as an insurance policy for your crop, but this study shows we can trust the natural system most of the time. Weekly scouting in the watermelon crop is enough to maintain the yield and benefit the insect community in terms of pest suppression and pollination.

The kids who ate the DHA-fortified food surpassed those who did not in gross and fine motor abilities, language proficiencies and social skills   all related to brain health.Additionally, reducing the amount of linoleic acid   a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid   in the food also aided the children s neurological abilities. This is because the chemical composition of the omega-6 fatty acid thwarts production of the brain-boosting DHA, the latter of which is essential for brain development during pregnancy and early childhood and also is associated with improved vision, heart health and immune system function. This is the first evidence of the cognitive effects of ready-to-use therapeutic food showing DHA and reduced omega-6 are needed to increase the brain power of children with severe acute malnutrition,  said the study s senior author, Mark J. Manary, MD, the Helene B. Roberson Professor of Pediatrics.  We think the therapeutic food should be reformulated and standardized to include DHA and reduced omega-6. All children are entitled to our best efforts to reach their neurocognitive potential. The findings were published online Nov. 2  in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Globally, more than 16 million children under age 5 suffer from severe acute malnutrition. The condition is a form of starvation that primarily affects kids from impoverished areas of Africa and Asia and causes excessive thinness or swelling of the body while also compromising organ systems, including the brain.Severe acute malnutrition kills about 1 million children each year.Nearly two decades ago, Manary launched an effort in Africa to fight severe malnutrition using a peanut butter-based therapeutic food fortified with micronutrients known to restore body and muscle mass. The energy-dense, low-moisture food is comprised of peanuts, milk, vegetable oils and sugar, and, like peanut butter, it requires no cooking and does not spoil in ambient conditions. Such characteristics make the food ideal for people living in extreme poverty or in areas struck by a natural disaster, political unrest or other situations causing food scarcity.Outpatient feeding programs serving this ready-to-use therapeutic food have saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of malnourished children. Earlier data has shown that children with severe acute malnutrition who were treated with the food recovered at rates of 85% to 90%. But Manary and others who care for malnourished children have faced challenges in effectively treating the cognitive problems associated with severe malnutrition, such as difficulty speaking, mobility issues and behavioral problems.The malnourished brain requires additional special nutrients to restore normal function, namely omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids most commonly found in fish and breast milk, Manary said. DHA constitutes 10% of the brain matter and is the most important nutrient for the brain. Adding it to the therapeutic food along with reducing omega-6, which is antagonistic with omega-3, boosted cognition in starving children,  Manary said.The clinical feeding trial was conducted from October 2017 through December 2020 at 28 clinics in rural Malawi in sub-Saharan Africa. It involved 2,565 children ages 6 months to 5 years with uncomplicated severe malnutrition, meaning they were diagnosed as severely malnourished but still had good appetites, were not hospitalized and did not show signs of severe infection.Children were randomly assigned to receive one of three ready-to-use therapeutic foods: the original standard version with higher levels of omega-6; a version with reduced amounts of omega-6 and increased omega-3; and a version that included DHA with reduced omega-6. The trial investigators, the families and researchers analyzing the data didn t know to which groups the children were assigned.The treatments lasted about eight weeks. Six months after treatment ended, the researchers compared cognition in the malnourished children. They measured cognition using the Malawi Development Assessment tool, a standardized, scientifically validated battery of exercises testing language proficiency, social interaction, and gross and fine motor skills. Cognition was superior in the children who received the therapeutic food with additional omega-3 and DHA when compared with the other two groups,  Manary said.  Their scores were higher across the board. We noted an improvement that was 22% greater than in those who received the standard ready-to-use therapeutic food. For half of the children, cognition is completely restored, but without low omega-6 plus DHA, severely malnourished children would be 10 IQ points below average,  he added.Researchers also measured DHA levels in the children s blood immediately after completing the ready-to-use therapeutic food therapy. After four weeks, DHA levels decreased by 25% in children receiving the standard food, most likely because of the high amount of omega-6 fatty acids. (Manary noted that those DHA levels would decrease by significantly larger margins if the children were given no ready-to-use therapeutic food at all). Meanwhile, after four weeks, DHA levels increased by 49% among children who received the DHA-enhanced food. This suggests that the lack of DHA was limiting cognitive improvement,  Manary said.  It s fantastic news in the sense that the DHA-enhanced therapeutic food could restore malnourished brains better than before, and those benefits can stick for six months to a year or more. On Nov. 8 and 9, the researchers will present their findings to the World Health Organization, which establishes international guidelines for the treatment of malnutrition and other diseases. Additionally, in early December, they will share their research to advocate for improvements in the formulation of ready-to-use therapeutic food distributed worldwide, during a meeting of Codex Alimentarius, an international food safety organization that sets standards followed by most of the world s nations. Manary and his colleagues plan to call for all ready-to-use therapeutic food to be made with reduced amounts of omega-6 fatty acids and enhanced with DHA. Our goal is to change global policy,  Manary said.  These children deserve nothing less. Reference: Stephenson K, Callaghan-Gillespie M, Maleta K, et al.

The results show that the function of neural networks regulating satiety and appetite is altered already before a person develops obesity.Obesity is a globally increasing health problem, and new interventions to prevent and treat obesity are needed. Obesity is linked to changes in brain insulin sensitivity and neurotransmitter function. These changes may explain increased appetite and overeating.  However, thus far it has not been determined whether these changes are visible in the brain already before a person develops obesity, and if these changes would increase the risk for future obesity, says Doctoral Candidate Tatu Kantonen from the Department of Clinical Medicine of the University of Turku. Kantonen s study investigated changes in the brain in pre-obesity by studying the insulin, opioid, and cannabinoid function through PET imaging. The participants of the study consisted of 41 young men with varying number of obesity risk factors. The results showed that family-related risk factors such as parents  obesity or diabetes were associated with altered insulin signalling in the subject s brain as well as reduced function of the opioid and cannabioid systems.Disturbance in the neural networks controlling satiation and appetite can therefore be observed already before a person develops obesity, and these brain changes are connected to family-related risk factors of obesity. The results may have implications for the development of prevention and treatment interventions for obesity. They show that the brain and central nervous system are important targets in the treatment of obesity, says Kantonen. Reference: Kantonen T, Pekkarinen L, Karjalainen T, et al.

Their findings have been published in Science of the Total Environment.Aside from considering the risks of COVID-19 transmission in bathrooms, the review also analysed other infectious disease risks from public toilets in restaurants, workplaces, commercial premises and universities.The results showed widespread evidence of contaminated surfaces as a cause of faecal-oral transmission, but no documented instances of airborne-related infectious disease transmission.In the wake of borders re-opening, researchers called for more studies assessing SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks in public washrooms.Co-author of the paper, UniSA environmental scientist Professor Erica Donner, says anecdotal evidence suggests that public washrooms have been avoided by users in the past 18 months due to perceived risks of COVID-19 transmission. Some people have been worried about using public washrooms during the pandemic, but if you minimise your time in the bathroom, wash and dry your hands properly, and don t use your mobile phone, eat or drink, then the risks should be low, especially if the bathroom is well maintained,  Prof Donner says. While there is limited evidence of COVID-19 transmission via public washrooms, they are rife with bacteria, especially those that are used frequently and not cleaned properly. A wide range of intestinal, skin, and soil bacteria and respiratory viruses were identified in public washrooms, posing risks of transmission.Open-lid toilet flushing, ineffective hand washing or hand drying, poor surface cleaning, blocked drains and uncovered rubbish bins all contribute to heavy bacterial and viral loads in washrooms.Six studies investigated bacterial dispersal in public washrooms, showing jet air dryers can potentially spread droplets as far as three metres, and toilet flushing spreading particles as far as 1.5 metres and remaining in the air for more than 30 minutes.One 2021 study estimated that the number of particles from a toilet flush was equivalent to droplets from a person talking loudly for just over six and a half minutes. Although there is a potential risk of aerosols spreading from toilet flushing and hand drying, we found no evidence of airborne transmission of intestinal or respiratory pathogens in public bathrooms in the literature we reviewed,  Prof Donner says. However, there is no doubt that thorough hand washing and effective hand drying is critical in stopping the spread of diseases. As borders open up and cases increase, people can protect themselves against COVID-19 infection by continuing to practice good hygiene. This includes handwashing and sanitising, disinfecting door handles, toilet lids and other frequently touched surfaces. These habits will not only lower the risk of COVID-19 infection but also limit the risk of bacterial infections. Reference: Vardoulakis S, Espinoza Oyarce DA, Donner E.

The paper and its findings, published today in Nature, could pave the way toward a new treatment for certain kinds of aggressive breast cancer. During cancer progression, this molecule, known as DDR1, organizes a high-order extracellular matrix that acts like barbed wire around the boundary of a tumor to prevent immune cells from entering the tumor,  Rong Li, the Ross Professor of Basic Science Research at GW and lead author of the paper, said.  Knowing that the DDR1 molecule creates a protective boundary around tumors, we were able to use pre-clinical models to show that the moment you deactivate DDR1, immune cells can infiltrate the tumor and kill the cells inside. Li and his colleagues studied triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of cancer that accounts for about 15% of all breast cancer cases. This type of cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lacks the receptors commonly used in targeted cancer therapies, making it difficult to target the tumor cells. Immunotherapy is designed to activate immune cells when they can get to the center of a tumor, but the DDR1 molecule puts up a physical barrier to anti-tumor immune cells. Identifying the underlying mechanism could provide a new way of looking for novel therapeutic agents for this hard-to-treat cancer, Li said.In the Nature study, the researchers assessed the impact of removing DDR1 in multiple pre-clinical models. They determined that knocking out DDR1 not only halts tumor growth, but it also may protect the body from future tumors.In conjunction with the new findings, co-corresponding author Zhiqiang An has developed a therapeutic DDR1-targeting antibody that breaks down that line of defense and helps tumor-killing immune cells cross.  The discovery of the important role of DDR1 in cancer resistance is a significant advance that can potentially transform treatment pathways,  said An, who serves as director of the Texas Therapeutics Institute and a professor of molecular medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth Houston).  I m delighted by the collaboration between researchers and academic labs, excited by synergies of basic and translational research, and encouraged by the rapid translation from discovery to therapeutic candidates for the benefit of people living with cancer. With this more comprehensive understanding of DDR1, researchers also hope to identify additional molecules like DDR1 and use the same approach to fight other cancers.Reference: Sun X, Wu B, Chiang HC, et al.

A significant number of plastics break down into microplastics, which are ingested by fish and other marine life causing havoc to marine ecosystems. In Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, by AIP Publishing, researchers from California State Polytechnic University report using catalytic pyrolysis to turn plastic wastes into a valuable fuel source. Pyrolysis is the thermochemical decomposition of carbon-based matter in the absence of oxygen. Researchers focused on recycling plastic and upgrading plastic into other products or converting it to a vapor with heat, which met a catalyst and turned into the desired fuel-like product. This pyrolytic process transforms primary organic waste into a sustainable fuel or other valuable chemical.  The innovative part of the experiment is the catalyst,  said author Mingheng Li.  The catalyst is critical to this particular pyrolysis process, because it only requires one step to get to the desired fuel product at relatively mild temperatures.  The catalyst was prepared by dipping a zeolite substrate in an aqueous solution containing nickel and tungsten and drying it in an oven at 500 degrees Celsius. The synthesized catalyst was used in conjunction with a lab-designed, single-stage pyrolytic reactor, which ran at a set point of 360 C to break down a mixture of plastic grocery bags. The catalytic process used in this experiment on plastic waste could also be used to process other wastes, such as manure, municipal solid waste, and used engine oil, to make usable energy products.  This pyrolysis process serves as a definitive step in reducing reliance on fossil-based fuels,  said Li. The researchers found the pyrolysis product was very similar to a standard diesel fuel product via gas chromatographic analysis, a type of chromatography used in analytical chemistry for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. Going forward, the team will work to explain the cracking mechanism that occurs on the surface of the catalyst. In addition, they will try to optimize diesel fuel production from various mixed plastic wastes.ReferenceArnold M, Boghosian B, Li M. Catalytic production of diesel-like oils from plastic wastes.

Currently, however, there isn t an effective warning system for impending blooms. Now, researchers in ACS Applied Nano Materials report an indicator that changes color when exposed to rising levels of alkaline phosphatase   an enzyme that forecasts phytoplankton s exponential growth. This change can be detected by the naked eye or a smartphone.A surplus of phosphorus in freshwater systems causes algae, such as phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, to grow out of control, turning the water into a  pea soup  of these organisms. Blooms can threaten drinking water supplies because some algal species release unpleasant odors or toxins. But if people knew when an algal bloom was likely to develop, they could manage it by removing or killing the algae before they become a problem. Previously, Jingjing Deng and colleagues showed that alkaline phosphatase helps release bioavailable phosphorus from complex compounds, and that rising levels of the enzyme could forecast phosphorus-related algal blooms. However, current detection methods for alkaline phosphatase aren t very sensitive or specific. So, the researchers wanted to use the reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase to induce both fluorescence and visible color changes in a water sample. To make the color-changing indicator, the researchers first combined copper ions with guanosine-5-monophosphate, forming spherical nanoparticles. Next, they incorporated two compounds (1,1,2,2-tetra(4-carboxylphenyl)ethylene and sulforhodamine 101) within the nanoparticles. The final result was a deep blue solution in visible light that fluoresced a bluish-purple under UV light. In the presence of alkaline phosphatase, the solution shifted to a pinkish hue and a strong red fluorescence under UV light. The researchers tested the indicator with water from 13 river locations that had limited bioavailable phosphorus, calculating red-to-blue fluorescence ratios with a smartphone s color scanning app. They found that the portable digital method reliably detected alkaline phosphatase and was as robust as benchtop measurements of the indicator s fluorescence. The researchers also grew toxin-producing cyanobacteria in the lab, feeding them complex phosphorus-containing compounds, and measured the alkaline phosphatase changes. On the third day, a large increase in enzyme activity was detected with both fluorescence and visible color changes. A few days later, the algae were growing exponentially. Because the indicator and smartphone-based system detected the activity surge prior to a bloom, the researchers say it could be developed for real-time field monitoring and prediction.ReferenceLuo Y, Li J, Li Y, Yang B, Zhou T, Deng J.

These studies reveal the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain   looking at the ways in which the virus might enter and disrupt the brain and the extent and duration of these effects. This important research provides new light on an unclear aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the ability of the virus to infect neurons and other cells of the nervous system has been hard to pin down.Opening the press briefing was the All India Institute of Medical Science, Patna s Professor Ashutosh Kumar, who looked at the mechanisms that may permit the virus to access our brain. His team identified a pair of molecules   the receptor protein neuropilin 1 and the protease furin   as potential mediators of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Neuropilin-1 is capable of, in combination with furin, cleaving the SAR-CoV-2 spike protein, an essential step in viral cell entry.A complementary study, looking at how the virus might enter the peripheral nervous system, was presented by Virginia Tech s Jonathan D. Joyce. Joyce s presentation contained a stark reminder of why this research is such a focus of the SfN program in 2021   80% of people with COVID-19 develop neurological symptoms, ranging from loss of taste and smell to nerve pain. Joyce s work looked at ganglia   groups of neuronal cell bodies that are found in the peripheral nervous system. By using mouse models of COVID-19, Joyce s team revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was capable of infecting peripheral nerves beyond those responsible for smell. Every single peripheral sensory and autonomic nerve tested had the viral genome present, and infectious virus was also detected in a subset of these nerves. This finding, said Joyce, may explain some of the constellation of neurological symptoms reported by COVID-19 patients.SARS-CoV-2 s profound effect on our sense of smell, while far from being the most severe or debilitating symptom of COVID-19, is an unusual and potent clinical sign that sets the disease apart from other respiratory viruses. Investigating this phenomenon in detail was John H Morrison, a professor of neurology at UC Davis. Are such neurological effects a direct result of the virus invading the brain, or of some other biological response to the virus?Morrison and colleagues, using a primate model, showed that seven days after exposure, SARS-CoV-2 proteins could be found in multiple brain areas, with transport through the brain apparently facilitated via brain circuits. Notably, Morrison s team showed that entry to the brain appeared to be through the olfactory system and that aged, diabetic animals had more aggressive brain infection.A final study presented was by Dr. Allison Sekuler, a chair in cognitive neuroscience at Baycrest s Rotman Research Institute and a professor at McMaster University and the University of Toronto. Her multi-institutional team used a neuroimaging-based approach to examine the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition. Using an innovative portable electroencephalography (EEG) device, they showed that brain power was reduced in people who had tested positive for COVID-19 up to seven months after infection.Together, these studies show the neuroscience field s commitment to revealing the remaining ambiguous effects of COVID-19 on the brain, which will help bring clarity to both those battling the disease and those still feeling its side effects months later.

A Mount Sinai study now shows that we may also do this when interacting with other people.In an effort to understand how a sense of control over others may influence the brain s decision-making processes, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai tested the ability of healthy human subjects to play a bargaining game. For the first time, they found that people used  forward thinking  when trying to sway others. Forward thinking happened regardless of whether the subjects could actually influence others and appeared to be driven by neural activity in a well-known decision-making center of the brain. Humans are social beings. And, in our view, many psychiatric disorders are the result of problems with how the brain s software is programmed to handle social situations. In this study we tried to understand the rules that govern how that software is programmed,  said Xiaosi Gu, PhD, Director of the Center for Computational Psychiatry at Mount Sinai.  Our results suggest that in certain social situations the brain draws on the kind of forward thinking often used when playing chess. The study was led by Soojung Na, PhD, a former graduate student in the Gu lab and Dongil Chung, PhD, a principal investigator at the Uslan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.The researchers specifically investigated whether forward thinking is used during times when we try to influence others, or exert  social control.  Decades of research have shown that social control can have profound effects on well-being and mental health. Although several studies have shown that forward thinking is used in non-social situations, few have investigated its role in how we interact with others.To test this idea, the researchers initially had 48 healthy volunteers sit in a brain scanner and play different versions of the  ultimatum game,  a well-known bargaining exercise in which the subjects were asked to split $20 with an opposing team. Initial offers always started at $5. In one,  controllable,  version of the game the rules were predictable. If the subject accepted the $5 then the next offer would be one or two dollars lower. Conversely, a rejection of the $5 led to raising the subsequent offer by the same amounts. For the second,  uncontrollable,  version of the game, a subject s initial decision had no effect on the following offers. Instead they were chosen randomly and were thus unpredictable. Each subject played 40 rounds, alternating between the two different versions.Initial results showed that there were differences between how the subjects responded to the games, which suggested that they perceived and exploited the advantages posed by the predictable version. Most notably, they received higher offers, took longer to decide, and felt a greater sense of control when playing the predictable version.The participants reported a sense of control during the unpredictable game that was much higher around 40 percent than reality, which was zero chance of control. Moreover, in one subset of experiments, the subjects played the games against a computer instead of teams. Here the participants felt about 60 percent in control of the game regardless of which version they played and despite the fact that they received higher offers in the predictable version. These results highlight the complicated interplay between the actual controllability of social situations and our feelings of control,  said Dr. Gu.Nonetheless, computational modeling experiments suggested that in every situation tested predictable vs unpredictable and team vs computer the subjects consistently used forward thinking to play the game. In other words, a computer algorithm which tested out whether a subject would think two, three, or four steps ahead before deciding on an offer recreated the initial results better than one that assumed the subjects just reacted or thought only one step ahead.These findings were strengthened by the results of an online version of the initial experiments that was played by 1,342 participants. Again, the results showed that the predictable version of the game produced higher offers and a greater sense of control then the unpredictable one even though the simulation suggested that forward thinking was used for both.Finally, the results of the brain scans suggested that these choices were being driven by neural activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a decision-making center known to be involved in forward thinking. For instance, the two-step forward thinking computer simulation helped explain the changes in this area of the brain better than other simulations or when applied to other brain regions. These results expand the role of both the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and of forward thinking in our lives,  said Dr. Gu.  In the future, we plan to explore how problems in the brain s forward thinking app may play role in depression, schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

As similar hormones and brain structures are involved in social interactions in many species, including humans, this new information may lay the groundwork for better understanding some of the foundations of social differences.Voles make good model animals for studying social behaviors because they are naturally social creatures. Some vole species, such as prairie voles, form lasting social bonds with both their mates and same-sex peers. Meadow voles, on the other hand, only form communities to help survive the winter and then part ways in the warmer months. We wanted to determine why voles of these two species spend time in social contact,  says first author Annaliese Beery, who directed this research in her laboratory at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, US, and is currently in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley, US.  Specifically, we wanted to know what role social motivation plays in their behaviour, or to what extent social selectivity is more about avoiding strangers.  To answer these questions, Beery and her colleagues trained both prairie voles and meadow voles to push a bar to receive food as a reward. They then replaced food rewards with brief access to a familiar vole of the same species, or a stranger, to see how often the voles would push the bar to get close to the other animal. With each successive press of the bar, it became more difficult to gain access to the other vole, with the animals needing to press the bar again for more access. There were striking species and sex differences in who the voles would work to be closer to,  Beery says. Her team found that female prairie voles worked harder to see familiar voles than strangers, but male prairie voles did not show this preference for their acquaintances. Instead, the males worked hard to access any females, but showed less interest in males. But the males still huddled with familiar animals when they were together. The meadow voles, which were female only, did not work as hard as the female prairie voles to reach familiar animals.Together, the results suggest that prairie voles find social interactions with familiar animals rewarding, while the meadow voles were more likely to tolerate friends and family over unfamiliar animals but were not highly motivated by these interactions.Finally, the researchers discovered that the individual variation in behaviour was associated with the density of receptors in the brain for oxytocin   a hormone linked to social interaction. Animals with more oxytocin receptors in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens worked harder to socialise. By contrast, animals with more oxytocin receptors in a part of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis were more likely to be aggressive towards other animals.  Our study illustrates the difference between social reward and social selectivity,  says co-author Sarah Lopez, who worked on the study as a student researcher in the Beery Social Neuroendocrinology Lab at Smith College, and is now a medical student at the University of Pittsburgh, US.  We ve shown that selectivity can come from avoidance and lack of avoidance, as well as from social reward. Beery adds:  Knowing more about how the mechanisms supporting social relationships are similar and different across species and sexes will help us understand which mechanisms are universal and which are species-specific. This insight may in turn aid our understanding of how species-typical patterns of social behaviour might evolve over time. Reference: Beery AK, Lopez SA, Blandino KL, Lee NS, Bourdon NS.

However, in a newly published study, researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) have detected antibodies primarily made in response to infections in the mucous membranes   in such areas as the lungs, intestines, or vagina   in study participants with malaria.The researchers say that their unexpected finding provides new insight into how the human body responds to malaria infection and may ultimately help to identify new ways to treat malaria or develop vaccines.The study was published on September 13 in NPJ Vaccines.More than 400,000 people die each year of malaria infections, with more than two-thirds of these deaths in children under 5 years old, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In early October 2021, the WHO recommended widespread use of a new malaria vaccine in children who live in regions with moderate to higher malaria transmission rates, the first human vaccine to be recommended for a parasite infection. While the vaccine would prevent millions of infections and save thousands of lives, the researchers are actively pursuing the next generation of malaria vaccines that may be even more effective. We ve made progress in treating and preventing deaths due to malaria infections, but progress has plateaued, and we need new ideas,  said pediatric infectious disease physician and study author Andrea Berry, MD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics at UMSOM and scientist at UMSOM s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD).  Not much had been done to study IgA antibodies in malaria infections, because people had not thought that they were important. Yet, because we were not looking for them, we may have missed a whole avenue of research that we can now explore. The body s immune system creates different kinds of antibodies to help clear infections and to prevent reinfection. In an earlier small study, the research team was studying other antibody responses in patients with malaria infection. While they detected the IgM antibody, which appears early in many infections, along with IgG, which is the most abundant antibody, they also found IgA antibodies. Researchers decided to follow up with a new study to examine more samples to confirm what they had observed and to study additional groups of people.For the new study, the research team looked at antibodies collected from the blood of 54 adult research participants after being infected with malaria in the laboratory   either through an IV inserted directly into the blood or through mosquito bites. They also examined samples of blood taken from 47 children living in Mali, West Africa, who were enrolled in a malaria vaccine trial and acquired malaria during the study period. Researchers detected high levels of IgA antibodies in the adult participants infected with malaria. In addition, 10 of the children had levels of IgA antibodies similar to those of the adults tested. We do not know what triggers the IgA antibodies to develop, but we think it happens early in a malaria infection,  said Dr. Berry.  Some people think that the response might happen when the mosquito injects the parasite into the skin. Interestingly, some of our participants were not bitten by mosquitoes because their malaria infection was delivered intravenously, so there are probably additional triggers for IgA development. Now, she said, determining why the children did not universally have high levels of IgA will give researchers more of an understanding of how malaria infections affect the body. There are several possible explanations for this difference between the adults and the children,  said Dr. Berry.  Perhaps, children s immune systems respond differently to the parasite than adults do, or it is possible that IgA antibodies are only created during the first malaria infection.  She explained that in the adult participants, researchers knew that they received their first infection, but whether the children had been previously infected was unknown. The timing of the infection and sample collection was uniform among the adult study participants, but not with the children, because their malaria infections were coincidental during the study.Dr. Berry said they can now test to see if IgA antibodies prevent malaria parasites from going into the liver or red blood cells. They can also investigate which proteins in malaria these IgA antibodies target and whether they would be good candidates to use in a vaccine. Even with medical advances, malaria remains one of the leading causes of death in developing countries,  said E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, UM Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor, and Dean, UMSOM.  Getting back to basics and exploring unknown fundamental mechanisms behind the body s response to malaria infection may be the key to revealing new ways to prevent and treat this devastating disease.

Scientists pre-treated healthy mice with the chemotherapy agent and gave them intravenous injections of breast cancer cells four days later.Within three hours of injection, the cancer cells were penetrating weakened junctions between blood vessel cells in the lungs and binding to those vessels underlining structure   avoiding being washed away by blood flow. This is the key step giving cancer cells a foot in the door at a secondary site,  said Tsonwin Hai, professor of biological chemistry and pharmacology at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study. The whole point of our pre-treatment model is to ask the question: Does chemotherapy affect normal cells in such a way that they will turn around and help cancer cells? The answer is yes. It s a cautionary note for the use of chemotherapy. The study was published online recently in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences.Hai has studied the underpinnings of cancer metastasis for years, previously finding that activation of a specific gene in immune cells is a crucial link between stress and cancer s spread and that the chemo drug paclitaxel sets off molecular changes in immune cells that allow breast cancer cells to escape from a tumor.This new study zeroed in on the effects of the chemo drug cyclophosphamide on non-cancer cells before there is any cancer present, focusing on the lungs as the site of metastasis.Researchers injected one dose of the chemo into mice and waited four days for the animals to metabolize and excrete the drug. They then gave the mice intravenous injections of breast cancer cells, allowing them to travel to the lungs.Once in the lungs, the cancer cells were more likely to latch onto blood vessel walls if the animals were pre-treated with chemo. Researchers identified two reasons: First, spaces had opened up between cells in the vessel lining. Beyond that, a second material under those cells, called the basement membrane, had changed properties in a way that let cancer cells latch on so they wouldn t be whisked away by blood flow. The endothelial cells lining the inner side of the blood vessel are like a brick wall, and each brick is tightly adhered to the next one,  said Hai, also an investigator in Ohio State s Comprehensive Cancer Center.  What we found when we treated mice with chemotherapy is that it makes the vessel leaky, so the tight junction is not as tight anymore and the cancer cells can squeeze themselves through the brick layer. We also found that chemotherapy modified the underlying basement membrane so once the cancer cells squeeze through, they find a place to grab onto. In control mice that did not receive chemotherapy, the cancer cells  adhesion to blood vessel walls was comparatively minimal, Hai said.The research team determined that cyclophosphamide s presence led to an increase in levels of an enzyme in the blood called MMP-2, and that increase induced changes to the basement membrane that allowed cancer cells to attach to the blood vessel lining (see figure above).For decades, scientists focused on the effects of chemo on the intrinsic properties of cancer cells that allow the cells to survive, resist chemotherapy and spread. Only in the last 10 years or so have researchers uncovered the effects of chemotherapy on non-cancer cells and their contribution to metastasis. We focused here on how chemo affects the non-cancer cells in the lung   the second site in our model   rather than that at the primary tumors, because cancer cells  escape from a primary tumor is not a late event   it can actually happen very early on,  Hai said.  Our data revealed that chemo acts on non-cancer cells and sets in motion changes in the lung so that within three hours of cancer cells  arrival, they already can adhere very well. The effect of chemotherapy on non-cancer cells actually changes those cells, and those changes help cancer cells to progress. This work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Much of it comes from the single-use items that we re all familiar with, such as food wrappers and microbeads that inadvertently wind up in the sea. But a growing amount is coming from plastics that are actually made to be used in marine environments, such as instrumentation used for an emerging ocean  Internet of Things. Oceanographic sensors are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and people don t want to go back into the ocean and get them, so they re basically disposable,  said UC Santa Barbara marine microbiologist Alyson Santoro, a faculty member in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology (EEMB). These networking devices are used by the  blue economy    a diverse group of maritime industries including tourism, defense, transportation, fisheries, education and power generation. By enabling rapid data-gathering and communications across the many sectors and communities that use the ocean, monitoring can be enhanced, resources managed more effectively and innovative solutions accelerated.But that doesn t resolve the issue of long-lived plastics in the ocean, a problem that Santoro and colleagues   Anne Meyer at the University of Rochester, Melissa Omand at the University of Rhode Island, Ryan Freedman at the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and partners from sustainable polymers designer Mango Materials   are trying to get ahead of. And now, with support from the National Science Foundation s Convergence Accelerator program, the group is poised to tackle that challenge, with results that could change the way future oceangoing materials are made. This award will give me the opportunity to work with scientists and engineers I wouldn t have the chance to work with otherwise, and the rare opportunity to be a student again and participate in the program s design curriculum, where we ll learn how to collaborate effectively as a team,  Santoro said. Her group is one of 16 teams selected for the highly competitive 2021 Cohort, Phase 1, Networked Blue Economy track of NSF s Convergence Accelerator. Professor Santoro s proposal is a visionary approach to tackling the urgent need to understand how to find solutions to plastic pollution through cross-fertilization of ideas between scientists and engineers,  said EEMB chair Debora Iglesias-Rodriguez.  Congratulations to Professor Santoro for pioneering research that could be truly transformative and open opportunities for our students. For the first year, we ll be learning how to work together and refine our ideas,  Santoro said.  We ll do a lot of prototyping of different materials that we will test in different ways.  There is in fact no standardized way to test plastic degradation in the ocean, she added, so one of the outcomes of the project will be to develop those standards. Throughout the curriculum, teams practice pitching, with the formal pitch occurring at the end of phase 1.The project also has a training component, in which UC Santa Barbara students will be sent to Mango Materials for internships and industry experience. M. Ofelia Aguirre, from UC Santa Barbara s Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships, will partner with the team to mentor undergraduate interns and help transition the team s findings into training the next generation of microbiologists, material scientists and ocean engineers. At the end of phase 1, the team will participate in a formal pitch and phase 2 proposal evaluation. Selected teams will move into phase 2, focusing on solution development, sustainability and more. It s not just for research; there s a lot of push in global shipping to do what s called smart shipping, in which the shipping vessels themselves would be able to adjust their track based on ocean conditions,  Santoro said.  And the sensor networks that allow them to make those decisions are all out, floating in the ocean.  Among the goals, she added, is to develop a product or open use technology that will have a large impact on society within a three to five-year timeframe.This article has been republished from the following materials.

But groundbreaking ideas usually mean taking risks in innovation, which calls for scientists and engineers who aren t afraid to dream big.That s exactly what the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is looking for when it awards the Langer Prize for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Excellence to researchers pursuing  blue sky  ideas, like UD s own Aditya Kunjapur.Kunjapur, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, has been awarded the 2021 AIChE Langer Prize to help transition bacteria-based technology that his lab has developed toward the marketplace. He marks only the third recipient of this grant, which is awarded to original ideas that have a real promise of providing valuable contributions to society. There are a lot of things that I like about what AIChE has done by creating this particular award. One of those is that they are recognizing that entrepreneurship is really important,  Kunjapur said.  This is true in general for science, but even more so in the current environment where academic discoveries and inventions related to biotechnology need to be translated to help make a difference in people s lives. Kunjapur s work has focused on engineering bacteria to perform a wide array of functions, from producing fuels and chemicals to treating or preventing disease. In his lab, which was launched at UD only three years ago, he is focusing on creating and harnessing new chemical building blocks using genetically engineered bacteria. In the case of the project supported by the Langer Prize, Kunjapur s Lab is exploring whether bacteria can produce amino acids that will elicit a stronger immune response, which could lead to applications in vaccines or as immunotherapies. What we re doing is trying to put something onto those proteins that says,  Hey, look at me!  to the immune system,  Kunjapur said.  Our community of synthetic biologists has gotten so good at changing the genetics of a microbe. You d think   especially during a global pandemic   that we might have a lot of tools that would be relevant. In fact, we do. And my colleagues have done a lot of great work in this area. With antibiotic resistance on the rise, having better vaccine candidates to battle troublesome bacteria would decrease our reliance on finding new antibiotics. Now, he s exploring whether synthetic biology tools can lead to the design of a vaccine that could work against bacteria for which there currently are no vaccines. This project so far is the work of one really outstanding graduate student,  Kunjapur said, giving credit to Neil Butler, a chemical engineering graduate student.  It s been his initiative from day one, and his work played a huge role in earning this prize. It can be challenging to fund  blue sky  ideas because those out-of-the-box ideas are also often a higher risk to explore. That s why it s notable that the $75,000 stipend connected to the award is completely unrestricted. Kunjapur said Langer Prize funding will allow his lab to further explore commercialization of their discoveries, contract out more research, accelerate the technology and continue conversations with companies to learn about their needs. This funding will allow us to begin to perform higher-risk, more expensive experiments that are normally difficult to fit in the budget of a new lab,  Butler said.  I m excited to push these directions forward. That success in the lab, as well as support from the Langer Prize, has allowed Kunjapur s group to seek a new entrepreneurial postdoctoral fellow with experience in protein engineering, next-generation sequencing and immunology to start in mid-2022. Interested applicants should reach out to Kunjapur directly before Friday, Dec. 31.The Kunjapur Lab has been working on this project since its inception, and has also received research funding from the National Science Foundation. More recent NSF support came from Horn Entrepreneurship s NSF I-Corps Sites Program for commercial translation of their work. Through that program, Butler participated in training and conducted interviews with customers and companies that could find value in their synthetic biology-based technology.""Using synthetic biology, we believe bacteria can synthesize proteins that are better targets for the immune system,"" Butler said. ""Innovative alternatives to traditional vaccination methods should be pursued.""The Langer Prize itself, like Kunjapur s lab at UD, is relatively new. Named after Robert S. Langer, one of 12 Institute professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the prize is awarded to entrepreneurial researchers aiming to address challenges in a variety of industries. The award, first granted in 2019, comes with unrestricted seed funding  to tackle high-risk, high-impact challenges with the potential of achieving game-changing innovations. Kunjapur, who finished his postdoctoral work at Harvard Medical School in 2018, is only the third honoree of the Langer Prize, which is intended for early-career researchers demonstrating entrepreneurial excellence in innovations. He joined the UD faculty in 2018, and since then has been named an Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative Fellow (in 2019) and to the 35 Under 35  class of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (in 2020).Langer and Kunjapur have more in common than just this award. Kunjapur was a student in MIT s chemical engineering department and could have pursued working for him in the esteemed Langer Lab, he said. At the time, I just didn t think of myself as being that interested in drug delivery or biomedical research,  Kunjapur said as he recalled a talk by Langer that he attended as a first-year grad student. Listening to Langer s story of his own professional journey helped Kunjapur realize that working in a well-established field like the oil and gas industry would mean that success would revolve around truly incremental changes   like making a process just 0.00001% better. Inspired by Langer s decision to turn down the oil and gas industry for uncharted waters, Kunjapur found himself on his own innovative journey. Now, small scientific ventures chasing  blue sky  ideas like those being explored in Kunjapur s lab are on the front lines of societal leaps and bounds in the face of a global pandemic. Start-up technologies with academic roots have been instrumental to the success of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for COVID-19. It s important to just try things that are a little outside of the box or higher risk,  Kunjapur said.  Even though we have this kind of aging infrastructure for scientific funding, society is still capable of doing things on a remarkable scale and pace. It s just incredible what progress in biotechnology has been achieved in the last three years. This article has been republished from the following materials.

But researchers from Japan have discovered that, on a geological time scale, one rainforest tree species has been getting up to all sorts of antics.In a study published this month in Tree Genetics & Genomes, researchers from the University of Tsukuba have revealed that a tropical rainforest tree species underwent a recent and rapid population expansion in Borneo, showing that an understanding of a species  past is important for ensuring its future.Biodiversity loss is one of the most pressing problems of our time. Ecosystems such as tropical rainforests, which have high biodiversity and species richness, face ongoing threats from changing land use and over-exploitation by humans. To conserve the tree species living in these environments, it is important to understand their genetics and how their current genetic structures were established. We investigated the genetics of Shorea parvifolia, a widely distributed tropical forest tree in Southeast Asia,  says senior author of the study, Professor Yoshihiko Tsumura.  Its genetic structure has been affected by repeated glacial and interglacial fluctuations; these genetic changes provide key knowledge for sustainable use and conservation. S. parvifolia is important for ecosystem function and forestry in Southeast Asia. To examine its genetics, the researchers took leaf samples from trees in natural populations that covered almost the entire geographical range of S. parvifolia. The team used nuclear DNA markers and the DNA sequencing data of chloroplasts (the plant cell structures that carry out photosynthesis) to examine the genetic structure of S. parvifolia and how it was established. The nuclear DNA analysis of the genetic structure showed a clear separation between the Borneo populations and the others,  explains Professor Tsumura.Although the genetic structure shown by the chloroplast DNA was less pronounced, further analysis showed important differences in the Borneo populations. The results indicated that S. parvifolia has had a recent population expansion in Borneo. The high genetic diversity at particular genetic markers in the Borneo samples suggest that during the most recent glacial period, populations of this species likely migrated from the Malay Peninsula to Borneo and then underwent a major population increase, amassing considerable genetic diversity,  says Professor Tsumura.On the basis of the results of their study, the researchers have suggested that conservation units in this area be divided into three regions: the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. The team s findings also highlight the benefit of using locally sourced seeds for plantings aimed at improving conservation and sustainability in tropical forests of Southeast Asia, because doing so could maintain species  genetic diversity.Reference: Ohtani M, Tani N, Ueno S, et al.

The study began as an attempt to create a map of the most common relationship problems experienced by people outside of clinical and counselling settings.  Most of what we know about relationship problems comes from studies of people in couples therapy, which includes a rather specific subset of people   people who have the time, money, and motive to work on their relationship problems  said Charlotte Entwistle, lead author of the study.  We wanted to understand not only what relationship problems are most commonly experienced by the general public, but who experiences which problems more. Using natural language processing methods, the team analyzed the demographic and psychological characteristics of over 184,000 people who posted their relationship problems to an anonymous online forum. The researchers were then able to statistically determine the most common themes that came up across each post, creating a  map  of the most common relationship problems.Results showed that communication problems were the #1 most frequent problem mentioned, with nearly 1 in 5 people noting difficulty discussing problems, and 1 in 8 mentioning trust issues in their relationships.Previously unexpected patterns emerged from the data as well, including key gender differences in which themes were used the most. As we were conducting the study, we realized that this was an important opportunity to put a lot of common ideas about gender differences in relationships to the test  said Dr Ryan Boyd, the lead researcher of the project.  For example, are men truly less emotionally invested in relationships than women, or is it the case that men are simply stigmatized out of sharing their feelings? Analyses revealed that the most common theme mentioned by people talking about their relationship problems was about the emotional pain caused by the problems, rather than the problems themselves. The most common theme was about  heartache  and was comprised of words like regret, breakup, cry, and heartbroken.Contrary to their expectations, the team s findings showed that men discuss heartbreak significantly more than did women. These findings suggest that the stereotype of men being less emotionally invested in relationships than women may not be accurate.Charlottle Entwistle said:  Notably, the fact that the heartache theme was more commonly discussed by men emphasizes how men are at least as emotionally affected by relationship problems as women. Additionally, the researchers found that men were more likely to seek relationship help than women in online settings.Dr Ryan Boyd noted that  Traditionally, women are more likely to identify relationship problems, consider therapy, and seek therapy than are men. When you remove the traditional social stigmas against men for seeking help and sharing their emotions, however, they seem just as invested in working through rough patches in their relationships as women. The team s findings have implications for the general public, as well as clinical settings. The researchers noted that developing a more accurate picture of relationship problems helps us to better understand when and why things go wrong in our relationships, potentially helping couples avoid the most common setbacks to romantic success. The study s authors also suggest the findings may also help to destigmatize help-seeking by showing how common many relationship problems are, and by showing that men are just as likely as women to seek help in the first place.The researchers say that this work also points to important future directions for additional research.  One of the most important things that we re seeing here is that we re able to create an incredibly accurate picture of relationship problems that everyday people face based purely on what people say online  said Dr Boyd.  This gives us serious hope that we can use help-seeking behavior to better understand all types of social and psychological issues, and in a way that we simply cannot do using traditional research methods.

Researchers have long suspected that BD may be accompanied by abnormal structural and functional changes in the brain. Small cross-sectional brain imaging studies of people with BD have shown hints at those changes, but the ability to interpret data collected at a single timepoint is limited. Now, a multi-center longitudinal study shows aberrant changes over time in the brains of people with BD. Some changes were specifically associated with more episodes of mania.The report appears in Biological Psychiatry, published by Elsevier. The study involved a large international multi-center team of more than 70 researchers from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group.""The ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group report illustrates the power of large-scale multi-center collaboration,  said John Krystal, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry.  Longitudinal neuroimaging studies are extremely challenging to conduct. Here, by combining data from 14 sites, we get one of the clearest pictures we have of the neurotoxic impact of bipolar disorder, particularly manic episodes.""The researchers gathered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and detailed clinical data from 307 people with BD and from 925 healthy controls (HC) from 14 clinical sites worldwide. Participants were assessed at two timepoints, ranging from six months to nine years apart.The most striking finding was that the cortex, the brain s outermost layer, thinned over time to a greater extent in people who experienced more manic episodes. Those who did not have mania showed no cortical thinning or even cortical thickening. The changes were most evident in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an area associated with executive control and emotion regulation. The fact that cortical thinning in patients related to manic episodes stresses the importance of treatment to prevent mood episodes and is important information for psychiatrists,  said senior author Mikael Land n, MD, PhD, Professor and Chief Physician at the Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.  Researchers should focus on better understanding the progressive mechanisms at play in bipolar disorder to ultimately improve treatment options. Compared to HC, people with BD showed a faster enlargement in the brain s ventricles, cavities within the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid. In cortical areas outside the PFC, BD participants actually showed slower thinning than HC participants. Lead author Christoph Ab , PhD, Assistant Professor, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, said:  The abnormal ventricle enlargements and importantly the associations between cortical thinning and manic symptoms indicate that bipolar disorder may in fact be a neuroprogressive disorder, which could explain the worsening of bipolar symptoms in some patients.  One possibility to explain why BD patients may have slower thinning of the cortex compared to HC is that lithium, a medication used to treat BD, is known to have neuroprotective effects and could bolster cortical thickness. Regardless, the study provides new clues about the structural effects of BD on the brain over time.Reference: Ab  C, Ching CRK, Liberg B, et al.

Funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of its project  Polar+ Surface Mass Balance Feasibility , the study used measurements from the ESA s CryoSat-2 satellite mission, using estimates of surface elevation change over time. One of the very few satellites orbiting with 2 degrees of the planet's poles, CryoSat-2 has provided scientists with a long history of data no other spacecraft could reach since its launch over 11 years ago, transforming scientist s capacity to study the polar regions. It remains key to research and knowledge critical to decision-making on the planet s health.  Study co-author Lin Gilbert (UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory) said:  Observations show that extreme melt events in Greenland have become more frequent and more intense - as well as more erratic - which is a global problem. Monitoring from space enables us to cover the whole of Greenland (and nearly all Antarctica) repeatedly, which can't be done by teams on the ground. This is the first-time run-off has ever been measured directly from space - allowing us to remotely observe hard-to-explore regions of the ice sheets and use these observations to form an enhanced understanding of why this is happening and what we can do about it in future . The international team of researchers found that over the past four decades Greenland s meltwater runoff has risen by 21% - and has become 60% more erratic from one summer to the next. The findings revel that between 2011 and 2020 increased meltwater runoff from Greenland raised the global sea level by one centimetre - heightening the risk of flooding worldwide and disrupting marine ecosystems in the Arctic Ocean. Raising sea levels can also alter patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation that affect weather conditions across the globe. One third of this rise was produced in just two summers - 2012 and 2019 - when extreme weather led to record-breaking levels of ice melting not seen in the past 40 years. The study shows that during the past decade, runoff from Greenland has averaged 357 billion tonnes of ice melt per year   equating to almost 1 millimetre of global sea level rise - reaching a maximum of 527 billion tonnes in 2012, when changes in atmospheric patterns caused unusually warm air to sit over much the ice sheet. These changes are related to extreme weather events such as heatwaves, which have become more frequent and are now a major cause of ice loss from Greenland. Lead author Dr Thomas Slater (University of Leeds) said:  As we ve seen with other parts of the world, Greenland is also vulnerable to an increase in extreme weather events. As our climate warms, it s reasonable to expect that the instances of extreme melting in Greenland will happen more often   observations such as these are an important step in helping us to improve climate models and better predict what will happen this century.   There are, however, reasons to be optimistic. We know that setting and meeting meaningful targets to cut emissions could reduce ice losses from Greenland by a factor of three, and there is still time to achieve this.  The study observations can also be used to verify how climate models simulate ice sheet melting, allowing improved predictions of how much Greenland will raise the global sea level in future as extreme weather events become more common. Study co-author Dr Amber Leeson (Lancaster University) said:  Model estimates suggest that the Greenland ice sheet will contribute between about 3 - 23cm to global sea level rise by 2100. This prediction has a wide range, in part because of uncertainties associated with simulating complex ice melt processes, including those associated with extreme weather.  These new spaceborne estimates of runoff will help us to understand these complex ice melt processes better, improve our ability to model them, and thus enable us to refine our estimates of future sea level rise.

In this new study, scientists revealed that a parasite found commonly across the globe, is able to sensitise cold tumours - tumours that are not likely to trigger a strong immune response by the body   to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.Scientists leading the study believe that this finding could have broader therapeutic implications for many types of cancers.The team managed to  tame  the parasite Toxoplasma gondii - a single-celled opportunistic protozoan capable of infecting a broad range of warm-blooded animals and has been reported in nearly one-third of the world s human population.Toxoplasma gondii must live inside the cells of its host and secretes many proteins to counter the host s immune defences and to facilitate their own invasion and colonisation of the host cells. The researchers first built a Toxoplasma gondii mutant strain with a limited ability to grow, in cultured cells or to cause disease in mice, but at the same time is able to manipulate the host immune system.The researchers have shown that direct injection with this mutant parasite in solid tumours, induces inflammatory responses in the injected tumours and even in tumours located in a distant location in the mouse body. They have also shown that this treatment approach has made tumours more responsive to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor.This dual treatment significantly extended the survival of mice and reduced tumour growth in mouse models of melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma.Dr Hany Elsheikha, Associate Professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science at the University of Nottingham, and one of the lead authors of the study, said:  The use of a mutant version of Toxoplasma gondii in the treatment of certain tumours in mice models has been previously reported. What makes this study different is the confirmation that intratumoral injection with mutant Toxoplasma gondii strain boosts antitumor immunity and the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibition therapy. These are significant findings and are relevant to future tumour therapy. The marked reduction in tumour size and the significant improvement in the survival of mice that received this novel combinational therapy is promising but should be interpreted with caution as further research is needed.

The formed structures can then be used as templates for growing polymers in ways that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. Researchers from the University of Tsukuba have already shown that helical liquid crystals can be used to grow conducting polymers. Now, they have extended their method to include fd phage liquid crystal platforms. Their findings are published in Journal of Polymer Science.Virus particles that are non-harmful provide excellent ready-made building materials. For example, they can be used as scaffolds or containers for cargo. Fd phages whose function is to infect bacteria are linear viruses that look like cooked spaghetti. However, they can also act as liquid crystals and organize themselves into helical structures. Helices are interesting because they have a property known as ""handedness"" they turn either clockwise or anticlockwise. Using helical structures as a platform for growing polymers is an excellent way of introducing a helical arrangement into the final polymer material. Although this has been done using standard liquid crystals, this is the first report of using viruses as helical templates for polymerization. The researchers grew polypyrrole a conducting polymer on the fd phage template using a double-step chemical-electrochemical polymerization process and they examined the structure and magnetic properties of the product. ""The polypyrrole formed a network of small branch-like fibers, similar to the neural network in the brain,"" explains study main author Professor Hiromasa Goto. ""We found that the polymer networks had helical antiferromagnetic behavior, which we believe is because the polymer formed a helical structure at the molecular level as a result of adopting the organization of the virus liquid crystal."" In polypyrrole, the charge is carried by 'polarons', which are pairs of radicals and cations. Because the polarons in the main chain of the polymer take on the helical structure dictated by the virus template, their interaction leads to antiferromagnetic-like behavior. The combination of virus particles and conducting polymers has led to reports of numerous very interesting systems including virus/polymer nanowires for biosensors, conducting polymer-based COVID-19 detectors, and chemically modified viruses. There are therefore numerous potential applications for systems based on helical conjugates. ""Combing the useful properties of fd phages such as their ability to recognize and infect specific bacteria with conducting polymers that have magnetic properties opens many doors,"" says Professor Goto.

Now, researchers from Japan have identified a single protein that helps balance both sugar and fat levels in the liver and could be a promising drug target for treating symptoms associated with obesity.In a study published this month in Nature Communications, researchers led by a team from the University of Tsukuba have revealed that C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) is a global regulator of metabolism that is crucial for balancing sugar and fat metabolism in the liver. Metabolism is the process by which our bodies break down nutrients into smaller parts that can be used by individual cells to carry out their normal activities. The metabolism of different food components has to be balanced carefully to make sure that everything is maintained at optimal levels and keeps running smoothly; and this balance is maintained by a host of regulatory proteins. ""CtBP2 is a regulatory protein that senses changes in the relative levels of certain metabolites and responds by altering the expression of other proteins,"" explains lead author of the study Professor Motohiro Sekiya. ""Our preliminary findings showed that CtBP2 may be specifically involved in glucose metabolism in the liver, so we wanted to investigate this possibility in more detail."" To do this, the researchers explored the genes, proteins, and metabolites that CtBP2 interacts with. ""The results were somewhat surprising,"" states Professor Sekiya, ""as we found that CtBP2 interacted with multiple proteins to regulate the expression of genes related not only to glucose metabolism, but also to lipid metabolism and inflammation, all of which are involved metabolic disease."" In fact, the researchers found that CtBP2 levels are low in obese mice, as well as in liver samples from deceased obese individuals, which could explain the imbalances in sugar and fat metabolism seen with obesity. Conversely, giving obese mice extra CtBP2 improved their health by promoting a healthier metabolite balance, further demonstrating the pivotal role of this protein in maintaining optimum metabolism. ""Our findings suggest that CtBP2 is a master integrator of metabolic signals in the liver that is crucial for controlling glucose and lipid balance,"" says Professor Sekiya. The team showed that a site on CtBP2 called the Rossmann fold was crucial for the protein to carry out these activities, so designing drugs to target this active site could be a new avenue toward treating people with metabolic disorders. Given that current treatments for diabetes address sugar metabolism at the expense of fat metabolism, possibly damaging liver health, a single drug that could target both of these functions could also be an important step forward for diabetics.ReferenceSekiya M, Kainoh K, Sugasawa T, et al.

Pathologists evaluate and label thousands of histopathology images on a regular basis to tell whether someone has cancer. But their average workload has increased significantly and can sometimes cause unintended misdiagnoses due to fatigue.  Even though a lot of their work is repetitive, most pathologists are extremely busy because there s a huge demand for what they do but there s a global shortage of qualified pathologists, especially in many developing countries  said Dr. Hong-Wen Deng, professor and director of the Tulane Center of Biomedical Informatics and Genomics at Tulane University School of Medicine.  This study is revolutionary because we successfully leveraged artificial intelligence to identify and diagnose colorectal cancer in a cost-effective way, which could ultimately reduce the workload of pathologists. To conduct the study, Deng and his team collected over 13,000 images of colorectal cancer from 8,803 subjects and 13 independent cancer centers in China, Germany and the United States. Using the images, which were randomly selected by technicians, they built a machine assisted pathological recognition program that allows a computer to recognize images that show colorectal cancer, one of the most common causes of cancer related deaths in Europe and America. The challenges of this study stemmed from complex large image sizes, complex shapes, textures, and histological changes in nuclear staining,  Deng said.  But ultimately the study revealed that when we used AI to diagnose colorectal cancer, the performance is shown comparable to and even better in many cases than real pathologists. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve or AUC is the performance measurement tool that Deng and his team used to determine the success of the study. After comparing the computer s results with the work of highly experienced pathologists who interpreted data manually, the study found that the average pathologist scored at .969 for accurately identifying colorectal cancer manually. The average score for the machine-assisted AI computer program was .98, which is comparable if not more accurate.Using artificial intelligence to identify cancer is an emerging technology and hasn t yet been widely accepted. Deng s hope is that the study will lead to more pathologists using prescreening technology in the future to make quicker diagnoses.  It s still in the research phase and we haven t commercialized it yet because we need to make it more user friendly and test and implement in more clinical settings. But as we develop it further, hopefully it can also be used for different types of cancer in the future. Using AI to diagnose cancer can expedite the whole process and will save a lot of time for both patients and clinicians. Reference: Yu G, Sun K, Xu C, et al.

By understanding what determines the navigational mechanism and the biophysical and biochemical cues for a sperm to get to the egg, we may be able to use those cues to treat couples with infertility issues and select the best strategy for in vitro fertilization,  said Alireza Abbaspourrad, the paper s senior author and the Youngkeun Joh Assistant Professor of Food Chemistry and Ingredient Technology in the Department of Food Science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.The study,  Mammalian Sperm Hyperactivation Regulates Navigation Via Physical Boundaries and promotes Pseudo-Chemotaxis,  was published online Oct. 29 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The paper clarifies how millions of sperm travel through the female mammal s reproductive tract, with only a handful eventually reaching the fertilization site. The sperm stay close to the side walls and swim in a straight line against a small amount of fluid that flows from the upper to lower part of the reproductive tract. But once sperm reach the uterine junctional zone, enter the fallopian tubes and move towards the egg, an influx of calcium ions into their flagellum triggers hyperactivation and circular swimming. More study is needed to understand exactly what triggers the calcium influx in the flagellum.The microfluidic chips allowed the researchers to manipulate the environment. The team recorded the sperm swimming alongside the chamber s walls. They then tested compounds, including caffeine, which increase calcium ions in a cell s cytoplasm. They recorded the sperm s behavioral switch in the presence of calcium from symmetrical, direct swimming to hyperactivated circular swimming that meant the sperm no longer hugged close to the walls. Without this shift, sperm could run into dead ends where they get stuck. It s been shown that this [swimming] state is required for fertilization,  Abbaspourrad said. Though the observations occurred in a lab in vitro, it provides a sense of what might be happening in vivo, he said.""We think that hyperactivation modulates sperm's swimming behavior as it ascends towards the fertilization site, depending on the functional region within the tract, and as sperm responds to the biochemical factors present in the environment,"" said Meisam Zaferani, the paper s first author and a graduate student in Abbaspourrad s lab.Reference: Zaferani M, Suarez SS, Abbaspourrad A.

This approach maintains the clinical sensitivity associated with the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests   the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19   and gives labs the ability to process the tests far more quickly. The FDA authorizes Yale-designated laboratories to use the SalivaDirect test to pool as many as five samples at a time for SARS-CoV-2 testing. As vaccination programs gain ground and help us protect against severe COVID-19 cases, we must remain cautious. Adopting frequent testing as a new public health habit will help keep us safe from infection and keep our schools, workplaces, and businesses open,  said Anne Wyllie, principal investigator of SalivaDirect and research scientist at the Yale School of Public Health.  Sample pooling with SalivaDirect provides labs with an additional tool they can use to minimize testing materials, increase throughput, and report faster results. SalivaDirect is one of only three saliva-based PCR tests to receive  emergency use authorization  (EUA) in the United States for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pooled samples. If a pool tests negative, all individuals in the pool are classified as negative for SARS-CoV-2, and no additional testing is needed. If a pool tests positive, the lab conducts additional testing to identify the positive individual(s) in the respective pool. Keeping our community of university students, staff, and faculty healthy and on campus depends on our lab s ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections. This enables individuals with positive results to self-isolate, seek care, and prevent further viral spread. SalivaDirect has been a mainstay for COVID-19 testing because it is economical, user-friendly, accurate, and has rapid turn-around times,  said Suzanne Sandmeyer, professor of biological chemistry and director of both the Campus COVID-19 Testing Laboratory and the Genomics High-Throughput Facility at the University of California, Irvine.  This FDA clearance to pool samples will further enhance our lab s flexibility to rapidly scale testing, helping us respond quickly to infection rate changes due to new virus variants or post-holiday surges as people return to campus from outside our community bubble. SalivaDirect is an open-source RT-qPCR test designed to be streamlined, sensitive, and low-cost. Testing saliva with readily available reagents and equipment from multiple suppliers also eliminates the need for nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs, which have been prone to supply chain shortages. The ease of saliva-based testing lends itself to self-collection for all ages   keeping test site staff safer and reaching patient populations that may be less likely to comply with nasal swabs due to the associated discomfort.SalivaDirect has been deployed to 142 lab sites in 39 states and over 2 million tests have been administered to date in the United States. The protocol was created at the Yale School of Public Health as an alternative to other testing methods for COVID-19 and it received an emergency use authorization from the FDA in August 2020.SalivaDirect can be used for routine screenings of individuals without COVID-19 symptoms or for those suspected of having COVID-19. Samples can be collected in the presence of a trained observer or, for individuals 18 years old and older, in the comfort of one s own home without supervision using the SalivaDirect Unsupervised Collection Kit or SalivaDirect At-Home Collection Kit.

The  Hippo  signalling pathway in animals is one of these and controls organ size via the regulation of cell division, proliferation and death (apoptosis). It takes its name from one of its main components, the Hpo or  hippo  kinase. A kinase is a type of protein that adds or removes phosphate groups to other molecules, a process known as phosphorylation. Phosphorylation works as a sort of biological on/off switch and plays a critical role in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell cycle, growth, and apoptosis.As many cancers are the product of uncontrolled cell division, researchers have increasingly focused a lot of attention on the hippo pathway, which when malfunctioning results in irregular activity of a pair of its downstream targets, the Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ). YAP/TAZ act to regulate the transcription of genes (copying their information from DNA form to RNA form) that are involved in cell proliferation. When the Hippo signalling pathway is active, YAP is inhibited, thus playing a role in control of tumor suppression. On the other hand, when Hippo signaling is inactive, YAP becomes persistently active and promotes cell proliferation.But the precise mechanisms of YAP/TAZ activation remains poorly understood. It is known that the gene that encodes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a protein that helps cells grow, is often over-activated, especially in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and EGFR is often mutated and activated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC).As a result, EGFR is a common target of anti-cancer therapies, either using kinase inhibitor drugs, or blocking antibodies. Yet here too, whether EGFR controls YAP/TAZ activation has been an open question. EGFR fails to reduce phosphorylation of YAP in some cellular systems, but inhibits the Hippo pathway to activate YAP in others,  said Toshinori Ando, a main researcher working on the study and Assistant Professor at the Center of Oral Clinical Examination at Hiroshima University Hospital (with a cross-appointment as a post-doctoral scientist in the University of California, San Diego).  If EGFR is being targeted by therapeutics, we really should know a bit more about why we re doing this. So the researchers carried out a series of investigations of Hippo pathway mechanisms, including via comparisons of EGFR gene activation (expression) and activation of YAP in a series of HNSCC cancer cells; cells that showed the most expression of EGFR amongst HNSCC cells; an analysis of all cancer types; and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) a technique of identifying groups of genes that are over-represented within a large set and may be associated with certain diseases.They found that EGFR activation promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of one of the core Hippo pathway components, called MOB1. This is a gene that directs activation of particular kinases, LATS1 and LATS2, which modulate the function of the YAP/TAZ. The EGFR-promoted MOB1 tyrosine phosphorylation followed by LATS1/2 inactivation leads to aberrant YAP/TAZ activation in many cancers harboring EGFR alterations such as HNSCC and LUAC. Emerging evidence have shown that YAP is overexpressed and contributes to cancer growth, poor prognosis, and acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs in HNSCC and LUAC, although the mechanism of YAP re-activation is unclear,  added J. Silvio Gutkind, lead researcher of this project and Professor at the University of California, San Diego.This EGFR-MOB1-YAP/TAZ signaling axis may represent a novel target for cancer therapies. In addition, a combination of EGFR targeting therapy and YAP/TAZ targeting therapy could prevent cancer cells from acquiring resistance that might have occurred if just one or the other therapies were used on their own.A drug targeting YAP/TAZ has yet to be approved for the treatment of cancer patients. The researchers consider the development of such a drug to be an urgent priority as well as to clarify the unknown mechanism of YAP re-activation.Reference: Ando T, Arang N, Wang Z, et al.

Astrocytes are named for their star shape and are a type of glial cell, which are support cells for neurons in the brain. They play a crucial role in brain functions such as memory, learning, self-repair and synchronization.  ""This project stemmed from recent observations in computational neuroscience, as there has been a lot of effort and understanding of how the brain works and people are trying to revise the model of simplistic neuron-synapse connections,  said Abhronil Sengupta, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science. It turns out there is a third component in the brain, the astrocytes, which constitutes a significant section of the cells in the brain, but its role in machine learning and neuroscience has kind of been overlooked.  At the same time, the AI and machine learning fields are experiencing a boom. According to the analytics firm Burning Glass Technologies, demand for AI and machine learning skills is expected to increase by a compound growth rate of 71% by 2025. However, AI and machine learning faces a challenge as the use of these technologies increase   they use a lot of energy.  ""An often-underestimated issue of AI and machine learning is the amount of power consumption of these systems,  Sengupta said.  A few years back, for instance, IBM tried to simulate the brain activity of a cat, and in doing so ended up consuming around a few megawatts of power. And if we were to just extend this number to simulate brain activity of a human being on the best possible supercomputer we have today, the power consumption would be even higher than megawatts.  All this power usage is due to the complex dance of switches, semiconductors and other mechanical and electrical processes that happens in computer processing, which greatly increases when the processes are as complex as what AI and machine learning demand. A potential solution is neuromorphic computing, which is computing that mimics brain functions. Neuromorphic computing is of interest to researchers because the human brain has evolved to use much less energy for its processes than do a computer, so mimicking those functions would make AI and machine learning a more energy-efficient process.  Another brain function that holds potential for neuromorphic computing is how the brain can self-repair damaged neurons and synapses. Astrocytes play a very crucial role in self-repairing the brain, Sengupta said.  When we try to come up with these new device structures, we try to form a prototype artificial neuromorphic hardware, these are characterized by a lot of hardware-level faults. So perhaps we can draw insights from computational neuroscience based on how astrocyte glial cells are causing self-repair in the brain and use those concepts to possibly cause self-repair of neuromorphic hardware to repair these faults.  Sengupta s lab primarily works with spintronic devices, a form of electronics that process information via spinning electrons. The researchers examine the devices  magnetic structures and how to make them neuromorphic by mimicking various neural synaptic functions of the brain in the intrinsic physics of the devices. This research was part of a study published in January in Frontiers in Neuroscience. That research, in turn, resulted in the study recently published in the same journal.   When we started working on the aspects of self-repair in the previous study, we realized that astrocytes also contribute to temporal information binding,  Sengupta said.  Temporal information binding is how the brain can make sense of relations between separate events happening at separate times, and making sense of these events as a sequence, which is an important function of AI and machine learning.  ""It turns out that the magnetic structures we were working with in the prior study can be synchronized together through various coupling mechanisms, and we wanted to explore how you can have these synchronized magnetic devices mimic astrocyte-induced phase coupling, going beyond prior work on solely neuro-synaptic devices,  Sengupta said. We want the intrinsic physics of the devices to mimic the astrocyte phase coupling that you have in the brain.  To better understand how this might be achieved, the researchers developed neuroscience models, including those of astrocytes, to understand what aspects of astrocyte functions would be most relevant for their research. They also developed theoretical modeling of the potential spintronic devices.  ""We needed to understand the device physics and that involved a lot of theoretical modeling of the devices, and then we looked into how we could develop an end-to-end, cross-disciplinary modeling framework including everything from neuroscience models to algorithms to device physics,  Sengupta said.Creating such energy-efficient and fault-resilient astromorphic computing could open the door for more sophisticated AI and machine learning work to be done on power-constrained devices such as smartphones.   AI and machine learning is revolutionizing the world around us every day, you see it from your smartphones recognizing pictures of your friends and family, to machine learning s huge impact on medical diagnosis for different kinds of diseases,  Sengupta said.  At the same time, studying astrocytes for the type of self-repair and synchronization functionalities they can enable in neuromorphic computing is really in its infancy. There's a lot of potential opportunities with these kinds of components. Reference: Rastogi M, Lu S, Islam N, Sengupta A.On the Self-Repair Role of Astrocytes in STDP Enabled Unsupervised SNNs.

The current use of traditional AD can sometimes overlap with other sound elements in the soundtrack, such as music and sound effects. Under the new format, verbal descriptions are minimised and sound design is used as the main vehicle for accessibility, through a combination of additional sound effects, 3D sound, and first-person narration.Back in 2016, York researchers Dr. Mariana Lopez and Dr. Gavin Kearney conducted a survey which found that 34% of visually impaired people surveyed had not attended the cinema in the last previous 12 months, compared to only 5.5% of sighted people surveyed, with issues of accessibility discouraging visually impaired people from attending.The new methods result in a more  organic  form of accessibility which will help bring about a more inclusive cinematic experience.The University of York project, which was funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, sought to provide an alternative soundtrack that minimised the number of verbal descriptions and, as a result, avoid them masking crucial elements in the original soundtrack. The project favoured the creation of accessible experiences through sound design strategies by focusing on three main techniques.  The first method is the addition of sound effects to provide information on actions, elicit the presence of establishing shots, convey abstract scenes as well as indicate the presence of characters, time and place. The second method is the use of 3D sound over headphones to allow the conveyance of the position of characters and objects portrayed on the screen. Finally, the use of first-person narration to portray aspects of the story that cannot be conveyed through sound effects, such as feelings, gestures, colours as well as certain actions.The effectiveness of these new techniques was explored through a case study, the short film Pearl, which was conducted in collaboration with students of the University. The film focuses on a young girl called Margaret, who has the ability to produce pearls. The cinematography works on darkness and shadows and the production design looks to generate ambiguity by blending Victorian Gothic horror elements with contemporary ones. The film was chosen as a case study due to the research team s initial involvement as advisors to the production as well as its unusual storyline. The study team consulted widely and held a series of focus groups with visually impaired and sighted audiences to demonstrate the potential of these techniques to foster inclusive cinematic experiences.Dr Mariana Lopez, Senior Lecturer in Sound Production and Post Production in the Department of Theatre, Film, Television and Interactive Media, said:  We have sought to create a new paradigm for accessibility to film and television by shifting the focus from verbal descriptions to the power of creative sound design and the importance of incorporating accessibility to the creative filmmaking workflows.  By designing such works, sound can be a vehicle for social inclusion by making cinematic experiences shared accessible experiences. Reference: Lopez M, Kearney G, Hofstadter K.

The findings come from a human study conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston among 12 patients undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy   a procedure that places hundreds of tiny electrodes throughout the brain to record its activity and identify where seizures originate. In this study, Widge collaborated with Massachusetts General Hospital s Sydney Cash, MD, PhD, an expert in epilepsy research; and Darin Dougherty, MD, an expert in clinical brain stimulation. Together, they identified a brain region   the internal capsule   that improved patients  mental function when stimulated with small amounts of electrical energy. That part of the brain is responsible for cognitive control   the process of shifting from one thought pattern or behavior to another, which is impaired in most mental illnesses. An example might include a person with depression who just can't get out of a  stuck  negative thought. Because it is so central to mental illness, finding a way to improve it could be a powerful new way to treat those illnesses,  Widge said. The team developed algorithms, so that after stimulation, they could track patients  cognitive control abilities, both from their actions and directly from their brain activity. The controller method provided boosts of stimulation whenever the patients were doing worse on a laboratory test of cognitive control. This system can read brain activity,  decode  from that when a patient is having difficulty, and apply a small burst of electrical stimulation to the brain to boost them past that difficulty,  Widge said.  The analogy I often use is an electric bike. When someone's pedaling but having difficulty, the bike senses it and augments it. We've made the equivalent of that for human mental function. The study is the first to show that: A specific human mental function linked to mental illness can be reliably enhanced using precisely targeted electrical stimulation;  There are specific sub-parts of the internal capsule brain structure that are particularly effective for cognitive enhancement; and  A closed-loop algorithm used as a controller was twice as effective than stimulating at random times. Some of the patients had significant anxiety in addition to their epilepsy. When given the cognitive-enhancing stimulation, they reported that their anxiety got better, because they were more able to shift their thoughts away from their distress and focus on what they wanted. Widge says that this suggests this method could be used to treat patients with severe and medication-resistant anxiety, depression or other disorders.""This could be a totally new approach in treating mental illness. Instead of trying to suppress symptoms, we could give patients a tool that lets them take control of their own minds,  Widge said.  We could put them back in the driver's seat and let them feel a new sense of agency.""The research team is now preparing for clinical trials. Because the target for improving cognitive control is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for deep brain stimulation, Widge says this research can be done with existing tools and devices   once a trial is formally approved   and the translation of this care to current medical practice could be rapid. The wonderful thing about these findings is that we are now in a position to conduct clinical trials to further demonstrate effectiveness and then hopefully move to helping treatment-resistant patients who are in desperate need for additional interventions to treat their illnesses,  Dougherty said.Reference: Basu I, Yousefi A, Crocker B, et al.

The study, published in PNAS, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show that the rocks were uninhabitable for much of their lifetimes with the longest period of habitability not extending much past 1 billion years, and usually much shorter. Understanding the history of the deep biosphere can provide insight into the evolution of life on Earth.The deep biosphere is estimated to host the majority of microbial life on Earth, and about 10-20% of all terrestrial biomass. The ecosystems of this vast subterranean biosphere span from habitats deep beneath the ocean floor to fractured continental rocks beneath our feet. These ecosystems host microbial lineages that are of interest for understanding the origin and evolution of life on our planet but remain the least explored and understood ecosystems on Earth. Understanding the history of these microbial communities requires assessing the complex, and yet unexplored, evolution of habitable conditions. In a new study, Henrik Drake, Associate Professor of the Linnaeus University, Sweden, teamed up with Professor Peter Reiners of University of Arizona to present the first thermochronological perspective on the habitability of some of Earth s oldest rocks through time. The study suggests that the longest record of continuous habitability to the present does not stretch much beyond 1 billion years. Henrik Drake, explains the discoveries:  In this study we wanted to combine the record of signatures of deep ancient life found within Precambrian craton fracture systems with the recent advances in intermediate- and low-temperature thermochronology. The cratonic rocks formed billions of years ago, deep in the crust, at temperatures too high for any life. It was only much later, following erosion, that the currently exposed rocks reached levels in the crust where temperatures were habitable.  Assessing when these rock environments became habitable, and when they may have been buried and sterilized again, gives insights into the evolutionary aspect of the deep biosphere. This is important because the microbes at depth employ the same metabolisms anticipated for the very earliest metabolisms on Earth. There are also recent reports of intriguingly long residence times of deep fluids in some of Earth s cratons that further suggest that importance of understanding when these systems have sustained active ecosystems. Peter Reiners explains how thermochronology helps to understand habitability:  By combining thermochronologic results from several different radioisotopic dating systems, we can reconstruct their thermal histories through the ups and downs of burial and erosion over time. This approach gives us context for prospecting and interpreting the little-explored geologic record of the deep biosphere of Earth s cratons.  The researchers could successfully correlate their fossil records of deep ancient life in Scandinavian cratonic rocks, with habitable periods from the thermochronology framework. Henrik Drake, sums up the findings:  This made us confident that we could do the other way around as well - to use thermochronology to point to candidate areas for the oldest records of rock-hosted subsurface microorganisms on Earth. Eastern Finland, Greenland and maybe parts of the Canadian shield look particularly interesting with habitable conditions spanning back a billion year or even more. These are obvious targets for further studies of deep microbial evolution. ReferenceDrake H, Reiners PW. Thermochronologic perspectives on the deep-time evolution of the deep biosphere.

However, certain soybean varieties may be better at tolerating an extended period of dry weather than others. Researchers with the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture recently published a journal article highlighting which soybeans are better to plant in water-limited areas.Over the course of four growing seasons, researchers tested seventeen Mid-South soybean varieties at the West Tennessee AgResearch and Education Center in Jackson. The soybean varieties were tested under irrigated, rainfed and simulated drought conditions.  The information gained over time from this research project will help both soybean breeders and producers improve soybean variety selection to manage unpredictable drought conditions during the growing season,  said Avat Shekoofa, crop physiologist at the UTIA Department of Plant Sciences. The team collected soybean water loss, wilting scores, leaf maintenance and yield data through six different controlled and field experiments. One of their key findings showed a correlation to water needs in young plants versus mature plants: if a soybean used lots of water during vegetative growth, less water would be available in the soil to support reproductive growth and pod filling when the drought stress occurs. The researchers also found a wide variation in water loss among soybean varieties. Two of the soybean genotypes did better under the harsh conditions than the rest:  Ellis  and  USG Allen.  Under drought conditions, Ellis and USG Allen yielded 22% to 24% more than fast-wilting varieties .  Overall, the less the soybean wilts, the better candidate it is for use in water-limited areas,  said Shekoofa,  Soybean varieties expressing slow wilting managed drought stress conditions later in the season well.  The next step in this research is expanding to include a wider range of soybean maturity groups, as well as those that produce oils that are higher in monosaturated fats, known in the industry as high oleic soybean varieties. Soybean genotypes that show slow-wilting traits are being incorporated into breeding efforts to develop and improve drought-tolerant soybean varieties.

Circular Economy Infrastructure: why we need track and trace for reusable packaging  is published in the journal of Sustainable Production and Consumption. The research findings are based on interviews with manufacturing brands, retailers, regulatory bodies, NGOs and reuse experts from industries, including food and beverage, cosmetics, and household products, to determine businesses  reasons for not investing in reusable packaging. The research team also asked how digitalisation might help overcome these challenges. The interviews were used to create the world s first  Open Data Standard  for reusable packaging   an agreed vocabulary for data collection that helps organisations work together as a container moves between the manufacturer, transport provider, retailer, customer, and cleaning provider. Lead author Dr Katherine Ellsworth-Krebs, of Lancaster University s ImaginationLancaster laboratory, says:  Discussing what data is needed for reuse revealed how digitalisation supports collaboration, identifying points of miscommunication between key actors along the value chain.   Collaboration is essential for the circular economy because one company cannot close the loop alone, it requires the whole ecosystem to work together.  Four big business concerns identified: The study says digital trackers, unique barcodes, can address these hurdles. Being able to track an individual container enables businesses to calculate packaging lifespans and return rates from customers. Both are crucial to determining affordability. The unique barcode on a container is needed for recalling batches and evidencing cleaning between refills and return to the shop floor. These  digital passports  also enable businesses to tell packaging stories in an appealing way, as they are able to verify and quantify their reuse activities for marketing purposes. A reusable container may require many uses for its environmental footprint to compare favourably with single-use alternatives, and so accurate accounting for refills is core to useful life cycle assessments. Currently organisations pay environmental taxes when packaging is released onto the market, but with digital trackers, it would be possible, to exempt organisations from paying every time their packaging is re-filled. In this way, track and trace allows governments to create taxation that incentivises reuse.  Being able to tag and track packaging through digital passports has long been hailed as a cornerstone of resource efficiency because it allows for monitoring of reuse,  adds Dr Ellsworth-Krebs.  There are currently no government targets for reuse of packaging in the UK or EU due to this monitoring challenge.   Advances in digital technologies open up new possibilities for a cooperative circular economy, including stopping packaging becoming waste soon after it leaves the shop floor.

Knowledge of this new cell type will likely lead to greater insight on how to reverse autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma, and shed light on the nature of inflammatory disease in general, the researchers said. The results reinforce the idea that what you re exposed to initially may have lasting ramifications,  said Michael Rosenblum, MD, PhD, principal investigator on the study.  It appears that early exposure to inflammation can, through these cells we discovered, imprint an ability for tissues to develop inflammatory disease later in life. The team learned about the new type of cell while investigating the effects of a set of actions known to evoke immune response in mice. One of these actions involved knocking out a group of skin cells that suppress the immune system. In the absence of that regulation, Rosenblum said, the researchers saw the presence of a unique cell that seemed to be acting as a shelter for pathogenic immune cells that aren t usually seen in skin tissues. We had to knock out one cell population to see that they were controlling the growth and capacity of these other, unknown cells,  he said, noting that the new cells became apparent only in the tissue that had been exposed to inflammatory triggers.  What normally would be a deserted island on the skin was now inhabited by all these strangers,  he said.The team dubbed the strangers  TIFFs  (Th2-interacting fascial fibroblasts) after the Th2 immune cells that they help to house. The location of TIFFs in the skin suggests that they belong to a group of cells that make up fascia, the fibrous connective tissue that surrounds and connects organs throughout the body, said lead author Ian Boothby, a graduate student in Rosenblum s lab. Because most organs have fascia of some sort, what we re learning about TIFFs in skin may well be widely applicable to the rest of the body, meaning that these cells may play a role in a huge number of inflammatory diseases,  he said. Home for Immune Cells  Opens Its DoorsBoothby and Rosenblum saw that when the skin lacking regulatory cells is subjected to inflammatory triggers, the population of TIFFs expands like wildfire, and the TIFFs become a sort of holding pen for the Th2 immune cells. Later in life, when even a small insult to the skin presents itself again, Rosenblum said, the TIFFs open their floodgates, letting the Th2 cells out. All you need to do is push the immune system just a little bit, with a wound or with stress, to unleash all the pathogenic cells living in these TIFFs and create an exaggerated inflammatory response,  he said.That exaggerated response, the researchers hypothesize, may manifest as the creation of fibroses in the fascia, the driving force behind inflammatory skin diseases such as scleroderma, which affects about 50,000 Americans.The team s next move was to confirm the presence of TIFFs in human skin. They obtained samples from volunteers with eosinophilic fasciitis (EF), a rare inflammatory disorder in which white blood cells called eosinophils build up in the skin fascia, the fibrous tissue which lies between the skin and the muscles below it.When they compared the EF samples to those of healthy skin, the researchers found TIFFs in both types of skin sample, but the two looked completely different. In healthy skin, the fascia forms a thin, spidery network between fat cells, while in the EF skin sample, the cells had expanded to form thick bands of fibrous tissue.Solving the Mysteries Underlying InflammationIt turns out that TIFFs are present in every organ of the body, said Rosenblum. They re usually found in the fascia that surrounds our major organs and serve a role in maintaining structure. They re also prone to interacting with immune cells. He postulates that TIFFs might have evolved as a sort of emergency brigade in case of injury, able to jump-start repair in the case of internal injury. In patients with scleroderma or other fibrosing diseases like EF, that repair program may be kind of co-opted, resulting in this chronic wound-healing response,  said Rosenblum.  If we can understand the biology of these cells, we can come in with drugs that revert them back to what they re supposed to be doing. Taking that approach is vital to addressing the broad array of inflammatory diseases for which there are often no good treatments. There are lots of therapies that reduce inflammation, but we don t have good ways of restoring the affected organs to full health,  he said.  So, learning about how cells like these TIFFs interact with immune cells to drive inflammatory disease is critical to developing treatments that address its cause, rather than its symptoms.

Now imagine your lungs: myriad airways like branches, each with tiny alveoli like leaves. This alveolar structure is key to the absorption of oxygen and excretion of carbon dioxide that we call ""breath."" As we breathe, the volume of gases in the lungs is continually changing with varying degrees of inhalation and exhalation. These volumes are medically important for clinical assessment and diagnosis of respiratory pathologies.A light-based technology known as gas-in-scattering-media absorption spectroscopy (GASMAS) may allow noninvasive optical sensing of respiratory volumes. Using tuneable diode laser spectroscopy, GASMAS turns optical signals into information for measuring gas concentration. Reference models, known as ""phantoms,"" afford relevant features that help biomedical optics researchers to identify technical challenges and potential applications of GASMAS technology. As reported in the Journal of Biomedical Optics, scientists at Tyndall National Institute (TNI) in Ireland recently developed a lung phantom that mimics the optical properties and structure of the lung, including the tiny alveoli. The complexity of alveolar anatomy has meant that previous state-of-the-art lung phantoms have neglected it. The work done with this novel lung phantom demonstrates the feasibility of GASMAS to sense changes in gas volume in a controlled environment mimicking lung tissue. Previous work toward clinical use of GASMAS for respiratory healthcare has focused on neonates, because the thickness of protective organs surrounding their lungs is within the limits of penetration depth for near-infrared light. According to first author Andrea Pacheco, a PhD student in the Biophotonics@Tyndall Group, the extension of GASMAS technique beyond neonates will depend on advances in miniaturization and integration of pulmonary endoscopes with GASMAS probes. ""A further step in that direction could be to arrange two miniature GASMAS probes in an endoscope-like geometry and use our phantom to determine the signal quality and optimum source detector separation,"" she says. Pacheco and her coauthors show the basic principles involved in recreating lung tissue. Future researchers can vary the dimensions or density of the gas pockets simply by designing a new capillary holder and using capillaries with different inner radii.To mimic alveoli, the novel lung phantom developed by the TNI Biophotonics team features a system of capillaries that can be variably and progressively filled with liquid that matches the optical properties of lung tissue, allowing incrementally variable pockets of air that mimic air-filled alveolar sacs. Light transmission corresponds to the capillary content in a way that's analogous to lung inflation and deflation. This all takes place within a carefully controlled environment that mimics the humidity and temperature of the body, typically maintained at ~37 degrees Celsius. According to Pacheco, the challenges involved in creating a relatively complex model of the lung for clinical use required significant investments of time and energy: ""The clinical translation of existent technologies is tremendously challenging! The work related to this article started two years ago."" The most difficult part of the work was the need to mimic body temperature and relative humidity in a controlled manner. Pacheco says, ""It was frustrating simply trying to maintain a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius inside a bottle half-filled with water. No matter what I tried, I did not manage to do two consecutive GASMAS measurements with the same (or at least similar) parameters. And if this was just a bottle, how was I supposed to move from there to recreate lung tissue?"" Pacheco brought the problem to a meeting with the Biophotonics team at TNI, including Brian C. Wilson of University of Toronto, who was visiting the institute at the time. ""After brainstorming, the path to making a lung-tissue phantom seemed to be feasible. The unique skills of each of the co-authors combined with our hard work to pay off,"" says Pacheco.ReferencePacheco A, Grygoryev K, Messina W, Andersson-Engels S.

This study is a huge step forward in our understanding of how this powerful tool could be used in the clinic routinely to benefit patients with advanced breast cancer. Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, working in the Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre and the Centre for Molecular Pathology, analysed tumour DNA from blood tests from 800 women with advanced breast cancer who enrolled in the plasmaMATCH trial. They looked for targetable defects in genes such as HER2, PIK3CA and BRAF, which are linked to breast cancer.One of the benefits of liquid biopsies is that they provide a fuller picture of the genetics of a tumour than conventional, solid tissue biopsies, as they can sample all of a patient s cancer sites instead of just one small section of a tumour.By analysing tumour DNA using liquid biopsies, researchers identified which patients were most likely to have genetic changes in their tumours that could be targeted or could indicate how likely they were to respond to treatment. They also identified a number of new potential therapeutic approaches for advanced breast cancer.This report from the plasmaMATCH trial, coordinated by the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR-CTSU), was published in Nature Communications and funded by Breast Cancer Now and Cancer Research UK through the Stand Up to Cancer campaign. Firstly, researchers looked at HER2-positive cancers and found HER2 mutations more commonly in those cancers treated with increasing lines of HER2-targeted therapy   suggesting HER2 mutations evolve through prior treatment and drive resistance. This leads researchers to believe that drugs that target HER2 mutations could be important for treating these patients.HER2-positive breast cancers produce too much of the growth-promoting protein HER2 and are more likely to come back after treatment than some other types of breast cancer. Around 6,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with this type of cancer in the UK every year. Scientists also looked at patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Those with mutations in both ESR1 and MAPK were identified as a  high-risk  group more likely to develop resistance. Average overall survival was 7.9 months for this group of patients, compared with 18.5 months for patients without the mutations.They found that among patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer whose tumours had PIK3CA mutations, almost a quarter of patients (47 out of 202) had more than one PIK3CA mutation.Those with multiple PIK3CA mutations who were treated with fulvestrant saw their disease worsen eight months sooner than patients with a single or no PIK3CA mutation   suggesting an alternative treatment should be considered for these women with multiple PIK3CA gene faults.In patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, researchers also identified new BRAF mutations linked to advanced disease   including some BRAF mutations already linked to lung cancer.Additionally, a small subset of advanced breast cancers (1.1 per cent) had  microsatellite instability    a condition that makes cells less capable of correcting mistakes that occur when DNA is copied. Scientists think this group of women could benefit from treatment with immunotherapy antibodies.These differences in cancer s genetic makeup mean individual cancers behave differently, so having valuable information about who is likely to develop resistance, and what should be the next treatment to try, would allow clinicians to personalise treatment instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach. Study leader Professor Nick Turner, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the ICR and Head of the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research at The Royal Marsden, said: Our latest plasmaMATCH results identify which genetic alterations are common and most likely to drive breast cancer in different groups of patients, while also shedding light on the processes influencing the development of resistance to treatments. We have identified the mutations that breast cancer can acquired to evolve through treatment, helping to advance our understanding of how cancers become resistant to treatment. This will allow us in the future to come up with new strategies to tackle resistance, aiming to improve outcomes for women living with advanced breast cancer. Liquid biopsies can be a better option than conventional tissue biopsies due to their ability to potentially sample all of a patient s cancer rather than just one disease site. Eventually, they will be used widely in the clinic as a tool to help guide treatment decision making and gain the best possible outcomes for patients. Reference: Kingston B, Cutts RJ, Bye H, et al.

Publishing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, a research team led by Ning Tian, PhD, identifies a previously unknown type of interneuron in the mammalian retina.The discovery marks a notable development for the field as scientists work toward a better understanding of the central nervous system by identifying all classes of neurons and their connections.""Based on its morphology, physiology, and genetic properties, this cell doesn't fit into the five classes of retinal neurons first identified more than 100 years ago,"" said Tian.

Campana cells relay visual signals from both types of light-sensing rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina, but their precise purpose is the subject of ongoing research. Experiments showed Campana cells remain activated for an unusually long time -- as long as 30 seconds -- in response to a 10 millisecond light flash stimulation.""In the brain, persistent firing cells are believed to be involved in memory and learning,"" said Tian.

With this new test, more doctors may one day be able to identify children with the most aggressive forms of medulloblastoma and better tailor treatment,  says the study s senior author, Dr. Poul Sorensen, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at UBC s faculty of medicine, distinguished scientist at BC Cancer, and associate member at BCCHR.According to the researchers, right now only sophisticated and expensive tests conducted in a handful of labs around the world can identify children with the most aggressive forms of the disease, which forms in the cerebellum, the posterior part of the brain.Given current testing limitations, all children with medulloblastoma receive the same type of treatment, meaning children with less-aggressive forms are unnecessarily exposed to toxic side effects of brain radio- and chemotherapies, often leading to permanent learning, physical and emotional disabilities. Meanwhile, children with the most aggressive forms of the disease may not receive treatments sufficient to cure the disease.The new test developed in Dr. Poul Sorensen s laboratory at the BC Cancer Research Institute relies on an antibody-based technique called immunohistochemistry, which is widely available in clinical laboratories around the world. By using a technique that is available in virtually all clinical labs, our new test has the potential to improve the diagnosis and future treatment of medulloblastoma for children in almost every corner of the planet,  says the study s lead author Dr. Alberto Delaidelli, MD and UBC PhD candidate in Dr. Sorensen s lab.To develop the test, the researchers analyzed various data sets, including proteomics (which measures overall protein expression in tumour tissues) and transcriptomics (which measures overall gene expression in tumour tissues). Using this strategy, they found a protein called TPD52 that is highly expressed in the most aggressive medulloblastoma.They then screened for the expression of this protein in approximately 400 medulloblastoma samples and found that tumours where this protein was readily detectable were significantly more likely to display aggressive behavior and to relapse. These days, researchers often go from simpler techniques to extremely complicated  omics  techniques as part of their research efforts to make clinically-relevant observations,  says Dr. Delaidelli.  Instead, we used a bit of  reverse engineering,  working backwards by analyzing very complicated data sets to develop a technique that can be performed in virtually all clinical labs worldwide. The study, recently published in Clinical Cancer Research, is the result of a collaboration between researchers in Vancouver, Toronto, Philadelphia, Heidelberg and Moscow.The research groups are now testing the performance of the test in a clinical trial, working in collaboration with colleagues in Germany and other parts of the world.Reference: Delaidelli A, Dunham C, Santi M, et al.

Brown School of Engineering, and her colleagues at the University of Houston, the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Federal University of Cear , Brazil, have posted a  user-friendly  web server offering scientists the chance to screen their drug candidates virtually in relation to known protein binding pockets on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Better yet, the program incorporates what they say is an often-overlooked factor in computational models of these pockets: their flexibility. The project, detailed in an open-access paper in Computers in Biology and Medicine, incorporates models of three drug targets -- main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Papain-like protease (PLpro) -- for ensemble docking through DINC-COVID. The ensemble docking approach allows researchers to screen candidate ligands (reactive molecules) against different conformations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their binding pockets. DINC-COVID then scores the ligands  success at binding.DINC stands for  Docking INCrementally,  a protocol developed by Kavraki s lab in 2013 to speed protein-peptide docking simulations that help researchers design drugs, vaccines and other processes involving large ligands. An upgraded version led by Kavraki and Dinler Antunes, then a postdoctoral researcher in her lab and now an assistant professor at the University of Houston, appeared in 2017.The new iteration relies on the  impressive number  of SARS-CoV-2 protein structures that have been resolved so far. Understanding these structures allows researchers to find binding partners that could, ideally, deactivate the virus.The study also offers a literal twist, best represented by the main protease, a docking site on the virus that has been the focus of much attention over the past 18 months. Researchers have found the Mpro site can substantially distort its shape in response to binding, allowing it to accommodate a diverse set of potential ligands.That malleability makes Mpro and other sites hard to simulate, with a much higher computational cost, said Rice postdoctoral researcher and co-author Mauricio Rigo.  Unlike other servers, the proteins we are making available aren t static; they re not a single conformation,  he said.  We use states to reflect the dynamics of this protein in a physiological environment.  The team used several programs to narrow the ensembles from the 100,000 possible conformations generated by a molecular dynamics simulation, for instance, to a set of representative conformations. That lets the researchers decouple ensemble generation from docking within DINC-COVID, saving hours or days on complicated calculations. We believe this was the right way to go,  Rigo said.  Our tests of the algorithm gave us a good match with experimental results. Along with Mpro, the team modeled ensembles of catalytic binding sites on PLpro and RdRp. For Mpro, they modeled its catalytic and allosteric binding sites, for a total of 12 ensembles.  We chose them because these can be targeted by different drugs,  said Sarah Hall-Swan, a Rice graduate student and co-lead author of the paper.  When you re trying to find a drug to inhibit a virus, you're going to look for the protein parts that are important for that virus to function and try to inhibit them. The lab is working to expand the number of ensembles available in DINC-COVID.  We are very pleased with the response of the community to our work,  Kavraki said.  DINC-COVID has already been used by about 500 researchers in 16 different countries, while our earlier web server DINC has been accessed by 11,000 users. We hope DINC-COVID will help shed light on the complex mechanisms of infection by SARS-CoV-2. Reference: Hall-Swan S, Devaurs D, Rigo MM, Antunes DA, Kavraki LE, Zanatta G.

But studying this vast and remote area is extremely difficult. Many inhabitants of the twilight zone are easily destroyed during sampling  or are quick to avoid any disturbance so it s difficult to sample them with traditional nets. Advances in acoustics have enabled more accurate estimates of biomass, but questions about the diversity and distribution of species within that biomass remain unanswered.That knowledge gap is beginning to close, thanks to the genetic material from scales, fecal pellets , or bits of tissue creatures shed as they move through the water. The resulting trail of environmental DNA, or eDNA, gives researchers clues about which species are in that water and their relative abundance. In a paper published Thursday, October 28th in Scientific Reports, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found that changes in the concentration of eDNA in the ocean accurately reflects the movement of creatures as they travel between the twilight zone and surface. A major finding of our paper is that the eDNA signal doesn t go away immediately if the animal moves up or down in the water column, said Elizabeth Andruszkiewicz Allan, a WHOI postdoctoral fellow during the study and currently a postdoc at the University of Washington.  That helps us answer some big questions we can t answer with net tows or acoustic data. Which species are migrating? What percentage of them migrate each day? And who is an early or late migrator? Allan and co-author Weifeng  Gordon  Zhang, a WHOI physical oceanographer, utilized a computer model to simulate what happens to eDNA in the water column after it is shed by the host animal. They found that physical processes currents, wind, and mixing and settling of particles did not have a significant impact on the vertical distribution of the eDNA. In fact, most eDNA signals remained within 20 meters (66 feet) of where they were first shed, meaning that changes in eDNA concentration can reliably be used to determine where certain species live at different times of the day, the amount of time they spend at those depths, and the percentage of certain species that migrate from the twilight zone to the surface. Before this work, we couldn t confidently say what happened to the eDNA shed by twilight zone species. But a very clear pattern showed up in the model, providing a baseline understanding of the concentration of eDNA between the surface and deep layers over time,  said Zhang.  With this new knowledge, field researchers will be able to target where they take the precious water samples so they can identify the migrating species and estimate the percentage of animals in each species group that migrate each day. As one of the first studies to model eDNA concentration, the researchers note that more field data is needed to help test the model. However, these promising results show just how useful eDNA can be for studying animal migration and carbon sequestration in difficult-to-access parts of the ocean like the twilight zone. These modeling results provide a foundation for which we ll be able to more efficiently study the ecology of the ocean twilight zone,  said Annette Govindarajan, a WHOI molecular ecologist and co-author of the paper.  It sets up some experiments for future directions, some of which we ve already started working on. Reference: Allan EA, DiBenedetto MH, Lavery AC, Govindarajan AF, Zhang WG.

The study provides the largest peer-reviewed evaluation of the effectiveness of a third  booster  dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in a nationwide mass-vaccination setting. The study was conducted in Israel, an early global leader in third-dose COVID-19 vaccination rates. Many countries are currently experiencing a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 infections despite hitherto successful vaccination campaigns. This may be due to the greater infectiousness of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2, and to waning immunity of vaccines administered months earlier. In the face of the current resurgence, several countries are planning to administer a third booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. This study suggests that a third vaccine dose is effective in reducing severe COVID-19-related outcomes compared to individuals who have received two vaccine doses at least 5 months ago. It is the first to estimate the effectiveness of a third dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 specifically against severe outcomes with adjustment for various possible confounders, including comorbidities and behavioral factors. The study s large size also allows a more precise assessment of the vaccine s effectiveness across different time periods, different subpopulations (by sex, age and number of comorbidities), and different severe outcomes (which are rarer and thus require greater sample size). A recent clinical trial conducted by BioNTech included a smaller sample size and did not estimate the third-dose s effects for more severe outcomes.The study took place from July 30, 2021 through Sept 23, 2021, coinciding with Israel s fourth wave of coronavirus infection and illness, during which the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was the dominant strain in the country for new infections (with very few exceptions). Researchers reviewed data from 728,321 individuals aged 12 or above who had received the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. These individuals were carefully matched 1:1 with 728,321 individuals who had received only two shots of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least five months prior. The matching was based on an extensive set of demographic, geographic and health-related attributes associated with risk of infection, risk of severe disease, health status and health seeking behavior. Individuals were assigned to each group dynamically based on their changing vaccination status (198,476 individuals moved from the unvaccinated cohort into the vaccinated cohort during the study). Multiple analyses were conducted to ensure that the estimated vaccine effectiveness was robust to potential biases. The study included a total of over 12,000,000 person-days of follow-up.The results show that, compared with individuals who received only two doses five months prior, individuals who received three doses of the vaccine (7 days or more after the third dose) had 93% lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization, 92% lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease, and 81% lower risk of COVID-19-related death. Vaccine effectiveness was found to be similar for different sexes, age groups (ages 40-69 and 70+) and number of comorbidities. The study also included a population-level analysis which found that infection rates began to drop for each age group 7-10 days after that age group became eligible for the third dose.The research was conducted by Dr. Noam Barda, Dr. Noa Dagan, Prof. Cyrille Cohen, and Prof. Ran Balicer from the Clalit Research Institute, as well as Prof. Miguel Hern n and Prof. Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Professor Isaac S. Kohane of Harvard Medical School, and Prof. Ben Reis of Boston Children s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The extensive nationwide rollout of Israel s third-dose  booster  COVID-19 vaccination campaign provided the Clalit Research Institute with a unique opportunity to assess, through its rich and comprehensive digital datasets, the effectiveness of the third dose in a real-world setting against the less common but severe complications of COVID-19 said Prof. Ran Balicer, senior author of the study, Director of the Clalit Research Institute and Chief Innovation Officer for Clalit. These results show convincingly that the third dose of the vaccine is highly effective against severe COVID-19-related outcomes in different age groups and population subgroups, one week after the third dose. These data should facilitate informed policy decision-making, added Prof. Balicer, who also serves as Chairman of Israel s National Expert Advisory Team on COVID-19 response.Prof. Ben Reis, Director of the Predictive Medicine Group at the Boston Children s Hospital Computational Health Informatics Program and Harvard Medical School, said, To date, one of the main drivers of vaccine hesitancy has been a lack of information regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine. This careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on third-dose vaccine effectiveness, which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination with a third dose.  Prof. Miguel Hern n, Director of the CAUSALab and Professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said, This research is a perfect example of how randomized trials and observational healthcare databases complement each other. The trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provided compelling evidence of its effectiveness to prevent symptomatic infection, but the estimates for severe disease and specific age groups were too imprecise. This analysis of Clalit s high-quality database emulates the design of the original trial, uses its findings as a benchmark, and expands upon them to confirm the vaccine s effectiveness in adolescents. This combination of evidence from randomized trials and observational studies is a model for efficient medical research, something which is especially important in COVID times. Prof. Marc Lipsitch, Director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and Professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said, In all studies of vaccine effectiveness, a major challenge is to ensure that those we are comparing to identify the vaccine s effect are similar in the other characteristics that may predict whether they get infected or ill. This is especially hard in the context of a rapidly growing, age-targeted vaccine campaign. Clalit s extraordinary database made it possible to design a study that addressed these challenges in a way that provides tremendous confidence in the inferences that come out of the study.

Their findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), may help scientists breed resilient crops that can thrive in increasingly drier climates. In an era of accelerated climate change, it is critical to uncover the genetic basis to improve crop production and resilience under dry and nutrient-poor conditions,  said Gloria Coruzzi, Carroll & Milton Petrie Professor in the New York University (NYU) Department of Biology and Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, who co-led the study with Rodrigo Guti rrez. The study was an international collaboration among botanists, microbiologists, ecologists, evolutionary and genomic scientists. This unique combination of expertise enabled the team to identify the plants, associated microbes, and genes that enable the Atacama plants to adapt to and flourish in extreme desert conditions, which could ultimately help to enhance crop growth and reduce food insecurity. Our study of plants in the Atacama Desert is directly relevant to regions around the world that are becoming increasingly arid, with factors such as drought, extreme temperatures, and salt in water and soil posing a significant threat to global food production,  said Guti rrez, professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Pontificia Universidad Cat lica de Chile.

For instance, some plants will undergo defoliation or close their stomata to reduce water loss and increase the chance of survival. Details of how these mechanisms were activated in the endomembrane system have still not been clear.Recently, the Centre for Organelle Biogenesis and Function, School of Life Sciences at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has made a major breakthrough in identifying and functionally characterising a new population of giant COPII vesicles in response to hormone regulation and abiotic (drought) stresses in plants, with potential impact on the development of drought-tolerant crops and therefore future environmental sustainability. Results have been published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature Plants. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells is the major protein synthesis factory for membrane and secreted proteins. The COPII coated vesicles are subsequently responsible for mediating protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Precise selection of cargoes by vesicles determines the homeostasis of the cell. Professor JIANG Liwen, Choh-Ming Li Professor of Life Sciences and Director of the Centre for Organelle Biogenesis and Function, highlighted the importance of the research project,  Climate change poses a considerable threat to global food security. Understanding the mechanisms of protein trafficking as well as organelles biogenesis and function in plants could bring us insights on boosting drought tolerance and the production yield of crops by means of bioengineering. This project focuses on the mechanism of COPII vesicles production by hormonal regulation under drought stresses and its related protein reactions.  The research team has combined biochemical, cellular, molecular and proteomic approaches with cutting-edge electron microscopy techniques and experience gained over the past two decades to reconstitute COPII vesicles using plant-derived materials in vitro for the first time. They have identified giant COPII vesicles, twice the size of a normal COPII vesicle, induced by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. These giant vesicles package a large number of stress-relevant membrane proteins to their destination, to trigger the mechanism and relieve the plants from stresses. They have also revealed that the induction of giant COPII vesicles is regulated by a protein AtSar1a. In a drought stress experimental environment, the AtSar1a-lacked mutant plants, compared with their wild species, had their stomata opened wider and eventually suffered from severer water loss. Based on these new findings, the research team proposed a novel molecular mechanism underlying plant response to abiotic stresses and provided a new insight for the future development of drought-tolerant plants/crops in plant biotechnology, with potential impact on environmental sustainability. Professor JIANG said,  We started this project almost 10 years ago in collaboration with Prof. Randy SCHEKMAN, 2013 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, where we learnt the techniques of in vitro reconstitution. It has been very challenging because of the multiple advanced skills developed and used in studying COPII vesicles in plants for the first time. This study not only discovered a novel molecular mechanism underlying plants response to abiotic stresses, but also provided new insights for future development of drought-tolerant plants/crops in plant biotechnology, marking a new milestone in our team s research achievement under the Areas of Excellence Scheme.

An interdisciplinary research team at Heidelberg University and the University of Bern (Switzerland) led by Dr Mihai Petrovici is tackling this problem with the help of biologically-inspired artificial neural networks. Spiking neural networks, which mimic the structure and function of a natural nervous system, represent promising candidates because they are powerful, fast, and energy-efficient. One key challenge is how to train such complex systems. The German-Swiss research team has now developed and successfully implemented an algorithm that achieves such training.The nerve cells (or neurons) in the brain transmit information using short electrical pulses known as spikes. These spikes are triggered when a certain stimulus threshold is exceeded. Both the frequency with which a single neuron produces such spikes and the temporal sequence of the individual spikes are critical for the exchange of information.  The main difference of biological spiking networks to artificial neural networks is that, because they are using spike-based information processing, they can solve complex tasks such as image recognition and classification with extreme energy efficiency,  states Julian G ltz, a doctoral candidate in Dr Petrovici s research group.Both the human brain and the architecturally similar artificial spiking neural networks can only perform at their full potential if the individual neurons are properly connected to one another. But how can brain-inspired   that is, neuromorphic   systems be adjusted to process spiking input correctly?  This question is fundamental for the development of powerful artificial networks based on biological models,  stresses Laura Kriener, also a member of Dr Petrovici s research team. Special algorithms are required to guarantee that the neurons in a spiking neural network fire at the correct time. These algorithms adjust the connections between the neurons so that the network can perform the required task, such as classifying images with high precision.The team under the direction of Dr Petrovici developed just such an algorithm.  Using this approach, we can train spiking neural networks to code and transmit information exclusively in single spikes. They thereby produce the desired results especially quickly and efficiently,  explains Julian G ltz. Moreover, the researchers succeeded in implementing a neural network trained with this algorithm on a physical platform   the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic hardware platform developed at Heidelberg University.According to the researchers, the BrainScaleS system processes information up to a thousand times faster than the human brain and needs far less energy than conventional computer systems. It is part of the European Human Brain Project, which integrates technologies like neuromorphic computing into an open platform called EBRAINS.  However, our work is not only interesting for neuromorphic computing and biologically inspired hardware. It also acknowledges the demand from the scientific community to transfer so-called Deep Learning approaches to neuroscience and thereby further unveil the secrets of the human brain,  emphasises Dr Petrovici.Reference: G ltz J, Kriener L, Baumbach A, et al.

An analysis of neuropsychological testing and 18F-FDG PET imaging showed that few or no objective impairments were observed in the cognition and brain pathology of long-COVID patients; however, many of the group suffered from subjective complaints such as severe fatigue.The term  long-COVID syndrome  is used to describe symptoms that arise in the aftermath of a COVID-19 infection (usually defined as being present later than 12 weeks after the infection), including cognitive deficits such as brain fog, memory loss and attention problems as well as fatigue and exhaustion. The underlying cause of these symptoms is unknown.Previously published studies showed that patients needing inpatient treatment because of newly diagnosed COVID-19 have reduced glucose metabolism in the brain, which is associated with impaired cognitive function. To assess whether patients suffering from long COVID experience similar deficits, researchers conducted neuropsychological testing and cerebral 18F-FDG PET imaging.Thirty-one patients who sought counseling for persistent neurocognitive symptoms were included in the present study. Patients participated in a battery of neuropsychological tests, and the results were analyzed to determine cognitive impairment levels. Average group results of the testing showed no impairment. Mild deficits were observed in some patients on the single-subject level, however, mainly in regard to visual memory.18F-FDG PET imaging was recommended to all patients who received counseling, and 14 of the 31 patients proceeded. Clinical assessment of each patient s scan revealed no distinct pathological findings or alternative diagnoses. When the scans were compared to those of a control group, no significant differences were noted.The lack of significant findings on 18F-FDG PET scans and only mild impairments on neuropsychological testing is in contrast to the severe and lasting disability self-reported by the patients. Fatigue, however, was particularly prevalent in the group, reported by 61 percent of study participants. Fatigue often follows viral infections and inflammation and has been related to immune processes and chronic fatigue syndrome in long COVID. This suggests that the fatigue, not brain regional dysfunction, may be responsible for many long-COVID symptoms,  the researchers concluded.Reference: Dressing A, Bormann T, Blazhenets G, et al.

The almond-eyed, striped rodents with bushy tails live in colonies and take shelter underground in a network of burrows like other ground squirrels. They re pretty cute. People had them as pets and that s how they were introduced to the Canary Islands in 1965,  she said. I looked at whether and why they were social. I began studying the strategies for how they evade predation and increase survival. That s how I got to the question of the synchronous vigilance of the species,  she said.Prey animals such as kangaroos and wild boar also use synchronous vigilance to stay safe, van der Marel said.Co-author Marta L pez Darias, a researcher with the Institute of Natural Products and Agrobiology in Spain, said the synchronized behavior increased with the size of the group, similar to observations made in other species that use this defense mechanism.Unusual for ground squirrels, the populations found in the Canary Islands are as comfortable in the trees as on the ground, she said. They seem to prefer high vantage points such as the old rock walls above the fields and ravines where they can scan all angles of their surroundings. On the Canary Islands  Fuerteventura, the squirrels face daily threats from domestic cats and birds of prey like buzzards and common kestrels. When they forage, they re most vulnerable,  van der Marel said.  So the squirrels have to balance the time spent foraging and being vigilant. Their main defense mechanism is being watchful and alerting other group members to escape predation. To find food, the squirrels set out daily from their underground dens to forage for roots, seeds and fruit. Active in the day, they rely on their keen vision to detect threats from the air and land. The alarm call of a nearby squirrel will alert others and may send some running for the safety of rock piles or the nearest burrow. Often, other squirrels will join in the watchful vigil.The animals can t look for food and be on high alert for predators at the same time. So throughout the day they stop what they re doing to scan the environment together, often from a higher vantage point, van der Marel said.Virtually all the squirrels spend time standing watch during the day. About one-third of the time, they do so alone. But 40% of the time, they have company. And when a predator is observed, multiple squirrels stop to stand watch 60% of the time, the study found.Researchers found that squirrels that spent more time watching still found enough food to remain in good physical condition. Likewise, their extended vigilance did not affect their overall survival rates. There are plentiful resources and less predation pressure, so they don t have to forage as much,  she said.Reference: van der Marel A, Waterman JM, L pez-Darias M.

About 7,000 people in that group fit the criteria for this study. The research team analyzed the number of unvaccinated individuals who had a positive COVID-19 test more than three months before being hospitalized for the virus as well as the number of individuals who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and were not diagnosed with COVID prior to being admitted to the hospital. The research team found that overall, unvaccinated adults with a previous COVID-19 infection were about five times more likely to be hospitalized than those who were vaccinated. This data provides powerful evidence that vaccinations offer superior protection against COVID-19 than relying on natural immunity alone,  said Shaun Grannis, M.D., M.S., vice president for data and analytics at Regenstrief Institute and professor of family medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine.  Many have been asking if they should get vaccinated if they ve already been infected   this research shows the answer is yes.  Regenstrief contributes data and expertise to the VISION Network.The data analysis also found among adults older than 65, overall mRNA vaccines were nearly 20 times more effective at protecting against hospitalizations than prior infection alone.The study findings are consistent with laboratory evidence that mRNA vaccines create high levels of antibodies, whereas those who recover from COVID-19 have varying levels of antibodies, especially if they experienced mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.The VISION Network, which conducted the study, includes seven organizations that contribute and analyze data from U.S. healthcare systems to learn more about COVID-19.

To fill this knowledge gap, a team of undergraduate students from Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Korea, conducted a comparative study of wound healing in seven different fish species and investigated the role played by the skin bacterial community, demonstrating that fish can be an excellent model for exploring the mechanisms of wound healing.Although many of us take the healing processes of the skin for granted, they require a complex interplay of genetic and microbial factors. In mammals, including humans, scientists have demonstrated that symbiotic bacteria that live on the skin, known as  skin microbiota,  interact with the host s immune systems to accelerate wound healing. However, despite the wound healing process in fish being quite similar to that in mammals, few studies have been carried out to investigate the role that skin microbiota plays and how this varies among different species. In a recent study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, a team of undergraduate students at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Korea, set out to address this knowledge gap under the supervision of Professor Myungin Baek and Professor Jung-Ah Cho. First, they acquired multiple individuals of seven local species of fish that represented different habitats and skin types. Then, while the fishes were anesthetized, the team inflicted a deep circular wound (3 mm in diameter) in all of them to observe the healing rate of each species. They found notable interspecies differences in the healing rate, with the scale-less Korean bullhead and the Chinese bleak exhibiting the fastest recovery. To determine if microbiota played any positive role in the wound healing process, the team administered antibiotics to some of the fishes of these two species. Surprisingly, the wound healing rate in the Korean bullhead increased after the application of the antibiotic solution, hinting at the possibility of harmful bacteria slowing down the process in nature. The team confirmed this hypothesis by performing a 16S rRNA sequencing analysis on the bacteria found in the mucus around the wound.  We found that the population of one harmful bacteria the genus Elizabethkingia was more than 5000-fold reduced after antibiotic treatment in Korean bullhead specimens,  explains Tery Yun, the first author of the study.  Our study, thus, suggests that both host factors and microbial factors affect wound healing rates in fish species.  Understanding the mechanisms of wound healing is crucial for medical applications and to develop new treatments for people suffering from slow wound healing rates, such as patients with diabetes. While animal models based on mammalian species might be more likely to produce results immediately relevant for humans, the immense diversity of fish makes them an attractive research target as well. Mr. Yun explains,  Fishes are an excellent model to study wound healing. They comprise nearly half of the entire vertebrate species on Earth, thereby providing vast genetic assets for studying wound healing mechanisms.  Insights on wound healing from our piscine friends will certainly be welcome news for faster and more effective therapy for humans and non-human animals.ReferenceYun T, Shin S, Bang K, Lee M, Cho JA, Baek M.

The team used a multidisciplinary approach that combined single-cell RNA sequencing, ultrastructural microscopy, genetically engineered models, and patient samples to identify the cell types that form in response to pancreatic injury. Vanderbilt contributions included computational analysis by Ken Lau, associate professor of cell and developmental biology, and various microscopy approaches by Dylan Burnette, associate professor of cell and developmental biology, and Rafael Arrojo e Drigo, assistant professor of molecular physiology and biophysics.From this approach,  we compared our dataset to published datasets of gastric injury, oncogene-induced pancreatic neoplasia, and human pancreatitis to identify conserved processes across species and organ systems,  said DelGiorno. According to Wahl, the findings of this paper  support our long-held thesis that tissue inflammation causes cells to reprogram to a more primitive, developmentally plastic state that under normal circumstances contributes to tissue repair.

What if some proteins bind due to their shapes, a much simpler process? To answer this question, researchers used Summit, the nation s fastest supercomputer, to model lock-and-key interactions. In these interactions, molecules in the proteins that are binding together must chemically  fit  precisely. The team tested 46 protein pairs that scientists know bind to one another. Next, the team modeled those protein pairs  assembly on Summit. Out of the 46 pairs tested, 6 assembled based on their complementary shapes more than 50 percent of the time.The results could have many applications in biological research. For example, the approach could screen drugs for disease treatments or provide scientists with information about how to use proteins as building blocks to design new biological materials. The team plans to study additional proteins that can also bind based on shape or form even higher order assemblies. Ultimately, the team wants to know the limitation for how protein shapes can evolve to form hierarchical protein structures.For proteins to successfully bind to one another, one of them acts as a ligand, a molecule that attaches to a target protein, and one of them acts as a receptor, the molecule that receives the ligand. This process involves complex chemical interactions, in which molecules share bonds and change their configurations upon binding. Researchers wanted to see whether they could predict this binding based on shape alone, ignoring the interactions between proteins. From a database of more than 6,000 protein pairs, the team tested 46 pairs that are known to bind to one another and simulated their assembly on Summit, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility s 200-petaflop supercomputer.The team captured six protein pairs that bound based only on shape, with one of the pairs binding more than 94 percent of the time. The team plans to study more proteins that can also bind based on shape or form even higher order structures. In the future, the team wants to know the limitation for how protein shapes can evolve to form hierarchical protein structures. The team hopes they can eventually predict the binding of protein-protein interfaces in protein clusters or protein crystallization structures.

However, a low conversion efficiency has limited their application. Now, scientists at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Korea, have designed a novel hybrid thermoelectrochemical-concentration cell that outperforms similar state-of-the-art devices, opening doors to commercially feasible energy harvesting systems that could power IoT devices and sensors by leveraging thermal energy.Thanks to the ongoing digital revolution, we are on the verge of transitioning to a hyper-connected world. However, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and remote sensors that promise such a reality require energy. With sustainability as a top priority, the energy source must be abundant, ubiquitous, and renewable. Fortunately, low-grade waste heat (temperatures below 100  C) could fit the bill provided we develop efficient energy harvesting technologies. The conversion of a temperature difference into electricity is already possible through thermoelectrochemical cells (TECs). These devices can leverage waste heat to sustain a reduction oxidation (redox) reaction that, in turn, produces electricity. However, current state-of-the-art TECs are lacking commercial implementations due to their low energy conversion efficiency, lackluster output power, and costly fabrication. A breakthrough in energy conversion is, therefore, needed for TECs to become viable for untethered low-power devices. Against this backdrop, a team of scientists at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Korea, devised an effective strategy to take it up a notch. Led by Professor Hochun Lee, these researchers combined the operating principle of TECs with that of concentration galvanic cells, creating a hybrid thermoelectrochemical-concentration cell (TCC). Although TCCs are not a new concept, the design put forward by the team overcomes some critical limitations of existing TECs. The TCC reported in this study, which was published in the Chemical Engineering Journal, is based on redox reactions involving iodine ions (I ) and triiodide (I3 ). Unlike in conventional TECs, however, these reactions occur in a non-aqueous carbonate solution that uses dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a solvent. This particular selection of materials creates a peculiar effect. The researchers found that as the temperature of the hot side increased beyond 40  C, the DMC reacted with I  to produce a porous, gel-like layer of Li2CO3 near the hot electrode that helped maintain a large difference in the concentrations of I  and I3  throughout the cell, greatly boosting its performance.  Our hybrid cell demonstrates a remarkable thermal conversion efficiency (5.2%) and outperforms the current best n-type TECs,  says Prof. Lee.  In addition, the simple structure and fabrication process of our TCCs offer a practically feasible platform for thermal energy harvesting.  Further studies will be needed to refine this unprecedented approach to TCC design and, hopefully, achieve the goal of connecting multiple TCCs in series to reach commercially acceptable capabilities.  IoT-connected societies will require economic and autonomous power sources for their IoT devices and sensors, and we believe TECs will be the ideal candidate to meet their need,  concludes an optimistic Prof. Lee. Hopefully, science will lead us to sustainable and more efficient ways to make good use of waste heat.ReferenceKim K, Kang J, Lee H.

The study is published in the scientific journal Frontiers in Immunology - Microbial Immunology.Bacterial lung infection affects both children and adults worldwide and pneumonia remains a common cause of premature death in many parts of the world, with millions of people dying from it every year. To facilitate the development of more effective therapies, researchers at Karolinska Institutet are trying to characterise the immunological mechanisms involved in pneumonia.The new study demonstrates that an inflammatory mediator called interleukin-26 (IL-26) is critically involved in bacterial pneumonia in humans. During the last decade, IL-26 has emerged as an important player in the so-called innate immune response, our first line of defence against pathogens. It is abundant in the airways of healthy humans, and bacterial exposure stimulates an increased release of IL-26 by lung cells and white blood cells.Studying human lung tissue and airway samples from patients with bacterial pneumonia, the researchers were able to show that IL-26 exerts complex modulatory effects on the immune system and that the protein directly kills bacteria known to cause pneumonia. Antibiotics are not sufficient to treat pneumonia and antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem, highlighting the need for biological treatments of this global killer disease.

This information could inform efforts to develop new tools to help people with HIV put the virus into remission without taking lifelong medication, which can have long-term side-effects.The study, published today in the journal Nature Medicine, was led by Tae-Wook Chun, Ph.D., chief of the HIV Immunovirology Section in the Laboratory of Immunoregulation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH; and by Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., NIAID director and chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation. The study involved two adults with HIV who began ART soon after acquiring the virus and continued with treatment for more than six years, successfully suppressing HIV. The individuals then joined an HIV clinical trial and stopped taking ART under medical supervision. The study team followed one of these people for four years and the other for more than five years, with study visits roughly every two to three weeks. The investigators monitored the timing and size of viral rebounds in each participant, that is, times when the amount of HIV in their blood became detectable. One participant suppressed the virus with intermittent rebounds for nearly 3.5 years, at which point he began taking suboptimal ART without telling the study team. The other participant almost completely suppressed HIV for nearly four years, at which point the virus rebounded dramatically because he became infected with a different HIV strain, a phenomenon known as  superinfection.  In the first participant but not the second, the scientists found high levels of HIV-specific immune cells called CD8+ T cells that can kill virus-infected cells, indicating that different mechanisms of control were at work in each person. The researchers also found that the second participant, who had a weaker CD8+ T cell response against HIV, had a very strong neutralizing antibody response throughout the follow-up period until the sudden viral rebound. According to the scientists, this suggests that neutralizing antibodies may have played a significant role in facilitating near-complete HIV suppression in this individual until he newly acquired a different strain of the virus. The researchers emphasized that to avoid the emergence of viral resistance and prevent potential misinterpretation of scientific data in studies like this one, it is important to conduct routine antiretroviral drug testing of people with HIV who halt treatment for extended periods. In addition, the researchers identified HIV superinfection as a potential cause of sudden virologic breakthrough in people with HIV who halt treatment, especially when the breakthrough occurs after a prolonged period of virus suppression.ReferenceBlazkova J, Gao F, Marichannegowda MH et al.

There are 100 million neurons scattered along the gastrointestinal tract directly in the line of fire that can be stamped out by gut infections, potentially leading to long-term GI disease. But there may be an upside to enteric infection. A new study finds that mice infected with bacteria or parasites develop a unique form of tolerance quite unlike the textbook immune response. The research, published in Cell, describes how gut macrophages respond to prior insult by shielding enteric neurons, preventing them from dying off when future pathogens strike. These findings may ultimately have clinical implications for conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, which have been linked to the runaway death of intestinal neurons.     We re describing a sort of innate memory that persists after the primary infection is gone,  says Rockefeller s Daniel Mucida.  This tolerance does not exist to kill future pathogens, but to deal with the damage that infection causes preserving the number of neurons in the intestine. Known as the body s  second brain,  the enteric nervous system is houses the largest depot of neurons and glia outside of the brain itself. The GI tract s own nervous system exists more or less autonomously, without significant input from the brain. It controls the movement of nutrients and waste by fiat, coordinating local fluid exchange and blood flow with authority not seen anywhere else in the peripheral nervous system.  If enough of those neurons die, the GI tract spirals out of control. Mucida and colleagues reported last year that gut infections in mice can kill the rodents  enteric neurons, with disastrous consequences for gut motility. At the time, the researchers noted that the symptoms of IBS closely mirror what one might expect to see when enteric neurons die en masse raising the possibility that otherwise minor gut infections might be decimating enteric neurons in some people more than others, leading to constipation and other unexplained GI conditions. The researchers wondered whether the body has some mechanism of preventing neuronal loss following infection. In previous work, the lab had indeed demonstrated that macrophages in the gut produce specialized molecules that prevent neurons from dying in response to stress.  A hypothesis began to take shape.  We knew that enteric infections cause neuronal loss, and we knew that macrophages prevent neuronal cell death,  Mucida says.  We wondered whether we were really looking at a single pathway. Does a prior infection activate these macrophages to protect the neurons in future infections? Postdoctoral fellow Tomasz Ahrends and additional lab members first infected mice with a non-lethal strain of Salmonella, a standard bacterial source of food poisoning. The mice cleared the infection in about a week, losing a number of enteric neurons along the way. They then infected those same mice with another comparable foodborne bacterium. This time, the mice suffered no further loss of enteric neurons, suggesting that the first infection had created a tolerance mechanism that prevented neuronal loss.  The scientists found that common parasitic infections also have a similar impact.  In contrast to pathogenic bacteria, some parasites like helminths have learned to live within us without causing excessive harm to the tissue,  he says. Indeed this family of parasites, which includes flukes, tapeworms, and nematodes, infect in a way that is more subtle than highly hostile bacteria. But they also induce even greater, and more far-reaching, protection. During a primary bacterial infection, Mucida found, neurons call out to macrophages, which rush to the area and protect its vulnerable cells from future attacks. When a helminth insinuates itself into the gut, however, it is T cells that recruit the macrophages, sending them to even distant parts of the intestine to ensure that the whole gamut of enteric neurons are shielded from future harm.  At the end of the day, through different routes, bacterial and helminth infections were both leading to protection of enteric neurons.  Next, Ahrends repeated the experiments in mice from a pet store.  Animals in the wild have likely had some of these infections already,  he says.  We would expect a pre-set tolerance to neuronal loss.  Indeed, these animals suffered no neuronal loss from any infection.  They had a lot of helminths in general,  Mucida says.  The parasitic infections were doing their jobs, preventing the neuronal losses that we have seen in isolated animals in the lab. Mucida is now hoping to determine the precise impact of neuronal loss in the GI tract.  We ve observed that animals consume more calories without gaining more weight after neuronal loss,  he says.  This may mean that the loss of enteric neurons is also impacting the absorption of nutrients, metabolic and caloric intake.  There may be more consequences of neuronal loss than we expected,  he adds. Mucida believes that this research could contribute to a more complete understanding of the underlying causes of IBS and related conditions.  One speculation is that the number of enteric neurons throughout your life is set by early childhood infections, which prevent you from losing neurons after every subsequent infection,  Mucida explains.  People who for some reason do not develop tolerance may continue to lose enteric neurons throughout their life with every subsequent infection. Future studies will explore alternative methods of protecting enteric neurons, hopefully paving the way for therapies. ReferenceAhrends T, Aydin B, Matheis F, et al.

With this headset, anyone with a smartphone can place their device into the headset and view VR content through its large screen.With the barrier to entry now greatly reduced, scientists and engineers are trying to figure out ways of bringing VR to the masses and, potentially, using it to unlock breakthrough discoveries. One such team of researchers from some of the US s top medical centers and institutions has now published a paper in Frontiers in Genetics documenting a VR tool they created called  singlecellVR  that allows anyone to explore single-cell datasets.Dr Luca Pinello, an Associate Professor at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, as well the corresponding author of the paper, originally pitched the concept at a hackathon in 2019 alongside his colleagues David Stein, Dr Huidong Chen, and Mike Vinyard. After gaining a lot of attention from their peers at the event, they decided to develop a working prototype. New features were later added with the help of Dr Qian Qin and others in the Pinello Lab.Learning new things in a fun and interactive way I believe VR and augmented reality (AR) technologies are just getting started in terms of the spaces to which they are applicable, especially in the sciences,  Pinello said.  I hope the general public could appreciate the new opportunities that new VR/AR technologies are bringing to us to interact with reality, to explore biological data or just to learn new things in a fun and interactive way. The free, open-access web app allows anyone to easily visualize single-cell assays in VR and requires no advanced technical skills from the user. Single-cell assays have transformed our ability to model heterogeneity within cell populations and help identify the function and behavior of individual cells within a much larger population of cells.Having access to this data and knowing which cell states and genes  are present is crucial in helping scientists better understand how, for example, various cancers spread in the human body.Previous tools used to view single-cell data visualizations in VR have been limited to the most expensive hardware, costing upwards of $2,500. However, singlecellVR is built on previous advancements in VR by allowing users to visualize their own precomputed data directly from the most commonly used single-cell analysis tools including Scanpy, Seurat, PAGA, STREAM, scVelo, and EpiScanpy.How to access it We have simplified conversion of data output from these tools, enabling users to easily contribute to a growing database of datasets from key studies that are preprocessed and available for VR visualization,  the authors wrote. Ultimately, these tools seek to empower non-computational biologists to explore their data and make rapid hypotheses otherwise difficult to attain from traditional 2D visualizations.  The authors go on to say that despite tools having been developed in the past, there are currently no peer-reviewed tools available for the visualization of single-cell data in VR, illustrating the novelty in the area of single-cell RNA sequencing.While smartphone-based VR headsets are limited in the amount the user can navigate and interact with their digital surroundings, Pinello said that the addition of an inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard or controller (approximately $20) should make for a better experience. The singlecellVR website   which requires no installation on a device   allows users to explore several preloaded datasets or upload their own datasets for VR visualization across Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox on Android and Apple devices.Once users have uploaded their data to singlecellVR, they have the option to view and explore the data in 3D directly in their web browser or to quickly jettison the data to their mobile device for visualization in a VR headset. One of the biggest challenges in visualizing single-cell data, the team said, was taking data compiled on a desktop computer and displaying it through a smartphone.To overcome this challenge and enable a seamless transition to a smartphone for VR view, the team s website dynamically generates a QR code that enables users to open the VR view on their phone to view data uploaded through a personal computer.Plans for the futureLooking to the future, the team sees singlecellVR having more applications related to new single-cell technologies (eg multiomics or spatial profiling) and expects singlecellVR to expand support to more powerful devices such as the Oculus VR headsets from Facebook (costing approximately $300). My hope is that by lowering the barrier to adopt or explore these new technologies, more people will become excited about this space, and we will create a community interested in developing VR applications focused on the exploration and analysis of biological data,  Pinello said.Reference: Stein DF, Chen H, Vinyard ME, et al.

Results from the initial study in patients, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found the breath test is highly accurate in identifying COVID-19 infections in critically ill patients.  The gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 is a PCR test that requires an uncomfortable nasal swab and time in a lab to process the sample and obtain the results,  said Dr. Matthew Exline, lead researcher, director of critical care at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center University Hospital and professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.  The breathalyzer test used in our study can detect COVID-19 within seconds. COVID-19 infection produces a distinct breath print from the interaction of oxygen, nitric oxide and ammonia in the body. The breath detector device, developed by Pelagia-Irene Gouma, researcher and professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The Ohio State University and Milutin Stana evi , associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University, can detect the breath print of COVID-19 in exhaled breath within 15 seconds.  This novel breathalyzer technology uses nanosensors to identify and measure specific biomarkers in the breath,  said Gouma.  This is the first study to demonstrate the use of a nanosensor breathalyzer system to detect a viral infection from exhaled breath prints. The study followed 46 patients in the intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation. Half of the patients had an active COVID-19 infection and the remaining half didn t have COVID-19. All patients had a PCR COVID-19 test when they were admitted to the unit. Researchers collected exhaled breath bags from the patients on day 1, 3, 7 and 10 of their inpatient stay. The breath bag samples were tested within 4 hours of sample collection in a lab. The breath print was identified in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with 88% accuracy upon admission to the ICU. PCR tests often miss early COVID-19 infections and results can be positive after the infection has resolved,  Exline said.  However, this noninvasive breath test technology can pick up early COVID-19 infection within 72 hours of the onset of respiratory failure, allowing us to rapidly screen patients in a single step and exclude those without COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation. The use of breathalyzer technology to rapidly diagnose patients with respiratory infections has the potential to greatly improve the ability to rapidly screen both patients and asymptomatic people. Future studies will look at the use of this technology for less severe COVID-19 patients and will explore whether other diseases and infections could benefit from it. The research team has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of the breathalyzer technology.Dr. Andrew S.

Now, scientists at the Salk Institute and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) have taken a closer look at how mitochondria are maintained in nondividing cells, such as neurons, with the ultimate goal of developing a better understanding of how to prevent or treat age-related diseases. The researchers found that many of the proteins in mitochondria last much longer than expected, and that this stability likely protects them from damage. The findings were published October 28, 2021, in Developmental Cell. There is longstanding interest in the question of how certain cells in various tissues are maintained over the course of an entire life span,  says Martin Hetzer, the paper s senior author and Salk s senior vice president and chief science officer.  One thing we would like to understand is how it s possible that biological systems, which are made up of many dynamic constituents like proteins and biomolecules, can remain stable for a whole century in people who live that long. The Hetzer lab uses genetic approaches and advanced imaging to study how tissues are maintained and repaired over an entire lifetime. In a previous study, published in 2012, his group looked at specific surface proteins in the nucleus of rodent brain cells. They found that some of these proteins have a remarkably long life span, and in some cases are as old as the animals themselves.Building on this previous work, Hetzer s team at Salk and colleagues at UCSD collaborated to take a closer look at mitochondria in mouse brain cells. They chose mitochondria because like the nucleus it s important for these organelles (cellular structures) to remain stable in order to maintain proper cell function. Also, like the nucleus, mitochondria contain genetic material. Hetzer says that building a stable structure around mitochondria to protect their DNA makes sense.Within the mitochondria, the researchers decided to focus on proteins that are part of the electron transport chain, which is vital to the primary function of the mitochondria generating energy. The researchers labeled the proteins with stable but unusual isotopes that degrade over time. The technique is similar to carbon dating, which is used by archaeologists to determine the age of materials from once-living organisms. We were surprised to find that some mitochondrial proteins remained very stable and turned over much more slowly than most proteins,  says first author Shefali Krishna, a staff scientist in the Hetzer lab.To learn more about why these long-lived mitochondrial proteins persist for so long, they looked at what would happen if they depleted the proteins  mRNA, which contains the instructions for making more protein. Krishna explains that the team discovered that, even when the mRNA was removed, these proteins remained in the cells for a long time and were able to maintain mitochondrial function. This was in contrast to mRNA removal for short-lived proteins, where the proteins were depleted quickly. Synthesizing new proteins is very energy-consuming, so having long-lived proteins makes sense from an energy-conservation perspective,  says Hetzer.  In addition, whenever you have to replace something, you introduce the risk of making an error, so maintaining the proteins can provide some protection against that. I like to use the analogy of a car; it has some components that need to be changed frequently like the oil and tires, and some that last a very long time like the engine,  says Krishna.  In fact, how long the engine lasts often determines how long the car will last, and we want to maintain the engines of the cell as long as possible. The work provides another powerful example of how life spans of different cellular components and organelles can be studied through the application of new high-resolution imaging technologies, says co-author Mark Ellisman, a professor at UCSD.The team plans to continue studying these long-lived proteins in mitochondria to shed greater light on the role of mitochondria in diseases of aging.Reference: Krishna S, Arrojo e Drigo R, Capitanio JS, Ramachandra R, Ellisman M, Hetzer MW.

Today, scientists are sailing the world's open seas equipped with a tow net and flowmeter to sample microplastics.Now, a global team of oceanographers led by Kyushu University researchers has calibrated and processed data from these expeditions to build a publicly available dataset for more accurately assessing the abundance of microplastics and their long-term trends in the world s oceans.  Although the observation of microplastics dates back to the 1970s, standardized data spanning the globe is still limited,  explains Atsuhiko Isobe, professor at Kyushu University's Research Institute for Applied Mechanics and leader of the study.  Our dataset provides realistic amounts of microplastics in the wild to help researchers trying to assess the true impact they are having on aquatic organisms and the environment.  Categorized as small pieces of degraded plastic less than five millimeters in size, microplastics can travel thousands of miles in the open sea and, depending on their degradation, remain at various depths of the ocean surface. While numerous surveys in the last 50 years have set out to measure the amount of microplastics in the ocean, the combining and archiving of data has been slow and faces many challenges related to differences in collection methods and conditions, such as ocean turbulence, and counting and analysis protocols. To create the new dataset, which was published in the journal Microplastics and Nanoplastics, the researchers collected, calibrated, and gridded data from a total of 8,218 pelagic microplastic samples taken from oceans around the world between 2000 and 2019.  We collected published and unpublished data on microplastic distribution from around the world and calibrated to account for differences such as in collection method and wave height to create standardized, state-of-the-art 2D maps of microplastic abundance,  explains Isobe. The team estimates there are 24.4 trillion pieces of microplastics in the world's upper oceans, with a combined weight of 82,000 to 578,000 tons or the equivalent of roughly 30 billion 500-ml plastic water bottles.  While this work improves our grasp of the actual situation, the total amount of microplastics is still likely to be much greater since this is just what we can estimate on the surface,  states Isobe.  For us to get a clearer picture, we must develop 3D maps probing the depths of the oceans and continue to fill the gaps within our dataset.  One gap is the lack of microplastic data for the Indian Ocean and the seas around Southeast Asia, including the South China Sea. Moreover, data is missing for microplastics less than 300 micrometers in size or even on the nano scale. This is due to the lack of field survey protocols for such plastics and limitations in equipment and the mesh size of nets used in the field. Isobe hopes that future surveys will continue to fill in these gaps using common protocols to facilitate data sharing.  Though we are making progress, we still have much to learn to get a complete picture of the fate of plastic debris and the effect it is having on the environment,  concludes Isobe.ReferenceIsobe A, Azuma T, Cordova MR, et al.

Known as mirror-image peptides, the compounds have chemical properties that make them suitable for the development of low-cost antiviral therapeutics. A big advantage of mirror-image peptides is their long stability and that they are relatively cheap to produce,  says Philip Kim, senior author of the study and a professor of molecular genetics and computer science at the Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research at U of T s Temerty Faculty of Medicine. You could imagine them being formulated as a nasal spray to take prophylactically to prevent infection from occurring. Peptides are similar to proteins in that they are composed of the same amino-acids building blocks. But they are smaller than protein molecules. They can be designed to bind virtually any molecular target and with a greater specificity than small-molecule drugs, reducing the risk of side effects. In this way, peptides are similar to antibodies but are at least 100 times cheaper to produce thanks to their small size. The combination of low cost and easy scaling of manufacturing makes peptides attractive, particularly for low-income countries.But there s a caveat. In the body, peptides are rapidly degraded by the enzymes that have evolved to stamp out harmful versions produced by bacteria and other pathogens. But science has found a solution in mirror-image peptides that are resistant to degradation.For reasons that remain unclear, all naturally occurring amino acids exist in a left-handed configuration, as defined by the direction in which they rotate. Consequently, all proteins and peptides are also left-handed   and known as L-peptides.A few years ago, Kim s team developed a computational tool for the design of so-called D-peptides that have inverse geometry. These mirror-image molecules are manufactured from synthetic D-amino acids strung together in the same way as their left-handed counterparts. Using Kim s design method, they can be engineered to bind the same targets with undiminished specificity. The main difference is that their unusual geometry makes them resistant to enzymes in the bloodstream that break down normal L-peptides.The prospect of working with D-peptides is what enticed post-doctoral researcher Pedro Valiente to join Kim s lab one year prior to the pandemic. When COVID-19 struck, he quickly realized they could apply their tool to try to make antivirals for COVID-19. By May 2020, Valiente had already created the compounds that would prove to be potent inhibitors of the virus, although it took another year to verify that they work as expected in human cells. Valiente designed several D-peptides that mimic the region of the virus spike that binds the ACE2 receptor on the surface of cells. He reasoned that the peptides will bind to the receptor before the virus makes contact with it   thereby preventing infection. The hypothesis was later confirmed by the experiments with cultured human cells that were carried out by collaborators at two high-security labs in South Korea.What s more, the peptides worked just as well against several variants: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, which wreaked havoc over the past year after first appearing in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively. Although the researchers did not investigate the Delta variant, other evidence suggests that it, too, would be susceptible to the peptide drugs, Kim says. While we focused on the variants that were circulating at the time when we were doing this work, the peptides should work on Delta as well based on the similarity with its receptor binding domain,  he says.Valiente says the experience of working in Kim s lab was especially gratifying as he was able to create a potential therapeutic at record speed during the first lockdown when most of the world was at a standstill.By the time the researchers published their findings however, several treatments had become available, including antiviral medications, antibody cocktails and vaccines. Prompted by these global advances, the team has shifted focus from COVID-19 to trying to create compounds that target all coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, in a bid to design a universal therapeutics as a safeguard against future pandemics.To this end, Kim has partnered up with a Boston biotech company Decoy Therapeutics to commercialize his research.Reference: Valiente PA, Wen H, Nim S, et al.

By collating the findings from the studies they found that brain waves, known as  theta activity , in people with conditions like anxiety, OCD, and ADHD are different following mistakes or challenging situations compared to the theta activity in those with healthy brains.The results, published today in Biological Psychiatry, show that disorders like anxiety, OCD and ADHD are strongly linked to brainwaves that oscillate in consistently divergent ways from healthy brains in the midfrontal region of the brain. The researchers suggest that with further investigation measurements of theta activity have the potential to improve diagnostic methods and the effectiveness of currently available treatments like CBT.Oscillations in the theta frequency range are becoming increasingly recognised as related to behavioural and cognitive control, hallmarks of healthy behaviour, and disruption in these oscillations have been connected to a range of psychiatric illnesses. This study establishes that, in more than one type of mental illness, theta-related signals act in ways that diverge from the behaviours seen in healthy brains.In anxious individuals for example, research suggests that there is a significantly higher degree of frontal-midline theta activity compared to non-anxious individuals, and that could be associated with more reactive control modes of behaviour in the moment rather than proactive behaviours such as planning and preparation.Many studies use what s known as the Eriksen Flanker test to investigate this. A participant s reaction time is measured by asking them to press a correct button while being presented with distractions. In anxious individual s, their response time is negatively affected following a mistake as their focus is still on the mistake they just made rather than the task at hand. This could explain how the distraction of worries affects behaviour, as it depletes the required mental capacity needed for active maintenance of task rules and goals.Comparatively, the review found recent studies of ADHD suggest that a dysregulation of theta signals when performing tasks resulted in a different type of negative effect on performance. Again, in tests that measure response times, the theta activity in individuals with ADHD rises either too early or too late for them to make an appropriate decision based on what they perceive. Similar levels of dysregulation are found in those with substance use disorder.Dr Grainne McLoughlin, the study s first author from King s IoPPN said,  From our review, we see that a healthy brain is one in which we see consistent levels of theta activity at the right moments. Theta activity in an anxious person for example is imbalanced over time compared to someone without anxiety. Someone experiencing anxiety, while able to take in new information, isn t able to alter their cognitive behaviour effectively going forward because they are overfocussed on reacting immediately to environmental stimuli. Consistency and balance in these signals are thought to be essential for effective communication between brain regions, and appropriate and timely responses to our environment. Dr Scott Makeig, the study s Lead Investigator from the University of California San Diego and who has long investigated ways to map and model frontal theta activity, said,  Frontal midline theta complexes in scalp-recorded brain electrical signals play essential roles in these transient theta network events which also seem to synchronize higher-frequency activities to regulate communication between brain executive, sensory and motor areas supporting quick behavioural responses and situational awareness of their consequences. This review suggests a role of abnormalities in these theta network events in producing a range of symptoms associated with mental illness.  The investigators propose that this research has the potential to improve diagnostics and help shape future treatments.Dr McLoughlin said,  Analysis of these brainwaves shows that certain brains may be programmed to respond suboptimally to the environment. Improving the consistency and balance of these signals in the brain may be an important first step as there is the potential to improve the effectiveness of treatments like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Our research shows that without consistency and balance in theta oscillations, it can be difficult to process new information and voluntarily guide behaviour. This research in time could help clinicians to have a greater consideration for how the brain responds to situations so that therapies like CBT can be applied more effectively.

In a new study published in Asia-Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology, researchers from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) have revealed that blue images obtained by multicolor widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) may be used to identify areas of DR-induced damage in a more extensive portion of the eye compared with previous methods. Current eye imaging methods include fluorescein angiogram, which involves the injection of dye into the eye. SLO is a non-invasive approach that does not require dye, and multicolor widefield SLO represents an advancement of this technique in which red, blue, and green lasers are used to simultaneously capture images of a wide portion of the eye. Previous research has shown that blue images captured by conventional SLO may reveal hyporeflective areas in the eye indicative of damage associated with DR. Researchers at TMDU sought to further evaluate this finding using widefield SLO.In this retrospective study, the researchers compared blue widefield SLO images and fluorescein angiogram images taken in people with diabetes. The morphology of the retina was also evaluated in some individuals with DR.   We found that the hyporeflective areas in the blue widefield SLO images appeared to correspond with areas of ischemia in the fluorescein angiogram images of patients with DR,  explains Kyoko Ohno-Matsui, senior author.  We were pleased to find that the rate of concordance was high.  Further evaluation of patient images showed that ischemic areas (i.e., areas of reduced blood flow) appeared to correspond with parts of the retina that were thin and partially disorganized.  It s possible that the blue wavelength of light can pass more easily through these thinned areas of the retina, which presents as hyporeflective areas in the SLO images,  says Horie.This study confirms the utility of blue widefield SLO as a simple and non-invasive tool for the detection of DR-associated damage in the eye. This technique may serve as an important means of screening and monitoring disease progression in individuals with DR.

In fact, approximately between 90-97% of us eat meat, with worldwide meat consumption currently on the rise. Yet, the majority of people are concerned, at least to an extent, with animal welfare. In fact, research has shown that many are inclined to empathise more with dogs than with fellow adults.A new literature review by UK researchers from the Societies Research Hub at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) and Nottingham Trent University, led by Sarah Gradidge, explores this ""meat paradox""   namely the coexistence of eating meat and caring for animals.The researchers recognise two main psychological processes within the meat paradox: triggers and restorative strategies. Triggers make meat consumers feel uncomfortable about their own meat consumption. For example, this could be when a meat eater is reminded about meat originating from the flesh of slaughtered animals. However, those thoughts can be countered by certain strategies, so that the person can escape the paradox and resolve their feelings of discomfort. The researchers list the most common strategies of dealing with the meat paradox, such as when a person regards  food  animals to be of low status and hence incapable of thinking, feeling or understanding. Alternatively, some people justify meat consumption as ""natural"", ""necessary"", ""nice"" and ""normal"" (the ""4Ns""). Another common approach is to dissociate meat from animals by using alternative descriptions, such as  livestock ,  pork  and  poultry . Some behaviours, such as presenting vegetarianism as illogical, are also often used to justify meat consumption.Interestingly, the researchers also report that people with different demographics and attitudes utilise different strategies to overcome the meat paradox. For example, one study identified cross-cultural differences, whereby Americans dissociated meat from animals more than people from Ecuador, perhaps because in the latter country it is more common for meat to be served with the animal s head still attached. Similarly, another study found that French people were more likely to deny that animals have their own mind compared to Chinese people.People may also justify their meat consumption because it is part of their religious traditions. For example, some people linked it to God s abundant provision of food, while in a separate study others pointed out the existence of ethical slaughter within Islam.Disengagement from animals appears to be significantly more prevalent in men than in women, concludes the review. However, the researchers note that this is likely due to traditional gender attitudes. For example, military men and women think of meat consumption as inherently masculine and associate it with the  man as hunter  gender stereotype. On the other hand, those who do not believe as much in traditional masculinity (including males) demonstrate greater engagement with animals.In the review, the authors state, This research evidences how masculinity stereotypes necessitate males, and/or those wishing to be  masculine , to disengage from consumed animals, perhaps explaining why females identify as vegetarian and vegan more than males.  For example, 63% of vegans are female, compared to only 37% being male. In terms of political ideologies, greater conservatism appears to be linked to viewing vegetarianism and veganism in negative ways and justifying meat consumption as ""natural"", ""necessary"", ""nice"" and ""normal"", with individuals holding right-wing political beliefs being more willing to consume meat. On the other hand, left-wing participants see vegetarianism and veganism more positively, including in ethical and environmental context. The main conclusion from the review is: [S]ome people are more likely to engage with animals than others, including: females; those who value masculinity less; have less traditional gender attitudes and males who value  new masculinity . Thus, people from these groups may be more responsive to meat reduction interventions.  Sarah Gradidge, the lead author, says, It is exciting to present the first comprehensive structured literature review of the  meat paradox , and we hope it will inform both the  meat paradox  literature and behaviour within the real world, such as meat reduction. The work will be of interest not only to  meat paradox  researchers, but also to people and organisations aiming to reduce meat consumption and even to meat consumers themselves who wish to better understand their psychological relationship to meat. This review is especially timely given urgent requirements to reduce meat consumption in order to save the environment, and we therefore hope the review informs these efforts.

This is the result of a study conducted by the School of Psychology of the University of Sydney, in collaboration with the Universities of Pisa and Florence (Italy), recently published in Nature Communications. When we look around, we spontaneously perceive the form, size, movement and colour of a scene. Equally spontaneously, we perceive the number of items before us. This ability, shared with most other animals, is an evolutionary fundamental: it reveals immediately important quantities, such as how many apples there are on the tree, or how many enemies are attacking,  said co-author, Professor David Burr from the Universities of Sydney and Florence.Information about numbers is so important that it is thought most species have a dedicated  number sense , Professor Burr, from the School of Psychology said. Given the importance of the spontaneous perception of quantity, the scientists asked if it may be revealed by a primitive, automatic physiological response. The pupil light reflex is probably the most automatic physiological response: it constricts in light and dilates in darkness.  Recent research from our laboratory shows that pupil size is also regulated by cognitive and perceptual factors,  said senior author Professor Paola Binda from the University of Pisa.The present study took advantage of this discovery. To a group of adult participants, the researchers presented images with a variable number of dots (18 or 24), which were either isolated, or connected by lines (see Fig1). Connecting the dots into dumbbell shapes causes the dots to appear fewer (although they are the same number), a well-known illusion. The participants observed the patterns passively, without paying special attention to the number of objects in them, or any other attribute.Even though the number of pixels (black or white) were the same for all patterns, the diameter of participants  pupils varied according to the perceived number of dots; they were greatest when the perceived number was high, and least when it was low. This result shows that numerical information is intrinsically related to perception,  said Dr Elisa Castaldi from Florence University.  This could have important, practical implications. For example, this ability is compromised in dyscalculia which is a dysfunction in mathematical learning, so our experiment may be useful in early identification of this condition in very young children. It is very simple: subjects simply look at a screen without making any active response, and their pupillary response is measured remotely. Reference: Castaldi E, Pom  A, Cicchini GM, Burr D, Binda P.

It is estimated that there are over 250,000 people in England and Wales with ME/CFS, with about 2.4 times as many women affected as men.The guideline covers every aspect of ME/CFS in children, young people and adults from its identification and assessment before and after diagnosis to its management, monitoring and review.Peter Barry, Consultant Clinical Advisor for NICE and chair of the guideline committee, said: This guideline will provide clear support for people living with ME/CFS, their families and carers, and for clinicians. It recognises that ME/CFS is a complex, chronic medical condition that can have a significant effect on people's quality of life. We know that people with ME/CFS have had difficulty in getting their illness acknowledged, and the guideline provides guidance for suspecting and diagnosing the condition, recognising that there is no specific test for it. The guideline emphasises the importance of a personalised management plan for areas such as energy management - including the importance of rest and staying within the individual s energy limits - the treatment of specific symptoms, and guidance on managing flares and exacerbations. The guideline identifies the symptoms of ME/CFS as debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep or sleep disturbance, and cognitive difficulties ( brain fog ). It says that people with all 4 symptoms that have lasted 3 months or more should be directed to a ME/CFS specialist team (in the case of children this should be a paediatric specialist team) experienced and trained in the management of ME/CFS to confirm their diagnosis and develop a holistic personalised management plan in line with this guideline.People with ME/CFS should receive individually tailored support focused on personal agreed goals and a range of approaches should be used depending on the patient's preferences and priorities.And the guideline makes it clear that any programme based on fixed incremental increases in physical activity or exercise, for example graded exercise therapy (GET), should not be offered for the treatment of ME/CFS. Discussions with stakeholders highlighted that the term  GET  is understood in different ways and the guideline sets out clearly what is meant by the term.The importance of ensuring that people remain within their energy limits when undertaking activity of any kind is also highlighted. The guideline recommends that any physical activity or exercise programmes should only be considered for people with ME/CFS in specific circumstances and should begin by establishing the person s physical activity capability at a level that does not worsen their symptoms. It also says a physical activity or exercise programme should only be offered on the basis that it is delivered or overseen by a physiotherapist in an ME/CFS specialist team and is regularly reviewed.Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has sometimes been assumed to be a cure for ME/CFS, the guideline recommends it should only be offered to support people who live with ME/CFS to manage their symptoms, improve their functioning and reduce the distress associated with having a chronic illness.Read the new guidelines here: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng206 This article has been republished from the following materials.

Their technology can detect specific messenger RNA sequences in cells, and that detection then triggers production of a specific protein from a transgene, or artificial gene.Because transgenes can have negative and even dangerous effects when expressed in the wrong cells, the researchers wanted to find a way to reduce off-target effects from gene therapies. One way of distinguishing different types of cells is by reading the RNA sequences inside them, which differ from tissue to tissue.By finding a way to produce transgene only after  reading  specific RNA sequences inside cells, the researchers developed a technology that could fine-tune gene therapies in applications ranging from regenerative medicine to cancer treatment. For example, researchers could potentially create new therapies to destroy tumors by designing their system to identify cancer cells and produce a toxic protein just inside those cells, killing them in the process. This brings new control circuitry to the emerging field of RNA therapeutics, opening up the next generation of RNA therapeutics that could be designed to only turn on in a cell-specific or tissue-specific way,  says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering and the senior author of the study.This highly targeted approach, which is based on a genetic element used by viruses to control gene translation in host cells, could help to avoid some of the side effects of therapies that affect the entire body, the researchers say.Evan Zhao, a research fellow at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, and Angelo Mao, an MIT postdoc and technology fellow at the Wyss Institute, are the lead authors of the study, which appears today in Nature Biotechnology.

Sustaining one s attention is notoriously difficult. The longer that an individual performs a task, the worse their performance tends to be,  said Matthew Robison, UT Arlington assistant professor of psychology and first author of the study.  If you want to encourage people to maintain focus on a task, whether it be learning or job-related, or if you are designing something that you want people to engage with, giving feedback about their performance is a very powerful motivator. The study, titled  Examining the effects of goal-setting, feedback, and incentives on sustained attention,  was published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance.Across four experiments, researchers gave individuals a simple but attentionally demanding task and asked them to perform it for 30 minutes. They measured the effectiveness of goal-setting, feedback and incentive manipulations on participants  ability to sustain their attention. Participants provided commentary about their levels of motivation and alertness and disclosed the status of their attention as on-task, wandering or absent.In the first experiment, the researchers found that setting a specific goal improved sustained attention but produced no effect on task engagement (higher motivation and fewer task-unrelated thoughts).In the second experiment, they split the performance time into blocks and provided feedback at the end of each. The data offered convincing evidence that combining a specific goal with feedback improved attention and motivation. Additionally, on its own, feedback was an impressive regulator of task-unrelated thoughts.The study found little proof that incentives, such as a cash bonus or early release from the experiment, increased task engagement or performance compared to the effects of goals and/or feedback.In all experiments, the researchers witnessed a decline in performance over time, with participants reporting that they felt less motivation, more fatigue and increased mind wandering. Even in conditions when people report feeling motivated and engaged, it is difficult to maintain optimal performance, especially if the task is attentionally demanding,  Robison said.Leaders should be aware of the limitations of the human cognitive system to perform monotonous tasks over long periods of time, Robison said. Jobs such as lifeguarding, TSA screening or radar monitoring, where important events are rare but nonetheless require vigilance, may push an individual s attention beyond its limits. We need to be cognizant of the level of difficulty involved in sustaining attention when we ask others to perform tasks where they must be attentive for long periods of time,  Robison said.  It is possible that we put ourselves in harm s way by relying too much on the human attentional system to accomplish feats that may not be achievable. Reference: Robison MK, Unsworth N, Brewer GA.

These nanoparticles are leading to deterioration of the remains of the ship, which sank in battle in 1545 and was raised from the Solent in 1982. The Tudor ship and its collection of 10,000 artifacts are now housed in the Mary Rose museum in Portsmouth, UK.The new technique--computed tomography PDF (ctPDF)--used to examine the ship s remains was originally developed in a study co-authored  by Columbia Engineering/Brookhaven National Laboratory and ESRF members of the team to study catalysts and batteries. When approached by Serena Cussen, chair in functional nanomaterials at the University of Sheffield, Simon Billinge, a materials scientist at Columbia who helped develop the method for his studies using a synchrotron at Brookhaven, thought ctPDF might be a good way to see what was going on inside the remains of the ship. Billinge s group imaged how X-rays scattered through sample cross sections at the nanoscale and then precisely characterized the nature of the materials hidden deep in the Tudor wood. Comparing the resulting images pixel by pixel allowed them to determine that over centuries the wood had become riddled with nanoparticles of zinc sulfide.  It was especially exciting to get a glimpse into the history of the Mary Rose in the years since it sank,  said Billinge, who has a joint appointment at the U.S. Department of Energy s Brookhaven National Laboratory and is a co-author of the paper published today by Matter. The zinc sulphide deposits come from anaerobic bacteria living in the wood as it sat sunk in the seabed--they are essentially bacteria poop. Our results were like a microscale archeological dig where, by studying the location and composition of the deposits, we could see how the bacteria colonised the wood and what they ate. The team also found polymer deposits within the ship s wood. The polymer was sprayed on the ship to help preserve its remains after it was raised from the seabed 39 years ago, when it was thought that the polymer would lend mechanical stability. However, there is some recent evidence that this polymer can itself degrade and act as a source of degrading acids to the materials that surround it.The new X-ray technique now enables researchers to track the polymer within the ship s wood--a vital step in developing conservation strategies. The new method could inform future strategies to preserve the Mary Rose and other important archaeological discoveries. This is the first time that we have used the technique of X-ray total scattering with computed tomography to successfully study cultural heritage samples at the nanoscale. This work opens doors to new experiments in the domain of conservation,"" said Marco Di Michiel, scientist in charge of beamline ID15 at ESRF.Efforts are now underway to understand in detail the degradation effects these zinc-based particles may have had on the Mary Rose and how they might be neutralized.

There are several reasons for this. Hydrogen is currently produced mainly centrally from fossil raw materials. It then has to be compressed or liquefied in an expensive and energy-intensive process in order to be delivered to filling stations, for example. Expensive infrastructure with high investment costs is needed there to store large quantities of hydrogen.For a nationwide supply of hydrogen, decentralized production will therefore be indispensable in the future, and will ideally be climate-neutral from locally available renewable energy sources. In 2020, researchers at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) led by process engineer Viktor Hacker, together with the Graz-based start-up, Rouge H2 Engineering, presented a sustainable process for decentralized hydrogen production, the so-called ""chemical-looping hydrogen method"". The research results, which have won several awards, have resulted in a compact on-site on-demand plant that can produce hydrogen from biogas, biomass or natural gas.Now Hacker and his team are once again making people sit up and take notice.

Research led by Michael E. Wechsler, MD, MMSc, director of the National Jewish Health Cohen Family Asthma Institute, found that itepekimab was safe and effective in a phase 2 trial published online today in the New England Journal of Medicine.Asthma is a chronic lung condition characterized by airway narrowing and inflammation, as well as increased airways sensitivity to a variety of stimuli. In the United States, about 10% of the 30 million people with asthma suffer from severe asthma, in which the condition is poorly controlled even with the use of traditional therapies, like corticosteroids. Severe asthma is a big problem globally, and we are always looking for new strategies for patients who don t respond to currently available therapies,  said Dr. Wechsler.  We have targeted a new pathway that may potentially interrupt the inflammatory cascade and improve care in asthma patients. Currently, several monoclonal antibodies, such as dupilumab, mepolizumab and benralizumab, have been approved to target cytokine proteins like interleukin-4, interleukin-5 and interleukin-13, and these drugs are known to be effective in treating severe type 2 asthma. However, new targeted therapies are needed.Itepekimab is a novel monoclonal antibody designed to target interleukin-33. The international research team investigated the efficacy of itepekimab on its own and in combination with dupilumab in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 70 sites. Study participants were between the ages of 18 and 70 years old, suffered from moderate-to-severe asthma and received inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs).Subjects were divided into four groups that received either subcutaneous doses of itepekimab, dupilumab, a combination of both, or a placebo, every two weeks for 12 weeks. By the end, an event indicating a loss of asthma control occurred in 22% of the patients in the itepekimab group versus 41% of those in the placebo group, 27% of those in the combination group, and 19% of those in the dupilumab group. Itepekimab also significantly improved lung function. This study gives us insight into the pathophysiology of asthma and gives hope for a new therapeutic option for patients suffering from severe asthma,  said Dr. Wechsler.  We look forward to moving this research forward to help patients breathe as well as possible. We still need to ascertain which patients are most likely to respond to this novel therapy.

The findings, published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, provide a new strategy to refine breast cancer diagnosis that could help guide a more precise selection of tumor-specific treatments. About 80% of all breast cancers depend on the hormone estrogen to grow. The hormone promotes tumor growth by binding to the ER,  said corresponding author Dr. Matthew J. Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center and a McNair scholar at Baylor.Disrupting the estrogen-ER interaction is a key therapeutic approach. Drugs such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant target the ER this way, but tumor cells learn to evade this attack and become resistant to these drugs. One of the predominant ways ER+ breast cancer cells evade treatment is by creating mutant ERs that no longer can be recognized and targeted by ER-targeting cancer drugs,  said first author Xuxu Gou, a graduate student in the Ellis lab.The team has been studying ESR1 gene translocations, which refer to the ER gene swapping a part of its sequence with genetic information from another gene. ER gene translocations create chimeric ER proteins, meaning the protein contains only half of the ER protein and the other half comes from different protein. Some of the ER chimeras are extreme versions of mutant ERs because the drug-binding region, which is the same region estrogen binds to, is completely replaced with a region derived from another protein, to which neither the drug nor estrogen can bind. These ER chimeras trigger cancer activity in the absence of hormone. Not all ER translocations were active   some drive metastasis and resistance to treatment, but others do not,  Gou said.  To be able to determine whether any particular ESR1 translocation can promote disease progression, we developed a diagnostic genetic signature that detects the presence of an active ESR1 chimeric protein. With support from the National Cancer Institute s PDXnet program, the team used genomics and transcriptomics to annotate 20 mouse models of ER+ patient-derived tumors that demonstrated different degrees of dependence on estrogen for growth. In this data set, a 24-gene signature detected the presence of an active ESR1 fusion, but interestingly also common point mutations in ESR1. These findings were replicated in data from a human metastatic breast cancer cohort. The team therefore called their 24 gene signature the MOTERA score for  Mutant or Translocated Estrogen Receptor Alpha. The findings are significant in the area of precision medicine, as they can provide specific details about the tumor that could guide physicians in the selection of more effective treatments. In the future, a patient s cancer cells could be analyzed and, once the MOTERA score indicates the presence of an ER mutation or translocation, then the tumor cells would be further studied to more precisely determine what kind of ER mutant or translocation is present. This would help guide the selection of a personalized, optimal treatment,  said co-author, Dr. Charles E. Foulds, assistant professor at Baylor s Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center.Reference: Gou X, Anurag M, Lei JT, et al.

Since 2004, only two therapies have been approved for the treatment of MM, which affects about 3,000 people a year in the United States.Now a promising new therapy for mesothelioma and metastatic cancer, arising from laboratory investigations at the University of Vermont, is about to enter a Phase I clinical trial.Bringing scientific discovery to a clinical trial is challenging. According to Dr. Randall Holcombe, director of the University of Vermont Cancer Center,  It takes about 20 years from discovery to clinical trials, and even then, only about 1% of potential new agents achieve FDA approval. To be in that 1%, you need solid science and formidable funding. Dr. Brian Cunniff, a faculty member in UVM s Larner College of Medicine s Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Department, identified the new therapeutic approach as a Ph.D. student in partnership with his advisor, Emeriti Professor Dr. Nicholas Heintz, and UVM Alumni Dr. Kheng (Newick) Bekdache. They all knew the research was compelling. The approach, published in PLOS ONE,  targeted a universal vulnerability in cancer cells that could be exploited therapeutically.  All tumor cells are very reliant on efficient waste management systems to grow and survive; we were interfering with that,  said Dr. Cunniff.Ample funding soon followed this pioneering discovery. Dr. Cunniff was wrapping up his post-doctoral work at Harvard Medical School and making plans to leave academia when he received a phone call from Dr. Heintz that changed his life. The pharmaceutical company RS Oncology, Dr. Heintz said, wanted to fund a cure for MM and had selected their research as the vehicle to do that.Dr. Cunniff returned to the UVM Cancer Center to continue the work, targeting it to mesothelioma. RS Oncology committed substantial funding to UVM for the comprehensive pre-clinical package, helping the researchers surmount the huge financial hurdle for bringing scientific findings from the bench to the bedside. We were excited for the chance to recruit Brian back to our department and support his efforts with RS Oncology,  said Dr. Debra Leonard, chair of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.  Our department puts great value in the research conducted by our investigators and seeing that translate to patient treatments doesn t happen that often.

The ozone hole also affects the environmental chemical processes of the South Pole. This is demonstrated by an international research team coordinated by the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council (Cnr-Isp) and the Ca 'Foscari University of Venice which studied for the first time the consequences of ozone depletion on iodine trapped in Antarctic ice .The results of the study, in which researchers from the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI, Switzerland), Institute for Interdisciplinary Science (Icb-Conicet, Argentina), Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano (Csic, Spain), Korea Polar Research Institut ( South Korea), National Center for Atmospheric Research (United States) and University of Rome 3, are published in the journal Nature Communications . In Antarctica , where ice holds precious information about the past of our planet's atmosphere, researchers have extracted an ice core about 12 meters long near the Concordia international research station with the aim of chemically analyzing the evolution time of iodine over a period of about 200 years (from 1800 to 2012).  For the first time it was possible to observe and evaluate the effects of ultraviolet radiation on the concentration of this element in the snow,  explains Andrea Spolaor , CNR-Isp researcher and first author of the work. ""Iodine plays a fundamental role in polar atmospheric chemistry and in the planet's radiation balance, therefore studying how it is exchanged between snow and the atmosphere is also crucial in order to refine future climate and environmental projections."" To evaluate and interpret the trend of the iodine concentration in the ice core, the researchers employed a multidisciplinary approach which, in addition to chemical analyzes, included atmospheric and chemical-physical models. ""We found almost constant concentrations of iodine from 1800 to 1974, and then found a clear and significant reduction from 1975 to 2012. Our research shows that the reduction in the concentration of iodine and its consequent emission into the atmosphere in this last period of time , is attributable to the reduction in the concentration of stratospheric ozone, and therefore to the increase in UV radiation that reaches the surface of Antarctica  , continues Spolaor.  The implications of this discovery , adds Carlo Barbante , director of Cnr-Isp and professor at Ca 'Foscari  are manifold and have the potential to open new research horizons. In particular, we could apply the study of iodine in Antarctic ice cores to evaluate the presence of other stratospheric ozone depletion phenomena that occurred in the past , potentially up to 1.5 million years ago, thanks to the imminent start of the project. international Beyond Epic , coordinated by the CNR-Isp and which participates in Ca 'Foscari "". ""More than 40 years after the identification of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, these results are also relevant in light of present and future environmental and climatic challenges"", concludes Fran ois Burgay , co-author of the research and post-doc at the Paul Scherrer Institut.  With this work we show how the effects of man on the environment, even if suitably mitigated through the adoption of international protocols, continue for many decades and with consequences that are still largely unknown. For this reason, also in view of the upcoming COP26 in Glasgow , we need to act quickly to limit the long-term effects of ongoing climate change.

Much of the uncertainty swirls around responsibility and risk: How should scientists conduct infectious disease research now? Experts in a range of disciplines including political science, arms control, and biology have called for tighter regulation of the enterprise, with some calling for an end to certain areas like  gain of function  investigations altogether.Others, however, are asking lawmakers to consider a more nuanced and thoughtful approach. In a commentary published this week in mBio, a pair of researchers with decades of experience in high-containment laboratories argue that any approach to new regulation should draw on existing practices, past experiences, and careful consideration of both the human and financial costs. Most importantly, responsibility for the safety and security of running a lab should be entrusted not to government-level agents, but to the leaders of the research organization.  Near the bench rather than the Beltway!  they wrote in the commentary.  [Organizational leaders] should take responsibility for their own programs and people,  said Dave Franz, D.V.M. Ph.D, former commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Frederick, Maryland. Franz co-authored the new commentary with James Le Duc, Ph.D, former director of the Galveston National Laboratory, in Texas, which includes several biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. BSL-4 facilities investigate infectious agents that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease.  In the commentary, Franz and Le Duc noted that leaders of high-containment labs have a long history of safely managing potentially dangerous research projects at their organizations without catastrophic outcomes.  If you re running a good operation with education and training, and you re focusing on safety, transparency and ethics, I believe you can reduce accidents,  Franz said.  A lot of the people that think more regulation is the way ahead haven t run a high-containment lab,  Franz said. Regulating BSL-3 and -4 labs in the same way as nuclear labs, for example, doesn t work because of the dramatically different nature of the subject material. A lack of experience in biological labs, Franz said, could result in new rules that further burden the enterprise, rather than minimizing harm.  It s hard for government to be nuanced, but we need to think about the cost and benefit of regulations before we put them in place,  Franz said.  They often don t think about the cost in dollars, or in time, or the cost of chasing young people away from the profession.  But a leader within an organization, Franz said, can establish an environment of trust and respect.  If you re working in a healthy organization, the boss has an open door, and you trust your leadership, that can reduce harm.  The scientists noted that they re not against regulation and rules that reduce risk, but at the same time urge policymakers be careful in their consideration of additional unnecessary or ineffective regulatory burdens.  I hope we re thoughtful going forward,  Franz said. ReferenceFranz DR, Le Duc JW.

It was exciting to see this agent bound in the structure of a drug-resistant ribosome, and it was quite surprising that the drug binds in the same exact way as to the regular ribosome but causes significant structural re-arrangements that has never been observed before or could be predicted from the existing data,  said study co-corresponding author Yury Polikanov, UIC associate professor of biological sciences at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the College of Pharmacy.In previous research, Polikanov developed a unique approach for visualizing ribosomes that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Through this process, he and Alexander Mankin, UIC professor of pharmaceutical sciences, reported in a January Nature Chemical Biology paper that methylation   a process of changing the chemical make-up of a nucleotide in the ribosomal drug binding site   results in the inability of such ribosomes to bind some clinically important antibiotics rendering such ribosomes drug-resistant.To understand how and why iboxamycin manages to overcome resistance, Polikanov and UIC graduate student Egor Syroegin, study co-first author, applied their unique visualization techniques. The UIC researchers co-crystallized bacterial ribosomes with the drug and froze the crystals. Then, they used a powerful X-ray at the Advanced Photon Source facility at Argonne National Laboratory to determine the molecule s diffraction pattern   the places where the radiation bounced off the atoms in the crystals. This pattern was used to calculate electron density maps of the ribosome-drug complex and visualize their interactions. The whole process of atomic structure determination using X-rays is like a 3D puzzle,  Polikanov said.  We identified the open place in the ribosome puzzle, and we just needed to find the drug piece that fit. Once we did that, we could see where and how the drug was bound to the ribosome. When the UIC researchers looked at their visualization of the Harvard drug interacting with the drug-resistant ribosome, they found something unexpected. We noticed that the most common resistance mechanism via methylation of the ribosome does not work against this new drug because it still binds to the methylated ribosome and evades this type of resistance. We ve also noticed that iboxamycin actually caused the methylated nucleotide at the heart of the ribosome and right at the drug binding site to move out of the drug s way so that both the drug and the methylated nucleotide in the drug-resistant ribosome can co-exist   this was totally unexpected and unprecedented,  Polikanov said. This shows us Mother Nature is much smarter than we are. There is certainly a place for rational drug design, but we can t forget the importance of simple trial and error,  he said.  Neither iboxamycin s spectrum of activity, nor its potency in resistant strains, could have been predicted from prior knowledge. Reference: Mitcheltree MJ, Pisipati A, Syroegin EA, et al.

A collaboration led by scientists at Scripps Research in Florida has successfully treated the genetic disease in mice, with a potential drug molecule engineered in the lab of chemist Matthew Disney, PhD. The compound works in a new way, by directing the cell s own immune machinery to degrade and eliminate the disease-causing RNA.The team s study is published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Collaborators include Leonard Petrucelli, PhD, of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, and Jeffrey Rothstein, MD, PhD, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.Also known as Lou Gehrig s disease, ALS causes progressive loss of motor neurons, the elongated nerve cells that connect muscles to the central nervous system. As motor neurons die, paralysis, muscle loss, swallowing and eventually, breathing difficulties develop, leading ultimately to death. Scientists are learning that ALS has multiple causes, some of them sporadic, and some inherited or familial.Frontotemporal dementia similarly has both familial and sporadic causes. It involves progressive damage to neurons in the brain s frontal and temporal lobes. Symptoms may include difficulty walking or odd behavioral and emotional states.

Findings from a new University of Maine-led study, however, suggests otherwise; that human activity on the islands predates European arrival by centuries. Kit Hamley, National Science Foundation graduate research fellow with the UMaine Climate Change Institute, spearheaded the first-ever scientific investigation into prehistoric human presence on the Southern Atlantic archipelago. She and her team collected animal bones, charcoal records and other evidence from across the islands over multiple expeditions and examined them for indications of human activity using radiocarbon dating and other laboratory techniques. One notable sign of pre-European human activity derived from a 8,000-year-old charcoal record collected from a column of peat on New Island, located in the southwestern edge of the territory. According to researchers, the record showed signs of a marked increase in fire activity in 150 C.E., then abrupt and significant spikes in 1410 C.E., and 1770 C.E., the latter of which corresponds with initial European settlement. Researchers also gathered sea lion and penguin samples on New Island near the site where a landowner discovered a stone projectile point that is consistent with the technology Indigenous South Americans have used for the past 1,000 years. The bones were heaped in discrete piles at one site. Hamley says the location, volume and type of bones indicated that the mounds were likely assembled by humans. Most of the evidence Hamley and her colleagues collected indicated that Indigenous South Americans likely travelled to the Falkland Islands between 1275 C.E. and 1420 C.E. Arrival dates prior to 1275 C.E., however, cannot be ruled out because some evidence dates back even earlier, according to researchers. For example, the team found a tooth from an extinct Falkland Islands fox called the warrah with a radiocarbon date of 3450 B.C.E., the oldest for the species. Regardless, all of the team s findings indicate that people landed in the archipelago before British navigator John Strong in 1690, the first European to set foot on the archipelago. Indigenous people likely visited the islands for multiple short-term stays, as opposed to long-term occupation, according to the UMaine researchers. As a result, they left few cultural materials there, but enough for Hamley and her colleagues to find a discernible anthropogenic and paleoecological footprint and conduct their study.  These findings broaden our understanding of Indigenous movement and activity in the remote and harsh South Atlantic Ocean,  says Hamley, a UMaine Ph.D. student of ecology and environmental sciences.  This is really exciting because it opens up new doors for collaborating with descendant Indigenous communities to increase our understanding of past ecological changes throughout the region. People have long speculated that it was likely that Indigenous South Americans had reached the Falkland Islands, so it is really rewarding to get to play a role in helping bring that part of the past to life of the islands. UMaine researchers who participated in the study with Hamley include her adviser, Jacquelyn Gill, an associate professor of paleoecology and plant ecology; Daniel Sandweiss, a professor of anthropology; and Brenda Hall, a professor of glacial geology. Other investigators involved in the research include Dulcinea Groff, a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Wyoming and former UMaine Ph.D. student; Kathryn Krasinski, an assistant professor of anthropology at Adelphi University; John Southon; a researcher with the Department of Earth System Science at the University of California-Irvine; Paul Brickle, executive director of the South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute; and Thomas Lowell, a geology professor with the University of Cincinnati. Science Advances, a journal from the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences (AAAS), published a report of their findings. Hamley s most recent study builds on her research into the warrah (Dusicyon australis), an extinct species of fox. The warrah was the only native and terrestrial mammal to reside on the Falkland Islands at the time of European arrival. Subsequent hunting wiped the species out in 1856, making it the first extinct canid in the historic record, Hamley says. For years, various scholars, including Charles Darwin, have debated the warrah s origins and how it came to the islands. Hamley hypothesizes that humans may have introduced the species to the archipelago prior to European settlement. Many previously rejected the theory based on a prior lack of scientific evidence, but the latest findings from Hamley s team reopens that possibility, she says. Indigenous South Americans may have domesticated warrah as they have with other foxes and canids, and brought them to the islands during their voyages and short-term stays. During a 2018 expedition to the islands, Hamely and her colleagues found three warrah bone samples at Spring Point Farm in West Falkland. Carbon dating and isotopic analysis revealed the warrah whose bones were analyzed  had a marine-based diet consisting primarily of apex marine predators  like sea lions and fur seals, a similar diet to seafaring Indigenious South Americans in prehistoric times, according to researchers. While these findings could reflect coastal scavenging, it may exemplify the food their potential human counterparts were procuring and eating, researchers say.  This study has the potential to change the trajectory of future ecological research in The Falklands,  says Hamley.  The introduction of a top predator, like the warrah, could have had profound implications for the biodiversity of the islands, which are home to ground nesting seabirds such as penguins, albatross and cormorants. It also changes the ever-captivating story of past human-canine relationships. We know that Indigenous South Americans domesticated foxes, but this study helps show how potentially important these animals were to those communities extending back thousands of years.  Hamley conducted her research during three expeditions to the Falkland Islands in 2014, 2016 and 2018. During the 2016 journey, she participated in UMaine s Follow a Researcher program, through which scientists give K 12 students a glimpse of their work through live expedition updates, Twitter chats and videos. The study led by Hamley contributes to the growing body of scientific investigations into the ecological, anthropological and climate history of the Falklands Islands conducted by UMaine researchers. A 2020 UMaine-led study discovered that the establishment of seabird colonies on the islands in response to an abrupt regional cooling period 5,000 years ago changed its ecosystems.  As the world warms, we hope our growing understanding of the pre-colonial history of the Falklands will help decision-makers balance the needs of wildlife and people, who rely on ecotourism, fisheries and other industries,  says Gill, an NSF CAREER researcher who was named a 2020 Friend of the Planet by the National Center for Science Education.  We re only just beginning to piece together the role people played in the Falklands before European settlement. Because of centuries of colonialism on the mainland, a lot of the oral knowledge about this period was lost. Western science needs updating, and we hope future work will be done in collaboration with the modern-day Indigenous people in the region; their ancestors were the first experts here.

After accumulating in response to stressful events, the Xbp1 protein appears to suppress the cell cycle, the study suggests.The findings, published in the Journal of Cell Biology, appear to solve one long-standing mystery of the cell cycle. If scientists can identify a protein in mammals with a similar function, the research might eventually lead to new ways to accelerate wound healing by encouraging cell division or improve cancer treatment by doing the opposite. Scientists have been studying this fundamental process for nearly seven decades,  said Orlando Arg ello-Miranda, Ph.D., an Instructor who co-led the study with Assistant Professor Jungsik Noh, Ph.D., both of UTSW s Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics.  We ve essentially identified a protein that can stop the cell cycle in response to stressful conditions. Scientists have long known that the cell cycle consists of several defined stages as a cell goes from a resting state to increasing in size as it copies its genetic material   or DNA   in a process known as DNA replication, condenses its DNA, and finally divides into two  daughter  cells.It has long been known that a stressful event such as starvation can send a cell into a protective state known as quiescence. Typically, the cell cycle halts just before DNA replication takes place, Dr. Arg ello-Miranda explained. However, a minority of cells seem to become quiescent at other points in the process.To understand why, Dr. Arg ello-Miranda, Dr. Noh, and their colleagues studied yeast cells challenged by nutritional stress. The researchers were able to study individual cells in that state by using a technique called microfluidics six-color imaging developed at UT Southwestern. That technique combines a technology for cell culture called microfluidics with a six-color fluorescent-microscopy approach pioneered at UTSW in 2018. In microfluidics six-color-imaging, investigators pass cells through a tiny, fluid-filled chamber monitored with a specialized microscope and camera array. The researchers also used machine learning to track and detect up to six biochemical reactions in single cells in real time. In previous studies in the field, researchers cultured yeast cells in flasks and were unable to track single cells,  Dr. Arg ello-Miranda said.  In contrast, we have obtained movies that record how individual cells stop dividing and enter quiescence. Although most of the starved cells entered quiescence at the expected stage, right before DNA replication, about 7% paused at another stage of the cell cycle, he said.Using the new techniques to tag and follow specific proteins in individual cells over time, the researchers found that all the starved cells showed elevated levels of a suite of stress response proteins. However, cells that became quiescent at unexpected points in the cell cycle all had an abundance of Xbp1, which the study found is needed to stop the cell cycle after DNA replication.Further experiments showed that this accumulation of Xbp1 caused the cell cycle to pause, even when the activity of another protein called Cdk1 that encourages cell proliferation is high. A closer look showed that Xbp1 levels weren t static   rather, they climbed higher after each stressful event an individual cell experienced or the longer a stressful event lasted. This accumulation was so predictable we could tell how many stressful events a cell had been exposed to by how much Xbp1 was present in the cell nucleus,  Dr. Arg ello-Miranda said. The findings suggest that Xbp1 has a newly discovered function in regulating the cell cycle, allowing yeast cells to  remember  exposure to stress and to protect themselves by entering quiescence, he added.Although there is no direct homolog to Xbp1 in mammals, other proteins seem to show similar biochemical activity in mammalian cells. Those proteins will be the subject of future research, he said.Reference: Arg ello-Miranda O, Marchand AJ, Kennedy T, Russo MAX, Noh J.

However, scientists have detected these highly stable  forever chemicals  throughout the environment, prompting toxicity concerns. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Environmental Science & Technology have characterized PFAS in contemporary and historical organic waste products applied to agricultural fields in France, finding the highest amounts in urban samples, with compounds changing over time.Although production of the most concerning PFAS has been banned or voluntarily phased out in many countries, the compounds linger in the environment. Also, they have been replaced with other PFAS that have uncertain environmental and health effects. Humans and livestock could ingest PFAS and excrete them in their waste, and the compounds could leach into wastewater. In addition, when wastes are applied to agriculture fields as fertilizer, PFAS could contaminate groundwater and bio-accumulate in food crops. S bastien Sauv  with colleagues from France s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment wanted to comprehensively characterize multiple classes of PFAS in contemporary and historical organic waste products   including livestock manures, urban sewage sludges and composts, and industrial wastes   applied to French agricultural lands. The researchers selected 47 samples of organic waste products intended for field application, collected in France from 1976 to 2018. They analyzed the samples for known and previously uncharacterized PFAS by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Over 90% of the samples contained at least one PFAS, with up to 113 compounds detected in a single sample. The team detected fewer and lower levels of PFAS in livestock manures than in wastes of urban origin. In the urban wastes, they detected high levels of PFAS compounds that are not commonly monitored, suggesting that previous studies underestimated total PFAS levels. Historical urban samples contained higher levels of phased-out PFAS, whereas contemporary samples were dominated by compounds called fluorotelomers, which could degrade to more persistent PFAS in the environment, the researchers say.ReferenceMunoz G, Michaud AM, Liu M, et al.

No such reduction was seen in adults with a history of physical abuse, nor in those who did not develop PTSD. The team, which was led by MUSC neuroscientist Jane Joseph, Ph.D., also showed that connectivity in the VAN-DAN systems increased after treatment with oxytocin, a hormone associated with social affiliations and the stress response. The team s findings are published in Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging. We believe that these findings contribute to the field by helping us to understand better how the connection between the brain's attention systems may be involved in whether PTSD develops after childhood trauma,  explained Kathleen Crum, Ph.D., lead author of the article. Crum, who was at MUSC at the time of the study, has since transitioned to a faculty position in the Department of Psychiatry at the Indiana University School of Medicine.Abuse during childhood is a major risk factor for PTSD. Indeed, children who experience any form of abuse are 70% more likely to develop PTSD. Sexual abuse during childhood disrupts brain development and is theorized to be associated with betrayal trauma, which occurs when a person s trust in an institution or loved one is violated by abuse.   Current psychology literature suggests the possibility of something known as betrayal trauma,  Crum explained.  People perceive events differently depending on the form of abuse.  For example, study participants with a history of sexual abuse had reduced VAN-DAN connectivity, regardless of whether they went on to develop PTSD, whereas those with a history of physical abuse did not. VAN and DAN each play a unique role in the regulation of attention, according to Crum. DAN is a network in the brain that is responsible for voluntary attention, while VAN is the process of shifting or reorienting our attention to another event,  said Crum.  They act as a push-pull mechanism; while one action occurs, the other cannot.  Joseph and Crum wanted to study the VAN-DAN network because patients with PTSD often find it difficult to reorient their attention. Individuals with PTSD have difficulty disengaging attention from threat-related cues, including cues that remind them of their traumatic experiences,  explained Crum.  Individuals with PTSD may also tend to interpret neutral cues as threat-related. Collectively, these problems affect their ability to direct their attention to the task at hand in their everyday lives. It is thought that the  fight or flight  response may be hyperactive in these individuals, which may account for this difficulty with shifting their attention. Crum provided an example to illustrate why it can be difficult for people with PTSD to concentrate on a specific task when their perception of external threat is heightened.   Imagine a scenario where you are parachuting or skydiving and someone asks you to do a complex math problem   how well would you do on that math problem?  asked Crum.  The focus on survival and staying out of danger can compete with performing everyday tasks, like holding a conversation or doing our work. The team wanted to measure VAN-DAN connectivity at rest because it enabled them to compare differences in connectivity without the demands of a specific task. To measure resting-state connectivity, the team placed participants in an MRI scanner and asked them to focus on a cross on a screen, allowing their attention systems to remain at rest. Participants with PTSD or a history of sexual abuse showed decreased resting-state functional connectivity between the VAN and DAN regions, suggesting decreased connectivity between the two. The effect of the hormone oxytocin was also explored in relation to decreased connectivity. Oxytocin is thought to act on the attention network system and is being studied nationally as a potential treatment for PTSD and childhood trauma, including at MUSC.  Oxytocin is very important for social bonding and stress reduction,  explained Joseph.  While PTSD does not always originate from social and personal trauma, oxytocin seems to be beneficial in stressful situations, which is why it is being explored as a treatment for this disorder.  Crum believes the next step for the field would be to examine how trauma exposure itself affects attention network connectivity.  Existing research suggests that trauma exposure is associated with changes in the brain and its functions, regardless of a PTSD diagnosis,  stated Crum. Future work should analyze the differences between trauma exposure and traumatic stress in groups exposed to trauma who did and did not develop PTSD, as well as a third group who did not experience any trauma whatsoever.

White fat cells are essentially inert containers for energy stored in the form of a single large, oily droplet. Brown fat cells are more complex, containing multiple, smaller droplets intermixed with dark-colored mitochondria   cellular organelles that give them their color and are the  engines  that convert the lipid droplets into heat and energy.Some people also have  beige  fat cells, brown-like cells residing within white fat that can be activated to burn energy.In recent years, there has been much effort to find ways to increase brown or beige fat cell activity, to induce fat cells, known as adipocytes, to burn energy and generate heat in a process called thermogenesis as a means to treat obesity, type 2 diabetes and other conditions.But the therapeutic potential of brown fat   and perhaps beige fat cells  has been stymied by the complexity of the processes involved. It wasn t until 2009 that the existence of active brown fat cells in healthy adults was confirmed; previously it was believed they were common only in newborns.In a new study, published online October 27, 2021 in Nature, an international team of researchers led by senior author Alan Saltiel, PhD, director of the Institute for Diabetes and Metabolic Health at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, describe how energy expenditure and heat production are regulated in obesity through a previously unknown cellular pathway.The human body breaks down consumed carbohydrates into a type of sugar called glucose, which is the main source of fuel for cells. Unneeded glucose is packaged and stored as glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle cells, where it can be extracted and quickly used for sudden energy needs or to maintain blood sugar levels. Unlike in muscle and liver, the role of glycogen in fat has been a mystery. The researchers discovered that glycogen does much more than simply store energy in fat cells. It provides a signal that produces a major shift in how energy is handled.In this  surprise discovery,  Saltiel and colleagues report that the browning of fat cells depends on their ability to both make and then degrade glycogen. The turnover of glycogen sends a signal that it is safe for the cell to  uncouple  the production of ATP, the molecule that provides the energy that fuels most cellular processes.  Uncoupling is a way to generate heat, and in the process help balance energy. This pathway thus ensures that only the fat cells with enough energy stores to fuel the generation of heat are allowed to do so,  said Saltiel.The dramatic increase in worldwide obesity   650 million people or 13 percent, a tripling since 1975   has underscored the importance of understanding how the human body balances energy intake and expenditure. Glycogen regulates and promotes fat metabolism: the higher the levels, the more robust the metabolic processes, essentially burning fat quicker with resulting weight loss in obese mice. In humans, the genes involved in these complex processes were found to be lower in patients who were obese or prone to weight gain, suggesting that the glycogen pathway is needed in fat cells to burn off excess weight. The new findings, wrote the authors, suggest that modulating glycogen metabolism in fat cells might provide new approaches for weight loss and overall improvement in metabolic health.

The man s seated, upside-down skeleton was painted bright red, as was the gold mask covering his detached skull. Now, researchers reporting in ACS  Journal of Proteome Research have analyzed the paint, finding that, in addition to a red pigment, it contains human blood and bird egg proteins.The Sic n was a prominent culture that existed from the ninth to 14th centuries along the northern coast of modern Peru. During the Middle Sic n Period (about 900 1,100 A.D.), metallurgists produced a dazzling array of gold objects, many of which were buried in tombs of the elite class. In the early 1990s, a team of archaeologists and conservators led by Izumi Shimada excavated a tomb where an elite man s seated skeleton was painted red and placed upside down at the center of the chamber. The skeletons of two young women were arranged nearby in birthing and midwifing poses, and two crouching children s skeletons were placed at a higher level. Among the many gold artifacts found in the tomb was a red-painted gold mask, which covered the face of the man s detached skull. At the time, scientists identified the red pigment in the paint as cinnabar, but Luciana de Costa Carvalho, James McCullagh and colleagues wondered what the Sic n people had used in the paint mix as a binding material, which had kept the paint layer attached to the metal surface of the mask for 1,000 years. To find out, the researchers analyzed a small sample of the mask s red paint. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy revealed that the sample contained proteins, so the team conducted a proteomic analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. They identified six proteins from human blood in the red paint, including serum albumin and immunoglobulin G (a type of human serum antibody). Other proteins, such as ovalbumin, came from egg whites. Because the proteins were highly degraded, the researchers couldn t identify the exact species of bird s egg used to make the paint, but a likely candidate is the Muscovy duck. The identification of human blood proteins supports the hypothesis that the arrangement of the skeletons was related to a desired  rebirth  of the deceased Sic n leader, with the blood-containing paint that coated the man s skeleton and face mask potentially symbolizing his  life force,  the researchers say.ReferencePires E, Carvalho L da C, Shimada I, McCullagh J.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/mathematical-model-optimizes-vaccine-development-355225,Mathematical Model Optimizes Vaccine Development Researchers have used a mathematical model to better understand the immune response to vaccines  which could help improve vaccine design and simplify the associated technical challenges  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. When it comes to the design of a novel vaccine against viral infection, vaccine developers have to make several major decisions. One of them is the choice of what type of immune response they wish to induce.In a recent Forum article in Trends in Immunology a group of researchers at UPF and the Marchuk Institute of Numerical Mathematics in Moscow, Russia, led by Andreas Meyerhans and Gennady Bocharov, provides a theoretical paper that might help with this issue. The researchers have used a mathematical model to better understand the immune response to vaccines. This could help improve vaccine design and simplify the associated technical challenges.Viruses are intracellular parasites that need host cells to multiply. Thus, for a virus to infect a human, it has to get access to some of the body's cells that will enable viruses to multiply. Progeny viruses will be assembled within the infected cells and, upon release, will infect other target cells in the surroundings. Without any immune response to counteract the virus, it will continue to spread and may cause organ damage.Vaccines are the most cost-effective way to provide a host with virus-specific immunity that will then help it to keep an infectious virus below pathogenic levels. To do so, vaccines may induce antibodies that help to neutralize assembled free viruses and virus-specific cytotoxic T cells that will kill infected cells and thus reduce the number of virus-producing cells.While both arms of the immune response are considered of major importance for vaccine efficacy, the question is how do they cooperate? Are their actions simply additive or more than additive? The researchers have now addressed these fundamental questions by examining the contribution of antibodies and cytotoxic T cells using a model based on virus infection dynamics. They show that these two primary control factors of virus infection are cooperating multiplicatively rather than additively. While this relationship might appear rather abstract, it has very practical consequences for vaccine development.For example, f to be efficient a virus vaccine needs to increase the basic immune response by a factor of 10,000, this may be achieved in two ways. Either antibodies or cytotoxic T cells are increased by a factor of 10,000 or each of these responses is increased by only a factor of 100. The latter might be easier to obtain in practical terms and thus provide vaccine developers with different options for their design.Although these considerations are based only on theoretical grounds and require experimental validation, the first data in this direction are emerging.  We hope that our conceptional work will positively help with vaccine design , says Bocharov. And Meyerhans, the last author of the study, adds that  our considerations may help to simplify the technical challenges for novel vaccines and thus be of some practical use for healthcare .Reference: Bocharov G, Grebennikov D, Argilaguet J, Meyerhans A.

This is the first time ancient DNA has been used to confirm a familial relationship between living and historical individuals.The confirmation was made possible using a new method to analyse family lineages using ancient DNA fragments, developed by a team of scientists led by Professor Eske Willerslev, Fellow of St John's, University of Cambridge, and Director of the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre. The results are published today in the journal Science Advances.The technique searches for  autosomal DNA  in the genetic fragments extracted from a body sample. Since we inherit half of our autosomal DNA from our father and half from our mother, this means genetic matches can be checked irrespective of whether an ancestor is on the father or mother s side of the family.Autosomal DNA from Lakota Sioux leader Sitting Bull s scalp lock was compared to DNA samples from Ernie Lapointe and other Lakota Sioux. The resulting match confirms that Lapointe is Sitting Bull s great-grandson, and his closest living descendant. Autosomal DNA is our non-gender-specific DNA. We managed to locate sufficient amounts of autosomal DNA in Sitting Bull s hair sample, and compare it to the DNA sample from Ernie Lapointe and other Lakota Sioux   and were delighted to find that it matched,  said Professor Eske Willerslev in the University of Cambridge s Department of Zoology and Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre, senior author of the report.Lapointe said:  Over the years, many people have tried to question the relationship that I and my sisters have to Sitting Bull. Lapointe believes that Sitting Bull s bones currently lie at a site in Mobridge, South Dakota, in a place that has no significant connection to Sitting Bull and the culture he represented. He also has concerns about the care of the gravesite. There are two official burial sites for Sitting Bull - at Fort Yates, North Dakota and Mobridge - and both receive visitors.With DNA evidence to back up his claim of a bloodline, Lapointe now hopes to rebury the great Native American leader s bones in a more appropriate location.The new technique can be used when very limited genetic data are available, as was the case in this study. The work paves the way for similar DNA testing of the relationship between many other long-dead historical figures and their possible living descendants.The technique could also be used to answer important questions based on old human DNA that might previously have been considered too degraded to analyse   for example in forensic investigations. In principle, you could investigate whoever you want   from outlaws like Jesse James to the Russian tsar s family, the Romanovs. If there is access to old DNA   typically extracted from bones, hair or teeth, they can be examined in the same way,  said Willerslev.It took the scientists 14 years to find a way of extracting useable DNA from the 5-6cm piece of Sitting Bull s hair. The hair was extremely degraded, having been stored for over a century at room temperature in Washington s Smithsonian Museum before it was returned to Lapointe and his sisters in 2007.The technique differs from traditional approaches to DNA analysis, which look for a genetic match between specific DNA in the Y chromosome passed down the male line, or, if the long-dead person was female, specific DNA in the mitochondria passed from a mother to her offspring. Neither are particularly reliable, and in this case neither could be used as Lapointe claimed to be related to Sitting Bull on his mother s side.Tatanka-Iyotanka, better known as the Native American leader and military leader Sitting Bull (1831-1890), led 1,500 Lakota warriors at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876 and wiped out US General Custer and five companies of soldiers. The blood-soaked feat - also known as  the Battle of the Greasy Grass  - will forever symbolise the resistance of Native Americans to the white man s insatiable appetite for empire-building. Sitting Bull was assassinated in 1890 by the  Indian Police , acting on behalf of the US government. Sitting Bull has always been my hero, ever since I was a boy. I admire his courage and his drive. That s why I almost choked on my coffee when I read in a magazine in 2007 that the Smithsonian Museum had decided to return Sitting Bull s hair to Ernie Lapointe and his three sisters, in accordance with new US legislation on the repatriation of museum objects,  said Willerslev.He added:  I wrote to Lapointe and explained that I specialised in the analysis of ancient DNA, and that I was an admirer of Sitting Bull, and I would consider it a great honour if I could be allowed to compare the DNA of Ernie and his sisters with the DNA of the Native American leader s hair when it was returned to them. Until this study, the familial relationship between LaPointe and Sitting Bull was based on birth and death certificates, a family tree, and a review of historical records. This new genetic analysis provides an additional line of evidence to strengthen his claim.Before the remains from the Mobridge burial site can be reburied elsewhere, they will have to be analysed in a similar way to the hair sample to ensure a genetic match to Sitting Bull. Under US law, Lapointe owns the legal rights to Sitting Bull s genetic data so can decide who should do the analysis.Reference: Moltke I, Korneliussen TS, Seguin-Orlando A, et al.

We only know their average behaviour as an entire population. With our laser-based technology, single viruses could be studied individually. As well as diagnosing diseases, our device could be used to spot the outliers   the rare individual virus that has the potential to evolve and create the next wave of an epidemic, for instance. This brings us into an era where we can contemplate precision diagnostics at the single virus level. The researchers tested their device known as a digital virus manipulation chip on adenoviruses, which is a group of common viruses that can cause cold-like symptoms, measuring 90 to 100 nanometre (nm) in diameter. Although not yet tested on coronaviruses, it has the potential to be used for research on SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, as it is similar in size, between 80 to 120 nm in diameter.Professor Liu Aiqun, from NTU s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, who led the research, said:  Our invention uses light to manipulate viruses in a certain size range and we have proven that it works with adenoviruses. We believe our device could also be used to trap and concentrate SARS-CoV-2 for research and diagnosis. The findings of the study were published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal ACS Sensors in September.Researchers from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), University of Technology Sydney and the Australian National University, were also involved in the study.

In many instances, the tiny hairs in the inner ear s cochlea that allow the brain to recognize electrical pulses as sound are damaged. As a step toward an advanced artificial cochlea, researchers in ACS Nano report a conductive membrane, which translated sound waves into matching electrical signals when implanted inside a model ear, without requiring external power. When the hair cells inside the inner ear stop working, there s no way to reverse the damage. Currently, treatment is limited to hearing aids or cochlear implants. But these devices require external power sources and can have difficulty amplifying speech correctly so that it s understood by the user. One possible solution is to simulate healthy cochlear hairs, converting noise into the electrical signals processed by the brain as recognizable sounds. To accomplish this, previous researchers have tried self-powered piezoelectric materials, which become charged when they re compressed by the pressure that accompanies sound waves, and triboelectric materials, which produce friction and static electricity when moved by these waves. However, the devices aren t easy to make and don t produce enough signal across the frequencies involved in human speech. So, Yunming Wang and colleagues wanted a simple way to fabricate a material that used both compression and friction for an acoustic sensing device with high efficiency and sensitivity across a broad range of audio frequencies.To create a piezo-triboelectric material, the researchers mixed barium titanate nanoparticles coated with silicon dioxide into a conductive polymer, which they dried into a thin, flexible film. Next, they removed the silicon dioxide shells with an alkaline solution. This step left behind a sponge-like membrane with spaces around the nanoparticles, allowing them to jostle around when hit by sound waves. In tests, the researchers showed that contact between the nanoparticles and polymer increased the membrane s electrical output by 55% compared to the pristine polymer. When they sandwiched the membrane between two thin metal grids, the acoustic sensing device produced a maximum electrical signal at 170 hertz, a frequency within the range of most adult s voices. Finally, the researchers implanted the device inside a model ear and played a music file. They recorded the electrical output and converted it into a new audio file, which displayed a strong similarity to the original version. The researchers say their self-powered device is sensitive to the wide acoustic range needed to hear most sounds and voices.Reference: Zheng J, Yu Z, Wang Y, Fu Y, Chen D, Zhou H.

The gut  microbiome all the micro-organisms that live in the human gut is known to be altered in SLE patients. Now, a research team at Osaka University has comprehensively profiled the associations between the gut microbiome and SLE.Healthy human intestines contain billions of micro-organisms that are essential for the normal functioning of the gut. They protect against pathogens, assist in the metabolism of food, and are also able to affect the immune response. Various diseases have been linked to disturbances of the gut bacteria leading to imbalance, or  dysbiosis,  including autoimmune conditions.The team isolated DNA from the intestinal microbiome using fecal samples, and then used a next-generation sequencing machine to carry out metagenome shotgun sequencing. This is a technique that allows the sequencing of all genes present in a complex sample by fragmenting all the genomes, sequencing the short fragments, and then reassembling the sequences. By collecting samples from both SLE patients and healthy comparisons, they could comprehensively assess the relationship between the gut microbiome and SLE.  We were able to show distinct changes to the gut microbiome in SLE patients,  says lead author Yoshihiko Tomofuji,  as we found that two species of Streptococcus bacteria, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus intermedius, were significantly increased in the gut microbiome of patients with SLE. The gut microbiome can affect the wider functions of the body by altering the population of small molecules, or metabolites, circulating in the liquid part of the blood, called the plasma. The team therefore went on to integrate the gut microbiome data with data on the entire population of plasma metabolites, known as the plasma metabolome. Our analysis revealed interactions between the microbiome and the host that were mediated by the metabolome,  explains senior author Yukinori Okada.  A particular molecule known as acylcarnitine had a positive correlation with the SLE-associated bacterium. Acylcarnitine is known to induce inflammation and could therefore potentially act as a trigger for the overactivation of the immune system seen in SLE.This research reveals for the first time the specific microbial landscape of SLE patients, contributing to our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and SLE and providing useful resources for future research.Reference: Tomofuji Y, Maeda Y, Oguro-Igashira E, et al.

This compound is subsequently released into the digestive tract through chemical reactions with the fish s digestive fluids. That s the key finding of a study carried out jointly by scientists from EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Peking University in Beijing, and Oklahoma State University, and appearing in Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts. Our study shows that microplastics are an additional vector for exposing fish to micropollutants like progesterone, a steroid hormone that can be found in the environment,  says Florian Breider, the head of EPFL s Central Environmental Laboratory and a co-author of the study.  These microplastics act like sponges and serve as a vector   they readily absorb hydrophobic micropollutants in water, since the pollutants  molecules would rather attach to the plastic,  says Breider.  Once inside a fish, the molecules are released into its digestive tract as a result of the physical and chemical properties of the digestive fluids. Today, nobody knows whether the micropollutants subsequently pass through the intestinal walls and spread to the rest of the fish. ","Published: October 28, 2021"

The computer modelling tool will predict novel sites of binding for potential drugs that are more selective, leading to more effective drug targeting, increasing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects.  The data tool or protocol will uncover a novel class of compounds   allosteric drugs in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).   GPCRs are the largest membrane protein family that transduce a signal inside cells from hormones, neurotransmitters, and other endogenous molecules. As a result of their broad influence on human physiology, GPCRs are drug targets in many therapeutic areas such as inflammation, infertility, metabolic and neurological disorders, viral infections and cancer. Currently over a third of drugs act via GPCRs. Despite the substantial therapeutic success, the discovery of GPCR drugs is challenging due to promiscuous binding and subsequent side effects.  Recent studies point to the existence of other binding sites, called allosteric sites that drugs can bind to and provide several therapeutic benefits. However, the discovery of allosteric sites and drugs has been mostly serendipitous. Recent X-ray crystallography, that determines the atomic and molecular structure, and cryo-electron microscopy that offers 3D models of several GPCRs offer opportunities to develop computer-aided methodologies to search for allosteric sites.  The researchers developed a computer-aided protocol to map allosteric sites in GPCRs with a view to start rational search of allosteric drugs, presenting the opportunity for new solutions and therapies for a range of diseases.  Dr Irina Tikhonova from the School of Pharmacy at Queen s University and senior author, explains:  We have developed a novel, cost-effective and rapid pipeline for the discovery of GPCRs allosteric sites, which overcomes the limitations of current computational protocols such as membrane distortion and non-specific binding.  Our pipeline can identify allosteric sites in a short time, which makes it suitable for industry settings. As such, our pipeline is a feasible solution to initiate structure-based search of allosteric drugs for any membrane-bound drug targets that have an impact on cancer, inflammation, and CNS diseases.

ICREA researcher Dr. Patrick Aloy, head of the Structural Bioinformatics and Network Biology lab at IRB Barcelona, has headed a study that has managed to reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in mice by administering drugs currently used to treat hypertension and inflammation in humans.In this study, the scientists led by Dr. Aloy have characterised three stages of Alzheimer's disease, namely initial, intermediate and advanced. For each of these stages, they have analysed the behaviour of the animals, studied the effects on the brain (specifically the hippocampus at the tissue level) and performed a molecular analysis to measure gene expression and protein levels.The approach adopted has allowed them to describe the development of the disease at a level of detail hitherto unknown and also compare it with healthy ageing.  What we have observed is that, although Alzheimer's disease shares some features of accelerated ageing, it is also affected by totally different ageing processes,  says Dr. Aloy.  This disease is caused by the abnormal accumulation of certain proteins, and we have seen that, in some cases, this is not caused by overproduction but by an error in their removal,  he adds.","Published: October 28, 2021"

Most cells either get it from the bloodstream or make it themselves. Since there is plenty of inositol available, some cancer cells decide to stop making it. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Professor Christopher Vakoc and his lab discovered that acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive cancer that originates in the bone marrow, depends on a transporter to bring in the nutrient inositol. The researchers can develop a way to cut off the cells  food supply and kill them. Vakoc s lab studies cancer dependencies, such as the pathways cancers use to grow quickly. Cancers may streamline certain cell processes and rely on just one method to survive. For example, some remove backup pathways for DNA repair,  putting all their eggs in one basket  and depending only on a single pathway for survival. Vakoc can then develop treatments to knock out that remaining pathway and kill the cancer cells. In a study published in September in Cancer Discovery, Vakoc and his lab reported that AML is dependent on inositol, an abundant sugar that is made in many tissues throughout the human body. Inositol is also found in a wide variety of foods like fruits, beans, grains, and nuts, so cells can get it from outside of the body, through the bloodstream. Vakoc discovered that the AML cells had removed their own ability to make the sugar they need in order to streamline and accelerate their growth. They became reliant on the inositol coming from outside the body, using a small transporter on the cell surface to bring it inside. If researchers can find a simple treatment that can turn off or block this transporter, the cancer cells would starve. Vakoc says:  An antibody approach would be very attractive. You could make an antibody that just sticks to this transporter. It doesn t need to get into the cell, and it could shut off the transport function. The other possibility, from a drug development point of view, is inositol. You could build a molecular medicine that sort of looks like inositol, but maybe it has a few chemical differences that can clog the transport function. This method would not only kill the cancer cells, but it would also leave normal cells unharmed since they can make inositol on their own. Vakoc is looking forward to collaborating with a drug development partner to make a new treatment for this type of cancer.Reference: Wei Y, Huang Y-H, Skopelitis DS, et al.

With a highly infectious pathogen like SARS-COV-2, we want to have a method for extracting the mutational information as quickly as possible,  Kohandel said.  Variants are a huge problem because we don t know whether the diagnostic tests that are available are going to work or whether the treatments or vaccines will be effective in the long run.  Kohandel s research team initially focused on using a single ancestral sequence to identify the parts of the viral genome that are not significantly affected by mutations. These are the so-called  conserved  part of the virus.Identifying the conserved parts of a pathogen is valuable because even if there are mutations, it will not impact the efficacy of vaccines, treatments or tests that work by targeting those stable pieces. Imagine that from the beginning of the pandemic, we knew exactly which parts of the genome were going to be stable and which ones would likely change,  said Amirhossein Darooneh, a member of the research team and a professor in applied mathematics at Waterloo.  Everything would be different right now. Now that we have so much data on the sequencing of SARS-COV2 and its variants, we are able to use all that information to train a neural network to predict the most likely mutations of the genome. Our AI can predict the mutations that happened with really high accuracy. After identifying the conserved parts, the team trained an AI to anticipate the mutations that would occur in a pathogen. The machine learning program assessed millions of genomic sequences as part of its training process. The AI was then tested on the genomic sequence of the original strain of coronavirus.Based on its analysis of the original virus, the AI predicted and identified the variants that came to be known as alpha, beta, gamma, delta and other variants of concern as most likely mutable regions of the genome. Had this information been available at the early stages of the pandemic and when vaccines were first being developed, it could have led to more effective tests and vaccines that were much more resilient against current variants.Along with its impacts on the pandemic, the new technology can also contribute to other medical treatments. Even with cancer, we should be able to identify the therapeutic targets for overcoming mutation-driven drug resistance,  said Michelle Przedborski, another of the team members and a professor of applied mathematics at Waterloo.  Lots of drugs are targeting a specific part of the protein in cancer cells. But if there are mutations in those, then drugs wouldn t be effective anymore. We can apply the same analysis and AI method to other pathogens.

The ability to rapidly analyze large amounts of complex data has clinicians closer to providing individualized treatments for patients, with an aim to create better outcomes through more proactive, personalized medicine and care.  In medicine, we need to be able to make predictions,  said John F. McDonald, professor in the School of Biological Sciences and director of the Integrated Cancer Research Center in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience at the Georgia Institute of Technology. One way is through understanding cause and reflect relationships, like a cancer patient s response to drugs, he explained. The other way is through correlation.  In analyzing complex datasets in cancer biology, we can use machine learning, which is simply a sophisticated way to look for correlations. The advantage is that computers can look for these correlations in extremely large and complex data sets. Now, McDonald s team and the Ovarian Cancer Institute are using ensemble-based machine learning algorithms to predict how patients will respond to cancer-fighting drugs with high accuracy rates. The results of their most recent work have been published in the Journal of Oncology Research.  For the study, McDonald and his colleagues developed predictive machine learning-based models for 15 distinct cancer types, using data from 499 independent cell lines provided by the National Cancer Institute. Those models were then validated against a clinical dataset containing seven chemotherapeutic drugs, administered either singularly or in combination, to 23 ovarian cancer patients. The researchers found an overall predictive accuracy of 91%. While additional validation will need to be carried out using larger numbers of patients with multiple types of cancer,  McDonald noted,  our preliminary finding of 90% accuracy in the prediction of drug responses in ovarian cancer patients is extremely promising and gives me hope that the days of being able to accurately predict optimal cancer drug therapies for individual patients is in sight.""The study was conducted in collaboration with the Ovarian Cancer Institute (OCI) in Atlanta, where McDonald serves as chief research officer.

Decades of research have established its contribution to several seemingly unrelated brain functions including learning, motivation, and movement, raising the question of how a single neurotransmitter can play so many different roles.Untangling dopamine s diverse functions has been challenging, in part because the advanced brain of humans and other mammals contain different kinds of dopamine neurons, all embedded in highly complex circuits. In a new study, Rockefeller s Vanessa Ruta and her team dive deep into the question by looking instead at the much simpler brain of the fruit fly, whose neurons and their connections have been mapped in detail.As in humans, a fly s dopamine neurons provide a signal for learning, helping them to link a particular odor to a particular outcome. Learning that, for example, apple cider vinegar contains sugar serves to shape the animals  future behavior on their next encounter with that odor. But Ruta s team discovered that the same dopamine neurons also correlate strongly with the animal s ongoing behavior. The activity of these dopamine neurons does not simply encode the mechanics of movement, but rather appears to reflect the motivation or goal underlying the fly s actions in real time. In other words, the same dopamine neurons that teach animals long-term lessons also provide moment-to-moment reinforcement, encouraging the flies to continue with a beneficial action. There seems to be an intimate connection between learning and motivation, two different facets of what dopamine does,  says Ruta, who published the findings in Nature Neuroscience.

PTSD is characterized by hyperarousal and avoidance of risky, potentially aversive behaviors.Research has revealed that the brain employs distinct circuitries that mediate positive, or rewarding, behaviors and negative, or aversive, ones. PTSD has long been thought to arise from overactivity in the negative valence system, however a new study shows that people with PTSD also displayed a deficit in activation of positive valence processing soon after the trauma, suggesting it plays a role in resilience to PTSD.The work appears in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, published by Elsevier.Led by Talma Hendler, MD, PhD, and Ziv Ben-Zion, PhD, both at Tel Aviv University, Israel, the researchers identified 171 people who had been treated in a hospital emergency department for a trauma (such as a car accident) and who, within two weeks of the traumatic event, were experiencing symptoms of PTSD. One month after the trauma, survivors were assessed in the lab by a trained clinical interviewer in more detail, and underwent brain scans by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The same assessments were made at six months and 14 months post-trauma.While undergoing fMRI, participants played a competitive electronic gambling game designed to test participants  sensitivity to risk, reward and punishment. Not surprisingly, participants with more severe PTSD symptoms at the start of the study made fewer risky choices in the game, and fMRI scans showed that they had greater activation in the amygdala a brain region associated with fear processing and a key part of the negative valence system. But decreased activity at one month in the ventral striatum, a mesolimbic brain region involved in processing positive valence like rewards, predicted more severe PTSD symptoms at 14 months.Dr. Ben-Zion said the work  provides insights on roles of both the positive and negative valence processing systems in the early development of post-traumatic psychopathology. While most of the research to date on stress and trauma has focused on the hyper-active negative valence system (e.g., increased fear and threat responses), our findings also suggest a critical role for hypo-active positive valence system (e.g., less neural activation towards rewards) in PTSD development and point to its role in resilience to traumatic stress and /or adaptive recovery from it. Cameron Carter, MD, Editor of Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, said,  This work provides new insights into the fundamental changes in brain function that follow traumatic experiences and underlie the development of PTSD. The study shows us that these changes go beyond dysregulated threat processing and include brain systems related to reward and motivation that are likely to underlie changes in mood and motivated behavior in PTSD. The work could have implications for therapeutic strategies to treat stress- and anxiety-related disorders, Professor Hendler said, adding that  novel therapeutic approaches should address both positive and negative valence systems, as these two are intrinsically linked and both affect the symptom development after experiencing traumatic stress. Furthermore, we suggest that specific deficits in each valence system are associated with specific symptoms of PTSD, possibly pointing to distinct underlying mental processes that could guide a more personalized approach in psychiatric treatment.

I think this study is a tremendous proof-of-concept in the realm of COVID-19 testing, one that can be applied to other diseases,  said the study s lead author, Kathleen Barnes, PhD, professor at the CU School of Medicine.  It s a major move forward in the world of precision medicine. The study, published Tuesday in the journal Communications Medicine, suggests that specific signals from a process called DNA methylation varies between those infected and those not infected with SARS-CoV-2. And they can indicate the severity of the disease even in the early stages.DNA methylation, critical in how cells function, is an epigenetic signaling tool that cells use to turn genes off. Any mistakes in the process can trigger a variety of disease.Barnes believes that paying attention to these signals could help fill a needed gap in the current world of COVID testing. Most COVID-19 antigen or rapid tests are dependent on viral strains and can carry high false negative rates. They don t predict if the virus is viable and replicating, nor do they predict clinical outcomes, the study said.A pre-symptomatic patient may test negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus while patients who have recovered may still test positive despite no longer being infectious. Accurate diagnostics are urgently required to control continued communal spread, to better understand host response, and for the development of vaccines and antivirals,  the study said.  Identification of which SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are most likely to develop severe disease would enable clinicians to triage patients via augmented clinical decision support. But the authors said they didn t know of any test that can predict the clinical course  of COVID-19.With that in mind, they analyzed the epigenome in blood samples from people with and without COVID-19. They customized a tool from Illumina called the Infinium Methylation EPIC array to enhance immune response detection. Researchers then profiled peripheral blood samples from 164 COVID-19 patients and 296 control patients.The peripheral blood DNA samples were collected from patients seen at UCHealth and tested for SARS-CoV-2 epigenetic signatures starting March 1, 2020.  Most blood specimens were collected in the University of Colorado Emergency Medicine Specimen Bank under the direction of study co-author Andrew Monte, MD, PhD, and passed on to the Colorado Anschutz Research Genetics Organization (CARGO). Additional specimens were taken from patients consented to the University of Colorado COVID-19 Biorepository.The researchers discovered specific genetic markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection along with indications of how severe the disease might be. These signals of disease progression were present from the initial blood draw when first walking into the hospital,  the study said.  Together, these approaches demonstrate the potential of measuring the epigenome for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 status and severity. According to Barnes, the findings could ultimately lead to a new and more accurate way to test for COVID-19. We are exploring how this platform could add value to the COVID diagnostic world,  she said.  We think it adds value to knowing what patients develop more serious disease. This could tell you if you could ride out the infection or if it is likely to get worse. Reference: Konigsberg IR, Barnes B, Campbell M, et al.

The team's research was recently published and featured on the cover of the journal Advanced Materials.The ultimate goal of furthering this human-machine interface is to give touch devices the ability to provide users with a richer touch-based experience by equipping the technology with the ability to mimic the feeling of physical objects. Hipwell shared examples of potential implementations ranging from a more immersive virtual reality platform to tactile display interfaces like those in a motor vehicle dashboard and a virtual shopping experience that would let the user feel the texture of materials before purchasing them.""This could allow you to actually feel textures, buttons, slides and knobs on the screen,"" Hipwell said. ""It can be used for interactive touch screen-based displays, but one holy grail would certainly be being able to bring touch into shopping so that you could feel the texture of fabrics and other products while you're shopping online.""Hipwell explained that at its essence, the ""touch"" in current touch screen technology is more for the screen's benefit than the user. With the emergence and refinement of increasingly sophisticated haptic technology, that relationship between user and device can grow to be more reciprocal. She added that the addition of touch as a sensory input would ultimately enrich virtual environments and lighten the burden of communication currently carried by audio and visuals.""When we look at virtual experiences, they're primarily audio and visual right now and we can get audio and visual overload,"" Hipwell said. ""Being able to bring touch into the human-machine interface can bring a lot more capability, much more realism, and it can reduce that overload. Haptic effects can be used to draw your attention to make something easier to find or easier to do using a lower cognitive load.""Hipwell and her team are approaching the research by looking at the multiphysics   the coupled processes or systems involving multiple physical fields occurring at the same time   of the interface between the user's finger and the device. This interface is incredibly complex and changes with different users and environmental conditions.""We're looking at electro-wetting effects (the forces that result from an applied electric field), electrostatic effects, changes in properties of the finger, the material properties and surface geometry of the device, the contact mechanics, the fluid motion, charge transport   really, everything that's going on in the interface to understand how the device can be designed to be more reliable and higher performing,  Hipwell said.  Ultimately, our goal is to create predictive models than enable a designer to create devices with maximum haptic effect and minimum sensitivity to user and environmental variation.""As research into and development of the technology continues to progress, Hipwell said she predicts consumers will begin to see early elements implemented into common devices over the next few years, with some early products already in development.""I think early elements of it will definitely be within the next five years,"" Hipwell said. ""Then, it will just be a matter of maturing the technology and how advanced, how realistic and how widespread it becomes.""Reference: Li X, Ma Y, Choi C, et al.

The findings, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, build on a novel model of brain functioning called the  connectome  that describes this pattern of brain-wide connections. Maladaptive aggression can result in harm to self or others. This challenging behavior is one of the main reasons for referrals to child mental health services,  said Denis Sukhodolsky, senior author and associate professor in the Yale Child Study Center.  Connectome-based modeling offers a new account of brain networks involved in aggressive behavior. For the study, which is the first of its kind, researchers collected fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data while children performed an emotional face perception task in which they observed faces making calm or fearful expressions. Seeing faces that express emotion can engage brain states relevant to emotion generation and regulation, both of which have been linked to aggressive behavior, researchers said. The scientists then applied machine learning analyses to identify neural connections that distinguished children with and without histories of aggressive behavior.They found that patterns in brain networks involved in social and emotional processes   such as feeling frustrated with homework or understanding why a friend is upset   predicted aggressive behavior. To confirm these findings, the researchers then tested them in a separate dataset and found that the same brain networks predicted aggression. In particular, abnormal connectivity to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex   a key region involved in the regulation of emotions and higher cognitive functions like attention and decision-making   emerged as a consistent predictor of aggression when tested in subgroups of children with aggressive behavior and disorders such as anxiety, ADHD, and autism.These neural connections to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could represent a marker of aggression that is common across several childhood psychiatric disorders. This study suggests that the robustness of these large-scale brain networks and their connectivity with the prefrontal cortex may represent a neural marker of aggression that can be leveraged in clinical studies,  said Karim Ibrahim, associate research scientist at the Yale Child Study Center and first author of the paper.  The human functional connectome describes the vast interconnectedness of the brain. Understanding the connectome is on the frontier of neuroscience because it can provide us with valuable information for developing brain biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. Added Sukhodolsky:  This connectome model of aggression could also help us develop clinical interventions that can improve the coordination among these brain networks and hubs like the prefrontal cortex. Such interventions could include teaching the emotion regulation skills necessary for modulating negative emotions such as frustration and anger. Reference: Ibrahim K, Noble S, He G, et al.

The report is one of the first to provide data on guaranteed financial incentives for COVID-19 vaccination. Within a week, this well-designed incentive program halved the drop in COVID-19 vaccination that North Carolina was experiencing,  said co-author Noel T. Brewer, a professor of health behavior at UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.  Using guaranteed cash incentives is a best practice, recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. It builds on 70 years of psychological research showing that rewards are most effective when delivered immediately after the behavior. During the one-week review period, COVID-19 vaccinations declined by just 26% at clinics in Mecklenburg, Guilford, Rowan and Rockingham counties offering the $25 cards, but declined by 51% at other clinics in the four counties. During the same period, the rate of vaccinations decreased statewide by 49%.The incentive study guaranteed a $25 card to adults who either received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine or drove someone to providers participating in the pilot program.The program distributed 2,890 cards to vaccine recipients and 1,374 to drivers. The $25 Summer Card program switched to providing $100 cards after this evaluation was conducted, and data on the $100 Summer Card program are not included in the authors  review. Providing guaranteed small financial incentives is a promising strategy to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake,  said Charlene Wong, the chief health policy officer for COVID-19 at the NCDHHS Department of Health and Human Services.  The design of our $25 incentive pilot program in North Carolina helped alleviate transportation and other cost barriers to vaccination, particularly for low-income, Latinx and Black individuals. North Carolina Central University was pleased to be a key partner in North Carolina s effort to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates through incentive vaccination clinics,  said William Pilkington, H.O.P.E co-program director at Julius L. Chambers Biomedical Biotechnology Research Institute at NCCU.  The university s staff developed and administered surveys at the clinics that produced results clearly demonstrating the value of incentives to promote more equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccinations. Of 401 vaccine recipients surveyed, 41% reported the $25 card was an important reason why they decided to get vaccinated. The cards were more important to respondents who were not white as well as respondents with lower incomes.Additionally,  someone driving me here today  was an important reason for 49% of respondents, more commonly among Black, Hispanic and lower-income respondents. Lower-income and older individuals, especially, were more likely to have been brought by a driver who received a cash card. Reference: Wong CA, Pilkington W, Doherty IA, et al.

The general outlook for AML is poor, but when AML arises from MDS it is worse.Left untreated, AML kills patients quickly by crippling production of normal blood cells. AML is most prevalent in elderly people   many of whom cannot tolerate  traditional  treatment of intensive chemotherapy because of their age and frailty.Scientists at the University of Birmingham had already discovered that mixing bezafibrate (BEZ - cholesterol-lowering) with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA - contraceptive steroid) eased a range of blood cancers including AML, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.Now clinical trials show that adding valproic acid to a low-dose combination of the other two drugs offers enhanced killing of AML cells - giving the low-dose triple-drug combo (VBaP) a cancer-busting impact similar to a high dose of BEZ and MPA (BaP).Researchers from the University of Birmingham have published their findings in British Journal of Cancer.Co-author Professor Chris Bunce, commented: Using existing drugs to treat conditions outside of their approved indications is a proven approach to generate effective low-toxicity therapies. We believe that treating patients earlier with low toxicity therapies is the most effective clinical strategy for improving patient outcomes. Earlier clinical trials had shown that low-doses of BaP given to patients who could not have chemotherapy produced no toxic side effects and helped patients to boost their production of  blood cells.However high doses of the dual combo were not well tolerated, due to the frail nature of the patients caused by their age, poor kidney function, disease and, in some cases, prior chemotherapy treatments.Co-author Dr Farhat Khanim commented:  A major challenge in our previous BaP trials has been the focus on elderly patients for whom more intensive therapies were not option. For many of these patients there are very few treatment options other than regular transfusions to combat life-threatening deficits in red cells and platelets and antibiotic control of frequent life threatening infections. It is therefore an attractive option to consider testing VBaP in MDS patients. As the drug combination may have profound impact on quality of life and survival of these patients.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/saharas-fossil-rivers-show-threat-of-a-warming-world-355174,Sahara s Fossil Rivers Show Threat of a Warming World Scientists have studied the fossil rivers of the Egyptian Sahara to reconstruct the region s rainfall rates that led to a major migration of people away from the Nile valley        years ago  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Why did the people living near the Nile river migrate to central Egypt 10,000 years ago, when the Egyptian Sahara was still green? Geologists led by the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, have studied the fossil rivers north of Lake Nasser in Egypt in order to reconstruct the palaeo-hydrology of the region and to determine the rainfall rate of this African humid period. They found that following a rapid temperature increase of about 7 C, the frequency of heavy rainfall events increased fourfold, increasing river flooding and forcing riverine populations to migrate to the center of the country. These results, to be read in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, highlight the increase in extreme weather episodes in the event of global warming.Africa experienced a wet period between 14,800 and 5,500 BC, characterized by a still green Sahara. However, this region north of Lake Nasser in Egypt is now arid, leaving only fossilized rivers as traces of this green past.  These rivers are essential for reconstructing past climates, as they allow us to determine the quantities of flowing water at the time, as well as the quantities and frequencies of rainfall , explains Abdallah Zaki, a PhD researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and first author of the study. To reconstruct the palaeo-hydrology of a region, it is first necessary to measure the pebbles in the fossil rivers.  Large pebbles indicate a high water discharge, capable of transporting them, as do the depth and width of the river, which make it possible to assess the water discharge, for instance in units of cubic meters per second , says S bastien Castelltort, associate professor in the Department of Earth Sciences and final author of the study. The second step is to find out the surface area of the drainage basin, i.e. the area that connects the water upstream to the river.  By combining these two figures, we obtain the precipitation rate responsible for transporting the studied sediments , continues the Geneva researcher. To find the age of the rivers, the scientists use two different techniques. The first, carried out in collaboration with ETH Zurich, uses carbon-14 dating of the organic matter that fills the fossilized rivers. The second, called Optically Stimulated Luminescence and carried out with specialists from the University of Lausanne, consists of measuring the luminescence of quartz to obtain the age of the sediment deposit. The scientists carried out this work on six rivers in the region and confirmed that the rivers were mainly active between 13,000 and 5,000 BC, i.e. at the height of the African wet period.  But what is particularly interesting is that our study shows that the rainfall was very intense, with rates of 55-80 mm per hour, and that such rainfall events were 3 to 4 times more frequent than before the African humid period, which is an enormous climate perturbation , says Abdallah Zaki. Indeed, the annual rainfall rate alone does not reflect the intensity of the rains, and therefore the consequences.  If we take London as an example, we have the impression that it rains all the time , illustrates S bastien Castelltort.  However, London sees an average of 680 mm of rain per year, compared to about 1400 mm in Geneva, which is more than twice as much!  It s simply that in London, rainfall is spread out over the whole year, whereas it is more concentrated in Geneva. The results obtained by the geologists, i.e. this sudden increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events, provide an explanation for the strong migration of the region s riparian (living near the river) populations towards the center of the territory at that time, as observed by the archaeologists.  Indeed, the violent flooding of the rivers increased, making the banks inhospitable , confirms Abdallah Zaki. This fourfold increase in violent rainfall also coincides with a 7 C increase in temperature in the region.  This study thus provides us with a historical lesson told by the rocks on how the Earth system behaves in the event of rapid global warming , says S bastien Castelltort. Understanding the distribution of precipitation over the year will become a key issue in risk prevention today, because in a period of global warming, these risks will also increase in the near future.  What happened in Germany this summer will certainly become more common , he concludes.ReferenceZaki AS, King GE, Haghipour N, et al.

The first ones came onto the market in the 1970s and since then the number of different ones has expanded. Flame retardants can be released into the environment through high temperatures, friction or cleaning and can thus accumulate in the air or dust inside buildings, leading to human exposure through inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Some flame retardants have been shown to have adverse effects on health and since 2004 have been banned by European legislation and replaced by new ones, called emerging flame retardants, the health effects of which have not yet been studied. The URV's TecnATox research group has now detected the presence of seven emerging flame retardants in the air in a pioneering study in Europe. The results of this research have been published in the scientific journal Science of The Total Environment.The study, which is part of the FlameRISK project, has assessed the possible health risks, especially among children, whose tendency to put their hands or objects in their mouths, play on the floor and crawl on all fours increase their likelihood of exposure to these substances. To carry out the research, the research team analysed samples from twenty interior spaces of homes, offices and schools in the province of Tarragona. Air was collected for 24 hours using sensors that emit a stream of air and retain flame retardants in a filter. Samples of dust accumulated on furniture surfaces and electronic devices in the same spaces were also available. They were subsequently analysed to determine the levels of 41 different types of emerging or controlled flame retardants.The results confirmed the presence of seven emerging flame retardants (TEP, TCIPP, T2IPPP, TPPO, DCP, TMCP and B4IPPPP) in the air for the first time in Europe, including at high levels. Controlled flame retardants were also detected in the samples, although in smaller amounts than the emerging ones. This is because in many interior spaces there are still products (furniture, paints, devices, etc.) that were manufactured with these flame retardants before they were banned in 2004.The results were used to calculate the levels of exposure and the health risks for adults and children living in these indoor spaces. The risk was found to be higher for the child population, close to the limit considered dangerous by the legislation. ""This shows the potential of these chemicals, particularly the flame retardant TClPP, to affect human health,"" says Roser Esplugas, a researcher in the URV s Department of Chemical Engineering who participated in the study. If the permitted limits are exceeded, these retardants can cause cancerous diseases and toxicological effects such as altered hormonal and neurological systems, among others. It should be stated that the study did not examine people s exposure to these compounds in other indoor spaces, such as vehicles, where the presence is greater than in homes. Consequently, we may assume that the real risk is even greater "", warns the researcher. Nor did the study look at their ingestion by humans, which is another major source of exposure. The widespread use of these compounds means that they can enter the food chain and, therefore, also be ingested through food.The results of the study confirm the importance of continuing to measure flame retardants in different environments and assessing their effects on health in order to provide scientific literature on the possible risks to the population.Research on the FlameRISK project continues and the research team is studying the possible neurotoxic effects of several emerging retardants that were detected in the air and dust samples used in the study.Reference: Esplugas R, Rovira J, Mari M, et al.

University of Leicester researchers also studied the emotions reported during hallucinations, with confusion, fear and frustration being the most common.Although there was great variation in the localisation of feelings across participants, for each individual feelings were recurrently concentrated in particular body areas. Areas of concentration often held repeated sources of feelings like pain, heat, or tension.Dr Katie Melvin, of the Department of Neuroscience, Psychology and Behaviour at the University of Leicester and corresponding author for the study, said: During a systematic review of existing research, we found indicators of the contributions that multiple senses, emotions and feelings may make to hallucinations. We designed a study and developed the novel but simple multimodal unusual sensory experience (MUSE) map method to investigate these features further. MUSE maps involve documenting hallucinations in daily life and include body-mapping. The article shares new insights through body-maps and data on the immediate feeling of hallucinations. The range of feelings in the body and around the body (into peri-personal space) were particularly interesting. Participants often described that the method helped them share experiences that were difficult to put into words. The methods and outcomes of this study can contribute to advances on how we understand hallucinations and how we can support people who experience them. The next steps for this area of research will be further understanding the embodiment and feeling of hallucinations in different populations and developing interventions to support with this.  Example of participant annotations, used to create novel but simple multimodal unusual sensory experience (MUSE) body-maps. Credit: University of Leicester Psychosis is a term which describes experiences where an individual may have difficulties in determining what is real and what is not real.Research indicates psychosis is associated with experiencing trauma, adverse life events, and stress. People may be given a diagnosis such as schizophrenia. Experiences of perceiving or believing things which those around us do not can also occur in physical health conditions such as brain tumours or acute infections.Psychosis can have serious adverse outcomes on individuals including distress, lack of sleep, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, difficulties in carrying out daily activities, experiences of discrimination and lost opportunities.Participants in this study were asked by the research team to prospectively document the feeling and senses of hallucinations for one week prior to an interview.Novel visual diary methods involving drawing, writing and body-mapping generated 42 MUSE maps, which set out the specific areas across the body   and beyond, in so-called peripersonal space   where participants experienced sensations during hallucinations.The study found that hallucinations were characterised by numerous feelings arising at once, often including multisensory, emotional, and embodied features. Researchers suggest further uptake of visual, ecological and prospective methods may enhance understandings of lived experiences of hallucinations.Reference: Melvin K, Crossley J, Cromby J.

The next two greatest drivers are unusual weather patterns and changes in the abundance of disease vectors such as mosquitos and ticks.Zoonotic diseases occur when pathogens are transmitted from animals to humans prominent recent outbreaks include Ebola hemorrhagic fever and COVID-19. However, most zoonotic disease outbreaks involve fewer than 100 cases and are quickly brought under control. So what factors drive large-scale outbreaks?In a study published in the Royal Society journal Philosophical Transactions B, researchers investigated over 4,400 zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks. They identified the 100 largest in terms of numbers of human cases, all of which infected thousands to hundreds of thousands of people. From the full list they also selected 200 outbreaks at random to serve as  case controls.  The majority of these control outbreaks included 43 or fewer cases. They then compared the characteristics of large-scale and control outbreaks, particularly how the primary causes of infection and disease spread varied between them.Lead author Patrick Stephens, an associate research scientist with the Odum School of Ecology and CEID, said that this research is one of the first peer-reviewed studies to quantify the variation of infectious disease outbreak drivers across the globe. In the age of COVID-19, it is understandable that many people may not realize how many outbreaks of other infectious diseases are caused by complex, intertwined ecological and socioeconomic conditions,  he said.  We know that factors like exposure to wild mammals, habitat disruption, international trade and travel and contact with contaminated food and water are important considerations. Our research was designed to understand what proportion of outbreaks various drivers contributed to. To our knowledge, this study is the first to do so for a global sample of outbreaks of many diseases. Stephens worked with CEID researchers Nicole Gottdenker of the College of Veterinary Medicine and John Drake, Annakate Schatz and John Paul Schmidt of the Odum School to compile a list of contemporary zoonotic infectious diseases documented in peer reviewed scientific literature. They identified and scored 48 specific infectious disease drivers related to the large-scale and control outbreaks in ecological, environmental and socioeconomic categories.

The new treatment also lasts for two weeks, rather than the standard six weeks.Results of a study of the new treatment were presented Tuesday, Oct. 20, at the American Society for Radiation Oncology's Annual Meeting.""Throat cancer caused by HPV is one of the fastest-growing cancer types in the United States,"" says Daniel J. Ma, M.D., a radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic and the study's author. Dr. Ma says that while the standard treatment for this type of cancer leads to high cure rates, it may also result in many short-term and long-term treatment toxicities, including dry mouth, problems swallowing, neck stiffness and jawbone problems. ""Many of these side effects are directly linked to the amount of radiation used for treatment,"" says Dr. Ma.Dr. Ma and his colleagues developed an initial clinical trial looking at a new treatment using minimally invasive surgery and half the standard dose of radiation. The initial clinical trial demonstrated that well-selected patients could have excellent disease control with much lower toxicity using the new treatment. ""Our findings suggest that in select patients with HPV-associated oropharynx a shorter course treatment, compared to the standard of care, yields a similar result,"" says Dr. Ma. Based on these phase 3 results, Mayo Clinic has adopted this shorter course treatment as its standard of care for well-selected patients.Dr. Ma and his colleagues are now developing future clinical trials that will test whether it is possible to combine lower doses of radiation with other treatment strategies, such as proton beam therapy, to further reduce toxicity to patients.

It also raises the possibility of new treatments being found to manage debilitating inflammatory diseases of the gut, such as Ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease. The two classes of molecules identified by the study s authors are short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids. The researchers have not established exactly how these molecules influence the production of P-gp. They plan to examine the role these molecules play in gene and protein regulation in future work. Both molecules exist in the gut in healthy quantities only when certain microbes are given the right conditions to thrive in the microbiome. These microbes contribute to the digestion of food elements, such as fibre and green leafy vegetables. The researchers  findings support the growing bank of evidence that the health of a person s microbiome, and therefore their overall wellbeing, is closely linked to diet. The intestinal microbiome differs from person-to-person, but overall, an appropriate balance of key microbes is known to be linked to a healthy intestine. This balance can be disturbed by changes to the diet. In particular, a western diet high in simple sugars and fats, and low in plant-based protein, has been associated with a decrease in the quantities of bacteria in the gut that produce short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids. The protein that gets the gut speaking to the immune system P-glycoprotein (P-gp)   the protein studied in this work   allows the intestine to communicate with the immune system through the gut wall. For some years, this has been a protein of concern in cancer research because of its capacity to pump chemotherapy drugs out of cancer cells, thus reducing the drugs  ability to fight tumours. However, the very mechanism that makes P-gp problematic in treating certain cancers makes it beneficial in helping the intestine maintain homeostasis   that is, a state of equilibrium where chronic inflammation is subdued. For the past 10 years, scientists have been aware that through its action of pumping out foreign substances, including toxins, P-gp plays a critical role in protecting the surface of the gut. High levels of the protein correlate with a healthy intestine. In inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, expression of P-gp appears to be reduced. Yet, despite an understanding of the role of P-gp, until now the mechanisms controlling its expression and regulation have remained unknown. The findings of the new study, combined with earlier work at UMass Chan, explain how the microbiome can affect P-gp expression. This gives important insight into a key aspect of the microbiome and how it regulates health and disease in the gut. Inflammatory bowel disease In earlier research, the team of scientists from the US and UK demonstrated that P-gp releases anti-inflammatory compounds into the gut. These molecules, known as endocannabinoids, are chemically similar to cannabis but produced by the human body, and are key to keeping inflammation in the gut in check. If these endocannabinoids are reduced or not present, inflammation can flare up. The molecules identified in the new study prompt P-gp to release those all-important endocannabinoid molecules. The research, led by graduate student Sage Foley and Professor Beth McCormick at UMass Chan in collaboration with graduate student Merran Dunford and Professor Randy Mrsny from the Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology at Bath, builds on previous research by the team that demonstrated how the anti-inflammatory P-gp pathway is constantly balanced with a pro-inflammatory process. These opposing pathways communicate to keep the gut healthy: in the absence of an infection, the anti-inflammatory P-gp pathway is active to suppress unnecessary inflammation, while the pro-inflammatory pathway is poised ready to launch an immune response to protect against intestinal infection. In inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, this balance is poorly managed. The team s findings provide exciting new opportunities for the management of inflammatory intestinal diseases. Potential future treatments could include the delivery of specific bacteria or bacterial products to a person s gut, or dietary changes that would support a microbiome to promote or sustain P-gp expression in the intestine, thereby protecting against unwanted inflammation. Inflammatory bowel disease is linked to genetics and environmental conditions that include (but are not limited to) diet, exercise, lifestyle and antibiotic use. Ulcerative colitis, the most common form of inflammatory bowel disease worldwide, is a chronic, debilitating disease with no cure. Symptoms include abdominal pain, severe cramps, persistent diarrhoea or constipation, weight loss and severe intestinal inflammation. While current treatments can reduce inflammation and symptoms, there is nothing available today to treat the underlying disease. Ms Dunford said:  The upshot of this research is that we now know the specific molecules produced by the microbiome bacteria that are linked to P-gp, and hence, a healthy intestine. These molecules work in concert to stimulate P-gp to increase the release of endocannabinoid molecules, which suppress intestinal inflammation.  Ms Foley added:  We are excited to find that not only is there a link between the gut microbiome and P-gp regulation in the intestine, but that two classes of microbial molecules actually work together to trigger expression of P-gp.  This highlights the importance of a functioning core microbial community to have maximal impact on the human body. While even within an individual the relative abundance of microbes can fluctuate, we re beginning to understand the importance of nourishing the microbial community as a whole. Though there is still much to explore, we suspect this may be possible through changes to the diet or through the delivery of groupings of microbes.  Commenting on the research, Ruth Wakeman, director of services, advocacy and evidence at Crohn s & Colitis UK, said:  We welcome research that helps increase understanding of how environmental factors, diet and gut microorganisms may influence conditions such as Crohn s and colitis. We hope that research such as this will lead to new and improved methods of managing the conditions in the future. ReferenceFoley SE, Tuohy C, Dunford M, et al.

The findings appear in the October 26, 2021 issue of the journal, a publication of the European Molecular Biology Organization.Cancer is driven by multiple types of genetic alterations, including DNA mutations and copy number alterations ranging in scale from small insertions and deletions to whole genome duplication events.Collectively, somatic copy number alterations in tumors frequently result in an abnormal number of chromosomes, termed aneuploidy, which has been shown to promote tumor development by increasing genetic diversity, instability and evolution. Approximately 90 percent of solid tumors and half of blood cancers present some form of aneuploidy, which is associated with tumor progression and poor prognoses.In recent years, it has become apparent that cells cohabiting within a tumor microenvironment are subject not only to external stressors (mainly of metabolic origin, such as lack of nutrients), but also to the internal stressor aneuploidy. Both activate a stress response mechanism called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which leads to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells   an organelle that synthesizes proteins and transports them outside the cell.  When this primary transport/export system is disrupted, UPR attempts to restore normal function by halting the accumulation of misfolded proteins, degrading and removing them and activating signaling pathways to promote proper protein folding. If homeostasis or equilibrium is not re-established quickly, non-tumor cells undergo cell death. Conversely, cancer cells thrive in this chaos, establishing a higher tolerance threshold that favors their survival. In these circumstances, they also co-opt neighboring cells in a spiral of deceit that progressively impairs local immune cells,  said co-senior author Maurizio Zanetti, MD, professor of medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a tumor immunologist at Moores Cancer Center with Hannah Carter, PhD, associate professor of medicine and a computational biologist. Zanetti had previously introduced the hypothesis in a Science commentary. The researchers hypothesized that aneuploidy, UPR and immune cell dysregulation could be linked together in a deadly triangle. In the new study, Zanetti, Carter and colleagues analyzed 9,375 human tumor samples and found that cancer cell aneuploidy intersects preferentially with certain branches of the signaling response to stress and that this finding correlates with the damaging effects of aneuploidy on T lymphocytes, a type of immune cell. This was an ambitious goal not attempted before,  said Zanetti.  It was like interrogating three chief systems together   chromosomal abnormalities in toto, signaling mechanisms in response to endogenous stress and dysregulation of neighboring immune cells   just to prove a bold hypothesis. We knew the task would be challenging,  added Carter,  and that we would need to create and refine new analytical tools to test our hypotheses in heterogeneous human tumor data, but it was a worthwhile risk to take.  The findings, they said, show that the stress response in cancer cells serves as an unpredicted link between aneuploidy and immune cells to  diminish immune competence and anti-tumor effects.  It also demonstrates that molecules released by aneuploid cells affect another type of immune cells   macrophages   by subverting their normal function to turn them into tumor-promoting actors.  The findings offer new opportunities to understand tumor progression as a balance between the progressive accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities during tumor evolution and the progressive decay of anti-tumor immunity, said the authors, with the signaling response to stress gauging and regulating the relationship.  In practical terms, they said, a new aneuploidy score defining the burden of chromosomal abnormalities, developed for the study, could set a new paradigm for assessing the biological stage of tumor progression in patients and be used to extrapolate immune status.   It may also inform on new opportunities for pharmacological or genetic interventions that interfere with specific branches of the UPR as the mediator of aneuploidy-driven local immune dysregulation. This non-immunological approach could make immunotherapy of cancer more efficient,  said Zanetti.Reference: Xian S, et al.

Over the decades, as rock music became more mainstream, public condemnation of casual sex and illicit drugs endured. Why was that? Part of the answer may reside in our genes.New research published in the journal Psychological Science suggests that there is a common genetic basis underlying a person s disapproval of noncommittal sex and their condemnation of recreational drug use. This research helps psychologists better understand how heredity may relate to some of our deeply held moral values. People adopt behaviors and attitudes, including certain moral views, that are advantageous to their own interests,  said Annika Karinen, a researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands and the lead author on the paper.  People tend to associate recreational drug use with noncommitted sex. As such, people who are heavily oriented toward high commitment in sexual relationships morally condemn recreational drugs, as they benefit from environments in which high sexual commitment is the norm. Past studies have shown that openness to engage in noncommittal sex is partially explained by genes; the rest is explained by the unique environment not shared by siblings.Karinen and her colleagues wanted to study if moral views concerning drug use, which surveys have shown closely correlate with openness to noncommittal sex, were influenced by the same genetic factors.To tease out hereditary from environmental factors, the researchers surveyed 8,118 Finnish fraternal and identical twins to examine how open they were to recreational drug use and to sex outside of a committed relationship. Participants answered questions that gauged their moral views of situations in which people used recreational drugs, such as at a party or with friends. The participants were also asked questions that evaluated their openness to noncommitted sex.The researchers then compared fraternal and identical twin pairs to assess the extent to which condemnation of recreational drugs, openness to noncommittal sex, and the relationship between the two was explained by (a) genes, (b) the shared environment such as growing up in the same household or community, or (c) unique experiences and environments not shared by the twins. The researchers found that moral views concerning both recreational drugs and openness to noncommitted sex are approximately 50% heritable, with the remaining 50% explained by the unique environment.Furthermore, approximately 75% of the relationship between openness to noncommitted sex and moral views concerning recreational drugs was explained by genetic effects, and the remainder was explained by the unique environment. The researchers also found substantial overlap in the genetic effects underlying both factors namely, that approximately 40% of the genes underlying openness to noncommitted sex also underlie moral views concerning recreational drugs. These findings suggest that the genetic effects that influence openness to noncommitted sex overlap with those that influence moral views concerning recreational drugs,  said Karinen.  Important parts of hot-button culture-war issues flow from differences in lifestyle preferences between people, and those differences in lifestyle preferences appear to partly have a genetic basis.

In terms of clinical effects, the mice sensitized to a specific allergen that consumed cadmium produced high levels of antibodies against the allergen as well as immune cells that increased their respiratory symptoms. Separate epidemiological research has shown an association in children between vitamin D deficiency and higher susceptibility to asthma and other allergy symptoms. And a Congressional report released on Sept. 29 disclosed an unexpected source of cadmium in kids, announcing that dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals, including cadmium, had been detected in several brands of baby food.  The problem is, because cadmium doesn t degrade easily   it has a half-life in the body of at least 15 years   if you are chronically exposed to low doses, it accumulates over time,  said Prosper Boyaka, professor and chair of veterinary biosciences at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study.  It s also not something we can easily avoid being exposed to because it can remain in air, soil and water.  Most people ingest the natural element cadmium, a heavy metal used for batteries and making pigments, by eating plant and animal foods that have absorbed the pollutant or drinking contaminated water. The Environmental Protection Agency lists cadmium among eight metals considered extremely toxic at small concentrations. Boyaka and colleagues found that an experimental compound that inhibits the activated enzymes reduced the allergic response in mice that ingested cadmium.  We proposed two possible strategies in the paper,  Boyaka said.  One is vitamin D supplementation, but that has to happen before cadmium exposure has caused a heightened allergic reaction, so the question would be when to use a supplement. We also propose targeting those enzymes as a way to prevent the heightened allergic response.  The research was published recently in the journal Mucosal Immunology. Environmental pollutants such as cadmium and lead are considered contributors   along with genetic predisposition and overuse of antibiotics   to the growing number of people with allergies, but the mechanisms behind that association aren t well-understood, Boyaka said. In this study, researchers added what is considered a  subtoxic  dose of cadmium to drinking water consumed by groups of mice for 28 days. Using a mouse model that simulates human genetic predisposition to an egg allergy, the team exposed the mice to an egg protein to test their allergic response. Mice that drank water containing subtoxic doses of cadmium and then were exposed to the allergen had a stronger allergic reaction   in the form of internal inflammatory actions and allergy symptoms   than the response in control mice.  Our hypothesis was that cadmium would change the microbe population in the gut because we know that dysbiosis, or a change in the microbiota, can drive allergic responses. And yes, giving those tiny, tiny doses of cadmium in the drinking water did change allergic sensitization,  Boyaka said. The effect was known to occur in the gut, as expected, because germ-free mice, which lack intestinal microbes, that were orally exposed to cadmium did not over-produce the antibody that causes an allergic response. But the researchers determined the cadmium wasn t killing cells or making the intestines leaky. A series of experiments linked cadmium in the gut to production of inflammatory molecules   as well as to stimulation of the two enzymes that degrade vitamin D.  That s the main finding   after exposure to subtoxic doses of heavy metals, the pollutants remain in soft tissue, including in the gut. And what they do is make cells more reactive. In the gut, specifically, bacteria will make certain cells produce more of the enzyme that degrades vitamin D,  Boyaka said.  That s a connection that we did not know before.  Boyaka s lab is now investigating potential compounds that could be used to block the vitamin D-degrading enzymes.ReferenceKim E, Bonnegarde-Bernard A, Opiyo SO, et al.

Now, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign researchers have developed a finely tuned molecular agent that can target lung and other cancer cells for imaging and treatment.In a paper published in the journal Nature Chemistry, the researchers described the molecule s ability to target lung cancer cells, image them and deliver targeted treatment in cultures of human cancer cell lines as well as in live mice.The researchers picked a surprising biomarker to target: glutathione, a molecule naturally produced in tissues throughout the body but expressed in greater quantities in lung cancer. Because of its ubiquity, they said, it has not been a good target for treatments such as chemotherapy. One of the biggest issues with developing diagnostic tools or targeted drugs is off-target effects,  said Illinois chemistry professor Jefferson Chan, who conducted the study with graduate student Melissa Lucero.  When you give a patient a chemotherapeutic, it s kind of an arms race: You re killing the cancer cells, but you re also killing the rest of the body because so many things are similar. We used a unique chemistry approach to tune the reactivity of our molecule, so that we re targeting what would typically be considered a bad biomarker. The researchers tuned the dynamic range of the molecule so that it would not react to glutathione under healthy conditions but would react with the excess glutathione made by cancer cells.The researchers paired their targeting molecule with an agent for photoacoustic imaging, so that they could see where it was reacting and verify that it was targeting the lung cancer. The imaging agent responds to light and gives off an acoustic signal that can be picked up by an ultrasound transducer. It s a light-in, sound-out technique. It has a lot of advantages over traditional medical imaging. This imaging is powerful because of its resolution, its safety profile and its ability to interact with these designer molecules that tell us so much information at the molecular level,  Chan said.  There are hand-held and laparoscopic light devices that seamlessly integrate with ultrasound machines in hospitals, so we know when we develop molecules like this there are clinical applications. The researchers first tested the new molecule s imaging capabilities in cell cultures and found that it distinguished between healthy and cancerous cells. To gauge the diagnostic potential, they performed a blind study in live mice, using the photoacoustic probe to identify which mice in a cohort had lung cancer tumors. This study marks the first time that photoacoustic imaging has been successfully applied in lung tissue, Lucero said.Then, the researchers explored whether their targeted approach could be used to deliver treatment directly to the site of cancer cells, which would eliminate the biggest drawback of chemotherapy and other cancer treatments: toxicity to the whole body.They created a prodrug, dubbed PARx, that combines their targeted imaging probe with a powerful chemotherapy drug and tested it in the mice. They found that PARx inhibited tumor growth, without the mice displaying signs or symptoms of off-target toxic effects such as weight loss or liver damage. In contrast, a group of mice that received a control instead of the drug had significant tumor growth over the three-week treatment course. We found we could use high doses or frequent doses of the drug with no off-target effects,  Lucero said.  Then we did some more experiments in other clinically relevant mouse models, finding and treating cancer that had metastasized to the liver as well as primary tumors, which shows the potential for broad application of this approach. Next, the researchers are working to improve the selectivity and detection capabilities even further so that they can detect micro-metastases, or tiny clusters where the cancer has spread, anywhere in the body. They are also looking to apply their approach to other biomarkers, creating fine-tuned targeting molecules for other cancers. When you re targeting a disease like lung cancer, something that s a death sentence for a lot of people, you know it should be possible to diagnose it at an early stage, before symptoms manifest, by simply going after the right biomarker,  Chan said.  Now we have the first steps to be able to diagnose it, and also there s hope for treatment, because by using chemistry, we can counter the toxicity of these drugs and actually make them safe for general application.

Now, a team of scientists led by Associate Professor Nicola Allen has found one way that neurons and astrocytes work together to form healthy connections called synapses. This insight into normal astrocyte function could help scientists better understand disorders linked to problems with neuronal development, including autism spectrum disorders. The study was published September 8, 2021, in the journal eLife. We know that astrocytes could play a role in neurodevelopmental disorders, so we wanted to ask: How are they playing a role in typical development?  says Allen, a member of the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory.  In order to better understand the disorders, we first have to understand what happens normally. Synapses form critical connections between neurons, allowing neurons to send signals and information throughout the body. Astrocyte cells play a role in synapse development by giving neurons directions, such as telling them when to start growing a synapse, when to stop, when to prune it back, and when to stabilize the connection.Allen and her team took a closer look at how this process plays out in the visual cortex of the mouse brain. They sequenced the RNA of astrocytes at different stages of brain development to assess gene activity and compared it with neuronal synapse development. They found that astrocyte signaling was directly related to each stage of neuronal development. The researchers then wanted to know how the astrocytes knew to make these signals at the right time.First, the researchers looked at what happened to the astrocytes when they changed the neurons  activity. To do this, they stopped neurons from releasing a neurotransmitter called glutamate that can signal to astrocytes, and this stopped the astrocytes from showing the typical developmental changes. Next, the scientists stopped the astrocytes from responding to neurotransmitters, and found this stopped the astrocytes from expressing the right signals. With both these manipulations, the development of synapses was also disrupted, in line with the changes observed in the astrocytes.Collectively, the findings suggest that astrocytes are responding to neurotransmitters produced by neurons to control the timing of when astrocytes produce signals to instruct neuronal development, according to Allen. It makes sense that you have this constant feedback going on between the neuron and the astrocyte,  says Allen.  They are sending signals to each other:  Am I in the right place?   Yes, you are.   I ve made a connection now do I keep it?   Yes, you do.  And they keep going back and forth. Next, Allen and her team are studying whether these signals can be manipulated for example, to stimulate neurons to repair synapses or form new ones in disorders of aging, such as Alzheimer s disease.Reference: Farhy-Tselnicker I, Boisvert MM, Liu H, et al.

They present AbacusSummit in several papers published October 25 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.AbacusSummit was produced by researchers at the Flatiron Institute s Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) in New York City and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Made up of more than 160 simulations, it models how gravitational attraction causes particles in a box-shaped universe to move about. Such models, known as N-body simulations, capture the behavior of dark matter, which makes up most of the universe s material and interacts only via gravity. This suite is so big that it probably has more particles than all the other N-body simulations that have ever been run combined   though that s a hard statement to be certain of,  says Lehman Garrison, lead author of one of the new papers and a CCA research fellow.Garrison led the development of the AbacusSummit simulations along with graduate student Nina Maksimova and astronomy professor Daniel Eisenstein, both of the Center for Astrophysics. The simulations ran on the U.S. Department of Energy s Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility in Tennessee.AbacusSummit will soon come in handy, as several surveys will produce maps of the cosmos with unprecedented detail in the coming years. These include the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the Euclid spacecraft. One of the goals of these big-budget missions is to improve estimations of the cosmic and astrophysical parameters that determine how the universe behaves and how it looks.Scientists will make those improved estimates by comparing the new observations to computer simulations of the universe with different values for the various parameters   such as the nature of the dark energy pulling the universe apart. With the improvements offered by the next-generation surveys comes the need for better simulations, Garrison says. The galaxy surveys are delivering tremendously detailed maps of the universe, and we need similarly ambitious simulations that cover a wide range of possible universes that we might live in,  he says.  AbacusSummit is the first suite of such simulations that has the breadth and fidelity to compare to these amazing observations. The project was daunting. N-body calculations   which attempt to compute the movements of objects, like planets, interacting gravitationally   have been among the foremost challenges in the field of physics since the days of Isaac Newton. They re tricky because each object interacts with every other object, no matter how far apart they are. This means that as you add more objects, the number of interactions rapidly increases.There is no general solution to the N-body problem for three or more massive bodies. The calculations available are simply approximations. A common approach is to freeze time, calculate the total force acting on each object, then nudge each one based on the net force it experiences. Time is then moved forward slightly, and the process repeats.Using that approach, AbacusSummit handled colossal numbers of particles thanks to clever code, a new numerical method and lots of computing power. The Summit supercomputer was the world s fastest at the time the team ran the calculations.The team designed their codebase   called Abacus   to take full advantage of Summit s parallel processing power, whereby multiple calculations can run simultaneously. Summit boasts lots of graphics processing units, or GPUs, that excel at parallel processing.Running N-body calculations using parallel processing requires careful algorithm design because an entire simulation requires a substantial amount of memory to store. That means Abacus can t just make copies of the simulation for different nodes of the supercomputer to work on. So the code instead divides each simulation into a grid. An initial calculation provides a fair approximation of the effects of distant particles at any given point in the simulation. (Distant particles play a much smaller role than nearby particles.) Abacus then groups nearby cells and splits them off so that the computer can work on each group independently, combining the approximation of distant particles with precise calculations of nearby particles.For large simulations, the researchers found that Abacus  approach offers a significant improvement on other N-body codebases, which divide the simulations irregularly based on the distribution of particles. The uniform divisions used by AbacusSummit make better use of parallel processing, the researchers report. Additionally, the regularity of Abacus  grid approach allows a large amount of the distant-particle approximation to be computed before the simulation even starts.Thanks to its design, Abacus can update 70 million particles per second per node of the Summit supercomputer (each particle represents a clump of dark matter with 3 billion times the mass of the sun). The code can even analyze a simulation as it s running, looking for patches of dark matter indicative of the bright star-forming galaxies that are a focus of upcoming surveys. Our vision was to create this code to deliver the simulations that are needed for this particular new brand of galaxy survey,  says Garrison.  We wrote the code to do the simulations much faster and much more accurately than ever before. Eisenstein, who is a member of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument collaboration   which recently began its survey to map an unprecedented fraction of the universe   says he is eager to use Abacus in the future. Cosmology is leaping forward because of the multidisciplinary fusion of spectacular observations and state-of-the-art computing,  he says.  The coming decade promises to be a marvelous age in our study of the historical sweep of the universe. Reference: Maksimova NA, Garrison LH, Eisenstein DJ, Hadzhiyska B, Bose S, Satterthwaite TP.

Now, a new study into their immune responses identifies a potential mechanism by which these symptoms emerged.The study, led by researchers at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and the UCSF Department of Pediatrics, is the first to look at anti-neural antibodies    turncoat  antibodies that may attack brain tissue   in pediatric patients who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2.Over a duration of five months in 2020, a total of 18 children and teens were hospitalized with confirmed COVID at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospital San Francisco, according to the study publishing in JAMA Neurology on Oct. 25, 2021. They included the three patients in the study who underwent neurological evaluations.The researchers examined the patients  cerebrospinal fluid, obtained via lumbar puncture, and found that two of the patients, both of whom had histories of unspecified depression and/or anxiety, had antibodies indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may have invaded the central nervous system. The same patients, who had mild/asymptomatic COVID, also had anti-neural antibodies in their cerebrospinal fluid, which were identified by immunostaining brain tissue. This suggests an immune system running amok, mistakenly targeting the brain instead of infectious microbes.Autoantibody Parallel in Adults with Neurological SymptomsThe research follows a UC San Francisco study with Yale, published on May 18, 2021, in Cell Reports Medicine, that also found a high level of autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of adult patients with acute COVID, who had neurological symptoms, including intractable headaches, seizures and loss of smell. It is way too soon to know whether COVID is a common trigger for neuropsychiatric illnesses, but it does seem to be a potent trigger for the development of autoantibodies,  said co-corresponding author Samuel Pleasure, MD, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Neurology and of the UCSF Weill Institute.  It is currently totally unknown whether patients predisposed to neuropsychiatric illnesses are more likely to develop worsened symptoms after COVID, or whether COVID infection can act as an independent trigger. Efforts to identify an autoantibody shared by patients with similar neuropsychiatric symptoms have so far failed, said co-first author Christopher Bartley, MD, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Psychiatry and of the UCSF Weill Institute.  These autoantibodies may be most clinically meaningful as markers of immune dysregulation, but we haven t found evidence that they are actually causing the patients  symptoms. There s certainly more work to be done in this area. Unlike most psychiatric presentations, the three patients in the UCSF study had symptoms with sudden onset and rapid progression, representing a marked change from their baselines, said co-first author Claire Johns, MD, of the UCSF Department of Pediatrics.  The patients had significant neuropsychiatric manifestations despite mild respiratory symptoms, suggesting potential short and long-term effects of COVID.  After weekslong hospitalizations and ongoing psychiatric medications, the two UCSF patients, whose cerebrospinal fluid tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and anti-neural antibodies, were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, an immunomodulatory therapy that curbs inflammation in autoimmune disorders. Five days later, the first patient had  more organized thoughts, decreased paranoia and improved insight. This patient was also found to have autoantibodies targeting the protein TCF4, which is genetically implicated in some cases of schizophrenia. However,  we don t know that the antibodies are actually interfering with the protein s function,  said co-corresponding author, Michael R. Wilson, MD, of the UCSF Department of Neurology and of the UCSF Weill Institute, noting that the diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on a constellation of symptoms, rather than a specific biomarker.The second patient appeared to have a modest response to immunotherapy with improved cognition and working memory, but continued to have  impaired mood and cognitive symptoms  six months later. The third patient, who had no psychiatric history and had neither SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor anti-neural antibodies in their cerebrospinal fluid, made a complete recovery with psychiatric medications. His symptoms were ultimately attributed to recreational drug use.Immunotherapy Prompts Swift Response in Adult with PsychosisA more dramatic response was reported in a case-study by Yale and UCSF, published in Biological Psychiatry, on April 9, 2021, that documented a 30-year-old patient with mildly symptomatic COVID who presented at a hospital emergency department with delusions, violent outbursts, hyper-anxiety and paranoia. After failing to achieve a lasting remission with antipsychotic medications, he was diagnosed with possible  autoimmune-mediated psychosis  and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. His symptoms improved after the first day of treatment and he was eventually discharged without antipsychotic medications. We can t say, based on such a limited number of patients, whether immunotherapy played any role in the patients  clinical course,  cautioned Wilson.  In the cases of the two UCSF patients, we cannot rule out that they improved independent of immunotherapy, due either to concurrent treatment with psychiatric medications or the passage of time. Nonetheless, the researchers agree it s unlikely that there were pre-existing autoantibodies, and they point to other disorders with psychiatric symptoms, like anti-NMDAR encephalitis syndrome, that are caused by anti-neural antibodies and respond to treatment directed at these rogue antibodies.The researchers agree that more study is warranted, although Pleasure noted that one obstacle in expanding this research is the paucity of cerebrospinal fluid samples from pediatric patients.  We don t get to study the cerebrospinal fluid in kids very often,  he said.  Children with COVID are only very rarely sick enough to warrant a lumbar puncture, and kids who are very sick with multisystem inflammatory disease usually don t have a specific reason to get one. Meanwhile, mounting research suggests that COVID increases one s risk for psychiatric and neurological effects. A study from the United Kingdom published earlier this year found that of approximately 250,000 patients with COVID over the age of 10, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following six months was 34 percent; with 13 percent receiving their first such diagnosis.Reference: Bartley CM, Johns C, Ngo TT, et al.

During the AstraZeneca-Oxford trial, some human participants erroneously received a half dose of their first shot, followed by a full dose for their second shot. Paradoxically, the trial showed that volunteers who got a lower dose of the first shot were better protected against COVID-19 than those who received two full doses. However, it was not clear if the improvement of the low-dose vaccine was due to the dose itself or the fact that people who received the lower dose had also had a longer time between the first and the second shot, known as an extended prime-boost interval. Scientists from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine tested the effect of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prime dose in mice and found that a lower-dose first shot, followed by a full-dose booster shot, significantly improved the potency of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The booster shot produced more antibodies and T-cells in the mice, allowing them to develop much more robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, the study found. The findings were recently published in the journal Science Immunology. ","Published: October 26, 2021"

Professor Marie-Claude Rousseau, a researcher in epidemiology at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), along with researchers from the Universit  de Sherbrooke,  Universit  de Montr al, and Universit  Laval, has conducted the first-ever study in Quebec comparing childhood vaccination status in people with COVID-19 and a control group. Professor Marie- lise Parent and research officer Jennifer Yu, both from INRS, were also part of the team.The research, published in the Vaccine journal, brings new light on the possible link between the BCG vaccine and COVID-19. The researcher recalls that a potential protective effect of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 was the subject of a great deal of scientific and media interest very early in the pandemic.   In the past year, we have had 25 times more requests from the public to verify whether they had received the BCG vaccine as a child,  says professor Rousseau who is also the scientific manager of the Quebec BCG vaccination registry hosted by INRS, a unique computerized resource that lists 4.2 million vaccination certificates issued in the province between 1956 and 1992. Our study has shown convincingly that BCG, a strong stimulator of innate immunity, does not confer very long-term protection against COVID-19. This is not the result we were hoping for, but at least this matter, especially relevant for countries in the South, can be taken off the table,  says Dr. Jacques P pin, first author of the study and associate professor at the Universit  de Sherbrooke and the CHUS Research Centre. Professor Rousseau has been awarded a project grant of nearly $400,000 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) allowing her, among other things, to test these results on a larger cohort of 400,000 people among the last generations to have received the BCG vaccine.The main objective of this new project is to examine the overall non-specific effects of BCG vaccination over the long term and to see if people who have been vaccinated with BCG have a better survivability.The researcher will also look at whether the vaccine provides a protective effect against other infectious agents such as pneumococcus, group A streptococcus and meningococcus.Reference: P pin J, Labb  A-C, Carignan A, et al.

Most notably, they excel at predicting the next word in a string of text; this technology helps search engines and texting apps predict the next word you are going to type.The most recent generation of predictive language models also appears to learn something about the underlying meaning of language. These models can not only predict the word that comes next, but also perform tasks that seem to require some degree of genuine understanding, such as question answering, document summarization, and story completion. Such models were designed to optimize performance for the specific function of predicting text, without attempting to mimic anything about how the human brain performs this task or understands language. But a new study from MIT neuroscientists suggests the underlying function of these models resembles the function of language-processing centers in the human brain.Computer models that perform well on other types of language tasks do not show this similarity to the human brain, offering evidence that the human brain may use next-word prediction to drive language processing. The better the model is at predicting the next word, the more closely it fits the human brain,  says Nancy Kanwisher, the Walter A. Rosenblith Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, a member of MIT s McGovern Institute for Brain Research and Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), and an author of the new study.  It s amazing that the models fit so well, and it very indirectly suggests that maybe what the human language system is doing is predicting what s going to happen next. Joshua Tenenbaum, a professor of computational cognitive science at MIT and a member of CBMM and MIT s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and Evelina Fedorenko, the Frederick A. and Carole J.

The data from the study can help millions alleviate depression symptoms more effectively and is now available to clinicians and patients in an online database. Effectiveness of Common Antidepressants: A Post Market Release Study, released today in EClinical Medicine (published by The Lancet), summarizes the experiences of patients who have multiple comorbidities, or medical conditions, with using 15 different antidepressants. The study, by Farrokh Alemi, PhD, professor in Mason College of Health and Human Services Department of Health Administration and Policy and collaborators, analyzed data from more than 3.6 million patients with major depression who had more than 10 million antidepressant treatments. Patients were broken into more than 16,000 subgroups based on conditions, demographic information, and prescribed medications to analyze their experiences using antidepressants. Janusz Wojtusiak, PhD, associate professor, used the data to build a Web site designed to help individuals with depression find what will work best for them. By entering a patient s medical history into the site, users can find similar cases in the data and receive recommendations for antidepressants based on the experience of symptom remission in other patients. Patients can share those recommendations with their clinicians to ensure their appropriateness for their individual case. Unlike with previously published randomized studies, the remission rates in the study differed significantly based on the subgroup s medical history,  says Alemi.  The choice of the optimal antidepressant depended on the subgroup matched to the patient s medical history.  As an example, Alemi says, in the age and gender subgroups, the best antidepressant had an average remission rate of 50.78 percent, 1.5 times higher than the average antidepressant, which has a 30.3 percent remission rate. This was 20 times higher than the worst antidepressant used in the age and gender subgroup. Reference: Alemi F, Min H, Yousefi M, et al.

These results are remarkable given that brain training focuses specifically on improving these aspects of cognition, while language learning does not. As well, those who learned Spanish reported greater enjoyment than those who engaged in brain training.This study, published in the journal Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition, is among the first to examine whether the process of learning a language can benefit brain health in similar ways as bilingualism. These results are exciting because they indicate that older adults can reap cognitive benefits from an enjoyable activity in which they might want to participate, regardless of these benefits,  says Dr. Jed Meltzer, Baycrest s Canada Research Chair in Interventional Cognitive Neuroscience, a neurorehabilitation scientist at Baycrest s Rotman Research Institute (RRI) and the lead author on this study.Evidence suggests that bilingualism has a protective effect on brain health, with bilinguals developing dementia later in life than monolinguals. However, little is known about the cognitive impact of the process of learning a second language without becoming fully bilingual. The participants in our study showed significant cognitive improvements without becoming nearly fluent in Spanish, which suggests that you don t have to be bilingual for your brain to benefit from working with another language,  says Dr. Ellen Bialystok, Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Psychology at York University, and Adjunct Scientist at the RRI.  This is encouraging since bilingualism is often reached early in life and difficult to achieve in adulthood, while we can choose to learn another language at any age to reap some of the cognitive benefits enjoyed by bilingual individuals. In the study, the researchers recruited 76 older adults aged 65-75. All participants spoke only one language, were cognitively healthy, had never formally studied Spanish before and had not studied any other language in the past 10 years.Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: language learning, brain training or a waitlist (with no language learning or brain training), which served as the control group. For 16 weeks, those in the language learning group spent 30 minutes a day, five days a week learning Spanish using Duolingo, an online language learning app. Those in the brain training group spent the same amount of time but used BrainHQ by Posit Science.The researchers assessed participants  performance on specific cognitive tasks before and after the 16 weeks. These tasks were similar to the exercises in BrainHQ. At the end of the intervention, they also measured participants  adherence to the learning schedule and their enjoyment of the program they followed (language learning or brain training).They found that participants in the language learning group showed similar improvements as the brain training group in two areas of cognition: working memory and executive function   that is, the ability to manage conflicting information, stay focused and avoid distractions.In contrast, only the brain training group showed improvements in processing speed. This result was expected, since brain training specifically targets this skill by adding time pressure to each activity, while the language learning settings used in this study did not include any such pressure.Additionally, the language learning group reported more enjoyment of their program than the brain training group. This was reflected in their answers to a questionnaire as well as their adherence to the program: the language learning group followed the learning schedule more consistently than the brain training group did. Besides the cognitive benefits, learning a second language may enrich older adults  lives in other important ways   for instance, by leading to new friendships or opening the door to a new culture or travel, helping them live life to the fullest,  says Dr. Meltzer, who is also an Associate Professor in the Departments of Psychology and Speech-Language Pathology at the University of Toronto.This study was funded by a grant from the Centre for Aging + Brain Health Innovation (CABHI), with additional support from Duolingo. CABHI and Duolingo had no role in the study design, analysis or interpretation of results.With additional funding, the researchers could look at the brain health effects of language learning under time constraints, to see whether this might lead to similar improvements in processing speed as brain training. This would also better reflect real-world settings in which language is used, since we do not have infinite time to listen and respond when engaging in conversation.Reference: Meltzer JA, Kates Rose M, Le AY, et al.

It s what being  emotional  means to men vs. women that is part of a new University of Michigan study that dispels these biases.For instance, a man whose emotions fluctuate during a sporting event is described as  passionate.  But a woman whose emotions change due to any event, even if provoked, is considered  irrational,  says the study s senior author Adriene Beltz, U-M assistant professor of psychology.Beltz and colleagues Alexander Weigard, U-M assistant professor of psychiatry, and Amy Loviska, a graduate student at Purdue University, followed 142 men and women over 75 days to learn more about their daily emotions, both positive and negative. The women were divided into four groups: one naturally cycling and three others using different forms of oral contraceptives.The researchers detected fluctuations in emotions three different ways, and then compared the sexes. They found little-to-no differences between the men and the various groups of women, suggesting that men s emotions fluctuate to the same extent as women s do (although likely for different reasons). We also didn t find meaningful differences between the groups of women, making clear that emotional highs and lows are due to many influences not only hormones,  she said.The findings have implications beyond everyday people, the researchers say. Women have historically been excluded from research participation in part due to the assumption that ovarian hormone fluctuations lead to variation, especially in emotion, that can t be experimentally controlled, they say. Our study uniquely provides psychological data to show that the justifications for excluding women in the first place (because fluctuating ovarian hormones, and consequently emotions, confounded experiments) were misguided,  Beltz said.Reference: Weigard A, Loviska AM, Beltz AM.

Recent advances in early detection and targeted therapy have led to a growing success in treating breast cancer upon first presentation. This often is achieved by silencing tumour driving oncogenes and causing tumour regression. However, the survival of small numbers of tumour cells after initial therapy is an increasing challenge as such cells lead to subsequent recurrence of mostly incurable cancer in 20% to 40% of patients after a few years or even decades. The findings published today in Molecular Systems Biology are potentially relevant for breast cancer treatment outcomes as they can help tackling tumour recurrence.Oncogenes are genes whose elevated expression is associated with many cancers, as a result of either mutations or changes in control over their expression. One of the main processes involved in elevated oncogene expression during tumourigenesis is altered DNA methylation, the attachment of methyl groups to DNA molecules resulting in changes in expression of underlying genes. The European team analyzed methylation changes in the small number of cells that survive initial treatment responsible for what is known as Minimal Residual Disease (MRD). MRD can proliferate following a considerable dormancy phase and thereby cause incurable relapse of the cancer. Applying advanced data intensive techniques in a mouse model of breast cancer and integrating different levels of cellular behaviour, the metabolism and methylation of MRD cells were compared with the same processes in original tumour cells and normal healthy cells.  The main finding was that the resistant cells exhibited very similar metabolic behavior and methylation patterns to cells of the original tumour, but not to normal cells. However, they did not show other characteristics of the original tumour cells, such as high proliferation propensity and presence of oncogenic signalling. As such the researchers concluded that MRD cells carry some form of  metabolic and epigenetic memory  of the tumour state. This finding was confirmed using transcriptomic data derived from patients after they had received neo-adjuvant therapy, which is usually a form of chemotherapy to shrink the tumour prior to subsequent surgical excision. The researchers went on to demonstrate that memorized elevated glycolysis in MRD cells is crucial for their survival, generating the energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from glucose required to sustain cellular metabolism. This memory process is an obvious therapeutic target and the researchers have already identified a small molecule that inhibits that pathway in MRD without having any impact on normal healthy cells. While that molecule itself might not lead directly towards future therapies, an important aspect of this work is that it allowed obtaining an in-depth molecular view of MRD through comprehensive comparisons of the normal, tumour and treatment resistant state of the cells. Use of 3D cell cultures   also known as organoids - allowed the researchers to study the rare residual cells that are difficult to obtain in a clinical setting. The study thereby not only provides a specific target to tackle breast cancer relapse, but also an organoid approach that could in future be extended to patient-derived cells for precision medicine.Reference: Shechter KR, et al.

Scientists already know that the brain has a direct line to the reproductive organs affecting fertility and sperm count under stressful conditions. For example, emotional stress can lead to skipped menstrual periods in women. However, this latest study, published on Sept. 8 in Environmental Health Perspectives, connects the dots on how breathing polluted air can lower fertility.  Our findings showed that the damage due to air pollution at least to the sperm count could be remedied by removing a single inflammation marker in the brains of mice, suggesting that we may be able to develop therapies that could prevent or reverse the damaging effects of air pollution on fertility,  said lead study author Zhekang Ying, PhD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at UMSOM. Charles Hong, MD, PhD, the Melvin Sharoky, MD Professor in Medicine and Director of Cardiology Research at UMSOM said,  These findings have wider implications than just fertility, as there are many conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease that can result from brain inflammation due to air pollution.  About 92 percent of the world population lives in areas where the level of fine particles in the air smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter exceed the minimum safety standards set by the World Health Organization. These particles can come from sources such as car exhaust, factory emissions, wildfires, and woodburning stoves. In past studies, some results have shown that mice exposed to air pollution did not always have inflammation of the testes  the male sex organs that make sperm   meaning that some other mechanism was potentially responsible for reduced sperm counts. Knowing the direct link between the brain and the sex organs, the researchers tested whether air pollution increased inflammation in the brain. For this new study, researchers tested healthy mice and mice bred to lack a marker of inflammation in the brain, called Inhibitor Kappa B Kinase 2, or IKK2 for short, specifically located in the brain s neurons. They exposed both healthy and IKK2 mutant mice to filtered air or air pollution and then tested their sperm counts. The mice bred without the IKK2 inflammation marker in their neurons did not have reductions in their sperm counts when exposed to the polluted air, unlike the healthy mice. Researchers then removed IKK2 from specific neurons to determine more precisely how air pollution was leading to lower sperm counts. They found that one specific kind of neuron typically associated with sleep cycle and obesity was responsible for the reduced sperm count due to air pollution. These neurons typically are found in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain which controls hunger, thirst, and sex drive. The hypothalamus also works with the brain s pituitary gland, which makes hormones that communicate directly with reproductive organs.  Looking back, it makes perfect sense that the neurons in the hypothalamus are the culprits perpetuating this inflammation response that results in low sperm count, as we know that the hypothalamus is a major pathway link between the brain and the reproductive system,  said Dr. Ying. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs, UM Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Dean at UMSOM commented,   Environmental pollution is a problem of equity in that some persons who are poor or of color tend to face more severe health-related conditions due to greater exposure. It is important to explore the mechanisms by which pollution affects the body, so we can devise ways to prevent or treat these conditions to eliminate these health disparities.

SNG001 is the third agent to graduate to phase 3 in ACTIV-2, which is evaluating multiple investigational agents to treat early, symptomatic COVID-19 in non-hospitalized individuals. For more information about the trial, please visit the study website.ACTIV-2 is the first U.S. study to evaluate SNG001 (developed by Synairgen) among non-hospitalized people with COVID-19. SNG001 is self-administered as a nebulized dose (15.6 MIU) that participants inhale once daily for 14 days. Participants are trained to use the nebulizer device by study staff and take all doses at home. BRII-196/BRII-198 (a combination monoclonal antibody treatment) and SAB-185 (a novel polyclonal antibody therapy) are both currently also in phase 3 study in ACTIV-2. ACTIV-2 is currently evaluating treatment options that can be delivered in different ways, which is important as we aim to identify solutions that work for people who have a variety of needs, said ACTG Chair Judith Currier, M.D., M.Sc., University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  In addition to a combination monoclonal antibody infusion and polyclonal antibody infusion, this nebulized, inhaled version of interferon beta broadens potential treatment options for people who have COVID-19 but are not hospitalized, which we believe could significantly simplify care for some people with COVID-19. The ACTIV-2 DSMB recommended that SNG001 advance into a phase 3 study among participants with mild to moderate COVID-19. The planned phase 3 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SNG001 in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death among non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19.This article has been republished from the following materials.

But one team of researchers at Duke University says we might begin to get a glimpse of the future from just a few ounces of microbial soup.Every drop of pond water and teaspoon of soil is teeming with tens of thousands of tiny unicellular creatures called protists. They re so abundant that they are estimated to weigh twice as much as all the animals on Earth combined. Neither animals nor plants nor fungi, the more than 200,000 known species of protists are often overlooked. But as temperatures warm, they could play a big role in buffering the effects of climate change, said Jean Philippe Gibert, an assistant professor of biology at Duke. That s because of what protists like to eat. They gobble up bacteria, which release carbon dioxide into the air when they respire, just like we do when we breathe out. But because bacteria account for more of the planet's biomass than any other living thing besides plants, they are among the largest natural emitters of carbon dioxide   the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming. In a study published Oct. 19 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Gibert, postdoctoral researcher Dan Wieczynski and colleagues tested the effects of warming on bacteria-eating protists by creating mini ecosystems -- glass flasks each containing 10 different species of protists going about the business of eating and competing and reproducing. The flasks were kept at five temperatures ranging from 60 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Two weeks later, the researchers looked to see which species had survived at each temperature and measured how much CO2 they gave off during respiration.  To me, the question was a simple one,  Gibert said.  Is there something to be measured on living organisms, today, that may allow us to predict their response to increasing temperature, tomorrow?  The answer was yes. The researchers were surprised to find that each species  response to temperature could be predicted from just a few simple measurements of their size, shape and cell contents. And together, these factors in turn influenced respiration rates for the community as a whole. Protists such as this Euplotes are common in water, soil, even moss. Scientists say a few simple measures of a protist s cell size and shape can be powerful predictors of how they might respond to global warming. Courtesy of Dan Wieczynski.

They also found that by taking measurements such as cell size and shape and plugging them into a mathematical model, they could get very close to how things played out in their mini ecosystems in reality.  We can actually use what we know about the relationship between traits and temperature responses at the species level, and scale it all the way up to a whole ecosystem level,  Wieczynski said. The work is important because it sheds light on  how climate change will alter microbial communities and how this will feed back to influence the pace of climate change,  Wieczynski said.ReferenceWieczynski DJ, Singla P, Doan A, et al.

Bacteria are constantly exposed to viral attacks. A research team led by Martin Polz, a microbiologist at the University of Vienna, has now studied how bacteria defend themselves against viral predators. The study shows that bacteria have exchangeable genetic elements that are specifically designed for defense against viruses, allowing a bacterial population to switch its innate immunity surprisingly quickly. The question of how and how quickly bacteria develop resistance to viruses is of central importance for the development of phage-based therapies against bacterial infections.

Rare-earth metals are used for a variety of high-tech equipment from smartphones to submarines.The separation method, which uses carbon dioxide, water and food-grade citric acid, is the subject of a Sandia National Laboratories patent application. This technique not only recovers rare-earth metals in an environmentally harmless manner but would actually improve environments by reducing the toxicity of coal waste dotting America,  said Guangping Xu, lead Sandia researcher on the project. Harmless extraction of rare-earth metals from coal ash not only provides a national source of materials essential for computer chips, smart phones and other high-tech products   including fighter jets and submarines   but also makes the coal ash cleaner and less toxic, enabling its direct reuse as concrete filler or agricultural topsoil,  he said.The method, if widely adopted, could make coal ash, currently an environmental pariah, into a commercially viable product, Xu said.","Published: October 26, 2021"

In all those films, secret agent 007 washed his hands only twice, even though he often stayed in less than hygienic places with considerable health risks. If so, he must be sick much more often, thought PhD student Wouter Graumans of Radboudumc, when he had a serious food poisoning during a working visit to Burkina Faso. To test this, Graumans, along with epidemiologist Teun Bousema and malaria researcher Will Stone, systematically examined all the health risks in the 47 countries Bond visited. Using the advice of the Center for Disease Control as a benchmark. The results of their research have now been published in Travel Medicine & Infectious Diseases. Bond was at much greater risk than we always thought!In Live and Let Die, James Bond finds himself on an island among hungry crocodiles who love to devour him for lunch. Fortunately, he can distract the animals with pieces of raw chicken. Washing his hands thoroughly is out of the question, because he is already busy with an exploding drugs lab and a wild chase in a stolen speedboat. We see James Bond wash his hands only twice: after a meal in From Russia with Love and after killing an opponent in a mud bath in Diamonds Are Forever. But raw chicken is of course notorious for the risk of bacterial infections, such as Campylobacter, Salmonella and Clostridium, resulting in severe diarrhea. And it is precisely diarrhea that claims the most victims among travelers. The sex life of James Bond is above average. In his films Bond undertakes 59 amorous activities, an average of 2.4 per film. Bond changes partners very regularly and the time between first meeting and intercourse is extremely short. In Thunderball it is estimated to be 20 minutes, and when Bond lands with his parachute on a luxury yacht in The Living Daylights, it appears to be even shorter. Little time, then, for exchanging information about both partners' sexual histories or discussing contraception. That spontaneous unsafe sex is not entirely without risk is shown by the shockingly high percentage of partners who die shortly after intercourse with Bond, namely 27.1 percent. It should be noted, however, that sexually transmitted diseases do not play an obvious role in any of these deaths. James Bond drinks mostly 'Shaken, not stirred' martini cocktails, but we never see him with a hangover. Does he ever drink anything other than alcoholic beverages at all? Very sporadically, in 3 films. An orange juice in From Russia With Love, a coffee in Dr. No, and salt water in Casino Royale. The coffee contains poison, which knocks Bond out. The salt water he drinks to induce a vomiting reflex, again because he is poisoned. Maintaining fluid levels is clearly a concern with Bond. He exhibits extreme physical activity in often hot conditions, regularly dressing in inappropriate clothing, such as a black three-piece suit in The Spy Who Loved Me. He also does not use sunscreen in any of the films. Dehydration, sunstroke or heat stroke are thus lurking. In You Only Live Twice, James Bond walks for hours through the swaying tall grass in the Japanese mountains, with the blazing sun high in the sky, on his way to a rocket launching station. That he has no provisions with him, or at least a bottle of water, is rather unwise. But he did make the right choice with his long pants. After all, this type of grassland is full of two dangerous critters. Ticks transmit several pathogens, including a virus that causes meningitis. Mites can transmit bacteria (Orientia tsutsugamushi) in this part of the world, which causes scrub typhus. The lady walking along with Bond made a less than wise choice with her outfit: she is only wearing a bikini. The regular encounters between James Bond and his archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld, especially his white Persian cat, may well underlie Bond's recklessness. In Spectre, the cat even sits on Bond's lap. Could Bond have come into contact with Toxoplasmosis through the cat? Research shows that mice with a Toxoplasmosis infection are no longer afraid of cats and exhibit reckless behavior. A clever tactic by the parasite, as this makes the mouse fall prey to the cat much more quickly, and this ensures better spread of Toxoplasmosis. If Bond's brain is infected with Toxoplasmosis, that could possibly explain his reckless behavior and lack of fear. Autopsy on Bond's brain after his death may be needed to confirm this hypothesis. The researchers conclude that James Bond, like many travelers, pays too little attention to health risks. Moreover, his employer gives him too little time for thorough preparation for his trips. They call on M16 and his immediate superior M to take responsibility. After all, we only live once.ReferenceGraumans W, Stone WJR, Bousema T.

In severe COVID-19, however, this messenger is released at the very beginning of the infection, thus blocking the early control of the pathogen by the innate immune system. This was the conclusion of a study by Charit    Universit tsmedizin Berlin and the Leibniz Association s German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin (DRFZ), which has now been published in Nature. The early production of the immune-dampening TGF  messenger appears to be a hallmark of COVID-19 and has not been observed in other types of pneumonia. Correction of the immune system s faulty timing may therefore offer a new strategy for preventing severe disease.Transforming Growth Factor   (TGF ) is a biochemical messenger (cytokine) with multiple functions throughout the human body. In addition to playing an important role in embryonic development and tissue repair, it also has potent immune-modulatory effects. This  signaling molecule normally plays a role in downregulating the body s immune response once a pathogen has been successfully controlled. For this reason, production is normally timed to coincide with the end of an infection. With COVID-19, the situation appears to be different. Working alongside colleagues from the DRFZ, a multidisciplinary team of researchers from Charit  have revealed that patients with severe disease show an increase in the production of TGF  as early as the first week of infection.  We observed no such increase in other types of pneumonia, which came as a big surprise,  says the study s co-corresponding first author, Dr. Mario Witkowski, a researcher at Charit s Institute of Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Immunology. The team discovered that this untimely release of immune-dampening TGF  has an effect on the body s innate immune response, a branch of the body s immune system which has previously received markedly less attention from the global scientific community.The innate immune response is the first line of defense against pathogens entering the body. Though non-specific (i.e., the same for all pathogens), the innate immune response is ready to spring into action at any time. If this first line of defense fails to render the pathogen harmless, the second step is to activate the body s adaptive immune response   including both antibody-producing B cells and T cells   which targets and eliminates specific pathogens. However, the adaptive immune system must first acquire the ability to recognize these pathogens, and so its activation takes some time.The innate immune system is therefore critical to the body s ability to mount an immediate response against invading pathogens. If the pathogen in question is a virus, this response primarily involves the activation of  natural killer  ( NK ) cells, which are able to identify specific infection-related cell surface changes and thus to recognize virus-infected cells. NK cells can then eliminate these virus-infected cells using cellular toxins. For the first time, the Berlin-based team of researchers was able to show that NK cells also play a role in the early control of SARS-CoV-2. However, their ability to eliminate SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was impaired by the early release of TGF .The researchers began by isolating NK cells from the blood of men and women who had developed COVID-19 of varying degrees of severity. This was followed by functional analysis in the laboratory. A subsequent comparison with cells isolated from both healthy donors and patients with other severe respiratory diseases showed that NK cells are able to recognize and kill SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissue cells. Furthermore, the decrease in throat viral load was found to be particularly rapid in individuals whose blood had shown large numbers of these immune cells at the beginning of their SARS-CoV-2 infection.  In short, NK cells help the body fight SARS-CoV-2,  explains Dr. Witkowski.  According to our laboratory tests, however, cells isolated from patients with severe disease were far less effective against the virus than cells taken from individuals with mild symptoms. The researchers identified the early release of TGF  as the underlying cause. This conclusion was reached after analyzing more than 80,000 single NK cells from a total of 68 samples taken from COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. By establishing which genes had been activated in each of the cells, the researchers created an  atlas of gene expression  which provided extremely detailed data on immune cell responses. Their analysis also pointed to a profound effect being exerted by the immune-dampening cytokine TGF .  Our data show that, while NK cells are activated early in patients with COVID-19, they are then promptly blocked by TGF ,  says Dr. Mir-Farzin Mashreghi, head of the DRFZ research group which conducted the gene expression analyses.  NK cells find it harder to bind to virus-infected cells and are therefore unable to eliminate them.  This effect is primarily observed in COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Here, high levels of TGF  are seen in the initial days of infection. In contrast, individuals with mild symptoms only produce this chemical messenger after more than three weeks. In patients with other severe pneumonias, NK cells were not found to be affected by TGF . It is therefore clear that, in addition to other factors, the clinical course of COVID-19 is determined by the timing of the TGF  release,  explains co-corresponding author and study lead Prof. Dr. Andreas Diefenbach, Director of Charit s Institute of Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Immunology. Prof. Diefenbach, who also holds an Einstein Professorship for Microbiology and leads the DRFZ s Mucosal Immunology Research Group, describes his working hypothesis as follows:  It is likely that in most people with COVID-19, the innate immune system is able to push back against the virus shortly after infection. In some patients, however, the immune response to the pathogen is so profound that the body acts to correct this and produces TGF , the biochemical messenger which, among other things, impairs NK cell function. This of course happens at a point in time when SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be eliminated, meaning the blocking signal is sent too early. The end result of this faulty immune response is an inability to fight the virus in an effective manner, which in turn causes the damage typically associated with severe disease. We did not observe this combination of robust activation and simultaneous blocking of NK cells in patients with other infections like influenza; it appears to be a hallmark of COVID-19. Based on their findings, the researchers anticipate that the timely inhibition of TGF  could prevent progression to severe COVID-19. Candidates capable of blocking the chemical messenger are currently undergoing testing as part of clinical trials. They include a range of substances originally developed for use in the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, disorders in which TGF  also plays a role.  The use of anti-TGF  treatments to correct the timing of the body s immune response would make for an interesting strategy. Before anything else, however, it will be necessary to test the experimental TGF -inhibitors in animal models,  emphasizes Prof. Diefenbach.  We believe there is a further potential treatment target. It may be possible to target NK cells directly and, through their activation, restore their ability to eliminate SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. We will therefore study the precise mechanisms by which immune cells recognize and eliminate their target cells. Reference: Witkowski M, Tizian C, Ferreira-Gomes M, et al.

For cardiac disease, women almost uniformly fare far worse than men. There are likely many reasons for this, and scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Princeton University seemed to have found one deep inside cells before we re even born.Published in the journal Development Cell, this research suggests that male-female differences in protein expression occur immediately after embryonic cells become heart cells called cardiomyocytes. This is the earliest stage of heart development, well before the embryo is exposed to sex hormones.This comprehensive report is the first to detail the mechanisms of cardiac sex disparities at such an early stage, providing new opportunities for research of cardiac disease and treatment, as well as advancing the biological study of sex differences in this burgeoning field. Our studies show that sex biases in heart development occurs prior to primary sex determination and can be, and are, associated with sex bias congenital heart disease,  said co-senior author Frank Conlon, PhD, professor of genetics and biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Since sex disparities have been reported in many other disease states, including cancer, dementia, chronic kidney disease, obesity, autoimmune disease, and COVID19, our studies provide a framework for uncovering the mechanisms and pathways of these disease states, as well. This research was a collaboration between Conlon lab at the UNC School of Medicine, and the lab of co-senior author is Ileana Cristea, PhD, the Henry L. Hillman Professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton.Such health disparities between males and females have been known for a long time and led to  The Report of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Working Group on Sex Differences Research in Cardiovascular Disease  in 2016. Although sex plays a critical role in cardiac disease, the mechanisms underlying sex differences in cardiac health and disease have been unknown.Co-first authors Wei Shi, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Conlon lab, and Xinlei Sheng, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Cristae lab, led a systems-based approach to identifying the molecular differences, at both the RNA and protein levels of cells, between male and female embryonic and adult hearts in mice. They leveraged the power of the Collaborative Cross (CC) as a surrogate for human diversity, identifying the proteins, protein complexes, and protein pathways that are common between mammals and those that diverge between males and females. The CC is composed of eight founding strains of genetically diverse mice to address the many research shortcomings in most other available mouse-strain resources, including small numbers of strains, limited genetic diversity, and a less than ideal population structure.Conlon s team then defined the cell types that express a subset of these proteins to show differences in expression in the cardiomyocyte lineage between male and female hearts. Contrary to the current paradigm, we discovered that male-female cardiac sex differences are not solely controlled by hormones but also through a sex chromosome mechanism independent of sex hormones,  said Conlon, who is also a member of the UNC McAllister Heart Institute.  Our analysis showed that protein expression differs between male and female hearts at the embyronic period prior to primary sex determination and prior to the embryo being exposed to sex hormones. Understanding the basic biology of heart development at this very early stage provides crucial information for stem cell biologists interested in using cardiac progenitor cells for regeneration of heart tissue and other cardiac replacement therapies.Reference: Shi W, Sheng X, Dorr KM, et al.

Therefore, rapid screening for COVID-19 is becoming increasingly crucial. However, existing nucleic acid tests are not time-efficient enough and carry the risk of giving false results, leading to further spreading of the virus. Therefore, relying solely on nucleic acid testing poses public health and safety risks, and new detection methods are urgently needed.Recently, Professor Maosheng Yao from College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University integrated breath sampling, Ion mobility spectrometry detection for gas chromatography, and machine learning models to develop a non-invasive exhaled breath screening system for COVID-19 (TestBreathNow-TBN) in collaboration with Chaoyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other research partners. The team used the system to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 patients, non-COVID patients with respiratory diseases, and medical staff and identified 12 key breath-borne VOC biomarkers. The sampling process is completely non-invasive, with subjects using a disposable breathing bag and exhaling for only 30 seconds to complete the sampling process. The system is easy to operate, does not require any testing reagents, and can be used with machine learning models to achieve rapid screening of COVID-19 patients in 5-10 minutes, with significantly lower costs for a single test.The system is expected to play a major role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission by providing rapid screening for COVID-19 in situations such as testing for false-negative results, granting permissions to custom entry, and deciding whether to discharge COVID-19 patients from hospitals. This technology will contribute to China s prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.Reference: Chen H, Qi X, Zhang L, et al. COVID-19 screening using breath-borne volatile organic compounds.

That knowledge could be an important step toward the development of treatments for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer s disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy, all of which are related to dysfunction in the hippocampus.In their latest study, published in the journal Nature, the scientists studied rats in a virtual reality maze. While observing the activities of large numbers of individual neurons in each animal s hippocampus, the scientists discovered responses in those neurons that revealed a specific mechanism for navigation. The hippocampus is one of the first regions to be affected in memory-based diseases like Alzheimer s,  said the study s lead author, Jason Moore, a former UCLA postdoctoral scholar who is now at New York University.  So it is crucial to understand its functionality, flexibility and limits. The study could help explain why people with damage to the hippocampus struggle not just with so-called spatial tasks, like finding their way home or locating a lost set of keys, but also with memory tasks, such as recalling what they had for lunch or whether they took their daily medication.The experiment used a type of virtual reality system that was developed in Mehta s lab. The technology is intended to keep the animals comfortable and avoid causing dizziness and other symptoms that other VR systems can trigger.For the study, rats were placed on a small treadmill inside a box with images of a maze projected onto the container s walls. The rats were encouraged to run through the maze to find their reward, a drop of sugar water. In order to make it to the reward, rats needed to discern where they were in relation to the virtual objects around them, where they needed to go to receive their rewards and how far away the destination was.Several animals were tested over many sessions, enabling the researchers to observe how the neurons  responses changed as the rats learned to navigate the maze.The scientists observed that hippocampal neurons encoded multiple aspects of the animal s location   where it is in space, the angle of its body relative to its reward and how far it has moved along its path   a phenomenon called  multiplexing. That finding is significant because it had been widely thought that neurons in the hippocampus code only for position. We found that in the virtual maze, the neurons carry very little information about the rat s position,  said Mehta, a UCLA professor of neurology, neurobiology and physics.  Instead, most neurons encode for other aspects of navigation, such as distance traveled and which direction the body is heading. The scientists also observed that as the rats gained experience in the maze, their neurons  remembered  the maze even more reliably and accurately.Research in Mehta s lab and elsewhere over the past 25 years has shown that such changes in neurons  activity   or neuroplasticity   occur via a process neuroscientists call Hebbian learning. That process is mediated by a neurochemical called NMDA, which is a common target for drugs used to treat neurological disorders.Mehta said the neuroplasticity scientists observed in the rats is likely due to Hebbian learning across billions of synapses. That conclusion was further proven when the researchers injected the animals with substances to inhibit their NMDA, which impaired their performance in the maze. Remarkably, neuroplasticity was far greater in the virtual reality environment than in simpler, real-world mazes,  Mehta said.  Further, this boosted neuroplasticity was related to performance. Also contributing to the research were co-authors Jesse Cushman, Lavanya Acharya and Brianna Popeny, all of UCLA, as well as several UCLA undergraduate students.In future studies, Mehta and his colleagues will conduct similar research on rats and on humans with memory impairment, to test wither virtual reality can be used for early diagnosis and to evaluate the effectiveness of medications.Reference: Moore JJ, Cushman JD, Acharya L, Popeney B, Mehta MR.

Our study found no evidence of an increased risk for early pregnancy loss after COVID-19 vaccination and adds to the findings from other reports supporting COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,  write the study authors, which includes co-author Dr. Deshayne Fell, an Associate Professor in the School of Epidemiology and Public Health in the University of Ottawa s Faculty of Medicine and a Scientist at the Children s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) Research Institute. The findings are reassuring for women who were vaccinated early in pregnancy and support the growing evidence that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe. Dr. Fell, currently leading an Ontario study on the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and the international team behind the study found no relationship between the type of vaccine received and miscarriage. In Norway, the vaccines used included Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. It is important that pregnant women are vaccinated since they have a higher risk of hospitalizations and COVID-19-complications, and their infants are at higher risk of being born too early.

Nature has already developed strategies to transport liquids across surfaces in order to survive,  says MIE PhD Candidate Mohammad Soltani, lead author of a new paper recently published in Advanced Functional Materials. We were inspired by the structural model of natural materials such as cactus leaves or spider silk. Our new technology can directionally transport not only water droplets, but also low surface tension liquids that easily spread on most surfaces. The innovation has important implications for microfluidics, a field where small quantities of liquids are transported within tiny channels, often less than a millimetre wide. This technique has many applications, one of them being to miniaturize the standard analytical tests that are currently preformed in chemical laboratories.By reducing the quantity of sample and reagents required and automating protocols for working with them, microfluidics can power  lab-on-a-chip  devices that offer fast, inexpensive medical tests. Proponents dream of diagnosing multiple conditions in minutes using only a drop or two of blood.But current microfluidic devices have a key limitation: they can only effectively handle liquids with high surface tension, such as water. This property, also known as cohesion, means that the liquid has a greater tendency to stick to itself than to the sides of the channel it is being transported through.High surface tension liquids form discrete droplets that can be moved around independently, like raindrops on window glass. Cohesion can even be exploited to pull the liquid droplets along the channel through a process known as capillary action.By contrast, low surface tension liquids such as alcohols or other solvents tend to stick to the sides of the channels, and can currently be transported for only about 10 mm before the droplet completely disintegrates. Capillary action no longer applies, so this transport requires an external force, such as magnetism or heat, to move the droplets.The new coating developed by Golovin and his team enables low surface tension liquids to be transported over distances of over 150mm without losing any of the liquid, about 15 times as long as currently possible.The technology uses two newly developed polymer coatings, one of which is more liquid-repellent than the other. Both are composed of  liquid like  polymer brushes. The more repellent coating acts as a background, surrounding the less repellent coating and creating tiny channels along the surface. The channels allow for the liquids to move in a desired pattern or direction without losing any of the liquid during transport or requiring additional energy input. Polymer brush coatings reduce the fluid friction and allow the droplets to be transported passively,  says Soltani,  Less friction means more energy is available to transport the liquid. We then create a driving force by designing the channels with specific patterns. The ability to losslessly transport low surface tension liquids like alcohols and other solvents will allow for advancements in lab-on-a-chip devices. Researchers will be able to transport a wider variety of liquids and be able to build more complex devices. Using these unique coatings, researchers can transport liquids over a longer range, move multiple liquids at the same time along a precise pathway and even merge and split droplets   all without losing any volume or experiencing cross-contamination.In addition to allowing for more complexity in the field of microfluidics, this technology will limit waste in research labs. With no residue being left behind on the surface of the device and therefore no risk of cross-contamination, researchers can use the same devices over and over again. We re looking at using this technology for microfluidics bioassays, as this is an area where every drop of liquid is precious,  said Golovin,  This technology has a lot of potential to advance point-of-care diagnostics, for example for liver or kidney disease, where biological marker screening is often performed in non-aqueous media.

The findings, published in Evolution, Medicine and Public Health, suggest that breastfeeding may have a positive impact on postmenopausal women s cognitive performance and could have long-term benefits for the mother s brain. While many studies have found that breastfeeding improves a child s long-term health and well-being, our study is one of very few that has looked at the long-term health effects for women who had breastfed their babies,  said Molly Fox, PhD, lead author of the study and an Assistant Professor in the UCLA Department of Anthropology and the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences.  Our findings, which show superior cognitive performance among women over 50 who had breastfed, suggest that breastfeeding may be  neuroprotective  later in life. Cognitive health is critical for wellbeing in aging adults. Yet, when cognition becomes impaired after the age of 50, it can be a strong predictor of Alzheimer s Disease (AD), the leading form of dementia and cause of disability among the elderly   with women comprising nearly two-thirds of Americans living with the disease.Many studies also show that phases of a woman s reproductive life-history, such as menstruation, pregnancy, breastfeeding and menopause can be linked to a higher or lower risk for developing various health conditions like depression or breast cancer, yet few studies have examined breastfeeding and its impact on women s long-term cognition. Of those that have, there has been conflicting evidence as to whether breastfeeding might be linked to better cognitive performance or Alzheimer s risk among post-menopausal women. What we do know is that there is a positive correlation between breastfeeding and a lower risk of other diseases such as type-2 diabetes and heart disease, and that these conditions are strongly connected to a higher risk for AD,  said Helen Lavretsky, MD, the senior author of the study and a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA.  Because breastfeeding has also been found to help regulate stress, promote infant bonding and lower the risk of post-partum depression, which suggest acute neurocognitive benefits for the mother, we suspected that it could also be associated with long-term superior cognitive performance for the mother as well,  added Dr. Fox.To find out, the researchers analyzed data collected from women participating in two cross-sectional randomized controlled 12-week clinical trials at UCLA Health: 1) The  Brain Connectivity and Response to Tai Chi in Geriatric Depression and Cognitive Decline,  included depressed participants. 2) The  Reducing Risk for Alzheimer s Disease in High-Risk Women through Yoga or Memory Training that included non-depressed participants with some subjective memory complaints and a risk for heart disease.Among the two trials, 115 women chose to participate, with 64 identified as depressed and 51 non-depressed.  All participants completed a comprehensive battery of psychological tests measuring learning, delayed recall, executive functioning and processing speed. They also answered a questionnaire about their reproductive life-history that included questions about the age they began menstruating, number of complete and incomplete pregnancies, the length of time they breastfed for each child and their age of menopause.Importantly, none of the participants had been diagnosed with dementia, or other psychiatric diagnoses such as bipolar disorder, alcohol or drug dependence, neurological disorders or had other disabilities preventing their participation or taking any psychoactive medications. There was also no significant difference in age, race, education or other cognitive measures between the depressed and non-depressed participants.Key findings from the researchers  analysis of the data collected from questionnaires on the women s reproductive history revealed that about 65% of non-depressed women reported having breastfed, compared to 44% of the depressed women. All non-depressed participants reported at least one completed pregnancy compared to 57.8% of the depressed participants.Results from the cognitive tests also revealed that those who had breastfed, regardless of whether they were depressed or not, performed better in all four of the cognitive tests measuring for learning, delayed recall, executive functioning and processing compared to women who had not breastfed.Separate analyses of the data for the depressed and non-depressed groups also revealed that all four cognitive domain scores were significantly associated with breastfeeding in the women who were not depressed.  But in the women who were depressed, only two of the cognitive domains   executive functioning and processing speed   were significantly associated with breastfeeding. Interestingly, the researchers also found that longer time spent breastfeeding was associated with better cognitive performance. When they added up all the time a woman spent breastfeeding in her life, they found that women who did not breastfeed had significantly lower cognitive scores in three out of four domains compared to women who had breastfed for 1-12 months, and in all four domains compared to the women who had breastfed for more than 12 months. Women who had breastfed the longest had the highest cognitive test scores. Future studies will be needed to explore the relationship between women s history of breastfeeding and cognitive performance in larger, more geographically diverse groups of women. It is important to better understand the health implications of breastfeeding for women, given that women today breastfeed less frequently and for shorter time periods than was practiced historically,  said Dr. Fox.Reference: Fox M, Siddarth P, Oughli HA, et al.

Among the researchers was Vadim Nikulin, Leading Research Fellow of the Centre for Cognition & Decision Making at HSE University.The research, entitled  Alpha and beta neural oscillations differentially reflect age-related differences in bilateral coordination  has been published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging.Bilateral coordination is the ability to coordinate the left and right sides of the body while in motion an essential skill in everyday life. Those with impaired bilateral coordination can have difficulty with tasks such as clapping their hands or opening jars.There are two types of coordination: in-phase and anti-phase. During in-phase movements (such as catching a ball with both hands), the same muscles on both sides contract synchronously. During anti-phase movements (such as moving both arms to the same side at once), the muscles contract in an alternating fashion.Aging has been linked to a decline in bilateral coordination, particularly anti-phase coordination. The researchers proposed that age-related changes in in-phase and anti-phase coordination in older people are related to the fact that these processes are controlled by different mechanisms in the brain linked to neural oscillations.To test this hypothesis, the researchers conducted an experiment using electroencephalography (EEG). The participants comprised 25 younger subjects with an average age of 26, and 25 older subjects with an average age of 70.The subjects sat at a transparent table featuring a depiction of one out of eight possible circular arm movements. They were able to see their arms under the table. The subjects were asked to repeat a circular motion shown on the screen in time with a metronome. Two of the eight possible motions were in-phase and two were anti-phase. The remaining four motions required the use of one arm only. The researchers used multichannel EEG to record the subjects  brain activity.The researchers discovered that compared to the younger group, the older subjects displayed lower synchronization between different sides of the body during anti-phase movements. This explains why, for example, it becomes more difficult to perform such movements with age.Decreased synchronization during anti-phase movements was also linked to differences in brain activity while performing the movements. In younger subjects, the power of alpha waves in the right, non-dominant hemisphere of the brain decreased less during in-phase movements than during anti-phase movements. In older subjects, the power of alpha waves fell by the same amount during both types of movement.It is suggested that the power of alpha waves is linked to the level of active involvement in solving the given task. The lack of reduction in this power in the non-dominant hemisphere may reflect a compensation for the loss of these skills in older subjects, for example, that they need to more actively concentrate on the tasks.Comparable differences were observed between the power of beta waves in both age groups. In the younger group, beta waves decreased equally with both types of movement, while in the older group, beta waves fell more during anti-phase movements than during in-phase movements. This greater decrease may also reflect the need for additional processing of sensorimotor information during anti-phase coordination.Reference: Shih P-C, Steele CJ, Nikulin VV, et al.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Professor Bo Li and his lab found that mice have pre-programmed neurons and circuits that process  positive  and  negative  stimuli. Their findings may be useful for studying neurological and psychiatric disorders in humans.Are we born to fear punishment or crave rewards? Or do those capacities evolve with experience? Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor Bo Li and his lab found that mice have pre-programmed circuits that process  positive  and  negative  stimuli. These neurons are found in the mouse s amygdala, a section of the brain that deals with learning rewards and punishments. The researchers  findings may be useful for studying neurological and psychiatric disorders in humans.Previously, Li and his colleagues discovered that the amygdala is the hub for both fear- and reward-based learning. Xian Zhang, a postdoc in Li s lab, wanted to find out the exact circuitry that takes in positive or negative stimuli that trigger either pleasure or fear.In an experiment similar to how Pavlov s dog was taught to associate a bell sound with food, Li and Zhang trained mice to connect certain sounds with either a reward (a refreshing drink of water) or a punishment (an annoying puff of air to the whiskers). Then, in collaboration with CSHL Adjunct Professor Z. Josh Huang, they developed a method to mark and observe different neurons in the mouse amygdala. They discovered two distinct types of neurons: one that was activated when the mouse heard the reward sound, and one that was activated when it heard the punishment sound. Both neuron populations exist throughout the entire amygdala. Li explains: They re spatially intermingled. When you start to image them, you know that some of the neurons respond only to good things, some of the neurons respond only to bad things, just like the pepper and the salt mixed together, and they do different jobs. The researchers were surprised to discover that some amygdala cells are hardwired to process motivation stimuli, even without training. A puff of air or sip of water triggered the same neurons in both untrained and trained mice.Zhang thinks their findings may be relevant to human psychiatric disorders like depression. He says: If you have an imbalanced bit in different neural circuits, you probably have a deficit of your motivation, like you lost your interest in pursuing rewards, or you lost your interest in avoiding punishment. I think this finding is important to know for the future, to help people with depression or other mental disorders. In mouse models of depression, animals lack the motivation to seek rewards or avoid punishments. Li and Zhang hope that this study, published in Nature Neuroscience, will help researchers understand how motivation works or goes wrong in mammalian brains.Reference: Zhang X, Guan W, Yang T, et al.

Hiccups during the copying process of viruses cause recombination to take place: the exchange of segments of viral RNA. While this can lead to the emergence of new virus variants, the mechanism can also be exploited to induce non-viable defective viruses. The research is published today in Molecular Cell. The research, led by the research group of Professor Nynke Dekker, clarifies at the molecular level how RNA viruses recombine: when there is a hiccup in the RNA copying process (also known as replication), the molecular copying machinery (known as the polymerase) jumps from one RNA strand to another and continues copying there. This causes recombination, in which the RNA strand produced is a combination of different RNA strands, a process in that can lead to the development of new virus variants.Nynke Dekker: ""We first saw hiccups in the copying process at the molecular level in the lab, and could then observe its consequences for recombination in cells and finally in mice. It's really great that thanks to collaborations with other institutes we were able to figure out this mechanism.""","Published: October 25, 2021"

Walking patterns can be a revealing trait of health, but gait symptoms of disorders like Fragile X can escape the naked eye for years until they are visibly noticeable,  said study coauthor Elizabeth Torres, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and director of the Sensory Motor Integration Lab.  Given issues with anatomical differences such as people with longer or shorter limbs and disease complexity, it has remained challenging to use walking patterns to screen nervous system disorders more broadly, across disorders impacting people of different ages and developmental stages. According to the National Fragile X Foundation, approximately 1 in 468 men and 1 in 151 women are carriers of the abnormal gene that causes Fragile X syndrome. The National Organization for Rare Disorders notes over 30 percent of people with SHANK3 deletion typically require two or more chromosome studies before the deletion is detected. As such, the estimated prevalence is 2.5-10 per million births with equal likelihood of males and females being affected.In the study, researchers examined the walking movements that cannot be seen by the naked eye in 189 people to detect nervous system disorders.The microscopic movements are detectable using statistical techniques developed by Torres and causal forecasting methods developed by Rutgers graduate student Theodoros Bermperidis, alongside wearable motion-sensored sneakers created by Stevens Institute of Technology collaborators.The researchers combined gait data from various patients and those without any disorders using video, heart rates and wearable technology like a Fitbit. Participants completed a simple walking task while wearing the smart shoes that collected an assortment of signals across the body and feet.Torres and her team analyzed how the spikes derived from microvariations in the movements  stream, changed from moment to moment and at what rate. Instead of taking grand averages that discard these spikes as noise, they examined peaks, valleys and neighboring points surrounding the peaks, and causally determined important lags in the spikes  timing.The study provides a framework to help predict the early departure of normal walking patterns in healthy young people, both for normal aging and for participants who are Fragile X carriers. The methods help stratify a random draw of the population with autism-related disorders. Given that Fragile X and SHANK3-related syndromes remain high in other neurological conditions such as autism, Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and Parkinson s, this is an important way to detect signs of abnormal patterns,  said lead author Bermperidis.According to the research, gait declines naturally with typical aging. However, the hip, knee and ankle joints and the thigh, leg and foot bones are the first limbs impacted by aging.Doctors face the challenge of diagnosing a patient that comes to their office for the first time showing unusual gait patterns. Torres says biosensors paired with analytics and the doctor s broad experience can altogether offer much more than meets the eye.Reference: Bermperidis T, Rai R, Ryu J, et al.

Two of these compounds improved markers of the disease in human cells and rodents. The findings support broader use of this drug-repurposing platform for other non-cancerous conditions that don t yet have effective treatments. Repurposing drugs can cut down the time and cost of developing treatments for rare diseases, which historically don t receive much investment into research and drug development,  said senior author Stephen Chan, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine and director of the Vascular Medicine Institute at Pitt and UPMC.  Pulmonary hypertension is an example of a rare disease where there is an unmet need for new treatments, given its devastating consequences. We developed this pipeline to rapidly predict which drugs are effective for PH and get these treatments to patients faster. Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that occurs in the vessels that transport blood from the heart to the lungs. As the disease progresses and the heart must strain harder against these high pressures, it can lead to heart failure, multi-organ dysfunction and death. PH affects people of all ages but hits young women more often than men.One of these young women is Allison Dsouza, a 24-year-old nurse who not only lives with the condition herself but also treats PH patients in the UPMC Lung Transplant Program. She was diagnosed with PH as a high school senior after she started having trouble walking to her car and doing hobbies like horseback riding. According to Dsouza, she was the sickest patient with the highest lung pressures that her doctors had seen. PH is thought to be triggered by environmental and genetic factors that damage the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, leading to inflammation and abnormal repair that restrict blood flow or cause the loss of the thinnest branches of the lung vessel tree.The drugs currently available for PH dilate or relax these blood vessels, which can give relief from symptoms and prolong the time it takes for the disease to progress, but they re not curative. Dsouza receives a drug called Remodulin that is delivered continuously by a pump inserted under her skin. Within months of starting treatment, she walked a 5-kilometer race, started playing polo on horseback and enrolled in college to study nursing. The treatments are phenomenal, but they re also a huge burden on life,  said Dsouza.  Subcutaneous treatments cause severe pain, and intravenous treatments have a huge risk of infection that people can actually die from. The medication is lifesaving, but the side effects can kill you. And for some people, the therapies don t work. According to Chan, there is a need for drugs that target the origins of pulmonary hypertension.Given evidence that PH and cancer share numerous features, Chan hypothesized that vast molecular data from cancer studies could be leveraged to predict which cancer drugs may also target PH. To make those predictions, Chan collaborated with co-senior author Seungchan Kim, Ph.D., chief scientist and executive professor of electrical and computer engineering at Prairie View A&M University. They built a computational platform that analyzed gene expression data from 800 cancer cell lines exposed to hundreds of cancer therapeutics and assessed rewiring of gene networks associated with drug responses in these cells. When we overlay these networks with PH-specific gene networks, we can predict which drugs may be effective in treating PH,  Kim explained.The platform ranked each drug in terms of how its action depended on rewiring of PH-specific gene networks, and the researchers chose to further investigate two highly ranked compounds: I-BET762 and BRD2889.In human pulmonary endothelial cells, I-BET762 and BRD2889 modulated PH gene networks predicted by the platform genes that drive cell death under low-oxygen and inflammatory conditions, processes that promote PH.A drug in the same class as I-BET762 currently is being tested for PH in clinical trials led by Laval University coauthors. The computational analysis and experiments identified new molecular pathways for this drug class, indicating that the platform can offer novel insights into drugs already under study. Another promising compound, BRD2889 which is an analog of piperlongumine, a compound derived from long pepper plants that has anti-cancer properties had not previously been investigated for treating PH.When Chan and co-senior author Imad Al Ghouleh, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at Pitt, gave BRD2889 to mice and rats with PH, disease symptoms were reversed, suggesting that this compound has potential as a new PH drug. The researchers have applied for a provisional patent for BRD2889, and they plan to move the compound into clinical trials in the future.With evidence that drug candidates identified by the algorithm are effective at treating PH in animals, the researchers plan to go back and look more closely at other compounds predicted as potential treatments for the disease. And according to Chan, the applications of this study go far beyond PH. With this algorithm in hand, we may be able to repurpose existing cancer drugs for the treatment of other rare and emerging diseases,  said Chan.Reference: Negi V, Yang J, Speyer G, et al.

In a special, in-depth ethical risk assessment, the team has reached the decision to retire the older of the two remaining females, 32-year-old Najin, as a donor of egg cells (oocytes). This leaves the ambitious programme with just one female that can provide oocytes, Najin s daughter Fatu. Weighing up risks and opportunities for the individuals and the entire species rendered this decision without an alternative. This situation will further strengthen the need for stem cell associated techniques, which are also part of the BioRescue mission as well as long-term biobanking. Najin will remain an important part of the mission as an ambassador for her kind and by transferring social knowledge to future offspring.Najin was born in Safari Park Dv r Kr lov  (Czech Republic) in 1989 and was moved to Ol Pejeta Conservancy (Kenya) along with three other northern white rhinos in 2009 for a natural breeding programme. Five years later, scientists established that the last chance to survive for Najin and her kind lies in advanced techniques of assisted reproduction conducted by the BioRescue consortium. This approach relies on collecting oocytes from female northern white rhinos, which involves hormone stimulation, full anaesthesia and transrectal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval. In rhinos this procedure is absolutely new and although it is performed by the world-leading scientists and veterinarians from the BioRescue team in the most professional and reassuring manner, there are risks involved for the animals , says Jan Stejskal, director of international projects at Safari Park Dv r Kr lov .  Oocyte collections in Najin have yielded only few eggs and none of them could be fertilised successfully to become an embryo. Weighing this outcome with potential risks, it is the most responsible decision to cease any further intervention on Najin and to stop using her as a donor of oocytes. She will remain a part of the programme, for example by providing tissue samples for stem cell approaches, which can be performed with minimal invasion. This decision to stop the oocyte collection from Najin was reached under the guidance of the Ethics Laboratory for Veterinary Medicine, Conservation and Animal Welfare of Padua University. Prof Barbara de Mori and her team came to this recommendation after analysing all relevant ethical dimensions and desiderata, as well as conducting several moderated discussions with all stakeholders involved. Furthermore, they evaluated all the possible options using scientific methods such as decision trees and Bateson s cube to back the expertise of the people involved with a systematic, objective perspective. It was especially challenging to evaluate the importance of maximising the chances to save a species against the welfare of one individual animal , says Prof Barbara de Mori.  We identified the main choices and the combinations of decisions the consortium could make and then ranked them in light of desiderata such as avoiding major or minor accidents, the opportunity to repeat procedures and the successful harvest of oocytes , adds Dr Pierfrancesco Biasetti, scientist at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW) and member of the Ethics Lab at Padua University.Some scenarios turned out to have high probabilities of satisfying most of the desiderata whereas others have rather low chances to do so. This approach confirmed that under the given circumstances a continuation of the oocyte harvests or other potential options such as ovariectomy (to obtain biomaterial potentially valuable for future in-vitro procedures) are not ethically acceptable choices.From the very beginning, it has been a pivotal component of the work of the BioRescue project and its partners in the northern white rhino rescue mission to consider all relevant ethical aspects of interventions. We are well aware of the fact that we are pushing the boundaries of what is do-able in conservation and that this requires us to also think about ethical and moral implications , says BioRescue project head Prof Thomas Hildebrandt from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW).  Every procedure of the programme is accompanied by a full ethical risk assessment and we are convinced that we should not do anything we could do just because we can. Developing clear ethical principles based on our knowledge, scientific expertise in animal welfare ethics and decision making, and a vigilance towards societal discourse is a fundamental basis of BioRescue. When considering the future role of Najin, this decision-making process was exceptionally difficult as the experts involved had to look at it from both the perspective of the population, the focus of species conservation, and the perspective of the individual animals, the focus of animal welfare. Retiring one individual from a conservation programme because of animal welfare considerations is usually not a question to think about for long , say Leibniz-IZW head veterinarian Dr Frank G ritz and Ol Pejeta head veterinarian Dr Stephen Ngulu.  But when one individual is 50 percent of your population, you consider this decision several times because it has significant impact on the prospects of the conservation programme. Recent ultrasound examinations have revealed multiple small, benign tumours in Najin s cervix and uterus as well as a large cystic structure 25 cm in diameter in her left ovary. These findings might explain why oocyte collections were not as successful with her as with Fatu. This is why we came to the conclusion that the most valuable role for Najin is to be an ambassador for the conservation of her kind and to ensure that she can transfer her social knowledge and behaviour to offspring in the foreseeable future. In the face of Najin s phase-out of the first pillar of the BioRescue programme (advanced assisted reproduction technologies, aART), its second pillar will become even more important. The aART relies on natural gametes for the creation of embryos, meaning that both the oocytes and the sperm have been collected directly from northern white rhino females and males. The stem cell associated techniques (SCAT), the second pillar of the mission, strive to create artificial gametes from stored tissue of northern white rhinos. For example, tissue such as skin cells collected from Najin could be transformed into induced pluripotent stem cells that could then be reprogrammed to develop into artificial gametes (oocytes or sperm). This highly advanced technique, within the BioRescue consortium developed by internationally leading teams from Kyushu University and the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), allows to significantly increase the number of gametes available for embryo production and thereby can be a substantial multiplication factor. Additionally, it greatly diversifies the genetic reservoir of the assisted reproduction programme. The SCAT are still beyond the cutting edge of rhino reproduction, but progress that has been made by the teams at Kyushu and MDC nourishes the hope that in the coming years northern white embryos could be created from lab-generated gametes. The ethical risk assessment applied the best scientific approach aimed at safeguarding Najin s welfare given her advanced age and the pathological signs in her uterus , says Dr Patrick Omondi, Director, Wildlife Research and Training Institute (Kenya).  We are pleased to have participated in this assessment which affirms the collaborative and innovative approaches by the BioRescue Consortium in saving the species from extinction. Wildlife conservation has faced a multitude of challenges over the last decades and BioRescue has developed technologies that allow experts to tackle some of these. The Government of Kenya collaborated with various partners to promote wildlife conservation by use of technological advances. The Northern White Rhino, though not native to the country, has found a home in Kenya. The Government through the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife has committed itself to ensure that wildlife is conserved and managed for the present and future generations both in Kenya and globally and with a special focus on ensuring that endangered species do not face extinction. That Najin has not produced any viable ovum compounded by its advanced age, we have no choice but to accept the fate of having to retire her from the aART program. We are however encouraged that she will be around long enough to have a positive impact on the next NWR generations through offspring from her daughter Fatu,  says Honourable Najib Balala, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, Kenya.With the ever-increasing challenges rhino conservation is facing, the decision to retire Najin following expert advice on health considerations, advanced age and with no embryo successfully produced from the 10 oocytes harvested in three oocyte collections was a very difficult decision to make for Kenya Wildlife Service: We are however convinced that, as a Government agency mandated to conserve and manage the country s wildlife, KWS has made significant contribution to the processes and efforts to save the Northern white rhino from extinction. We are also convinced that retiring Najin, though a difficult decision to make, is the only right option we have as we collaborate with technical experts both locally and internationally to explore opportunities presented by novel technologies of assisted reproduction techniques to save the species from extinction , says Brigadier (Rtd.)

Only 25% of patients with this type of brain tumour survive for more than one year and just 5% live for more than five years.A team at Queen Mary University of London has established an entirely new experimental research pipeline which, in a trial involving ten patients, has revealed new insights into how GBM develops, identifying potential new targets for individualised treatments. It could also help predict a patient s response to drugs currently in clinical use for other diseases which would be extremely valuable as the average survival time for this type of brain tumour is just 12 to 18 months.Their paper, Comparative epigenetic analysis of tumour initiating cells and syngeneic EPSC-derived neural stem cells (SYNGN) in glioblastoma, is published in the high impact journal Nature Communications today (Thursday 21 October). Professor Silvia Marino, who leads the team, said:  We have used this powerful technique to identify changes in the function of genes that occur in GBM that do not entail a change in the genetic code (epigenetics). This has revealed new insights for how GBM develops and identified potential new targets for individualised treatments. ","Published: October 25, 2021"

These were found to be independent characteristics and allowed donors to be classified into different groups.As a result of the testing, the research team were able to group donors into six distinct groups which remained the same for the majority of samples after retesting two years later.Professor Jon Gibbins, Director of the Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Research at the University of Reading said:""The next big thing in medicine is the idea of personalisation of treatments, which requires much more detailed profiles of our bodies. Heart disease and strokes are the biggest killers around the world, and millions of patients are prescribed drugs to reduce their risk of having a potentially deadly attack. Currently mostly patients are treated the same -- a one size fits all approach. We hope that our new testing will allow us to predict who needs treatment and which drug to use.""This new research is therefore really exciting as we have a framework for building a personalised clotting profile that is simple to administer and could help clinicians to prescribe more effective treatments to reduce the risks of strokes and heart disease further.""The team are now examining the use of the test with patients with established heart disease to help pave the way to personalised medicine approaches.Reference: Dunster JL, Bye AP, Kriek N, et al.

The new cells often migrate to the site of injury, a process known as  cell migration.  However, abnormal cell migration can also facilitate the transport and spread of cancer cells within the body. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one such example of a highly invasive brain tumor that spreads via migration of the tumor cells. The frequency at which such tumor cells spread and grow make conventional tumor removal methods ineffective. Furthermore, options such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are harmful to healthy cells and cause adverse effects. In order to develop improved therapeutic strategies, a precise understanding of the invasion mechanism of GBM cells is necessary.An alternative treatment strategy in consideration involves capturing the migrating tumor cells. It turns out that cell migration is dictated by the structure and the orientation of the  extracellular matrix  (ECM)   fibrous structures surrounding the cells. By engineering similar structures of desired geometries, it is, therefore, possible to exert control over the migration process.Now in a study published in ACS Applied Bio Materials, researchers from University of Fukui, Japan, have designed a platform based on nanofibers that resemble the ECM to examine their effect on GBM cells. We fabricated a nanofibrous sheet in which the fiber density changes from end to end gradually using a technique called  electrospinning  and carried out a culture experiment of brain tumor cells, says Dr. Satoshi Fujita, who headed the study.The researchers observed clear distinctions in cell movement in nanofibers of different densities. They found that the denser fibers promoted the formation of  focal adhesions  clusters in the cells that resulted in a slower cell migration.Taking advantage of this negative correlation between cell movement and fiber density, the researchers were able to control and direct the migration of cells by designing a nanofibrous sheet with stepwise varying densities. By arranging the fibers in a high-to-low density configuration, they were able to restrict the movement of cells as most of them were captured in the high-density zones. On the other hand, a low-to-high density configuration had the opposite effect and encouraged migration.In addition, they noticed that the gaps between the zones hindered cell migration, leading to cells being trapped in the high-density zones. This one-way migration was observed for the first time and the researchers named it  cell trapping  after fish and insect traps that cause their prey to travel along a single direction before trapping it. The study demonstrates the feasibility of capturing migrating cells using electrospun nanofibers that mimic the microenvironment of the brain, comments Dr. Fujita.With such remarkable findings, the team is excited about the future prospects of their nanofiber-based platform. It is available for the design of scaffolding materials, which are the basis of regenerative medicine, in combination with various fiber processing technologies and material surface treatment technologies. This could lead to the development of practical applications of regenerative medicines, speculates Dr. Fujita, In addition, it can be used as a processing technology for culture carriers for efficient production of biological drugs including proteins, antibodies, and vaccines. We certainly hope his visions are realized soon!Reference: Huang W-Y, Suye S, Fujita S. Cell trapping via migratory inhibition within density-tuned electrospun nanofibers.

Their findings were published today in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.The research involved proteins designed to selectively stimulate the immune system s CD8+  killer  T cells to multiply and specifically attack HIV-infected T cells. Co-corresponding author Steven Almo, Ph.D., developed the synthetic proteins, known as synTac (short for  synapse for T-cell activation ). Dr. Almo is professor of biochemistry and physiology & biophysics at Einstein and the chair of biochemistry, the Wollowick Family Foundation Chair in Multiple Sclerosis and Immunology, and director of the Einstein Macromolecular Therapeutics Development Facility.HIV infects the immune system s CD4+ T cells. For the past 25 years, people infected with HIV have been able to control their infection through antiretroviral therapy (ART) a combination of several drugs that prevent HIV from infecting new CD4+ T cells and multiplying within them.  Although ART works remarkably well at keeping HIV in check indefinitely, it is a stalemate and not a checkmate,  says co-corresponding author Harris Goldstein, M.D., professor of pediatrics and of microbiology and immunology and the Charles Michael Chair in Autoimmune Diseases at Einstein and director of the Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS Research. ART s long-term use can cause substantial side effects,  notes Dr. Goldstein.  And once ART is halted, latent HIV viruses which can persist for years in CD4+ T cells invariably emerge from their hiding places to revive the infection. Our JCI paper shows that synTac proteins, by greatly boosting the quantity of protective HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, were able to eliminate these infected cells. It s unlikely that any treatment strategy can remove all latently infected T cells,  says Dr. Goldstein.  Our goal with synTac is a  functional cure,  in which the powerful immune response induced by synTac suppresses HIV to undetectable levels even after they discontinue ART. The researchers first tested their anti-HIV synTac proteins on human blood samples infected with either HIV or cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common type of herpes virus that can infect and kill immunosuppressed patients. For blood from human donors infected with either HIV or CMV, synTacs specific for mobilizing immune responses against those viruses triggered selective and vigorous multiplication of CD8+ T cells that exhibited potent HIV or CMV anti-viral activity.Next, the researchers intravenously injected synTacs specific for HIV or CMV into virus-infected mice with  humanized  immune systems that permit infection by viruses affecting people, such as HIV and CMV. The synTac proteins triggered human HIV-specific CD8+ T cells to increase 32-fold and increased human CMV-specific CD8+ T cells by 46-fold. In both the HIV- and CMV-infected mice, the large numbers of synTac-stimulated human CD8+ T cells potently suppressed the viral infections suggesting that synTacs may offer new opportunities for functionally curing HIV and treating CMV and other viral infections. Our JCI paper shows that synTac proteins, by greatly boosting the quantity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, might offer a cure for HIV by eliminating infected T cells.  A key asset of the synTac platform,  says Dr. Almo,  is how easily we can program synTac proteins to combat any of the many diseases in which T cells play a role including disease targets that extend well beyond viruses. For example, an ongoing clinical trial involving patients with head and neck cancer is assessing synTac s ability to selectively activate anti-cancer T cells. And since synTacs can turn off, as well as activate T cells, they re also under study for treating type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases by turning off T cells that mistakenly attack people s healthy tissues.

The findings appear in Nature on Oct. 20.When birds are singing for themselves, these basal ganglia neurons allow a certain amount of variability in the song, which the researchers say is essential to  mapping  the circuitry and finding the optimal way to produce the song.  To figure out how to move, it needs to first try out many different movements, to try out different ways of accomplishing a goal of moving their body,  said Jonna Singh Alvarado, who led this project for his PhD dissertation at Duke.  They need to learn,  If I think this, how am I about to move? How will that move my body?  and it needs to do that in many variations. Having done the task many times,  you've established this kind of brain-to-movement dictionary, where you've explored all these different ways that you can give commands and they can move your body,  said Alvarado, who is now a post-doctoral researcher at Harvard University.  And then, you can exploit the mapping you've created.  I've explored, I have this dictionary, let me grab the right words from this dictionary and perform exactly what I know I can perform, given what I know the female wants to hear.   Lots of practice is essential to keep the song in good shape, Alvarado said.  If they don't keep polishing these circuits with constant activity, they slowly drift and degrade. Practicing and continuing to explore this vocal space and keeping your dictionary updated is very important to keep the performance at tip top shape. The differences between the practice songs and the courtship performances are super-subtle to human observers, almost undetectable, said Richard Mooney, the George Barth Geller professor of neurobiology in Duke s School of Medicine and Alvarado s thesis advisor. But the female zebra finches can tell, and they like a fast performance. A practice song played on a speaker fails to intrigue, but a swift and precise game-time song makes her check out the source of the sweet sounds. Songbirds have made this problem more simple for us,  Alvarado said. In the dedicated and specialized song circuitry of the bird s basal ganglia, each neuron just does one job.But even this relatively simple brain posed a huge computational problem for the team. One of the things that's been really hard in other animals is to figure out what the link is between the variability you're producing, and the variability you want to produce,  said John Pearson, an assistant professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at Duke, who led the statistical analysis of the neurons.  This is the first time that people have gotten a real sizable population of these cells, and we can begin to try to link the variability in vocal performance to the variability in neural activity. Mooney, who describes himself as a huge fan of guitarist Jimi Hendrix, said he has heard this kind of rehearsal in Hendrix s informal four-track living room tapes.  It kind of goes everywhere, there's the kernel of one song, but then it sort of morphs. It's like free jazz or something. And, you know, I think he was just really, really good at exploring when he was alone. This kind of motor rehearsal applies to any skill that s being practiced, Alvarado said.  But then, there's a moment in which you have to execute in a high-stakes situation -- that can be something like predation, either escaping predator or catching prey, and it can be courtship: it s time to perform and we need to do it in a very specific way that we know the other party is listening. Mooney, who has studied bird song for decades, said this work drew on many different kinds of scientific expertise, including colleagues at UC Berkeley and the University of Oregon.  It took a lot of different people to get all these parts worked out. It s a big, very complex story. But the work is important because insight into the bird s basal ganglia has direct relevance to human movement disorders, including Parkinson s and  Huntington s diseases, Tourette s syndrome, and others, Mooney said. In Parkinson's, motor variability is dysfunctional and completely dysregulated and that is through the degeneration of these same basal ganglia circuits,  Alvarado said.  Understanding how (basal ganglia neurons) function normally and how their activity gets changed and rewired to produce completely different patterns of movement is pretty paramount to understanding just how to fix these problems in the future,  he said.Reference: Singh Alvarado J, Goffinet J, Michael V, et al.

This creates a problem for researchers, as COVID-19 has only been actively circulating for about a year and a half. In the absence of sufficient empirical data, a team of Yale researchers and colleagues at other institutions sought to determine the rate of reinfection by analyzing immunological data from SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome and human coronaviruses. With an understanding of how these viruses evolve and how they are related to each other, the team was able to model the likelihood of reinfection for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The overall goal of the study was to provide an answer to a question that at this point in the pandemic would be impossible to answer empirically, which is how long after you ve been infected by SARS-CoV-2 can you expect to possess immunity against the virus before you become vulnerable to reinfection?  said Hayley Hassler, a research associate at the School of Public Health and one of the study s co-authors.The study showed that the duration of immunity is relatively short. According to Hassler, the risk of reinfection is about five percent at three months after the initial infection. After 17 months, that number increases to 50 percent. Townsend noted that this result was not unexpected, given that natural immunity against other coronaviruses in humans tends to be short-lived. But one cause for concern is that COVID-19 has more dangerous outcomes during and after infection compared to common colds. According to Townsend, the model projected the risk of reinfection under endemic conditions   in which everybody has either been infected by or vaccinated against the virus. In these conditions, unvaccinated individuals should expect to be reinfected with COVID-19 every 16 to 17 months on average. On an individual level, this number may vary. Our results are based on average times of waning immunity across multiple infected individuals,  Hassler told the News.  Any one of those individuals may experience longer or shorter durations of immunity depending on immune status, cross-immunity, age and multiple other factors. Townsend noted that some news coverage has compared SARS-CoV-2 to both the flu and measles, suggesting that these viruses could provide similar types of immunity. These comparisons are misleading, he said, because the viruses are not closely related and cannot be expected to have similar properties. One of the most dangerous misconceptions is the belief that COVID-19 provides life-long immunity, which Townsend emphasized is not the case. The study looked into six viruses that are close viral relatives of COVID-19, which Townsend mentioned are more useful and  informative  in comparative research because of their common ancestry. Townsend said he was excited about the study s use of a data-driven model based on an understanding of evolutionary principles. Although evolutionary biology is typically thought of as a historical discipline, according to Townsend, the team was able to use these theoretical principles to model the reinfection of a relatively new virus. This is an instance where we have no idea about the answer to something and the only way that we can obtain that answer is through evolutionary biology,  he said.  And we managed to obtain it, and I m very confident in the result. Sudhir Kumar, a biology professor at Temple University and one of the study s co-authors, echoed this excitement about the evolutionary methods employed in the study. He said that this same approach could be applied to future pandemics.Kumar outlined the usage of these methods and their future applications.  The methods that we used are methods that are standard in the field of evolutionary biology,  he said.  We should be able to use the same approach for predicting durability of immunity in other cases. Kumar added that future work on the subject will include a follow-up paper looking at the durability of vaccine-induced immunity against breakthrough infection. He plans to provide an estimate of durability for immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals.Because SARS-CoV-2 is still a relatively new virus, much remains to be understood about the durability of immunity. What this study does reveal, Townsend said, is that natural immunity does not last in the long term and that it is not a substitute for vaccination. We need to be very aware of the fact that this disease is likely to be circulating over the long term and that we don t have this long term immunity that many people seem to be hoping to rely on in order to protect them from disease,  he said.

Suviseshamuthu, PhD, Guang Yue, PhD, and Didier Allexandre, PhD, from the Center for Mobility and Rehabilitation Engineering Research at Kessler Foundation.Postural instability is an understudied complication of traumatic brain injury that hinders progress in rehabilitation, limits independence, and compromises safety. Despite the impact on the daily lives of individuals and their care partners, little research has been done on the neural mechanisms that contribute to balance function.For this pilot study, researchers in Dr. Allexandre's Neuromuscular and Neurophysology Laboratory studied 17 adults with traumatic brain injury and 15 matched controls. Using a computerized posturography platform and EEG, scientists delivered random balance perturbations and measured each participant s neural and postural responses. Furthermore, a subset of participants had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at the Rocco Ortenzio Center for Neuroimaging at Kessler Foundation, to measure brain structural integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).DTI studies showed widespread structural damage in the traumatic brain injury group, which had poorer balance performance and reduced brain activity and connectivity during balance tasks. The graph-theoretic measures of brain functional connectivity derived from EEG data show an abnormal brain network response during the balance task, an intriguing finding that warrants further investigation. Using EEG-based graph measures, we were able to explore the differences in underlying structural and functional mechanisms in individuals with and without traumatic brain injury, which may lead to the identification of a neural biomarker for balance dysfunction,  said lead author Dr. Shenoy Handiru.  Future investigations need to look at how to modulate brain networks affected by brain injury. We hypothesize that postural training may be a way to  re-wire  damaged networks so their function mimics that of the healthy brain, and lead to the desired outcome of improved balance function.

During this period, 115,000 people tested positive for COVID-19 through a PCR test conducted in the community, rather than in hospital, and there were 201 deaths recorded due to the virus.The Moderna vaccine is also available in Scotland and no deaths have been recorded in those who have been double vaccinated with it. Consequently, it has not been possible to estimate its effectiveness in preventing death, the researchers said.The researchers defined death from COVID-19 as anyone who died within 28 days of a positive PCR test, or with COVID-19 recorded as a cause of death on their death certificate.The research team, from Strathclyde, the University of Edinburgh and Public Health Scotland, analysed a dataset as part of the EAVE II project, which uses anonymised linked patient data to track the pandemic and the vaccine roll out in real time.The results are published as a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine.Professor Chris Robertson, of Strathclyde's Department of Mathematics and Statistics, said:  This study shows the value of carrying out analyses of routine healthcare data available in near real-time. Our findings are encouraging in showing that the vaccine remains an effective measure in protecting both ourselves and others from death from the most dominant variant of Covid-19. It is very important to validate these early results in other settings and with a longer follow-up study.  The researchers say that, to increase confidence in these early findings, the research needs to be repeated in other countries and settings, and with longer follow-up time after full vaccination.The team says that, because of the observational nature of the study, data about vaccine effectiveness should be interpreted with caution and it is not possible to make a direct comparison between both vaccines.Reference: Sheikh A, Robertson C, Taylor B.

They call on neuroscientists to incorporate evidence from social science disciplines to better understand how people think. Accumulating evidence indicates that memory, reasoning, decision-making and other higher-level functions take place across people,  the researchers wrote in a review in the journal Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience.  Cognition extends into the physical world and the brains of others. The co-authors   neuroscientist Aron Barbey, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Richard Patterson, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Emory University; and Steven Sloman, a professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University   wanted to address the limitations of studying brains in isolation, out of the context in which they operate and stripped of the resources they rely on for optimal function. In cognitive neuroscience, the standard approach is essentially to assume that knowledge is represented in the individual brain and transferred between individuals,  Barbey said.  But there are, we think, important cases where those assumptions begin to break down. Take, for instance, the fact that people often  outsource  the task of understanding or coming to conclusions about complex subject matter, using other people s expertise to guide their own decision-making. Most people will agree that smoking contributes to the incidence of lung cancer   without necessarily understanding precisely how that occurs,  Barbey said.  And when doctors diagnose and treat disease, they don t transfer all of their knowledge to their patients. Instead, patients rely on doctors to help them decide the best course of action. Without relying on experts in our community, our beliefs would become untethered from the social conventions and scientific evidence that are necessary to support them,  he said.  It would become unclear, for example, whether  smoking causes lung cancer,  bringing into question the truth of our beliefs, the motivation for our actions. To understand the role that knowledge serves in human intelligence, the researchers wrote that it is necessary to look beyond the individual and to study the community. Cognition is, to a large extent, a group activity, not an individual one,  Sloman said.  People depend on others for their reasoning, judgment and decision-making. Cognitive neuroscience is not able to shed light on this aspect of cognitive processing. The limitations of individual knowledge and human dependence on others for understanding are the themes of  The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone,  a book Sloman wrote with Phil Fernbach, a cognitive scientist and professor of marketing at the University of Colorado. The challenge for cognitive neuroscience becomes how to capture knowledge that does not reside in the individual brain but is outsourced to the community,  Barbey said.Neuroscientific methods such as functional MRI were designed to track activity in one brain at a time and have limited capacity for capturing the dynamics that occur when individuals interact in large communities, he said.Some neuroscientists are trying to overcome this limitation. In a recent study, researchers placed two people face-to-face in a scanner and tracked their brain activity and eye movements while they interacted. Other teams use a technique called  hyperscanning,  which allows the simultaneous recording of brain activity in people who are physically distant from each another but interacting online.Such efforts have found evidence suggesting that the same brain regions are activated in people who are effectively communicating with one another or cooperating on a task, Barbey said. These studies are also showing how brains operate differently from one another, depending on the type of interaction and the context.Several fields of research are ahead of neuroscience in understanding and embracing the collective, collaborative nature of knowledge, Patterson said. For example,  social epistemology  recognizes that knowledge is a social phenomenon that depends on community norms, a shared language and a reliable method for testing the trustworthiness of potential sources. Philosophers studying natural language also illustrate how knowledge relies on the community,  Patterson said.  For example, according to  externalism,  the meaning of words depends on how they are used and represented within a social context. Thus, the meaning of the word and its correct use depends on collective knowledge that extends beyond the individual. To address these shortfalls, neuroscientists can look to other social science fields, Barbey said. We need to incorporate not only neuroscience evidence, but also evidence from social psychology, social anthropology and other disciplines that are better positioned to study the community of knowledge,  he said.Reference: Sloman SA, Patterson R, Barbey AK.

The activation of Na,K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop affects the expression of important protein markers in fat cells as well as in the hippocampus, which can worsen brain function and lead to neurodegeneration. Targeting the fat cells to antagonize Na,K-ATPase may improve these outcomes.  We have aimed to demonstrate that Na,K-ATPase signaling, specifically in adipocytes, play a central role in inducing alterations in specific regions of the brain, most notably in the hippocampus, which is critical to memory and cognitive function,  said senior author Joseph I Shapiro, M.D., professor and dean of the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine.Researchers used a genetically-modified mouse model that released the peptide NaKtide specifically in adipocytes, or fat cells, to find that NaKtide inhibited the signaling function of Na,K-ATPase. The adipocyte-specific NaKtide expression improved the altered phenotype of adipocytes and improved function of the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with memory and cognition. Inducing oxidative stress through western diet increased production of inflammatory cytokines confined to adipocytes as well as altered protein markers of memory and cognition in the hippocampus.  Western diet induces oxidant stress and adipocyte alteration through Na,K-ATPase signaling which causes systemic inflammation and affects behavioral and brain biochemical changes,  said Komal Sodhi, M.D., first author and associate professor of surgery and biomedical sciences at the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine.  Our study showed that adipocyte-specific NaKtide expression in our murine model ameliorated these changes and improved neurodegenerative phenotype.

Publishing their results in the journal Water Research, the scientists present a DNA-based testing method that provides a surrogate for monitoring AMR, which will make AMR screening cheaper and more accessible around the world. The study presents a method, which is similar to methods used on wastewater samples to detect SARS-CoV-2, that differentiates between bacteria who are carrying AMR genes versus no AMR genes. There is currently no simple  silver bullet  assay for triaging AMR based on DNA from wastewater - this new assay may provide this role. It can be used for rapid screening of transmissible AMR to identify locations where more expensive analysis can be justified.  Study co-author, Professor David Graham, of Newcastle University s School of Engineering, said:  The use of wastewater is becoming an increasingly vital tool for guiding healthcare decisions during the pandemic. We have shown that the same principle can be used to address other problems, including reducing the spread of superbugs. The method provides a more exact way of determining AMR by measuring DNA in wastewater samples.  AMR is major global public health issue that has implications on the effective treatment of a growing number of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. Antibiotic use selects for resistance strains in human and animal wastes, which can be released to the environment via wastewater, spreading antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacteria across nature. The findings are especially important in light of a recent report by the World Economic Forum on the economic cost of AMR, in which Professor Graham was a co-contributor. The report showed that the cost of AMR is closely related to the capacity of local healthcare systems, with areas without robust healthcare surveillance seeing the greatest levels of AMR and healthcare costs. The report showed AMR costs to the wider economy due to reduced labour supply result in worktime and productivity losses, with waterborne AMR leading to 3.5 million additional sick days yearly, at a cost of $300 million globally.  Study co-author Dr Marcos Baluja, of Newcastle University s School of Engineering added:  We are now aware of the environmental dimension of AMR and its implication in public health. At Newcastle University, we work to understand this complex ecological and evolutionary problem and design feasible methods to identify the hotspot of AMR selection and maintenance in the environment. These tools are crucial to efficiently interrogate the environment and design comprehensive strategies to mitigate dissemination of environmental sources of AMR.

Our brains must track who is speaking and what is being said, as well as what our relationship to that person may be   because, after all, we probably give the opinion of our best friend more weight than that of a complete stranger.A study published today in the journal Science provides the first glimpse into how the brains of social mammals process these types of complex group interactions.In the study, neuroscientists at the University of California, Berkeley, used wireless neural recording devices to track the brain activity of Egyptian fruit bats as they freely interacted in groups and occasionally vocalized to each other through high-pitched screeches and grunts. Most studies of communication, particularly vocalization, are typically performed with single animals or with pairs of animals, but basically none have been conducted in actual group settings,  said study co-first author Maimon Rose, a graduate student in the NeuroBat Lab at UC Berkeley.  However, many social mammals, including humans, typically interact in groups. Egyptian fruit bats, specifically, like to interact within large colonies. By tracking which of the bats vocalized, while simultaneously measuring the real-time neural activity in both the vocalizing and the listening bats, the researchers were able to decode how neurons in the bats  frontal cortices distinguished among vocalizations made by themselves and by others, as well how the bats distinguished among different individuals in the group.When they compared the neural recordings among the different bats, they also found that brain activity became highly correlated when a bat made a vocalization. Surprisingly, they found that communication produced by bats that were  friendlier    those that spent more time in close proximity to others   induced a higher degree of correlations across the brains of the group members. Other neuroscience studies have tried to examine small pieces of these interactions individually. For example, one study might examine how neurons respond when somebody else speaks, and then a separate study might look at how neurons respond when that individual speaks,  said study senior author Michael Yartsev, an assistant professor of neurobiology and bioengineering at UC Berkeley.  This study is the first to really put all of these pieces together to get a full picture of communication within a social group.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

The study, published in Science, also showed that the increased neutralizing antibody responses were sustained for at least eight weeks after the boost, were significantly higher than after the primary vaccine series, and generated high-level protection   meaning the ability to significantly limit virus from replicating in the lungs and nose. These data suggest that boosting triggers a strong immune memory response and potentially longer lasting immunity.The researchers also determined that both the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed to target the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and a slightly modified version of the vaccine targeting the Beta variant, were equivalent in their ability to boost antibody responses and protect. Scientists at the Vaccine Research Center, part of NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, led the project with collaborators from Emory University; Bioqual, Inc.; Moderna, Inc.; and Johns Hopkins University.This study was performed six months ago when the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant was a major concern. The researchers focused on the Beta variant because it has consistently shown the greatest ability to resist neutralization   by likely reducing vaccine effectiveness   according to the researchers. While Delta has become the dominant virus variant in the United States, because of its high transmissibility, it has only an intermediate ability to resist neutralization, the study authors state.The scientists write that in people, an mRNA-1273 booster vaccine may improve the duration and potency of protection against upper and lower airway infection by any of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta. They note that this would be especially important to maintain protection against severe disease and possibly limit mild infection and virus transmission.  Their results support vaccine boosting in the elderly, people with pre-existing health conditions, those at high-risk exposure, and those who responded poorly to primary vaccination.Reference: Corbett Kizzmekia S., Gagne Matthew, Wagner Danielle A., et al.

For this purpose, they grew the strain in the laboratory in nutrient media to which they added successively increasing amounts of vancomycin. Staphylococci are rapidly mutating bacteria. The strain studied also lacks a mechanism that normally repairs these genetic changes. This means it acquires new properties particularly quickly, including those associated with greater tolerance to vancomycin.

Scientists found that the disease also killed porpoises and dolphins in the Salish Sea   perhaps affecting cetaceans even earlier than people.A study published today in the journal Diseases of Aquatic Organisms explores how human-caused changes on land can affect aquatic animals, specifically in the case of the fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus gattii. Led by the University of California, Davis, a team of scientists from Canada and the Pacific Northwest pieced together the history of the fungal outbreak in marine mammals. They assembled and analyzed data collected over decades by veterinarians, microbiologists, marine mammal biologists, and marine mammal stranding responders. C. gattii can cause lung and brain disease. It lives in soil and in tree dwellings and is acquired by breathing in fungal spores. It is not considered contagious between individuals. Typically found in tropical and subtropical forests paralleling the distribution of eucalyptus trees, C. gattii was likely translocated to the Pacific Northwest in the early 1900 s, although the exact mechanisms are unknown. Beginning in 1999 on Vancouver Island, humans, domestic animals, and terrestrial wildlife became infected with C. gattii, progressively affecting individuals living on mainland British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. The researchers found that 42 dolphins and porpoises in the Salish Sea also died from the fungal pathogen, including harbor porpoises, Dall's porpoises, and Pacific white-side dolphins. Construction, deforestation, and other activities that disturb soil can aerosolize C. gattii spores, causing infection in people and animals that live near the disturbed sites and breathe in the spores.  As we change the environment in unprecedented ways, we could see more diseases that affect people and wildlife,  said lead author Sarah Teman, a research assistant at the SeaDoc Society, a program of the Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. The marine mammals that died from C. gattii were found near terrestrial hotspots, suggesting that the spores settled on the surface of the sea, where the porpoises and dolphins inhaled them when they surfaced to breathe. Researchers also found evidence that the first probable case of C. gattii in the Pacific Northwest could have occurred in a Dall's porpoise in 1997 - two years before the identification of the first human case in the region in 1999.  Often we study marine mammals because they play important roles in the ecosystem, and they are cool,  said Joe Gaydos, UC Davis wildlife veterinarian at SeaDoc Society and co-investigator.

Now, a research team from Brown University and the University of Maryland has developed a new material for use in solid-state batteries that s derived from an unlikely source: trees.In research published in the journal Nature, the team demonstrates a solid ion conductor that combines copper with cellulose nanofibrils   polymer tubes derived from wood. The paper-thin material has an ion conductivity that is 10 to 100 times better than other polymer ion conductors, the researchers say. It could be used as either a solid battery electrolyte or as an ion-conducting binder for the cathode of an all-solid-state battery. By incorporating copper with one-dimensional cellulose nanofibrils, we demonstrated that the normally ion-insulating cellulose offers a speedier lithium-ion transport within the polymer chains,  said Liangbing Hu, a professor in the University of Maryland s Department of Materials Science and Engineering.  In fact, we found this ion conductor achieved a record high ionic conductivity among all solid polymer electrolytes. The work was a collaboration between Hu s lab and the lab of Yue Qi, a professor at Brown s School of Engineering.Today s lithium ion batteries, which are widely used in everything from cellphones to cars, have electrolytes made from lithium salt dissolved in a liquid organic solvent. The electrolyte s job is to  conduct lithium ions between a battery s cathode and anode. Liquid electrolytes work pretty well, but they have some downsides. At high currents, tiny filaments of lithium metal, called dendrites, can form in the electrolyte leading to short circuits. In addition, liquid electrolytes are made with flammable and toxic chemicals, which can catch fire.Solid electrolytes have the potential to prevent dendrite penetration and can be made from non-flammable materials.  Most of the solid electrolytes investigated so far are ceramic materials, which are great at conducting ions but they re also thick, rigid and brittle. Stresses during manufacturing as well as charging and discharging can lead to cracks and breaks.The material introduced in this study, however, is thin and flexible, almost like a sheet of paper. And its ion conductivity is on par with ceramics.Qi and Qisheng Wu, a senior research associate at Brown, performed computer simulations of the microscopic structure of the copper-cellulose material to understand why it is able to conduct ions so well. The modeling study revealed that the copper increases the space between cellulose polymer chains, which normally exist in tightly packed bundles. The expanded spacing creates what amount to ion superhighways through which lithium ions can zip by relatively unimpeded. The lithium ions move in this organic solid electrolyte via mechanisms that we typically found in inorganic ceramics, enabling the record high ion conductivity,  Qi said.  Using materials nature provides will reduce the overall impact of battery manufacture to our environment. In addition to working as a solid electrolyte, the new material can also act as a cathode binder for a solid-state battery. In order to match the capacity of anodes, cathodes need to be substantially thicker. That thickness, however, can compromise ion conduction, reducing efficiency. In order for thicker cathodes to work, they need to be encased in an ion-conducting binder. Using their new material as a binder, the team demonstrated what they believe to be one of the thickest functional cathodes ever reported.The researchers are hopeful that the new material could be a step toward making bringing solid state battery technology to the mass market.Reference: Yang C, Wu Q, Xie W, et al.

The researchers developed a test to detect MRD, and thus the risk of relapse, earlier than a recurrent tumor would be identified using a traditional imaging scan. The findings were published today in Cancer Cell.   Medulloblastoma is among the most common malignant pediatric brain tumors. Imaging at the end of therapy is helpful to assess for the absence of bulky disease but, to date, there is no definitive test to declare a patient free of disease. As such, clinicians do not know who is cured or who will relapse but they do know that up to one-third of patients may relapse.MRD refers to tumor cells that are present during or after cancer treatment has concluded. Detecting these tumor cells, or markers of them, such as cell-free DNA, is vital for recognizing early risk of relapse and potentially heading this off before it has become established. We scan patients frequently for the first couple of years when they come off therapy, but unfortunately, by the time we see a recurrence on a scan there is already a lot of disease,  said co-senior author Giles Robinson, M.D., St. Jude Department of Oncology.  Relapsed medulloblastoma harbors an incredibly poor prognosis and for many it is too late to cure. As a result, we sought a better way to determine whether a child is truly clear of disease at the time they come off therapy. With this test, we now know that if there is medulloblastoma cell-free DNA in the CSF at the end of therapy, then that patient is very likely to relapse,  Robinson said.  That gives us something we can act on, an opportunity to truly eradicate the disease before it has had a chance to relapse or re-emerge. ","Published: October 22, 2021"

That s according to a team of scientists from AMBER, the SFI Centre for Advanced Materials and Bioengineering Research, Trinity, and University College Dublin.The research published in the Chemical Engineering Journal reveals that tap water contains trace elements and minerals, which prevent plastics from degrading in the water and releasing microplastics. Microplastics can carry a range of contaminants such as trace metals and some potentially harmful organic chemicals. Previous studies investigating microplastics release have used forms of pure water, which only exist in laboratories and do not specifically take into account the ions and impurities found in tap water. Professor John J Boland from AMBER, and Trinity s School of Chemistry, who was a co-leader of the research team, said:  It is well known that plastics can degrade and release microplastics, which can get into the environment and be consumed by humans. Our research shows that many items such as plastic kettles, which are repeatedly used with tap water, can develop over time a protective skin that prevents the release of microplastics entirely.  Because tap water is not 100% pure H2O   since it contains trace elements and minerals, what we showed is that if you include these trace elements and minerals the degradation of plastics in tap water is completely different. Rather than the plastics falling apart, the minerals coat the plastic and prevent any kind of degradation and so the product becomes microplastic-free.  For example, that dark brown colour in your kettle is a good thing. It is copper oxide that forms from copper minerals in your tap water, which in turn comes from the copper pipes in your house   all these combine to give a perfect protection to the kettle.  This discovery is important because we have learned that these types of protective skins can be manufactured in the laboratory and directly applied to the plastic without having to wait for it to build up naturally. This discovery also shows that nature is leading the way, pointing to solutions to what is a very significant problem facing our modern high-tech society. ReferenceShiab Y et al.

The researchers discovered that this channel is upregulated meaning both its protein expression and channel activity were substantially increased in metastatic melanoma cells compared with healthy melanocytes. They found that targeting this channel protein with small pharmaceutical compounds triggers the rapid and selective death of cancer cells while completely sparing normal cells. Their research is published in the journal Cell Reports.""Many traditional cancer therapies target a well-known cell death pathway called apoptosis to trigger cancer cell death. However, many aggressive cancer cells harbor numerous mutations of genes that help them escape these treatments. We saw an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies that target nonapoptotic cell death pathways to eradicate cancer cells,"" said Wanlu Du, an assistant research scientist in the U-M Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology.In metastatic cancers, lysosomes turn hypertrophic, which means they actively contribute to tumor progression by increasing their ability to provide nutrients to the rapidly dividing cells and secreting enzymes to digest extracellular matrix the material that provides the physical scaffolding for cells to help cancer cell invasion. But designing cancer therapies that target lysosomes may also harm normal cells and tissues by compromising lysosomes' ability to provide nutrients for healthy cells. Instead, the U-M researchers focused on specific machinery within lysosomes that are hijacked by cancer: TRPML1. TRPML1 is a protein channel that ferries metal ions, including iron, zinc and calcium, across the lysosome membrane and into the cell. The researchers examined protein expression levels of TRPML1 in normal skin tissues, benign and metastatic melanoma. In addition, they measured the channel activity by directly patch-clamping the cell's lysosome. The researchers then examined the effect of pharmacological molecules, called TRPML1 agonists and antagonists, on cancer cells viability.The research team, led by Du and U-M researcher Haoxing Xu, found that activating, rather than inhibiting, this zinc/calcium ion channel caused cancer cells to die but did not cause harm in healthy cells.""This is the first example of an opposite way to think about cancer treatment,"" said Xu, senior author of the paper and professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. ""Cancer is caused by maladaptation, or upregulation, in many signaling pathways, which results in excessive, uncontrolled cell growth. The traditional anticancer approach is straightforward: to inhibit or decrease maladaptive upregulation. ""We now demonstrated that giving a further boost to the 'bad,' cancerous signaling can selectively 'kill' the cancer cells."" To determine what was responsible for the cell death when activating TRPML1, the researchers examined the effect of different metal ions on the cell death. They found that zinc permeability of TRPML1 played a critical role in the process.""When we tested different ion blockers to see which could prevent the cell death, we found that if we blocked lysosomal zinc release, we could completely block this type of cell death,"" Du said. ""This is why we believe this channel activation and lysosomal zinc release mediates this kind of cell death.""The researchers' study shed light on a new cell death pathway they call  ""lysozincrosis"" a combination of lysosome, zinc and necrosis. This pathway is mediated by the activation of TRPML1, lysosomal zinc ion release, and mitochondria dysfunction. Reference: Du W, Gu M, Hu M, et al.

A multiyear study of older adults found that both short and long sleepers experienced greater cognitive decline than people who slept a moderate amount, even when the effects of early Alzheimer s disease were taken into account. The study was led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.Poor sleep and Alzheimer s disease are both associated with cognitive decline, and separating out the effects of each has proven challenging. By tracking cognitive function in a large group of older adults over several years and analyzing it against levels of Alzheimer s-related proteins and measures of brain activity during sleep, the researchers generated crucial data that help untangle the complicated relationship among sleep, Alzheimer s and cognitive function. The findings could aid efforts to help keep people s minds sharp as they age.The findings are published Oct. 20 in the journal Brain. It s been challenging to determine how sleep and different stages of Alzheimer s disease are related, but that s what you need to know to start designing interventions,  said first author Brendan Lucey, MD, an associate professor of neurology and director of the Washington University Sleep Medicine Center.  Our study suggests that there is a middle range, or  sweet spot,  for total sleep time where cognitive performance was stable over time. Short and long sleep times were associated with worse cognitive performance, perhaps due to insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality. An unanswered question is if we can intervene to improve sleep, such as increasing sleep time for short sleepers by an hour or so, would that have a positive effect on their cognitive performance so they no longer decline? We need more longitudinal data to answer this question. Alzheimer s is the main cause of cognitive decline in older adults, contributing to about 70% of dementia cases. Poor sleep is a common symptom of the disease and a driving force that can accelerate the disease s progression. Studies have shown that self-reported short and long sleepers are both more likely to perform poorly on cognitive tests, but such sleep studies typically do not include assessments of Alzheimer s disease.To tease apart the separate effects of sleep and Alzheimer s disease on cognition, Lucey and colleagues turned to volunteers who participate in Alzheimer s studies through the university s Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Such volunteers undergo annual clinical and cognitive assessments, and provide a blood sample to be tested for the high-risk Alzheimer s genetic variant APOE4. For this study, the participants also provided samples of cerebrospinal fluid to measure levels of Alzheimer s proteins, and each slept with a tiny electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor strapped to their foreheads for four to six nights to measure brain activity during sleep.In total, the researchers obtained sleep and Alzheimer s data on 100 participants whose cognitive function had been monitored for an average of 4 1/2 years. Most (88) had no cognitive impairments, 11 were very mildly impaired, and one had mild cognitive impairment. The average age was 75 at the time of the sleep study.The researchers found a U-shaped relationship between sleep and cognitive decline. Overall, cognitive scores declined for the groups that slept less than 4.5 or more than 6.5 hours per night   as measured by EEG   while scores stayed stable for those in the middle of the range. EEG tends to yield estimates of sleep time that are about an hour shorter than self-reported sleep time, so the findings correspond to 5.5 to 7.5 hours of self-reported sleep, Lucey said.The U-shaped relationship held true for measures of specific sleep phases, including rapid-eye movement (REM), or dreaming, sleep; and non-REM sleep. Moreover, the relationship held even after adjusting for factors that can affect both sleep and cognition, such as age, sex, levels of Alzheimer s proteins, and the presence of APOE4. It was particularly interesting to see that not only those with short amounts of sleep but also those with long amounts of sleep had more cognitive decline,  said co-senior author David Holtzman, MD, a professor of neurology.  It suggests that sleep quality may be key, as opposed to simply total sleep. Each person s sleep needs are unique, and people who wake up feeling rested on short or long sleep schedules should not feel compelled to change their habits, Lucey said. But those who are not sleeping well should be aware that sleep problems often can be treated. I ask many of my patients,  How s your sleep?  said co-senior author Beau M. Ances, MD, PhD, the Daniel J. Brennan, MD, Professor of Neurology. Ances treats patients with dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.  Often patients report that they re not sleeping well. Often once their sleep issues are treated, they may have improvements in cognition. Physicians who are seeing patients with cognitive complaints should ask them about their quality of sleep. This is potentially a modifiable factor. Reference: Lucey BP, Wisch J, Boerwinkle AH, et al.

These cells have been found to coordinate the immune responses of the gut following pathogen invasion and could be key targets when exploring new treatments for inflammatory bowel conditions.   Maintaining a healthy intestine and repairing tissue after infection or other types of injury is a complex process, and if this goes wrong, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and colitis. While much previous research in this area has focused on the activity of different immune cells, a lot of mysteries about the mechanisms behind these diseases still remain unanswered, which suggests that other cells may play a critical role.In their study, published in Nature today (20 October), researchers studied the role of enteric glial cells in response to tissue damage. These cells lie within the gut wall and form part of the enteric nervous system which governs the contractions of intestinal muscles and other aspects of digestive function.They infected mice with a common roundworm parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, and found that when the parasite invades the gut wall, a protein, called interferon gamma, is quickly released by immune cells. Although this protein so far was thought to target cells of the immune system, this new study found that one of its first targets are the nearby glial cells. The protein activates these cells which then release signals that attract other immune cells to the site of damage to fight the infection. To identify if similar mechanisms occur in humans, the researchers analysed data previously collected by others of colon samples from people with ulcerative colitis, a long-term condition where the colon and rectum become inflamed, and which causes severe diarrhoea and stomach cramps. Similar to the mouse cells, genes associated with interferon gamma were also activated in the human glial cells. This suggests that glial cells in the human gut are also implicated in inflammatory conditions of this organ. Fr nze Progatzky, author and postdoctoral scientist in the Crick s Development and Homeostasis of the Nervous System Lab, says:  Sadly, currently treatments for inflammatory bowel disease are often limited to alleviating the symptoms, rather than tackling the cause. Our insights into the importance of enteric glial cells in maintaining a healthy intestine open the door to further studies into how these cells work and interact with the immune system and in the future could help us develop potential new treatments for these conditions. The team also studied the role of glial cells in maintaining healthy intestinal gut tissues, in the absence of infection. To do this, they blocked the ability of enteric glial cells to be activated by interferon gamma and found that this led to tissue inflammation even in normal mice. This shows the cells are also important outside of disease or injury, in maintaining healthy intestinal tissue.   Vassilis Pachnis, author and group leader of the Development and Homeostasis of the Nervous System Lab at the Crick, says:  Glial cells are present in many organs, and so it s possible they also play similar roles in maintaining healthy tissue and mounting appropriate responses to pathogens or toxins in other parts of the body. It will be exciting to explore this possibility further. Reference: Progatzky F, Shapiro M, Chng SH, et al. Regulation of intestinal immunity and tissue repair by enteric glia.

Now, a new study led by researchers at UPF, Centro Nacional de Investigationes Cardiovasculares (CNIC), CIBERNED and Instituto de Medicina Molecular Jo o Lobo Antunes (iMM, Portugal), published on 15 October in the journal Science, describes a new mechanism for muscle repair after physiological damage relying on the rearrangement of muscle fibre nuclei, and independently of muscle stem cells. This protective mechanism paves the way to a broader understanding of muscle repair in physiology and disease.Skeletal muscle tissue, the organ responsible for locomotion, is formed by cells (fibres) that have more than one nucleus, an almost unique feature in our body. Despite the plasticity of these fibres, their contraction can be associated with muscle damage. William Roman, first author of the study and researcher at UPF, explains:  Even in physiological conditions, regeneration is vital for muscle to endure the mechanical stress of contraction, which often leads to cellular damage . Although muscle regeneration has been investigated in depth in recent decades, most studies centred on mechanisms involving several cells, including muscle stem cells, which are required when extensive muscle damage occurs . In this study we found an alternative mechanism of muscle tissue repair that is muscle-fibre autonomous , says Pura Mu oz-C noves, ICREA professor and principal investigator at UPF and the CNIC, and study leader. Researchers (including Antonio Serrano (UPF) and Mari Carmen G mez-Cabrera (University of Valencia and INCLIVA) used different in vitro models of injury and models of exercise in mice and humans to observe that upon injury, nuclei are attracted to the damage site, accelerating the repair of the contractile units. Next, the team dissected the molecular mechanism of this observation:  Our experiments with muscle cells in the laboratory showed that the movement of nuclei to injury sites resulted in the local delivery of mRNA molecules. These mRNA molecules are translated into proteins at the site of injury to act as building blocks for muscle repair , explains William Roman.  This muscle fibre self-repair process occurs rapidly both in mice and in humans after exercise-induced muscle injury, and thus represents a time- and energy-efficient protective mechanism for the repair of minor lesions , adds Pura Mu oz-C noves.In addition to its implications for muscle research, this study also introduces more general concepts for cell biology, such as the movement of nuclei to injury sites.  One of the most fascinating things about these cells is the movement during the development of their nuclei, the biggest organelles inside the cell, but the reasons why nuclei move are largely unknown. Now, we have shown a functional relevance for this phenomenon in adulthood during cell repair and regeneration , says Edgar R. Gomes, group leader at the Instituto de Medicina Molecular and a professor at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Lisbon, who co-led the study.On the importance of these discoveries, Pura Mu oz-C noves, Antonio Serrano and Mari Carmen G mez-Cabrera agree that:  This finding constitutes an important advance in the understanding of muscle biology, in physiology (including exercise physiology) and muscle dysfunction .Reference: Roman W, Pinheiro H, Pimentel MR, et al.

It is not rare, with an estimated 3 million persons in the United States suffering from TRD. In a novel study, published in the October 19, 2021 online issue of The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, an international team of scientists led by senior author Zafiris J. Daskalakis, MD, PhD, professor of psychiatry and chair of the Department of Psychiatry at University of San Diego School of Medicine, investigated whether continued magnetic seizure therapy (MST) might effectively prevent the relapse of TRD, particularly in comparison to what is known about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the current standard of care but a method with mixed results and a controversial history.ECT is a procedure, performed under general anesthesia, in which small electric currents are passed through the brain, triggering a brief seizure and changes in brain chemistry that reverse symptoms of some mental health conditions, most notably depression and mania. ECT dates back to the 1930s. Early treatments involved high doses of electricity administered without anesthesia, resulting in memory loss, fractured bones and other serious side effects. Contemporary ECT uses much lower levels of electric stimulus in combination with anesthesia to avoid pain and muscle relaxants to reduce the physical dangers of a seizure. ECT often works when other treatments are unsuccessful, but it does not work for everyone, and some side effects may still occur, such as confusion and memory loss. These concerns, and a lingering public stigma, have limited its widespread use.MST is a different form of electrical brain stimulation, debuting in the late-1990s. It induces a seizure in the brain by delivering high intensity magnetic field impulses through a magnetic coil. Stimulation can be tightly focused to a region of the brain, with minimal effect on surrounding tissues and fewer cognitive side effects. Like ECT, MST is being studied for treating depression, psychosis and obsessive-compulsive disorder.While ECT and, to a lesser degree MST, have both been shown in previous research to produce immediate benefit in treating at least some cases of acute or treatment-resistant depression, much less is known about whether continued MST might prevent relapse of mental illness. In the latest study, the first of its kind, Daskalakis and colleagues investigated whether continued use of MST prevented a recurrence of treatment-resistant (unipolar) major depressive disorder or bipolar depression, which includes symptoms of mania.The researchers enrolled participants with qualifying diagnoses and who had responded well to an acute course of MST to receive a course of continuation MST. Between February 2012 and June 2019, 30 participants received 12 continuation MST sessions with decreasing frequency over the course of six months. One-third of the patients experienced relapse of depression or required psychiatric hospitalization, with no significant differences between those with unipolar and bipolar depression. However, the other two-thirds sustained improvements in depressive symptoms without any adverse cognitive effects.   The authors noted that the relapse rate for continued MST was lower than earlier research assessing one-time, acute MST: 33 percent compared to 50 percent. They also observed that those that had suicidal ideation improve with acute MST had sustained resolution of these symptoms throughout the course of continuation MST. Most neurocognitive tests showed no significant differences during MST continuation. Indeed, verbal fluency improved. These results also show that additional MST treatments repeated over a long period of time continued to be a safe and tolerable procedure. Reference: Tang VM, Blumberger DM, Throop A, et al.

They found that in the SBW25 strain, which mutated in a predictable way, there was a region where the DNA strand looped back on itself forming a hairpin-shaped tangle.These tangles can disrupt the cell machinery, called DNA polymerase, which copies the gene during cell division, and so makes mutations more likely to happen.When the team removed the hairpin structure using six silent mutations (without changing the sequence of the protein produced), this abolished the mutational hotspot and the bacteria started evolving in a much wider variety of ways to get back its swimming ability.Dr Tiffany Taylor, from the Milner Centre for Evolution, said:  DNA normally forms a double helix structure, but when the DNA is copied, the strands are briefly separated. We ve found there are hotspots in the DNA where the sequence causes the separated strands of DNA to get twisted back on themselves - a bit like when you pull apart the strands of a rope - this results in a tangle. When the DNA polymerase enzyme runs along the strand to copy the gene, it bumps into the tangle and can skip, causing a mutation. Our experiments show that we were able to create or remove mutational hotspots in the genome by altering the sequence to cause or prevent the hairpin tangle. This shows that while natural selection is still the most important factor in evolution, there are other factors at play too. If we knew where the potential mutational hotspots in bacteria or viruses were, it might help us to predict how these microbes could mutate under selective pressure. Mutational hotspots have already been found in cancer cells, and the researchers plan to search for them across a range of bacterial species, including important pathogens.This information can help scientists better understand how bacteria and viruses evolve, which can help in developing vaccines against new variants of diseases. It can also make it easier to predict how microbes might develop resistance to antibiotics.Dr James Horton, who has recently completed his PhD at the Milner Centre for Evolution, said:  Like many exciting discoveries, this was found by accident. The mutations we were looking at were so-called silent because they don t change the resulting protein sequence, so initially we didn t think they were particularly important. However our findings fundamentally challenge our understanding of the role that silent mutations play in adaptation. Reference: Horton JS, Flanagan LM, Jackson RW, Priest NK, Taylor TB.

In class, instructors toss out ideas; sometimes they go over our heads, but other times we grasp them quickly.The sentences above contain familiar metaphors, sometimes called clich s: common words or phrases borrowed from physical actions to convey abstract concepts. Poets and writers may create new and compelling metaphors, but all of us use hundreds of these everyday metaphors in regular conversations.A team of Princeton scientists has found a way to measure the impact of this metaphorical language. By tracking split-second pupil dilation as a response to an impactful experience, they ve found that our brains consistently pay more attention to conventional metaphors than similar alternatives. For example,  grasping a new idea  triggers a bigger response than either the literal equivalent  learning a new idea  or the concrete phrase  grasping a doorknob. Language research lies at the intersection of science and the humanities,  said Adele Goldberg, a professor of psychology at Princeton who is also an associated faculty member in the Program in Linguistics.  The concrete terms used in metaphors offer us a way to ground our abstract thoughts in the physical world. The current work encourages us to lean into metaphors to engage with one another more closely.  She is the senior author of a paper appearing in the December issue of the Journal of Memory and Language.Her research offers a possible explanation as to why metaphorical expressions are so common in all known languages: Metaphorical expressions are more engaging and convey richer meaning than literal phrases that express the same basic content, or concrete descriptions that use similarly imageable words.Goldberg and her colleagues plan to investigate whether everyday metaphors evoke the same effect in children and neurodivergent people (people whose brains process differently from what is considered typical, including those on the autism spectrum), with the goal of better understanding the role of metaphorical language in communication generally. The researchers also considered the implications for teachers and parents and how metaphorical language might help them communicate more effectively with students and children. We re interested in why people on the autism spectrum often struggle with language,  Goldberg said.  It s the one population that often learns language late and sometimes not at all. When people with autism do learn language, they can have trouble understanding sarcasm and metaphorical language. We d like to test a group of highly verbal people with autism to see if they show the same effect as the neurotypical people in the current study. The research process centered on the fact that the pupil   the black dot at the center of the eye   dilates in response to emotionally charged or intellectually engaging experiences. Many people don t realize that the pupil expanding is an indication   a measurable indication   that you re more engaged,  Goldberg said. Her previous work used fMRI brain scans to show that the amygdala, considered the emotional center in our brains, responds more to metaphors than literal language. This time, the researchers wanted tighter time controls. It takes a couple seconds for blood to flow to a new section of the brain and light up an fMRI scan, but pupils respond in a fraction of a second.The project was initiated by Serena Mon, a member of the Class of 2020, during her junior year. Her research continued into her senior thesis.  I found it fascinating that we could see the real-time responses, word by word, in how pupil size was changing,  said Mon.  We saw over and over again that when our subjects reached the metaphorical part of the sentence, that split second was when the pupils dilated.  In addition, the pupils remained dilated for a couple of seconds, suggesting a significant level of increased engagement. Mon had wanted to separate out the possibility that humans just prefer concrete visuals like balls and grasping hands to conceptional words.  In Adele s previous work, they had looked at metaphor versus literal,  said Mon, whose work won her the George A. Miller Prize in Cognitive Science, given annually to the best interdisciplinary senior thesis in cognitive science.  We were thinking that with a third category   the concrete   it would really help us identify: What is it that makes metaphors more engaging than these other two control types of sentences? So instead of simply comparing a common metaphor such as  grasp an idea  to a literal paraphrase such as  understand an idea,  as had been done in the fMRI study, Mon added a third category: a concrete description that used the same key words, but in a purely literal way, such as  grasp a rail. The team created a database of 180 sentences   60 metaphors, 60 literal translations of the metaphors and 60 concrete phrases   all of which were put through an exhaustive  norming  process to make sure listeners judged them to be equal in terms of familiarity, complexity, intensity, plausibility and positivity. Mon has since made the database publicly available for other researchers.In addition to measuring participants  pupils as they listened to sentences, the researchers also asked different groups of participants questions about them, as part of the norming process. They found that when metaphorical and literal sentences were compared directly, participants judged metaphorical sentences to be significantly more emotional and convey richer meaning, but they were not considered any more informative. When they combined this with the pupil data, the researchers concluded that conventional metaphors are measurably more engaging than literal paraphrases or concrete sentences in a way that is not a function of difficulty or amount of information. Some people feel these types of very conventional metaphorical expressions are clich s to be avoided, but insofar as they are more engaging, there is no reason to shy away from them,  said Goldberg, who is also the associate chair of Princeton s Department of Psychology.  Maybe that s a moral for teachers or for parents. If we want to engage our students or our children, these can help, so don t avoid them. This work confirms and extends earlier findings from Goldberg s group in collaboration with then-postdoctoral researcher Francesca Citron, now a professor at Lancaster University, which had found greater amygdala activity in response to metaphors compared to literal paraphrases in a series of fMRI studies. The researchers had originally hoped that the pupillometry study would tease apart emotional and cognitive engagement, but this proved difficult. We think of the amygdala   part of the lizard brain   as the seat of emotions like fear, but there s research showing that the amygdala is more active when we are cognitively engaged as well,  Goldberg said.  Pupils likewise dilate in response to both emotional engagement or cognitive engagement. In fact, we re hard pressed to come up with a dependent measure that doesn t react to both. She added:  It may not surprise anyone who has made a major life choice, taken an exam or fallen in love, that cognitive and emotional engagement are closely related. When you re emotionally engaged, you re also focused, and when you re cognitively engaged, there s an emotional response as well. I m beginning to think that they are so tightly connected that there may not be an unambiguous way to tease them apart. The other researchers on the team are graduate student Mira Nencheva; former postdoctoral research fellow Francesca Citron, now a lecturer in psychology at Lancaster University in England; and Casey Lew-Williams, a professor of psychology.Reference: Mon SK, Nencheva M, Citron FMM, Lew-Williams C, Goldberg AE.

One explanation for this could be the degree of efficiency of each organism's response to the damage sustained by its cells during its life, which eventually causes them to age. In relation to this, researchers at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and the University of Leicester (United Kingdom) have developed a new method to remove old cells from tissues, thus slowing down the ageing process. Specifically, they have designed an antibody that acts as a smart bomb able to recognize specific proteins on the surface of these aged or senescent cells. It then attaches itself to them and releases a drug that removes them without affecting the rest, thus minimizing any potential side effects. The results of this work, which have been published in Scientific Reports, open the door to the development of effective treatments to delay the progress of age-related diseases and even the ageing process itself in the longer term, with the aim of increasing the longevity and, above all, the quality of life of people at this stage of their lives.""We now have, for the first time, an antibody-based drug that can be used to help slow down cellular senescence in humans,"" noted Salvador Macip, the leader of this research and a doctor and researcher at the UOC and the University of Leicester. ""We based this work on existing cancer therapies that target specific proteins present on the surface of cancer cells, and then applied them to senescent cells,"" explained the expert.All living organisms have a mechanism known as ""cellular senescence"" that halts the division of damaged cells and removes them to stop them from reproducing. This mechanism helps slow down the progress of cancer, for example, as well as helping model tissue at the embryo development stage.However, in spite of being a very beneficial biological mechanism, it contributes to the development of diseases when the organism reaches old age. This seems to be because the immune system is no longer able to efficiently remove these senescent cells, which gradually accumulate in tissues and detrimentally affect their functioning. Laboratory experiments previously carried out with animal models showed that eliminating these cells with drugs successfully delayed the progress of the disease and the decline associated with age itself. This was done using a new type of drug, known as senolytics. However, they lack specificity and have side effects, hindering their use in humans.The drug designed by Macip and his team is a second-generation senolytic with high specificity and remote-controlled delivery. They started from the results of a previous study that looked at the ""surfaceome"", the proteins on the cell's surface, to identify those proteins that are only present in senescent cells. ""They're not universal: some are more present than others on each type of aged cell,"" said Macip. In this new work, the researchers used a monoclonal antibody trained to recognize senescent cells and attach to them. ""Just like our antibodies recognize germs and protect us from them, we've designed these antibodies to recognize old cells. In addition, we've given them a toxic load to destroy them, as if they were a remote-controlled missile,"" said the researcher, who is the head of the University of Leicester's Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Lab. Treatment could start to be given as soon as the first symptoms of the disease, such as Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's, arthritis, cataracts or some tumours, appear. In the long term, the researchers believe that it could even be used to achieve healthier ageing in some circumstances. Reference: Poblocka M, Bassey AL, Smith VM, et al.

However, existing genome editing technologies frequently result in unwanted mutations or can fail to introduce any changes at all. These problems have kept the field from reaching its full potential.Now, new research from the laboratory of Princeton University researcher Britt Adamson, conducted with collaborators in the lab of Jonathan Weissman, a member of Whitehead Institute and a professor of biology at the Massachussetts Insittute of Technology and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Cecilia Cotta-Ramusino, formerly at Editas Medicine, details a novel method called Repair-seq that reveals in exquisite detail how genome editing tools work. We ve known for a long time that the mechanisms involved in fixing broken DNA are essential for genome editing because to change the sequence of DNA you first have to break it,  said Britt Adamson, senior author on the study and assistant professor in the Princeton Department of Molecular Biology and the Lewis-Sigler Institute of Integrative Genomics.  But those processes are incredibly complex and thus often difficult to untangle. To repair DNA, cells use many different mechanisms, each involving sets of genes working together in distinct pathways. Repair-seq allows researchers to probe the contribution of these pathways to repair of specific DNA lesions by simultaneously profiling how hundreds of individual genes affect mutations produced at damaged sites. The researchers can then generate mechanistic models of DNA repair and learn how those mechanisms impact genome editing. Adamson and colleagues applied their method to one of the most commonly used genome editing approaches, CRISPR-Cas9, which employs the bacterial Cas9 nuclease to cut across both strands of the double-stranded DNA molecule, creating lesions called double-strand breaks. Editing with double-strand breaks has been the bread and butter of genome editing for a long time, but making intended changes without unwanted mutations has been an enormous challenge,  said the study s first author Jeffrey Hussmann, who conducted the work while a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Jonathan Weissman.  We set out to understand the mechanisms behind as many of the induced mutations as possible, reasoning that this could help us optimize the system. Repair-seq experiments generate an enormous amount of data. Analysis of that data, led by Hussmann, produced a map of how different DNA repair pathways are linked to particular types of Cas9-induced mutations. Building on a rich history of research in the field, Hussmann s analysis illuminated pathways that were already known, and identified new ones, which together highlight the enormous complexity and myriad of systems involved in double-strand break repair. The deep set of data unearthed in this work is now posted on an online portal that others can use to interrogate DNA repair genes and pathways.Separately, a team led by David Liu at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard developed a genome editing system called  prime editing  that doesn t rely on creating double-strand breaks. Prime editing efficiencies vary widely by cell type and target site, but the researchers suspected that identifying the DNA repair pathways involved might help identify avenues for improvement. With this in mind, Adamson and Hussmann joined forces with Liu and colleagues to investigate prime editing using Repair-seq. Working together was a huge benefit,  said Adamson.  For us, it was a fantastic experience of collaborative and team-oriented science. The collaborating researchers found that the ability to obtain intended edits with prime editing was affected by proteins in the DNA mismatch repair pathway. They then showed that inhibiting or evading that pathway dramatically enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of prime editing outcomes positioning prime editing to become a more broadly applicable genome editing technology. Working with Britt, Jonathan, and their labs has been a beautiful integration of basic science, tool application, and technology development a real testament to the power of multidisciplinary collaboration,  Liu said.Importantly, this work also demonstrates how Repair-seq can be used to improve other genome-editing technologies. In fact, the collaborating researchers have already applied it to a third genome editing system, which was also developed by scientists working under Liu. Results from that study were recently published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. Repair-seq is a beautiful marriage of technological savvy and biological insight,  saidJohn Doench, director of research and development in the Genetic Perturbation Program at the Broad Institute, who was not involved with the work. And for the work on prime editing, what a wonderful example of collaboration! Prime editors have often proven difficult to work with, and this paper starts to understand why, while also kickstarting novel solutions,  he added.Moving forward, the team will continue to improve the platform and apply it to additional genome editing technologies. We see Repair-seq as a tool that allows you to take a detailed picture of what genome editors are doing inside cells and then very quickly assess,  Is this a landscape in which I can find design principles that will help improve the tool?  Adamson said.  We are really excited to explore future applications. References: 1. Chen PJ, Hussmann JA, Yan J, et al.

Its churning is powered by differences in the water's temperature and saltiness, and weather patterns around the world are regulated by its activity.A pair of researchers studied the Atlantic portion of this worldwide conveyor belt called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, and found that winter weather in the United States critically depends on this conveyor belt-like system. As the AMOC slows because of climate change, the U.S. will experience more extreme cold winter weather. The study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment was led by Jianjun Yin, an associate professor in the University of Arizona Department of Geosciences and co-authored by Ming Zhao, a physical scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. AMOC works like this: Warm water travels north in the upper Atlantic Ocean and releases heat into the atmosphere at high latitudes. As the water cools, it becomes denser, which causes it to sink into the deep ocean where it flows back south. ""This circulation transports an enormous amount of heat northward in the ocean,"" Yin said. ""The magnitude is on the order of 1 petawatts, or 10 to the 15 power watts. Right now, the energy consumption by the entire world is about 20 terawatts, or 10 to the 12 power watts. So, 1 petawatt is enough to run about 50 civilizations."" But as the climate warms, so does the ocean surface. At the same time, the Greenland ice sheet experiences melting, which dumps more freshwater into the ocean. Both warming and freshening of the water can reduce surface water density and inhibit the sinking of the water, slowing the AMOC. If the AMOC slows, so does the northward heat transport. This is important because the equator receives more energy from the sun than the poles. Both the atmosphere and ocean work to transport energy from low latitudes to high latitudes. If the ocean can't transport as much heat northward, then the atmosphere must instead transport more heat through more extreme weather processes at mid-latitudes. When the atmosphere moves heat northward, cold air is displaced from the poles and pushed to lower latitudes, reaching places as far south as the U.S. southern border. ""Think of it as two highways connecting two big cities,"" Yin said. ""If one is shut down, the other one gets more traffic. In the atmosphere, the traffic is the daily weather. So, if the ocean heat transport slows or shuts down, the weather becomes more extreme."" Yin said the study was motivated by the extreme cold weather Texas experienced in February. ""In Houston, the daily temperature dropped to 40 degrees Fahrenheit below the normal,"" Yin said. ""That's the typical range of a summer/winter temperature difference. It made Texas feel like the Arctic. This kind of extreme winter weather happened several times in the U.S. during recent years, so the scientific community has been working to understand the mechanism behind these extreme events."" The crisis in Texas caused widespread and catastrophic power outages, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated that socioeconomic damages totaled $20 billion. Yin was curious about the role the ocean played in the extreme weather event. Yin and Zhao used a state-of-the-art, high-resolution global climate model to measure the influence of the AMOC on U.S. extreme cold weather. They ran the model twice, first looking at today's climate with a functioning AMOC. They then adjusted the model by inputting enough freshwater into the high-latitude North Atlantic to shut down the AMOC. The difference revealed the role of the AMOC in extreme cold weather. They found that without the AMOC and its northward heat transport, extremely cold winter weather intensifies in the U.S. According to recent observational studies, the AMOC has weakened in past decades. Climate models project it will get even weaker in response to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ""But there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the weakening because, at this point, we don't know exactly how much the Greenland ice sheet will melt,"" Yin said. ""How much it melts depends on the greenhouse gas emissions."" The researchers also didn't take into account in their model the effects of human-caused global warming, but that's an area of interest for the future, Yin said. ""We basically just turn off the AMOC (in the model) to look at the response by extreme weather,"" he said. ""Next, we want to factor in the greenhouse gases and look at the combined effects of the AMOC slowdown and global warming on extreme cold weather.""ReferenceYin J, Zhao M.

A new study from MIT, which analyzed two different diets in mice, reveals how those diets affect cancer cells, and offers an explanation for why restricting calories may slow tumor growth.The study examined the effects of a calorically restricted diet and a ketogenic diet in mice with pancreatic tumors. While both of these diets reduce the amount of sugar available to tumors, the researchers found that only the calorically restricted diet reduced the availability of fatty acids, and this was linked to a slowdown in tumor growth.The findings do not suggest that cancer patients should try to follow either of these diets, the researchers say. Instead, they believe the findings warrant further study to determine how dietary interventions might be combined with existing or emerging drugs to help patients with cancer. There s a lot of evidence that diet can affect how fast your cancer progresses, but this is not a cure,  says Matthew Vander Heiden, director of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the senior author of the study.  While the findings are provocative, further study is needed, and individual patients should talk to their doctor about the right dietary interventions for their cancer.

The work   detailed in a newly published paper in Advanced Materials  has uncovered a novel framework for the potential development of drug-free cancer therapies.Led by scientists at the Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate Center, CUNY (CUNY ASRC), the research team was able to design nanoparticles that are activated to self-assemble when they encounter cancer cells and send messages to instruct the cells to slow their growth. Because the nanoparticles communicate only with the cancer cells, the surrounding healthy cells aren t impacted. Cancer cells take up materials from their environment, and they also secrete factors that help them degrade surrounding tissue in order to spread and metastasize,  said Richard Huang, lead author of the paper, a Ph.D. student at the Graduate Center, CUNY (GC CUNY), and a researcher with the CUNY ASRC Nanoscience Initiative and the Center for Discovery and Innovation at CUNY s City College of New York (CCNY).  We made particles that respond to both of these characteristics by aggregating into clusters that are actively taken up by cancer cells. Once inside, they appear to be able to reduce the cancer cells  metabolic activity and consequently reduce their growth. One reason the progression of cancer is difficult to control is that the cells secrete an abnormally large amount of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) enzyme, which breaks down the collagen that holds together healthy tissue. The research team was able to use this feature against the cancer cells. This is achieved by designing nanoparticles that when triggered by MMP-9, begin assembling to large aggregates in the cells  vicinity. The cells engulf these aggregates, and their size causes physical distress to the cancer cells and reduces their ability to proliferate and survive.One highlight of the study is that the researchers were able to use confocal reflection microscopy to visualize the nanoparticle aggregates inside the cancer cells in real-time.  This label-free, live imaging technique allowed us to have a closer look at when and where the aggregates were formed, and how the cancer cells respond to the particles at the sub-cellular level,  said Ye He, director of the Live Imaging and Bioenergetics Facility in the CUNY ASRC Neuroscience Initiative.  Through this research, we wanted to determine whether it s possible to make use of relatively simple peptide design to create nanoparticles that could produce robust self-assembly in biological media and have an impact on cancer cells,  said Rein Ulijn, director of the CUNY ASRC Nanoscience Initiative and the study s principal investigator.  While this is early-stage research, the findings provide exciting possibilities for a drug-free therapeutic treatment that could be extremely useful for cancer patients who have developed drug resistance and for extending the lives of people with metastatic cancer.

The Vikings got there centuries beforehand, although exactly when has remained unclear. Here, scientists of the University of Groningen and an international team of collegues, show that Europeans were already active in the Americas in 1021 AD. The article Evidence for European presence in the Americas in AD 1021 has recently been published in Nature.The Vikings sailed great distances in their iconic longships. To the west, they established settlements in Iceland, Greenland and eventually a base at L Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada. However, it has remained unclear when this first transatlantic activity took place. Here, scientists show that Europeans were present in the Americas in 1021 AD - precisely 1000 years ago this year. This date also marks the earliest known point by which the Atlantic had been crossed, and migration by humankind had finally encircled the entire planet. In this study, the chopping of wood by Vikings at L'Anse aux Meadows was dated to exactly the year 1021 AD. The three pieces of wood studied, from three different trees, all came from contexts archaeologically attributable to the Vikings. Each one also displayed clear evidence of cutting and slicing by blades made of metal - a material not produced by the indigenous population. The exact year was determinable because a massive solar storm occurred in 992 AD that produced a distinct radiocarbon signal in tree rings from the following year. ""The distinct uplift in radiocarbon production that occurred between 992 and 993 AD has been detected in tree-ring archives from all over the world"" says Associate Professor of Isotope Chronology Michael Dee (Energy and Sustainability Research Institute Groningen (ESRIG), University of Groningen), director of the research. Each of the three wooden objects exhibited this signal 29 growth rings (years) before the bark edge. ""Finding the signal from the solar storm 29 growth rings in from the bark allowed us to conclude that the cutting activity took place in the year 1021 AD"" says Margot Kuitems (ESRIG, University of Groningen), first author of the paper. The number of Viking expeditions to the Americas, and the duration of their stay over the Atlantic, remain unknown. All current data suggest that the whole endeavour was somewhat short lived, and the cultural and ecological legacy of this first European activity in the Americas is likely to have been small. Nonetheless, botanical evidence from L'Anse aux Meadows has confirmed that the Vikings did explore lands further south than Newfoundland. 1021 AD is the earliest year in which European presence in the Americas can be scientifically proven. Previous dates for the Viking presence in the Americas have relied heavily on the Icelandic Sagas. However, these began as oral histories and were only written down centuries after the events they describe. Whilst contradictory and at times fantastical, the Sagas also suggest encounters occurred, both violent and amiable, between the Europeans and the indigenous people of the region. However, little archaeological evidence has been uncovered to support such exchanges. Other medieval accounts also exist, which imply prominent figures on the European mainland were made aware the Vikings had made landfall across the Atlantic. The Vikings were active in North America in the year 1021 AD. This now represents the earliest   and only   known year in which Europeans were present in the Americas prior to the arrival of Columbus in 1492 AD. It also represents a definitive point in time by which the Atlantic Ocean had been traversed and human migration had finally encircled the globe.ReferenceKuitems M, Wallace BL, Lindsay C, et al.

Two Princeton University researchers examined the efforts by New York City, the largest school district in the country, to determine the efficacy of its lead reduction strategies. Lead is a potent neurotoxin that, if ingested, can affect nearly every organ system in the body and severely disrupt physical development in children. Federal regulations on lead in products like paint, gasoline, and plumbing have drastically reduced the incidence of lead exposure in the United States in the past few decades.Still, lead poisoning continues to impact people   particularly those of color and low socioeconomic status. National estimates from 1999 to 2016 reveal that Black children between ages 1 and 5 had consistently higher levels of lead in their blood than white children. Additionally, people living in neighborhoods with large Black populations have reported significantly higher blood lead levels than people in predominantly white areas.  The crisis in Flint, Michigan was a reminder that lead poisoning remains a severe threat to human health,  said study co-author Jennifer L. Jennings, professor of sociology and public affairs at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.  We analyzed New York City school district s lead remediation efforts in hopes of determining how effective their strategies were, in the hopes of preventing another Flint-like situation. Jennings conducted the study with Scott Latham, associate research scholar. Together, they gathered and analyzed data from the New York City Department of Education, which conducted drinking water assessments in every school building during the 2016 to 2017 school year. Prior to lead remediation efforts, the average New York City student attended a school site where 8% of drinking fixtures   like water fountains and water bottle filling stations   tested at 15 parts of lead per billion parts of water (ppb), the U.S. Environmental Agency s lead  action level.  The researchers used school enrollment data to analyze lead exposure among racial groups and found that Black students attended schools with the greatest number of water fixtures with elevated lead levels. Any water fixtures testing at the  action level  were immediately removed and returned only after measuring at safer levels. Other buildings with older water fixtures or at least one fixture with elevated levels underwent routine flushing, pipe replacements, or filter installations. Newer fixtures were monitored for future maintenance.After New York City public schools were assessed and treated for lead, the percentage of water fixtures that were first tested at the  action level  significantly decreased. In 2018, the average student attended a school where 5.3% of water fixtures tested above the action level   a 2.7% decrease. On average, Black students saw the largest reduction in lead exposure than white, Hispanic, or Asian students. Through its remediation efforts, the New York City Department of Education made immense progress in reducing lead levels in school drinking water. Today, however, most New York City students attend a school where at least 1 in 20 drinking fixtures still test above the action level.Jennings and Latham theorize this may be due to the city s testing protocols. Lead levels in the same tap water can vary widely depending on the water s temperature, flow rate, length of stagnation, and the season of year. The metal is, therefore, extremely prone to false negatives. Still, the progress made by New York City demonstrates that removing and treating water fixtures with high lead levels can be an effective method of improving the safety of drinking water. The researchers emphasize the need for more documentation of lead exposure across schools and father research into additional remediation techniques.  Rising water temperatures, greater seasonal variability in precipitation, and more extreme weather events across the country due to climate change all have the potential to worsen lead levels in drinking water. It s imperative that we continue to document and analyze exposure in schools, student subgroups, and communities,  said Jennings.The researchers hope that future policies targeting lead exposure and control involve repeated water testing under a variety of conditions. Reducing and eliminating lead in drinking water is essential to the health and safety of children, students, and racially and socially vulnerable populations across the country.

One potential solution, a biodegradable polymer called polylactide (PLA), has so far not fully lived up to its promise, showing little sign of breakdown once in seawater. In a new study in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers set out to address this issue by incorporating RNA-inspired breaking points to the polymer.By some estimates, conventional plastic can take hundreds of years to decompose in the ocean, but no one really knows how long it will continue to clutter the seas. One replacement material, PLA, can be manufactured from natural sources, such as corn and potato starch. It can rapidly degrade under specific conditions, such as when composted, and is often used in compostable tableware and cutlery. However, studies of PLA in seawater and in soil found no significant signs of degradation after at least three years. Researchers have developed several approaches for making faster-degrading PLA, but these have drawbacks, such as altering the material s properties. It turns out that water can easily break apart the biological molecule RNA, thanks to a process called transesterification. So, taking inspiration from this process, Frederik Wurm and colleagues wanted to introduce chemical groups to PLA to make it easier for the polymer to break down in the ocean. The researchers added breaking points to PLA during its synthesis by incorporating transesterification sites similar to those found in RNA. They created different versions of the modified PLA, containing enough of these sites to account for 3-15% of the polymers. In experiments, they immersed films of the new PLAs in artificial seawater and measured the change in weight of the films, as well as the release of lactic acid, a degradation product of PLA. The polymer with the highest concentration of breaking points, 15%, broke down completely to lactic acid after two weeks. Polymers with lower concentrations took longer, and some could require as much as several years, they calculated. These results showed that the degradation rate can be tailored, depending on the amount of breaking points in the material. The potential applications aren t limited to PLA, according to the researchers. Adding breaking points may speed the decomposition of other plastic polymers and become a key strategy for preventing further marine pollution, they write.ReferenceRheinberger T, Wolfs J, Paneth A, Gojzewski H, Paneth P, Wurm FR.

Scientists have long known that red blood cells, which are essential in delivering oxygen throughout the body, also interacted with the immune system, but didn t know whether they directly altered inflammation, until now. The study, led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, was published today in Science Translational Medicine. Anemia is common, affecting about a quarter of the world s population. Acute inflammatory anemia is often seen early after an infection such as parasitic infections that cause malaria,  said senior author Nilam Mangalmurti, MD, an assistant professor of Medicine at Penn.  For a long time we haven t known why people, when they are critically ill from sepsis, trauma, COVID-19, a bacterial infection, or parasite infection, develop an acute anemia. These findings explain one of the mechanisms for the development of acute inflammatory anemia for the first time. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the immune system by activating immune responses like cytokine production. This study examined the red blood cells of about 50 sepsis patients and 100 COVID-19 patients and found that, during these illnesses, red blood cells express an increased amount of the specific TLR protein called TLR9 on their surface.Results showed that when the red blood cells bind too much inflammation-causing nucleic acid, they lose their normal structure, causing the body to not recognize them anymore. This leads immune cells, called macrophages, to  eat  them, taking them out of circulation in the body. When this happens it causes the immune system to become activated in otherwise unaffected organs, creating inflammation. This mechanistic discovery opens the door to research on how to block this specific receptor and create targeted therapies for autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and a whole host of inflammatory illnesses associated with acute anemia. Right now when patients in the ICU become anemic, which is almost all of our critically ill patients, the standard is to give them blood transfusions, which has long been known to be accompanied by a host of issues including acute lung injury and increased risk of death,  Mangalmurti said.  Now that we know more about the mechanism of anemia, it allows us to look at new therapies for treating acute inflammatory anemia without transfusions, such as blocking TLR9 on the red blood cells. Targeting this TLR9 may also be a way to dampen some of the innate immune activation without blocking this receptor in immune cells, which are very important for the host when fighting a pathogen or injury. Mangalmurti says that this DNA-binding discovery could also have implications for research into using red blood cells in diagnostics. For example, whether a physician could take red blood cells from a patient with pneumonia, sequence the nucleic acid that has been soaked up from the infection, and identify the specific kind of pathogen to better determine what kind of antibiotic to prescribe.Mangalmurti and fellow researchers are studying whether this is a valid option in diagnosing infection in critically ill patients and if this DNA-binding mechanism by red blood cells is a universal mechanism of anemia in parasitic infections.Reference: Lam L.

They said the yet-to-be-implemented water purification strategy could add another level of safety against pathogens that cause gastrointestinal ailments and other infections in humans. There is always a need for new techniques that are better, cheaper and more effective at safeguarding the public against disease-causing microorganisms,  said Shankar Chellam, professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  The water purification technique investigated in this study is a promising strategy to kill even more viruses at the earliest stages of water purification. The researchers have detailed their findings in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.Before water reaches homes, it undergoes multiple purification steps, namely coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. Conventional coagulation methods use chemicals to trigger the clumping of particles and microbes within untreated water. These aggregates can then be removed when they settle as sediments. While effective, Chellam noted that the chemicals used for coagulation could be very acidic, making their transport to treatment plants and storage a challenge.Instead of chemicals-based coagulation, the researchers investigated if an up-and-coming coagulation method that uses electricity was as effective at removing microbes from water. In particular, they used a surrogate of a nonenveloped virus, called MS2 bacteriophage, for their study. Their choice of microbes was motivated by the fact that MS2 bacteriophage shares structural similarities with many nonenveloped viruses that can persist in the water after treatment and cause disease in humans.For their experiments, the researchers inserted iron electrodes in a sample of untreated water laden with viruses. When they passed electrical currents, the anode oxidized, releasing iron ions into the solution. These ions combine with dissolved oxygen to produce hydroxyl radicals and also iron-rich precipitates. In the process, they found that as the iron precipitated, the virus attached to these clumps to form bigger aggregates, which could be easily removed from the water.Next, they investigated if this process also inactivated the virus. But while the iron aggregates helped in capturing the virus, they presented a problem to picture inactivation using electron microscopy. Clumping causes a tremendous challenge because there is no easy way to isolate the virus from the iron-rich aggregates, making it difficult to visualize viral damage and analyze if electrocoagulation was the cause of the viral damage or the virus extraction from the iron-rich clumps,  said Anindito Sen, a research scientist at the Texas A&M Microscopy and Imaging Center.To address this problem, Chellam s graduate student Kyungho Kim with Sen s guidance developed a novel computational technique to directly image the viruses aggregated alongside iron. Put briefly, they digitally inflicted damages on 3D images of an intact MS2 bacteriophage. Then they generated 2D versions of the damaged 3D model. Last, they compared these images with 2D microscopic images of the virus obtained after electrocoagulation.The researchers found that the damage in electrocoagulated viruses ranged from 10% to greater than 60%. Further, by following the same analysis with bacteriophages isolated from conventional coagulation, they observed that the viruses were not inactivated. The traditional multistep process of water purification has been there to ensure that even if one step fails, the subsequent ones can bail you out   a multiple barrier approach, so to speak,  Chellam said.  What we are proposing with electrocoagulation is process intensification, where coagulation and disinfection are combined within a single step before subsequent purification stages, to ensure better protection against waterborne pathogens.

Noting that conventional cutlery is made using high-energy processes, Li s team looked to naturally available materials for an alternative. When you look around at the hard materials you use in your daily life, you see many of them are man-made materials because natural materials won t necessarily satisfy what we need,  said Li in a press release. Anyone who has used a regular wooden knife can attest that they aren t the most efficient implements. But Li s new hardened knife is a different beast, forged in a two-step process. A final run through a hot press then further compacts the wood, creating a hardened block that, once dry, has a Brinell hardness number of 31.21, which is 23 times that of natural basswood. The process also avoids using the energy-guzzling, high-temperature processes required to create ceramic and steel products.Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the wood confirmed the reasons for its strength.  The strength of a piece of material is very sensitive to the size and density of defects, like voids, channels, or pits,  said Li.  The two-step process we are using to process the natural wood significantly reduces or removes the defects in natural wood, so those channels to transport water or other nutrients in the tree are almost gone. While the resulting product may be significantly softer than stainless steel, the hardened wooden knife, especially when carved so that the wood fiber is perpendicular to the direction of the blade, proved sharper than commercial steel or regular wooden knives. This was measured by cutting through a polymer wire while calculating the force at which the wire severs. When the knife was sawed back and forth on the wire, 0.75 kg of force was required to cut it, while a steel table knife needed 1.77 kg of force.To demonstrate the power of their knife with a less abstract test, the team served up a medium-rare steak and cut through it with their knife, as seen in the video below.

MIT researchers have now discovered a new way to jump-start the immune system to attack tumors, which they hope could allow immunotherapy to be used against more types of cancer.Their novel approach involves removing tumor cells from the body, treating them with chemotherapy drugs, and then placing them back in the tumor. When delivered along with drugs that activate T cells, these injured cancer cells appear to act as a distress signal that spurs the T cells into action. When you create cells that have DNA damage but are not killed, under certain conditions those live, injured cells can send a signal that awakens the immune system,  says Michael Yaffe, who is a David H. Koch Professor of Science, the director of the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine, and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.In mouse studies, the researchers found that this treatment could completely eliminate tumors in nearly half of the mice.Yaffe and Darrell Irvine, who is the Underwood-Prescott Professor with appointments in MIT s departments of Biological Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering, and an associate director of the Koch Institute, are the senior authors of the study, which appears today in Science Signaling.

Until now, examples of bacterial-fungal interactions were pretty limited in number and diversity,  said Aaron Robinson, a biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and lead author of a new paper describing the research in Nature s Communications Biology journal.  It had been assumed that bacterial-fungal associations might not be that common. But we found a lot of diverse bacteria that appear to associate with fungi, and we detected those associations at a frequent rate. The research contributes to an emerging understanding of the fungal bacteriome, the existence of bacteria both within and in close association with a fungal host, opening up possibilities for studying the interactions more intimately and connecting that research to issues such as ecosystem functioning and climate change impacts. This is a starting point to investigate mechanisms of bacterial-fungal interactions at a more intimate level,  said Robinson.  That research will be valuable for understanding what allows bacteria to associate with fungi, and how to best leverage that insight to accomplish goals for the Laboratory, for the Department of Energy, and for society in general. Understanding how these organisms interact with each other and contribute to larger systems is highly valuable in everything from modeling things like climate change to societally beneficial activities such as agricultural or industrial utilization of microbes. Researchers screened a total of 294 diverse fungal isolates from four culture collections from Europe, North America, and South America for potential bacterial associates. Collaborations with the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies at Los Alamos allowed researchers to visually examine several of these associations using fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques.These fluorescence microscopy examinations complemented the screening and confirmed the widespread and variable presence of bacterial associates among diverse fungal isolates and even within the hyphae (fungal tissue) of a single fungal host.In addition to screening the culture collections, the research team also screened 408 fungal genome sequencing projects from the MycoCosm portal, a repository of fungal genome projects developed and maintained by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute.Bacterial signatures were detected in 79 percent of the examined fungal genome projects. In multiple cases, the authors recovered complete or nearly complete genomes of these bacterial associates. Recovery of these fungal-associating bacterial genomes allowed for comparisons between fungal-associating and free-living bacteria.Of the 702 total fungal isolates examined by the research team, bacterial associates were found in 88 percent an unexpected detection rate relative to previous, more limited studies. The results shed light on the complexity and diversity of the fungal bacteriome across the fungal tree of life.The study s overview and description of diverse fungal-bacterial associations provides a path forward for understanding the associations in more depth. Continued analysis of the interactions will aid in a more complete understanding of environmental microbiome processes, particularly fungal and bacterial contributions to nutrient cycling, plant health and climate modeling.Within the context of changing climate conditions, understanding how bacterial-fungal interactions impact plants, animals, and general ecosystem functioning in diverse environments and under diverse conditions, such as drought and warming, will also help predict and potentially manipulate the impacts of these interactions.Reference: Robinson AJ, House GL, Morales DP, et al.

The publications was part of a project titled  Synthesis and study of a new class of nanocomposite ceramics with a degenerate dielectric constant for optoplasmonic applications  (supported by Russian Science Foundation); the project lead is Professor Sergey Kharintsev.As he says, quartz multimode optical fibers are widely used in telecommunications for data transmission, as distributed sensors   for measuring temperature, pressure, mechanical stresses, as well as distributed spectroscopic and acoustic probes in chemically aggressive media at high pressures and temperatures, for example, in oil exploration.  At high ambient temperatures and pressures, molecular hydrogen H2 and hydroxyl groups OH  can easily penetrate to the core of an optical fiber and enter into chemical reactions. This inevitably leads to an increase in optical loss and, consequently, to a deterioration in the transparency of the fiber. To solve this problem, amorphous carbon is usually used, which effectively protects the optical fiber from moisture and hydrogen. The thickness of the carbon layer is several tens of nanometers, and microstrains of the fiber do not cause a significant deterioration in optical transparency,  comments co-author, PhD student Svetlana Saparina. While investigating amorphous carbon coatings, the scientists found an irreversible increase in electrical resistance (up to 20%) during repeated heating and cooling cycles in air.  The increase in resistance is due to the interaction of amorphous carbon with water molecules from the environment. Dissociation of water molecules into H+ and OH- ions and their interaction with edge defects of amorphous carbon lead to the formation of C-H and COOH / C-OH functional groups. Using Raman scattering, we discovered the formation of a C = O carbonyl group when heated above 80 degrees, which annihilates when cooled to room temperature. Thus, the decomposition of water into H + and OH- and their irreversible binding to edge defects lead to the enrichment of the carbon layer with various functional groups. This mechanism leads to an increase in the electrical resistance of amorphous carbon. Defect-enriched carbon provides enhanced diffusion of hydrogen and moisture to the fiber core, making it less transparent,  continues Professor Kharintsev.ReferenceSaparina SV, Fishman AI, Stolov AA, Li J, Kharintsev SS.

Of the fish studied, 21 per cent were found to have microplastic particles in their gastrointestinal tracts. Coupled with the findings of the team s previous work looking at the amount of microplastic found in beluga stomachs, researchers estimate that the whales ingest upwards of 145,000 particles of microplastics a year. The lead author of the study, Rhiannon Moore, says that while the possible health impacts on belugas are unknown, the findings underscore how pervasive plastics are.  When we first investigated seven different beluga stomachs and found microplastics in all of them, I was quite surprised. These are animals that were in very remote northern areas and it wasn t just one kind of plastic that we found,  says Moore, who recently completed a masters of science degree at SFU. This is the first study to document microplastics in the stomachs of fish from the Eastern Beaufort Sea, located north of the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Alaska. Microplastic fibres, found in textiles and clothing, made up 78 per cent of the particles found in the stomachs of fish. The prevalence of microplastics in oceans is an emerging environmental concern and Moore says the studies show how nowhere is immune.  We use so much plastic in our society, and when improperly discarded they break apart into smaller and smaller pieces, and that makes them easy to be transported in ocean environments,  she says.  The results of these studies just further point to the reality that microplastics don t stay in one place. They move through the air, the water, they re in sediment and now we understand they re moving through the food chain.  Moore, who is now a Zero Waste Outreach Coordinator with the City of Victoria, says the studies just provide a snapshot in time and pointed out researchers don t know how long microplastics may stay in the digestive tract of animals or how they may be detrimental to their health. But it points to a need for humans to make more of an effort reduce the amount of plastic waste we produce.  This study adds to our long list of pollutants that end up in the Arctic, and highlights the need for urgent action to stem the release of plastics and microplastics in the more densely populated south,  adds Peter Ross, senior scientist at Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and co-author on the study.ReferenceMoore RC, Noel M, Etemadifar A, et al.

Evidence indicates exposure to high levels can lead to adverse health effects for humans and other species, and the study stresses the need for new ways to measure and study exposures to these synthetic chemicals from various sources including food. PFAS accumulate in the environment and do not break down on their own. For instance, the compounds can contaminate waterways after leaching from products discarded in landfills, said Keith Vorst, director of the Polymer and Food Protection Consortium and an associate professor of food science and human nutrition at Iowa State. These entirely manmade chemicals have been used in a wide range of products since the 1940s, and some states have enacted legislation to restrict their use. But their ability to persist in the environment means the compounds that already exist can continue to contaminate the environment.  They re out there, we need to be aware of them, and it s really hard to eliminate them,  Vorst said.  We need to work on mitigation strategies, and we need to be monitoring them and better understand the risks they pose. PFAS often have been used to coat food packaging as a barrier to keep grease from escaping. Vorst said paper wrappers on hamburgers are often coated in these compounds to prevent grease from leaking onto consumers  hands. The compounds have also been used widely to coat carpets, in car interiors and in fire-fighting foams. Some PFAS are no longer produced in the United States, but Vorst said more than 5,000 separate compounds qualify under this category, making it difficult for regulations to keep up with newly developed chemicals. Studies have indicated that exposure to high levels of some of these chemicals can cause reproductive and developmental, liver and kidney, and immunological effects in laboratory animals, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA reports the most consistent findings are increased cholesterol levels among exposed populations, and studies have found limited evidence for links between high levels of certain PFAS and low infant birth weights, effects on the immune system, cancer and thyroid hormone disruption. (https://www.epa.gov/pfas/basic-information-pfas)The new paper emerged out of a virtual symposium held in June of 2020 organized by the Institute for the Advancement of Food and Nutrition Sciences. The symposium featured scientists, engineers and regulatory professionals from public, private and academic institutions. The symposium addressed science gaps for exposure routes, detection and quantification of PFAS in food. Speakers also noted that, based on limited data to date, there is little PFAS detected in food. Polymer and Food Protection Consortium researchers Greg Curtzwiler, an assistant professor of food science and human nutrition, and Paulo Silva, adjunct assistant professor of food science and human nutrition, are working with Vorst in the laboratory to study potential mitigation strategies such as high voltage atmospheric cold plasma to change the chemistry of PFAS. This process could work by passing materials that contains PFAS, such as product packaging or even drinking water, through an engineered atmosphere to mitigate the compounds. The research team has tested the method and is working with Iowa State to patent the technology. Vorst s PFPC lab has been testing new methodologies to detect and monitor PFAS levels in various environments as well. Much of this research was funded by the ISU Polymer and Food Protection Consortium.  We re looking at continuous monitoring of exposure limits,  Vorst said.  We re trying to develop threshold limits for packaging and products. We re also looking at how we can change these chemistries to get them out of the environment, make them less persistent or sequester them. ReferenceVorst KL et al.

The current survey examines the literature published from 2012 to November 2020 to explore whether the consensus has changed. We are virtually certain that the consensus is well over 99% now and that it s pretty much case closed for any meaningful public conversation about the reality of human-caused climate change,  said Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and the paper s first author. It's critical to acknowledge the principal role of greenhouse gas emissions so that we can rapidly mobilize new solutions, since we are already witnessing in real time the devastating impacts of climate related disasters on businesses, people and the economy,  said Benjamin Houlton, the Ronald P. Lynch Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a co-author of the study,  Greater than 99% Consensus on Human Caused Climate Change in the Peer-Reviewed Scientific Literature,  which published Oct. 19 in the journal Environmental Research Letters.In spite of such results, public opinion polls as well as opinions of politicians and public representatives point to false beliefs and claims that a significant debate still exists among scientists over the true cause of climate change. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that only 27% of U.S. adults believe that  almost all  scientists agreed that climate change is due to human activity, according to the paper. A 2021 Gallup poll pointed to a deepening partisan divide in American politics on whether Earth s rising observed temperatures since the Industrial Revolution were primarily caused by humans. To understand where a consensus exists, you have to be able to quantify it,  Lynas said.  That means surveying the literature in a coherent and non-arbitrary way in order to avoid trading cherry-picked papers, which is often how these arguments are carried out in the public sphere. In the study, the researchers began by examining a random sample of 3,000 studies from the dataset of 88,125 English-language climate papers published between 2012 and 2020. They found only found four out of the 3,000 papers were skeptical of human-caused climate change.  We knew that [climate skeptical papers] were vanishingly small in terms of their occurrence, but we thought there still must be more in the 88,000,  Lynas said.Co-author Simon Perry, a United Kingdom-based software engineer and volunteer at the Alliance for Science, created an algorithm that searched out keywords from papers the team knew were skeptical, such as  solar,   cosmic rays  and  natural cycles.  The algorithm was applied to all 88,000-plus papers, and the program ordered them so the skeptical ones came higher in the order.

This is the first NIH grant awarded in over a half century to directly investigate the therapeutic effects of a classic psychedelic, consistent with a recent study published online that searched NIH funding and found zero grants were awarded between 2006 and 2020. Johns Hopkins Medicine will lead the multisite, three-year study in collaboration with University of Alabama at Birmingham and New York University. The study will be conducted simultaneously at the three institutions to diversify the pool of participants and increase confidence that results apply to a wide range of people who smoke. The grant, totaling nearly $4 million, is funded by NIH s National Institute on Drug Abuse. The historical importance of this grant is monumental,  says principal investigator Matthew Johnson, Ph.D., Susan Hill Ward Professor in Psychedelics and Consciousness in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  We knew it was only a matter of time before the NIH would fund this work because the data are so compelling, and because this work has demonstrated to be safe. Psilocybin does have very real risks, but these risks are squarely mitigated in controlled settings through screening, preparation, monitoring and follow-up care. Over the last 20 years, there has been a growing renaissance of research with classic psychedelics, which are the pharmacological class of compounds that includes psilocybin and LSD. These studies have been largely funded by philanthropy, resulting in impressive clinical findings for cancer-related existential distress, major depressive disorder and substance use disorders.Johnson initiated this line of research testing psilocybin for tobacco smoking cessation 13 years ago. A pilot study published in 2014 showed very high abstinence rates, much larger than those seen with traditional smoking cessation medications and therapies.The current double-blind randomized trial involves psilocybin sessions as well as cognitive behavioral therapy   a type of talk therapy (psychotherapy) focused on pinpointing negative patterns of thought that can lead to behavioral and mental health problems. The researchers suggest psilocybin might help break the addictive pattern of thoughts and behaviors that has become ingrained after years of smoking, thus helping people to quit the habit.Psilocybin, a compound found in so-called magic mushrooms, produces visual and auditory illusions and profound changes in consciousness. Combined with preparation and structured support, psilocybin has shown promise for treating a range of addictions and mental health disorders.

The researchers say that targeting the problem could lead to new treatments for a devastating form of the disease.UVA epilepsy researchers Eric R. Wengert and Manoj K. Patel and their team determined that a particular type of brain cell called somatostatin interneurons can cause seizures when they go haywire. These interneurons are typically thought to function as a built-in brake system to safeguard against excessive activity in the brain and prevent seizures, but Wengert and colleagues found that, when dysfunctional, somatostatin interneurons actually drive excessive brain activity and seizures. These malfunctions are triggered by mutations in a particular gene known to cause a rare epilepsy syndrome in human patients. These mutations are not inherited from the child s parents, but instead occur shortly after conception. Identifying the particular nerve cells that contribute to seizures is important because it helps direct the ways researchers go about developing novel therapies,  said Patel, of UVA s Department of Anesthesiology.  Based on this research, we now have a new cellular target to try to restore balance to the brain and prevent seizures. Understanding the Cause of Epileptic SeizuresThe researchers examined the role of somatostatin interneurons as part of their investigation of a rare neurological condition called SCN8A epileptic encephalopathy. SCN8A refers to a mutation in the SCN8A gene that causes the condition. Children with SCN8A epilepsy often suffer from recurrent seizures that do not respond to medication, as well as from severe developmental delays and movement disorders. They are also at significant risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, the No. 1 cause of epilepsy-related death. To better understand what occurs in SCN8A epileptic encephalopathy, the researchers developed mouse models of two SCN8A mutations discovered in patients. These models allowed them to determine which neurons are responsible for driving the neurological dysfunction. The researchers found that both SCN8A mutations caused harmful changes to sodium channels in a way that made somatostatin interneurons fizzle out and stop functioning when they normally would be highly active.  It s similar to a speeding car with a broken brake system that cannot slow it down,  Wengert said.  A brain without properly functioning somatostatin interneurons to dampen brain activity ends up with runaway excitation, which can result in a seizure. Based on their findings, the scientists believe that it may be possible to treat SCN8A epileptic encephalopathy by developing ways to fix the agitated interneurons. The results, they say, also help us better understand epilepsy more broadly. Although this work focused on SCN8A epilepsy, our results identify somatostatin interneurons as a general contributor to epileptic seizures,  Wengert said.  If we can identify ways to restore proper functioning in these cells, these approaches may be useful in providing better anti-seizure treatments to patients with various types of epilepsy.

However, we also know that overstimulated children can wreak havoc on a classroom, leaving a teacher trying to regain control of their group. The situation is very similar in the brain, where cells must remain active but in an orderly manner to carry out their many important tasks.If too many excitatory cells (the students in this metaphor) begin firing at the same time, the overexcitation can spread through an entire neural network (the classroom), resulting in epileptic activity. So, inhibitory cells (the teachers) tamp down the excitation to maintain balance in the brain.Now, researchers at Gladstone Institutes uncovered that reducing levels of the protein tau, which is known for its role in Alzheimer s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, changes excitatory and inhibitory cells in ways that make it harder for the brain to burst with overexcitation. Epilepsy can be associated with many brain disorders, including Alzheimer s disease and autism,  says Lennart Mucke, MD, director of the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease and senior author of the new study published in the journal Cell Reports. We previously showed in mouse models that reducing tau levels makes the brain more resistant to epilepsy of diverse causes, but we have puzzled about the underlying mechanisms. Our recent findings shed light onto how tau reduction affects different types of brain cells involved in creating abnormal network activity. It is critical to preserve a balance between the activity of excitatory and inhibitory cells for the brain to process information, appropriately control movements, and perceive things as they really are, rather than in a distorted way. The diseases we re interested in have in common that they cause an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the brain,  says Mucke, who is also the Joseph B. Martin Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience and a professor of neurology at UC San Francisco.Mucke and his team discovered that reducing levels of tau impacts both excitatory and inhibitory cells, but in different ways. They showed that excitatory neurons that lack tau don t fire as much, whereas inhibitory neurons that lack tau are more easily stimulated to fire.Together, these effects reduce the excitation-inhibition ratio in brain networks, counteracting diseases that cause abnormal increases in that ratio. To return to the classroom example, the neural effects of reducing tau are the equivalent of making the students less rambunctious and the teachers more effective at supervising them.Just like calm in the classroom facilitates learning, the calming effect of tau reduction on brain networks might improve the brain s ability to perform its functions, especially when the calm is being disrupted by disease. The insights gained in the new study could help guide the development of novel therapies that target tau as a way of reducing abnormal brain activities in a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases.Reference: Chang C-W, Evans MD, Yu X, Yu G-Q, Mucke L.

Now researchers at the Center for Mind and Brain at the University of California, Davis, have for the first time seen how specific brain regions activate as two-year-olds remember newly learned words   while the children were sleeping. The work is published Oct. 19 in Current Biology. We can now leverage sleep to look at basic mechanisms of learning new words,  said Simona Ghetti, professor at the Center for Mind and Brain and UC Davis Department of Psychology. At two to three years old, children enter a unique age in memory development, Ghetti said. But young children are challenging to study, and they especially dislike being in a functional MRI scanner.  The scariest things to small children are darkness and loud noises, and that s what it s like during an MRI scan,  Ghetti said. Ghetti s team had previously found that if children fell asleep in a scanner while it wasn t working, they could later start the scan and see brain activation in response to songs the children had heard earlier. In the new study, they looked at how toddlers retained memories of words. Graduate student Elliott Johnson and Ghetti created a series of made-up, but realistic sounding words as names for a series of objects and puppets. In the first session, two-year-olds were introduced to two objects and two puppets, then tested on their memory of the names after a few minutes. A week later, they returned and were tested on whether they remembered the names of the objects and puppets. Soon after the second test, they slept overnight in an MRI scanner. The researchers played back the words the children had learned, as well as other words, as they slept.  This article has been republished from the following materials.

Injured motor and sensory neurons in the central nervous system   the brain and spinal cord   have limited ability to heal, so people who survive such injuries can be left with chronic paralysis, numbness and pain.Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified a drug that helps sensory neurons in the central nervous system heal. Neurons are surrounded by support cells that protect and nurture them. In this study, the researchers gave mice with injured sensory neurons a drug called fenofibrate that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat high cholesterol. The drug activated the support cells surrounding sensory neurons and helped them regrow about twice as fast as sensory neurons in mice that received a placebo. The study is available online in eLife. When people think of spinal cord injury, they tend to think of paralysis, but there are a lot of problems with sensory processing and pain after spinal cord injury as well,  said senior author Valeria Cavalli, PhD, the Robert E. and Louise F. Dunn Professor of Biomedical Research and a professor of neuroscience.  Addressing those sensory issues could go a long way toward improving quality of life for survivors. Our data indicate that fenofibrate has the potential to activate these support cells and improve recovery, which means we could potentially repurpose this FDA-approved compound to help restore sensory function after nerve injuries. Unlike neurons in the brain or spinal cord, sensory nerves in the periphery of the body heal after injury, which is why a gash on your leg doesn t leave part of your leg permanently numb. To understand why regeneration occurs in the peripheral but not the central nervous system, Cavalli studies a unique cell type that spans both systems: sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. The cell bodies of such neurons bundle together into a structure known as a ganglion that sits just outside the spinal cord. A long, thin arm called an axon branches out from each cell body in opposite directions, with one branch heading into the central nervous system via the spinal cord and the other becoming part of the peripheral nervous system as it descends into the body. Despite being two parts of the same cell, the peripheral and central axonal branches do not respond identically after injury. The peripheral parts regrow and recover much faster and more completely than the central ones.Cavalli and first author Oshri Avraham, PhD, a staff scientist, suspected that the differences in regeneration between the two branches may come down to differences between the behavior of support cells in response to injury to the central versus peripheral axon branches.To investigate that possibility, the researchers compared gene expression in five kinds of support cells in the ganglion, after injury to the peripheral and central branches of the sensory neuron. They found that the patterns of gene expression in the support cells differed depending on which part of the neuron they injured. Most notably, so-called satellite glial cells ramped up expression of a set of genes known as the PPAR-alpha pathway   famous for its role in fat metabolism   only after injury in the peripheral axon branch. The pathway was not turned up after injury to central axonal branches, and was actually dialed down after spinal cord injury in the central nervous system.To Cavalli and Avraham, this observation suggested that the PPAR-alpha pathway may promote regeneration. To find out, they fed mice fenofibrate   a drug that activates PPAR alpha   for two weeks before injuring the mice s sensory axon branch heading into the central nervous system. Three days after the injury, the central branches of the sensory neuron axons had regrown about twice as much in the mice that had received fenofibrate than in those that had received a placebo. PPAR alpha is only expressed in satellite glial cells, not in neurons, so these results tell us that targeting these support cells can improve regeneration and potentially relieve sensory symptoms like pain,  Cavalli said.  It gives us an additional tool to design therapies to restore function after nerve injuries. We haven t fixed spinal cord injury, but we re one step closer to figuring out how to do it. Cavalli and colleagues are now planning experiments to combine fenofibrate with other experimental regeneration-promoting therapies targeting neurons or other aspects of the central nervous system to further enhance regeneration.Reference: Avraham O, Feng R, Ewan EE, Rustenhoven J, Zhao G, Cavalli V.

Centuries later researchers have found that inadequate sleep in children affects their emotional functioning in ways that may predict longer-term social problems. A new study, published in Affective Science by University of Houston professor of psychology Candice Alfano, examined whether changes in children s facial expressions of emotion after sleep restriction predict social problems concurrently and/or over time.   Sleep problems in children are routinely linked with lower social competence and more problems in peer relationships, but we really don t understand what drives these associations,  reports Alfano. Based on findings from some of her prior research, Alfano hypothesized that the answers might partly lie in the ways children s faces express emotions when tired.  To test this theory, Alfano and colleagues examined 37 children between the ages of 7 and 11 during two in-lab emotional assessments; one when children were well-rested and another after two nights of partial sleep restriction. During these assessments, children viewed positive (think kittens and ice cream) and negative (think getting a shot and ferocious dogs) pictures on a computer screen while a high-definition camera recorded their facial expressions. Participants  parents provided reports of their child s social functioning at that time and approximately two years later. ""As we suspected, children who displayed less positive facial expressions in response to pleasant images when sleep restricted were reported to have more social problems two years later, even when controlling for earlier social problems,  said Alfano. Although concurrent relationships between sleep-based changes in facial expressions and social problems were not found, Alfano suggests that this may be due to developmental differences in social behavior and peer relationships.   For younger children, more explicit behaviors such as sharing and taking turns may be more important for friendships than subtle facial expressions. However, emotional expression becomes more important with age,  explains Alfano.  Facial expressions not only provide others with an understanding of how you are feeling but are known to have a contagion effect on how others feel.  The results support a burgeoning body of research that indicates poor sleep quality in childhood forecasts later socio-emotional problems and also indicates the importance of studies exploring how sleep affects multiple facets of children s mental health and well-being. Facial expression, a central aspect of social communication, is one aspect of emotion where sleep loss takes a toll. Reference: Alfano CA, Kim J, Cifre AB, Palmer CA.

The study, which was published recently in Fertility and Sterility Science, is the first to show that functional sperm cells can be made in a dish using primate embryonic stem cells.  This is a major breakthrough towards producing stem cell-based therapies to treat male infertility in cases where the men do not produce any viable sperm cells,  said lead researcher Charles Easley, an associate professor in UGA s College of Public Health. Researchers used embryonic stem cells from rhesus macaque monkeys to generate immature sperm cells known as round spermatids, which they showed to be capable of fertilizing a rhesus macaque egg.Scientists have been able to produce sperm-like cells using mouse stem cells, said Easley, but rodent sperm production is distinctly different than humans. Until this work, it wasn t clear that this technology could ever work in humans. This is the first step that shows this technology is potentially translatable. We re using a species that's more relevant to us, and we're having success in making healthy embryos,  said Easley.Rhesus macaques share similar reproductive mechanisms to humans, making them an  ideal and necessary model for exploring stem cell-based therapies for male infertility,  the authors write.Using a novel method, the researchers differentiated the cells into immature sperm cells known as round spermatids. Like immature spermatids in vivo, fertilization with in vitro spermatids requires activating the egg and the addition of other factors to enable the fertilized egg to develop into a healthy embryo.This fall, the researchers plan to take the next critical step of implanting these embryos into a surrogate rhesus macaque to examine whether these embryos from in vitro spermatids can produce a healthy baby. If that step is successful, the team will carry out the same process using spermatid-like cells derived from macaque skin cells.Collaborators include Jon Hennebold from the Oregon National Primate Research Center and Kyle Orwig and Gerald Schatten from the University of Pittsburgh.Reference: Khampang S, Cho IK, Punyawai K, et al.

The technology the researchers have developed can also be applied on biotechnological production where it can provide novel insights at the single-cell level, which in turn can be used to improve cell line production capacity.   AML (acute myeloid leukemia) is a cancer of the blood that affects the normal stem cells in the bone marrow, which are thereby transformed into cancer stem cells, and maturation of the cells stops prematurely. These immature cells accumulate rapidly in the bone marrow and displace the normal cells. This leads to severe deficiency of normally functioning cells in the blood. AML is a very aggressive form of cancer and its treatment consists of intensive chemotherapy, which in many cases can minimize the amount of immature, diseased cells in the bone marrow to less than 5 percent. This is an indication that the disease is at rest and can no longer be detected by microscopic examination of the bone marrow and the patient is considered cured. However, even though the disease cannot be clinically detected, there could still be cancer stem cells present in the bone marrow. With approximately 50 % patient relapse and only 22% survival rate after 5 years of disease onset, this a real threat to a full recovery. ","Published: October 20, 2021"

But did you know that your body has a similar process for waste removal in which damaged cells are  thrown out ? A research team in Japan has recently shed new light on the dynamics of this process termed efferocytosis following ischemic stroke.In a new study published this month in Science Immunology, researchers from the University of Tsukuba use a mouse model to identify the role of a key cell receptor, CD300a, in the process of efferocytosis after stroke.During ischemic stroke, blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain leads to disrupted blood flow, which can trigger cell death. Dying cells in turn trigger inflammatory responses that may worsen damage in the brain and lead to neurological impairment. Therefore, the elimination of dying cells through efferocytosis is a key part of minimizing the effects of ischemic stroke. However, the process of efferocytosis is not fully understood. The group led by researchers from the University of Tsukuba sought to further clarify the role of efferocytosis in ischemic stroke, particularly in the super-acute phase, which occurs within hours of the initial onset of stroke. We focused on cell receptor CD300a because it has been shown to be involved in efferocytosis, but its particular role in the process is not entirely clear,  explains senior author Professor Akira Shibuya.  We thought that it might represent a potential target to reduce the damage caused by ischemic stroke. To investigate the role of CD300a in efferocytosis following stroke, researchers induced ischemic stroke in a mouse model that was deficient in CD300a and found that CD300a-deficient mice showed less neurological deficits in the super-acute phase of stroke compared with stroke-induced mice that had normal CD300a expression. These effects appeared to be the result of enhanced efferocytosis in the CD300a-deficient mice, illustrating the role of CD300a in the inhibition of efferocytosis.The researchers also found that treatment with an antibody that blocked the action of CD300a in mice with normal CD300a expression led to a reduction in brain inflammation after stroke, and that these mice even showed enhanced recovery following the blocking treatment. Our findings demonstrate the importance of efferocytosis during the super-acute phase of stroke and the impact of CD300a on the regulation of this process,  says Professor Shibuya.Because ischemic stroke may cause harmful neurological effects in the brain, strategies to reduce cellular damage and inflammation following stroke are of great importance. Blocking the action of CD300a to promote the removal of damaged cells through efferocytosis may be a potential means to reduce damage after ischemic stroke.Reference: Nakahashi-Oda C, Fujiyama S, Nakazawa Y, et al.

In the study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health, researchers were able to change the activity of this circuit and restore levels of motivation in a pre-clinical model of pain tested in rodents.On a basic level, pain includes two components   sensory (the pain you feel) and affective (the negative emotional component of pain). The presence of anhedonia, a hallmark of affective pain, is a common feature of depression, and may also increase one s vulnerability to opioid use disorder (OUD). Given this relationship, better understanding the brain circuitry involved in the affective component of pain is an important part of NIDA s research portfolio. Chronic pain is experienced on many levels beyond just the physical, and this research demonstrates the biological basis of affective pain. It is a powerful reminder that psychological phenomena such as affective pain are the result of biological processes,  said NIDA Director, Nora D. Volkow, M.D.  It is exciting to see the beginnings of a path forward that may pave the way for treatment interventions that address the motivational and emotional effects of pain. To investigate what might be underlying the affective component of pain, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis built upon prior studies(link is external) where researchers observed that rats in pain were more likely to consume higher doses of heroin than the rats that were not in pain. In addition, their motivation for natural rewards, such as sugar tablets, was decreased. The new line of investigation sought to uncover the brain circuitry involved in this pathway, to better understand the relationship between pain and related changes in one s motivational state.In this new study, the researchers measured the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, part of the brain s  reward system,  which process rewards and orchestrate motivated behavior. Dopamine neuronal activity was measured in rats while they pressed a lever with their front paw to receive a sugar tablet (the reward). To assess the impact of pain on the animals  behavior and activity of these dopamine neurons, either saline (the control condition) or a solution that produces a local inflammation (the pain condition) was injected into the hind paw.  After 48 hours, the researchers found that rats in the pain condition pressed the lever less to obtain the sugar tablet, demonstrating a decrease in motivation, and that their dopamine neurons were less active. They then discovered that the reason the dopamine neurons were less active was because pain was activating cells from a region of the brain known as the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which makes the inhibitory neurochemical GABA, and GABA blocks the activity of the dopamine neurons.However, when the researchers artificially restored the activity of dopamine neurons (through a process called chemogenetics), they were able to reverse the negative effect of pain on the reward system and reinstate the motivation to push the lever for the sugar tablet among the rats in pain, even with the painful stimuli still present.In additional experiments, the researchers were also able to restore the activity of the dopamine neurons by reversing the pain-induced hyperactivity of the GABA neurons. Doing so restored the motivation of rats that were experiencing pain to prefer a sweet solution of sucrose over water, indicating an improvement in their ability to feel pleasure, despite being in pain.To the authors  knowledge, this is the first time it has been reported that pain promotes increased activity of GABA neurons and an  inhibitory pathway  in the reward system of the brain from the RMTg, which causes decreased activity of dopamine cells. Pain has primarily been studied at peripheral sites and not in the brain, with a goal of reducing or eliminating the sensory component of pain. Meanwhile, the emotional component of pain and associated comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and lack of ability to feel pleasure that accompany pain has been largely ignored,  said study author Jose Mor n-Concepcion, Ph.D., of Washington University in St. Louis. It is fulfilling to be able to show pain patients that their mental health and behavioral changes are as real as the physical sensations, and we may be able to treat these changes someday,  added study author Meaghan Creed, Ph.D., of Washington University in St. Louis.Reference: Markovic T, Pedersen CE, Massaly N, et al.

Biologists continue to debate, however, whether these regulatory sequences of DNA play essential or detrimental roles in the body or are merely incidental, an accident that the organism can live without.A new study led by researchers at University of California, Berkeley, and Washington University explored the function of one component of this junk DNA, transposons, which are selfish DNA sequences able to invade their host genome. The study shows that at least one family of transposons   ancient viruses that have invaded our genome by the millions   plays a critical role in viability in the mouse, and perhaps in all mammals. When the researchers knocked out a specific transposon in mice, half their mouse pups died before birth.This is the first example of a piece of ""junk DNA"" being critical to survival in mammals.In mice, this transposon regulates the proliferation of cells in the early fertilized embryo and the timing of implantation in the mother s uterus. The researchers looked in seven other mammalian species, including humans, and also found virus-derived regulatory elements linked to cell proliferation and timing of embryo implantation, suggesting that ancient viral DNA has been domesticated independently to play a crucial role in early embryonic development in all mammals.According to senior author Lin He, UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology, the findings highlight an oft-ignored driver of evolution: viruses that integrate into our genome and get repurposed as regulators of host genes, opening up evolutionary options not available before.""The mouse and humans share 99% of their protein coding genes in their genomes   we are very similar with each other,"" He said. ""So, what constitutes the differences between mice and humans? One of the major differences is gene regulation   mice and humans have the same genes, but they can be regulated differently. Transposons have the capacity to generate a lot of gene regulatory diversity and could help us to understand species-specific differences in the world.""Colleague and co-senior author Ting Wang, the Sanford and Karen Loewentheil Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the Department of Genetics at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, agrees.""The real significance of this story is it tells us how evolution works in the most unexpected manner possible,"" Wang said. ""Transposons were long considered useless genetic material, but they make up such a big portion of the mammalian genome. A lot of interesting studies illustrate that transposons are a driving force of human genome evolution. Yet, this is the first example that I know of where deletion of a piece of junk DNA leads to a lethal phenotype, demonstrating that the function of specific transposons can be essential.""The finding could have implications for human infertility. According to first author Andrew Modzelewski, a UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow, nearly half of all miscarriages in humans are undiagnosed or don't have a clear genetic component. Could transposons like this be involved?""If 50% of our genome is non-coding or repetitive   this dark matter   it is very tempting to ask the question whether or not human reproduction and the causes of human infertility can be explained by junk DNA sequences,"" he said.","Published: October 19, 2021"

Managers and other decision makers no longer simply  go with their gut.  But doctors often remain reluctant to introduce such information when making medical decisions for patients.In an article published in Science, Helen Colby, an assistant professor of marketing at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business in Indianapolis, and a co-author note that it is time for many doctors to stop relying on their use of mental shortcuts, usually called decision rules or heuristics, when making decisions about patient care with limited cognitive resources.Colby, who researches health decision-making, and Meng Li, an associate professor and director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Health and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Colorado Denver, were invited to provide commentary on a paper also published in Science by Manasvini Singh, an assistant professor of health economics at the University of Massachusetts.Colby and Li s article,  Physicians  flawed heuristics in the delivery room; Complicated childbirths can influence later decision-making,  also appears in the Oct. 15 edition of the journal.Using electronic health records of more than 86,000 deliveries, Singh found that delivering physicians were influenced not just by the indications of the current patient but also by the outcome of their most recent previous delivery. For example, when a physician experienced a negative outcome with a vaginal delivery they were more likely to choose to deliver the next baby by cesarean section and vice versa. Most of the time, the heuristics do save time and resources and they produce pretty good outcomes. But in some situations, pretty good is not good enough,  Colby said.  When lives are on the line, any improvement in decision making can have life-saving consequences. Colby and Li highlight that a  win-stay-lose-shift  heuristic has been identified in other contexts as a learning strategy, but said it only works well in certain settings. In the medical context, this heuristic would be rational only if the specifics of the prior patient matched the specifics of the current patient and thus provided a useful learning experience. In that case, if one patient s delivery went wrong, it can tell the physician that the same delivery plan may not work well with another patient with very similar characteristics and indications,  they wrote.  However, two patients who happen to have consecutive deliveries by the same physician are not expected to be highly similar. They are not suggesting that physicians  use of these mental shortcuts lack expertise or training, but the research demonstrated that it a common tendency, even among more experienced doctors.Colby and Li offer several suggestions to help physicians overcome their reliance on maladaptive heuristics or decision rules.First the phenomenon needs to be acknowledged within the profession without condemning physicians. Although understanding decision biases usually does not entirely ameliorate them, teaching doctors about heuristics may promote the acceptance of potential interventions,  they wrote.  More research and clinical efforts need to focus on designing and testing decision aids that are beneficial to patients and user-friendly to physicians. In addition to making sure that the decision aid has a high degree of scientific accuracy in recommending the optimal treatment option, studies also need to examine whether physicians will accept and use such recommendations,  they added.  Physicians may have understandable concerns about recommendations from a  black box. Colby also said this is not an attempt to sound an alarm on doctors or castigate them for not always making optimal decisions. Rather, it simply highlights an important fact   like all experts, doctors are human. We patients, and often the doctors themselves, want to think of doctors and other healthcare staff as omniscient and omnipotent   a bastion of strength when we are in our time of need,  she said.  Doctors are regularly rated as the most respected profession in the United States, and a recent study found that doctors are often ascribed godlike powers. We cannot seek to assist medical decision making without first admitting the nature of the decision makers,  she added.  Helping doctors to make better decisions through reduced reliance on heuristics and decision rules should be a public health priority   It may be scary to admit that doctors are human, but it is the best thing we can do to help them, and ultimately to help them help us.

However, when you re walking along city streets, a straight line may not be possible. How do you decide which way to go?A new MIT study suggests that our brains are actually not optimized to calculate the so-called  shortest path  when navigating on foot. Based on a dataset of more than 14,000 people going about their daily lives, the MIT team found that instead, pedestrians appear to choose paths that seem to point most directly toward their destination, even if those routes end up being longer. They call this the  pointiest path. This strategy, known as vector-based navigation, has also been seen in studies of animals, from insects to primates. The MIT team suggests vector-based navigation, which requires less brainpower than actually calculating the shortest route, may have evolved to let the brain devote more power to other tasks. There appears to be a tradeoff that allows computational power in our brain to be used for other things   30,000 years ago, to avoid a lion, or now, to avoid a perilious SUV,  says Carlo Ratti, a professor of urban technologies in MIT s Department of Urban Studies and Planning and director of the Senseable City Laboratory.

But a new study from University of Wisconsin Madison researchers finds that reduced calorie intake alone is not enough; fasting is essential for mice to derive full benefit.The new findings lend support to preliminary evidence that fasting can boost health in people, as trends like intermittent fasting continue to hold sway. These human and animal studies have added to the growing picture of how health is controlled by when and what we eat, not just how much.The research further emphasizes the complexity of nutrition and metabolism and provides guidance to researchers trying to untangle the true causes of diet-induced health benefits in animals and humans.The researchers discovered that, combined with eating less, fasting reduces frailty in old age and extends the lifespan of mice. And fasting alone can improve blood sugar and liver metabolism.Surprisingly, mice that ate fewer calories but never fasted died younger than mice that ate as much as they wanted, suggesting that calorie restriction alone may be harmful.The research was led by UW  School of Medicine and Public Health metabolism researcher Dudley Lamming, his graduate student Heidi Pak and their colleagues at UW Madison and other institutions. The team published their findings Oct. 18 in Nature Metabolism.Pak and Lamming were inspired to conduct the study because researchers began to realize that previous studies had unintentionally combined calorie restrictions with long fasts by providing animals with food just once a day. It was difficult, then, to distinguish the effects of one from the other. This overlap of treatment   both reducing calories and imposing a fast   was something that everybody saw, but it wasn t always obvious that it had biological significance,  says Lamming, who has long studied the effect of restricted diets on metabolism.  It s only been in the past few years that people started getting interested in this issue. To untangle these factors, Lamming s group designed four different diets for mice to follow. One group ate as much as they wanted whenever they wanted. Another group ate a full amount, but in a short period of time   this gave them a long daily fast without reducing calories.The other two groups were given about 30% fewer calories either once a day or dispersed over the entire day. That meant that some mice had a long daily fast while others ate the same reduced-calorie diet but never fasted, which differed from most previous studies of calorie restriction.It turned out that many of the benefits originally ascribed to calorie restriction alone   better blood sugar control, healthier use of fat for energy, protection from frailty in old age and longer lifespans   all required fasting as well. Mice who ate fewer calories without fasting didn t see these positive changes.Fasting on its own, without reducing the amount of food eaten, was just as powerful as calorie restriction with fasting. Fasting alone was enough to improve insulin sensitivity and to reprogram metabolism to focus more on using fats as a source of energy. The livers of fasting mice also showed the hallmarks of healthier metabolism.The researchers did not study the effect of fasting alone on lifespan or frailty as mice aged, but other studies have suggested that fasting can provide these benefits as well.While the mice that ate fewer calories without ever fasting did show some improved blood sugar control, they also died younger. Compared with mice who both ate less and fasted, these mice that only ate less died about 8 months earlier on average. That was quite surprising,  says Lamming, although other studies have also shown some negative effects from restricting calories. The team also measured frailty through metrics like grip strength and coat condition.  In addition to their shorter lifespans, these mice were worse in certain aspects of frailty, but better in others. So, on balance their frailty didn t change much, but they didn t look as healthy. The primary studies were done in male mice, but Lamming s lab also found similar metabolic effects of fasting in female mice.The research reveals how difficult diet studies are, even in a laboratory environment. That difficulty is magnified for human studies, which simply can t match the level of control possible in animal models. The new study can provide direction to future work trying to answer whether fasting improves human health. We need to know whether this fasting is required for people to see benefits,  Lamming says.  If fasting is the main driver of health, we should be studying drugs or diet interventions that mimic fasting rather than those that mimic fewer calories. Reference: Pak HH, Haws SA, Green CL, et al.

Researchers at Radboud University (Netherlands) have studied this together with the Universities of Bonn, Saarland (Germany), Lausanne (Switzerland) and Athens (Greece). Mouse fathers who had previously overcome an infection with fungi or were stimulated with fungal compounds also passed on their improved protection to their offspring across several generations. The team showed at the same time an improved immune response being passed on to the descendants. The study has now been published in the renowned journal Nature Immunology. Not just what is written in the DNA sequence is inherited. Scientific studies show that environmental influences are also passed on to the next generation. One example: children who grew in the womb during the hunger winter of 1944/45 show typical changes in their metabolism as an adaption to food scarcity during development and this is associated with a higher risk of diabetes and obesity. Epigenetic research investigates such relationships on the molecular level. It examines changes in gene function. ""Not all areas of DNA are equally accessible for reading the genetic information,"" explains Prof. Dr. Andreas Schlitzer of the LIMES Institute at the University of Bonn. For example, if methyl groups block access, the gene cannot be read properly. These associations have been investigated for decades. Transmission of infection resistance to the next generation have been previously shown in plants and invertebrate animals. A research team from the Radboud University Nijmegen (Netherlands), the University of Bonn, Saarland University, the University of Lausanne (Switzerland) as well as the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (Greece) has now for the first time intensively investigated whether effects of the innate immune system are also passed on to the next generations in mammals. The researchers infected male mice with thrush fungi (Candida albicans). After recovering from the infection, the animals were mated with completely healthy females. The researchers compared the resulting offspring with offspring from pairs of mice that were not infected previously with Candida. In order to investigate the status of the immune system experimentally, the team infected the males of the subsequent generation of mice with coliform bacteria. ""The offspring of the male mice previously exposed to Candida were significantly better protected from a subsequent E. coli infection than the progeny of the uninfected male mice,"" reports Prof. Mihai G. Netea of the Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases. This effect was still evident in the next generation. How does this transmission of immunization to subsequent generations work? The team examined typical immune cells such as monocytes or neutrophils. No differences were detectable between the offspring of Candida-infected male mice and the non-infected control group. However, in the offspring of the previously infected mouse fathers, the MHC class II complex was upregulated, which activates parts of the immune system. In addition, the activity of genes involved in inflammation was also found to be upregulated in the offspring of Candida-infected male mice. In the offspring of fathers previously infected with thrush fungi, it was found that genes associated with inflammation were easier to read in monocyte progenitors than in sons of uninfected fathers. ""This shows that monocyte precursors are epigenetically rewired if the fathers have previously undergone infection with Candida albicans,"" Schlitzer summarizes. How does the transmission of this information to the next generation take place? In cooperation with Saarland University, the researchers investigated the gene activity of the sperm of mouse fathers infected with Candida. They analyzed the extent to which methyl groups blocked access to genes. ""A shift in gene markers was evident here,"" says Prof. Dr. J rn Walter of Saarland University. Offspring of Candida-infected male mice showed fewer gene blockages in gene regions important for inflammatory processes and monocyte maturation. How the information about the sperm markings reaches the bone marrow, the birthplace of many immune cells, still needs to be explored in further studies. ""The results have been made possible by the very good and close cooperation of researchers from different disciplines and institutions,"" emphasizes Prof. Netea. Together with Prof. Schlitzer, the researchers are also members of the Cluster of Excellence ImmunoSensation2 and part of the Life & Medical Sciences Institute (LIMES) of the University of Bonn. ""The study is the first to show in mammals that adaptations to infectious diseases are also passed on to the offspring,"" Netea says. In contrast to the classical theory of evolution, which assumes slow adaptation through changes in the genetic code, this involves very rapid changes via the epigenetic regulation of gene activities, irrespective of the genetic code. The researchers do not yet know whether the findings obtained in mice can also be transferred to humans. ""But we are assuming that this is the case,"" Schlitzer says.

Findings suggest that a variation in the protein s structure correlates with worse survival outcomes in males than females. The study was published in the September special issue  Infiltrative Gliomas: Emerging Insights into Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management  of the Cancers journal. This is a fascinating observation because glioblastoma has sex-specific differences,  said Diana Azzam, assistant professor at Stempel College, who was corresponding author of the study.  It's more frequent in males than females, and the survival outcome of males is worse than females. In the future, this can potentially help patients receive personalized treatments for the disease. Azzam worked closely with the study s lead authors Katie M. Troike, Ph.D. candidate in the Molecular Medicine Ph.D. program at Cleveland Clinic, and Arlet M. Acanda de la Rocha, a postdoctoral associate at Stempel College. I've studied TSPO for more than 20 years and knew that it was highly expressed in glioblastomas. This outstanding research team is beginning to uncover its role in one of the deadliest cancers,  said Tom s Guilarte, scientist, professor and dean of Stempel College, who was a senior author of the study.  We hope this research will lead to finding better treatments and, one day, a cure. Glioblastoma is found in adults and is 1.6 times more likely to affect males than females. Each year, approximately 12,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with glioblastoma. Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma experience symptoms like seizures, persistent headaches, or loss of brain function like memory loss and personality changes. Glioblastomas have devastating consequences for patients. The median survival time is 12 to 14 months, and less than 7% of patients survive more than five years. Thus, better treatments and strategies for improving prognosis are urgently needed as there is no cure for the disease.Researchers analyzed the blood samples of 441 glioblastoma male and female patients to evaluate the correlation between the TSPO polymorphic variant rs6971, one of the most frequent polymorphisms (variants) found in humans, with the clinical outcomes of glioblastoma patients. Compared with female glioblastoma patients, males with the TSPO variant had shorter overall and progression-free survival times. There was no association between the variant and survival time in females. The study suggests that, as a predictor of poor prognosis, the variant has potential for use as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma patients. We have been thinking about sex differences in glioblastoma in terms of immune responses and this collaborative study provides an unexpected example of a polymorphism that shows a sex difference, suggesting that there are likely others that function in a similar manner,  said Justin D. Lathia, vice chair of the Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Sciences at Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute and one of the study s senior authors.  This is an exciting new direction and will be the focus of future studies. The research team also included colleagues from the National Cancer Institute led by Jill Barnholtz-Sloan, associate director, informatics and data science, in the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology and senior investigator in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics.Azzam said this will be the first of many studies related to the use of TSPO as a prognostic biomarker. What we really need to do is understand the function of this polymorphism. Why is it associated with worse survival in male patients? Why do we see biological sex-specific differences? We have so many questions now,  she said.Reference: Troike KM, Acanda de la Rocha AM, Alban TJ, et al.

This is typically the mechanism at work during vaccination against a virus, for example. To understand the role of circadian rhythms on immune activation, the researchers looked at the migration of dendritic cells from the skin into the lymphatic system, one of the pillars of the adaptive immune response.

A study by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) scientists showed how encasing algae protein in liquid droplets can dramatically enhance the algae s light-harvesting and energy-conversion properties by up to three times. This energy is produced as the algae undergoes photosynthesis, which is the process used by plants, algae and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy. By mimicking how plants convert sunlight into energy, artificial photosynthesis may be a sustainable way of generating electricity that does not rely on fossil fuels or natural gas, which are non-renewable. As the natural energy conversion rate from sunlight to electricity is low, boosting the overall electricity produced could make artificial photosynthesis commercially viable. The study, led by Assistant Professor Chen Yu-Cheng from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, looked at a particular type of protein found in red algae. These proteins, called phycobiliproteins, are responsible for absorbing light within algae cells to kick-start photosynthesis. Phycobiliproteins harvest light energy from across the spectral range of light wavelengths, including those which chlorophylls absorb poorly, and convert it to electricity. Asst Prof Chen said:  Due to their unique light-emitting and photosynthetic properties, phycobiliproteins have promising potential applications in biotechnology and solid-state devices. Boosting the energy from the light-harvesting apparatus has been at the centre of development efforts for organic devices that use light as a power source.  The team s research may lead towards a new, sustainable way of generating electricity from sunlight that does not rely on fossil fuels or natural gas, which are non-renewable. New bio-inspired technology based on phycobiliproteins could be used to make more efficient solar cells and paves the way for greater efficiency within artificial photosynthesis. Using algae as a source of biological energy is a popular topic of interest in sustainability and renewable energy, as algae usage potentially reduces the amount of toxic by-products created in the manufacturing of solar panels. The study supports NTU s commitment to sustainability as part of its 2025 strategic plan, which seeks to understand, articulate, and address humanity s impact on the environment. The findings were published and selected as the cover of scientific journal ACS Applied Materials Interfaces.Microalgae absorb sunlight and convert it into energy. In order to amplify the amount of energy that algae can generate, the research team developed a method to encase red algae within small liquid crystal micro-droplets that are 20 to 40 microns in size and exposed them to light. When light hits the droplet, an effect known as the  whispering-gallery mode  occurs, in which light waves travel around the curved edges of the droplet. Light is effectively trapped within the droplet for a longer period of time, providing more opportunities for photosynthesis to take place and hence generating more energy. The energy generated during photosynthesis in the form of free electrons can then be captured through electrodes as an electrical current.  The droplet behaves like a resonator that confines a lot of light,  said Asst Prof Chen.  This gives the algae more exposure to light, increasing the rate of photosynthesis. A similar result can be obtained by coating the outside of the droplet with the algae protein too.   By exploiting microdroplets as a carrier for light-harvesting biomaterials, the strong local electric field enhancement and photon confinement inside the droplet resulted in significantly higher electricity generation,  he said. The droplets can be easily produced in bulk at low cost, making the research team s method widely applicable. According to Asst Prof Chen, most algae-based solar cells produce an electrical power of 20-30 microwatts per square centimetre ( W/cm2). The NTU algae-droplet combination boosted this level of energy generation by at least two to three times, compared to the energy generation rate of the algae protein alone.Artificial photosynthesis aims to replicate the natural biological process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. The goal is to establish a way of making energy renewable, reliable, and storable without impacting the environment in a negative way. One of the challenges of artificial photosynthesis is generating energy as efficiently as other solar-powered energy sources, such as solar panels. On average, solar panels have an efficiency rating of 15 to 20 per cent while artificial photosynthesis is currently estimated to be 4.5 per cent efficient. Asst Prof Chen said:  Artificial photosynthesis is not as efficient as solar cells in generating electricity. However, it is more renewable and sustainable. Due to increasing interest in environmentally-friendly and renewable technologies, extracting energy from light-harvesting proteins in algae has attracted substantial interest in the field of bio-energy.  Asst Prof Chen envisions one potential use case of  algae farms , where densely-growing algae in bodies of water could eventually be combined with larger liquid crystal droplets to create floating power generators.  The micro-droplets used in our experiments has the potential to be scaled up to larger droplets which can then be applied to algae outside of a laboratory environment to create energy. While some might consider algae growth to be unsightly, they play a very important role in the environment. Our findings show that there is a way to convert what some might view as  bio-trash  into bio-power,  said Asst Prof Chen. ReferenceYuan Z, Cheng X, Li T, et al.

Environment Programme Chief Environmental Economist Pushpam Kumar. The most disturbing finding was the increase in deaths from ambient air pollution,  said Landrigan, director of BC's global observatory.  While this increase is still modest, it threatens to increase exponentially as African cities grow in the next two to three decades and the continent develops economically. The African continent is undergoing a massive transformation, the co-authors note. Africa s population is on track to more than triple in this century, from 1.3 billion in 2020 to 4.3 billion by 2100. Cities are expanding, economies are growing, and life expectancy has almost doubled. Fossil fuel combustion has driven an increase in outdoor air pollution that in 2019 killed 29.15 people per 100,000 population, an increase from 26.13 deaths per 100,000 in 1990, according to the report.Indoor and outdoor sources combine to make air pollution the second-largest cause of death in Africa, claiming more lives than tobacco, alcohol, motor vehicle accidents, and drug abuse. Only AIDS causes more deaths. The impact in Africa is part of a global toll taken by air pollution, which killed an estimated 6.7 million people worldwide in 2017, the paper notes. Air pollution in Africa has major negative impacts on health, human capital, and the economy,  the co-authors conclude.  These impacts are growing in magnitude as countries develop. Examining the toll on the developing brains of children, the researchers calculate that air pollution exposure to infants and young children resulted in the loss of 1.96 billion IQ points across the continent.The team studied trends in air pollution in Africa to determine impacts on human health and economic development in 54 African countries. The team devoted special attention to three rapidly developing Sub-Saharan countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, and Rwanda. We focused on these three countries because they are all at somewhat different points in their economic development, and we reasoned that comparing air pollution patterns among them would give us a good indicator of future trends,  Landrigan said.Within these three countries, the upward trend in outdoor air pollution is most clearly evident in Ghana, the most economically advanced of the countries, and is beginning to be seen in Ethiopia and Rwanda, Landrigan said. Experience from other countries suggests that the increases in AAP appearing in Africa today could be the harbinger of a looming problem,  according to the report.  In the absence of visionary leadership and intentional intervention, AAP could become a much larger cause of disease and premature death than at present and could pose a major threat to economic development. In addition to the toll on human health, air pollution imposes economic costs, the study found. Economic output lost to air-pollution-related disease was $3.0 billion in Ethiopia, or 1.16 percent of the nation s gross domestic product; $1.6 billion in Ghana (0.95 percent of GDP), and $349 million in Rwanda (1.19 percent of GDP). Investment in pollution control besides climate and biodiversity has significant return than usually construed,"" said UNEP's Kumar. ""This study from three diverse countries of Africa demonstrates that managing pollution favorably impacts human capital and helps lay the foundation for sustainable recovery in the post pandemic era. The study recommends governments make air pollution prevention and control national priorities and create sustainable funding to support those priorities. Specific recommendations include: We encourage Africa's leaders to take advantage of the fact that their countries are still relatively early in their economic development and to transition rapidly to wind and solar energy, thus avoiding entrapment in fossil-fuel-based economies,  said Landrigan.  We argue that African countries are in a unique position to leapfrog over mistakes made elsewhere and to achieve prosperity without pollution. He added,  Air pollution in Africa threatens economic development and future growth, but can be avoided by wise leaders who transition rapidly to wind and solar energy and avoid entrapment by coal, gas, and oil.

But maybe not for long.In a new Cornell-led food science study, researchers now demonstrate how viticultural trash could be a nutritive treasure. The group showed that two stilbenes   beneficial molecular compounds found in plants   can affect human intestines and the stomach s microbiome in a healthy way. While this still needs further research, the finding may play a role in reducing the risks from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, according to their work published Sept. 18 in the journal Nutrients.  This byproduct of making wine has important potential,  said Elad Tako, associate professor of food science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.  If we can use the pomace to either extract key compounds or use them as a dietary ingredient to fold into food, then grape pomace can be a very sustainable source of nutritional compounds with demonstrated health benefits.  Tako said the research provides understanding on how stilbenes work at the human gut level. Additionally, in the study, the Tako research group screened red grape varieties typically found in the Finger Lakes Region of New York, where a robust winery economy exists. The team used Vitis vinifera (wine grapes), Vitis labruscana (Concord grapes) and an interspecific hybrid, to associate the findings with practical dietary health benefits of grape and grape product consumption, Tako said.  I ve been working with polyphenols (plant-based nutritional compounds), and I was intrigued by previous research that suggested that bioactive compounds   such as resveratrol in red wine   has cardiovascular and other health benefits,  Tako said.  The mechanism of how these compounds work in the body was not clear, so I used my in vivo model to find the answer.  By using a chicken (Gallus gallus) as in vivo model, the scientists were able to determine the nutritional benefits of the stilbenes, resveratrol and pterostilbene. The embryonic phase (the fertile egg) of Gallus gallus lasts for 21 days, which is when the embryo is surrounded by amniotic fluid (egg whites), naturally and orally consumed by the embryo prior to hatch on day 21. In the experiment, the stilbenes extract was injected into the eggs  amniotic fluid, consisting mostly of water and peptides, on day 17 of embryonic development. The amniotic fluid and the added nutritional solution were then consumed by the embryo by day 19 of incubation   a method developed by Tako called  intra amniotic administration.  In this way, the group learned how the resveratrol and the pterostilbene affects the gastrointestinal tract, as well as other physiological systems and tissues, Tako said. The group confirmed positive, nutritional effects on the intestinal microbiome and small intestine.ReferenceGomes MJC, Kolba N, Agarwal N, et al.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-improved-lateral-flow-assays-developed-354856,New  Improved Lateral Flow Assays Developed Georgia Tech researchers have developed improved  user friendly disposable lab tests  capable of of performing multi step assays  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Lateral flow assays   LFAs, often called  dipsticks    have been a standard point-of-care testing platform for decades, and keep growing in popularity, especially in developing countries. These disposable, paper-based diagnostic devices are affordable, widely available, have a long shelf life, and they re fast, typically delivering test results in less than 20 minutes.They re also easy to use at home. The user adds a few drops of a sample   saliva, blood, or urine, for instance   to one end of the dipstick, and within minutes reads the results at the other end.The technology has been widely used to determine the presence or absence of biomarkers in humans, as well as contaminants in water or food. Most commonly, LFA technology is used for at-home pregnancy tests. And more recently, LFA technology has been used successfully in at-home tests for Covid-19. These tests have been extremely popular for years, mainly because they are so simple to use. You don t send anything to the lab or clinic because these tests don t require any external equipment to operate. This is an advantage,  said engineering researcher Fatih Sarioglu, who runs the Biomedical Microsystems Laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  But there also is a disadvantage. There are limitations to what they can do. Recognizing the widespread popularity and practicality of dipsticks, particularly in resource-limited settings, Sarioglu and his research team are overcoming those limitations with development of a flow control technology, turning these simple tests into complex biomedical assays.They explain their research, and its emphasis on flow technology, in two recently published papers in the journals Science Advances and ACS Sensors. One explains the development of their technology and the other applies the technology in a toolkit to diagnose the novel coronavirus, as well as influenza.Controlling the FlowLFAs utilize capillary liquid flow to detect analytes   capillary flow is the process of liquid passing through a narrow passageway (like a capillary); analytes are substances or chemicals of interest, such as an antibodies or proteins, in an analytical procedure (like an LFA).Sarioglu explained that conventional LFAs are not practical for performing multi-step assays   capillary flow prevents them from coordinating a complex process that includes the application of multiple reagents in a specific sequence with specific delays in between.In the recently published studies, the team describes a technique to control capillary flow by imprinting roadblocks on a laminated paper with water insoluble ink. The blocked liquid flow is thus manipulated into a void formed at the interface of the ink-infused paper and the polymer tape laminate. By modifying the roadblocks, the researchers can essentially set the time it takes for a void to form   creating timers that hold capillary flow for a desired period. By strategically imprinting these timers, we can program the assays to coordinate different capillary flows,  said Sarioglu, professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  That enables multiple liquids to be introduced, and multistep chemical reactions, with optimal incubation times   so, we can perform complex, automated assays that otherwise would normally have to be performed in laboratories. This takes us beyond the conventional LFA. Disposable LabFor the user, the new dipstick test works the same way as the reliable standard   a sample is added at one end and the results present themselves minutes later in living color(s) at the other end. Sarioglu and his colleagues simply enhanced and expanded the process in between.Basically, they drew patterns on paper   a dipstick   and created immunoassays that rival other diagnostic tests requiring labs and extra equipment, in the effective detection of pathogenic targets like Zika virus, HIV, hepatitis B virus, or malaria, among others.The paper in ACS Sensors describes a PCR-based point-of-care toolkit based on the lab s flow technology. The assay is programmed to run a sequence of chemical reactions to detect SARS-CoV-2 (severe respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) and/or influenza A and influenza B. A traditionally labor-intensive genetic assay can now be done on a disposable platform which will enable frequent, on-demand self-testing, filling a critical need to track and contain outbreaks.The lab is studying the technology s application for other assays targeting other pathogens, with plans to publish in the coming months. Sarioglu is optimistic that the work will have implications in the current healthcare challenge with Covid-19, and beyond. We believe this flow technology research will have widespread impact,  he said.  This kind of dipstick test is so commonly used by the public for biomedical testing, and now it can be translated into other applications that we do not traditionally consider to be cut out for these simple tests.

Radiotherapies and chemotherapies have saved countless lives, but the latest arsenal, adoptive cell therapies (ACT), has stirred most excitement. In ACT, cells are processed to enhance their anti-cancer immune effects and injected into the patient. A new study by CiRA Professor Shin Kaneko and colleagues shows how iPS cell technology can produce some of the most potent anti-cancer immune cells for ACT yet.T cells are the primary cells used in ACT, as they are the immune cells in the body most capable of killing cancer. However, current strategies using T cells have several, limiting the number of patients who can benefit from ACT. The Kaneko lab is exploring iPS cell technology as a solution.""We have to process the T cells before injecting them into the patient. This processing affects the quality. If we first process the cells as iPS cells and then differentiate them into T cells, we can avoid many of these problems,"" he said.As promising as this strategy is, generating T cells from iPS cells is not trivial. Kaneko's research team has reported many studies in which iPS cells were differentiated into T cell-like cells, that is, the T cells showed behavior that suggests they are chimeras of T cells and other immune cells.""The innate immune properties may cause the cells to kill non-cancer cells in the patient or graft versus host disease,"" explained Kaneko.In order to produce bona fide T cells, iPS cells must be cultured in an assortment of cytokines, which are factors naturally secreted by immune cells.""IL-2 and IL-15 are commonly used to generate T cells, but we found they promoted innate immunity characteristics,"" explained Dr. Yohei Kawai, the first author of the study. ""To get adaptive immunity characteristics, we replaced IL-2 and IL-15 with IL-21.""IL-21 is a pleiotropic cytokine whose affects are not well understood but is secreted by helper T cells.""I was constantly searching cytokines to suppress the innate phenotype,"" added Kawai.The immune system is broken down into innate and adaptive immunity. As the names suggest, cells in the first group attack anything deemed foreign to the body, while those in the second are sensitized to specific pathogens, including cancers, and include all T cells.T cells are further divided into subsets, or phenotypes, including memory and effector types. Effector T cells are more vigilant and can be viewed as frontline protection. Memory T cells, on the other hand, are recruits in training. If needed, they can be promoted to effector T cells and move to the frontline, but memory T cells themselves are kept off the battlefield.Besides potency, another major difference between phenotypes is proliferation capacity. Memory T cells are able to multiply at much higher rates than effector T cells. Thus, somewhat counterintuitively, a therapy using memory T cells is preferred, because they can quickly mature into the effector phenotype if necessary, but they can also expand into more memory T cells while in waiting, increasing the number of cells ready for attack.Indeed, the memory T cells prepared from iPS cells showed superior anti-cancer effects in ACT than primary T cells and more proliferation capacity.""Our culture system could produce unlimited numbers of memory and effector T cells from iPS cells. This advance will help us develop iPS cell technology into powerful cancer immunotherapies,"" said Kaneko.Reference: Kawai Y, Kawana-Tachikawa A, Kitayama S, et al.

The work is published Oct. 15 in the Nature Communications. The complete dataset is publicly available at https://mouse.atlas.metabolomics.us/. This is the largest metabolome analysis available on the brain, worldwide. It covers 1,547 identified metabolites, enabling analysis of many chemical conversions for energy, neurotransmitters or complex lipids in the brain,  said Professor Oliver Fiehn, director of the West Coast Metabolomics Center at the UC Davis Genome Center and senior author on the paper.Metabolomics is the study of the chemical fingerprints of metabolism in living cells. It uses advanced high-throughput techniques to separate and identify all the different chemicals, or metabolites, present at a given time in a cell, tissue or organ. Alongside genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, these techniques allow scientists to better understand what is happening inside cells and tissues.Postdoctoral scholar Jun Ding, Fiehn and colleagues sampled mice at ages 3 weeks (adolescent), 16 weeks (early adult), 59 weeks (middle age) and 92 weeks (old age). They looked at ten separate brain regions with different functions. The new atlas can be used to better understand these different functions, Fiehn said.The results show that the brain metabolome clearly is clearly distinct between large brain regions such as the brainstem, which controls vital functions such as breathing and blood pressure, from the cerebrum, which controls movements, speech and thinking, Fiehn said. In addition, specific sections showed high concentrations of metabolites associated with particular receptors, such as adenosine, ceramides and phospholipid ethers.They did not find any significant metabolic differences between the brains male and female mice.","Published: October 18, 2021"

In this study, we observed that the greater time spent in outdoor light during the day was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, lower odds of using antidepressant medication, better sleep and fewer symptoms of insomnia,  Mr Burns said. These results may be explained by the impacts of light on the circadian system and the direct effects of light on mood centres in the brain. Associate Professor Cain said making minor adjustments to a person s daily routine could help improve their mood, sleep, and energy levels. People now spend most waking hours in intermediate, artificial lighting conditions, due to reduced sunlight exposure and relatively bright night-time light exposure,  he said. In this study, we observed that greater time spent in outdoor light was associated with better mood outcomes, better quality sleep, and ease of wakening. Insufficient exposure to daytime light could be a key factor contributing to poor mood and sleep outcomes in depressive disorders.

Life span has nearly doubled since the 1950s, but health span   the number of disease-free years   has not kept pace. According to a paper published in npj Regenerative Medicine, people are generally living longer, but the last decade of life is often racked with chronic, age-related diseases that diminish quality of life. These final years come with a great cost burden to society.Researchers contend that new solutions for increasing health span lie at the intersection of regenerative medicine research, anti-senescent investigation, clinical care and societal supports. A regenerative approach offers hope of extending the longevity of good health, so a person's final years can be lived to the fullest.""Diverse aging populations, vulnerable to chronic disease, are at the cusp of a promising future. Indeed, growing regenerative options offer opportunities to boost innate healing, and address aging-associated decline. The outlook for an extended well-being strives to achieve health for all,"" says Andre Terzic, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and the senior author. Dr. Terzic is the Marriott Family Director, Comprehensive Cardiac Regenerative Medicine for the Center for Regenerative Medicine and the Marriott Family Professor of Cardiovascular Research.Regenerative medicine is a new field of research and practice that is shifting the emphasis from fighting disease to rebuilding health. Mayo Clinic's Center for Regenerative Medicine is at the forefront of this movement, supporting research into new ways of delaying, preventing or even curing disease.Research advancing regenerative optionsResearch has increased understanding of technologies that target and remove so-called ""zombie"" cells that accumulate with age. Zombie cells, also known as senescent cells, secrete harmful proteins and chemicals that contribute to disease and failing health. When cells become senescent, they no longer divide and differentiate, and they lose their ability to repair diseased tissue.""Advances in anti-senescent and regenerative technology give hope of extending life span and living the older years disease-free,"" says Armin Garmany, first author and an M.D./Ph.D. student in the Regenerative Sciences Track in Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine.New regenerative interventions on the horizon show promise for addressing chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. For example, advances in regenerative immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy unleash the body's ability to recognize and destroy some cancers.""The clinical readiness of regenerative therapies is maturing in age-related disease,"" says Satsuki Yamada, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and co-author of the study. ""The evolving knowledge in regenerative sciences is offering tools to halt or reverse refractory disease progression, transforming the goals of disease management from care to cure.""Clinical care poised to deliver regenerative careThe rise in electronic health records and artificial intelligence provides new ways of sifting through vast datasets and pinpointing regenerative therapies matched to individual need. This could delay the onset of chronic diseases that surface later in life. Targeting regenerative procedures to a multiplicity of chronic age-related diseases could be a powerful way to close the gap between health span and life span.""The regenerative model of care is poised to advance a perspective of disease-free longevity, transforming current practice in patient care,"" says Dr. Terzic. ""Effective implementation of next-generation medical innovation will be accelerated by augmented decision-making.""Societal supports help extend a healthy lifePublic health initiatives could contribute to health longevity. For example, banning public smoking, enforcing Nutrition Facts labels and promoting vaccinations could lead to healthier lives, and delay or prevent degenerative conditions that arise later in life.In addition, addressing social determinants of heath   conditions in the environment where people live   could factor into preventing or delaying disease.""Childhood adversity, social alienation, maladaptive socioeconomic status and compromised health care access are all associated with health inequality and reduced life span,"" says Garmany. ""Addressing these issues is at the core of preventing disease.""Worldwide demographics place life expectancy at 73, but the average age of chronic disease onset is 64. That gap between health span and life spans could be closed with proper public policy initiatives and application of new regenerative and anti-senescence discoveries to clinical care. Breakthroughs that extend life expectancy could potentially be matched with more years of good health.Reference: Garmany A, Yamada S, Terzic A.

He s talking about his research on the human brain in general, and on brain fingerprints in particular. He learned that every one of us has a brain  fingerprint  and that this fingerprint constantly changes in time. His findings have just been published in Science Advances. My research examines networks and connections within the brain, and especially the links between the different areas, in order to gain greater insight into how things work,  says Amico.  We do this largely using MRI scans, which measure brain activity over a given time period.  His research group processes the scans to generate graphs, represented as colorful matrices, that summarize a subject s brain activity. This type of modeling technique is known in scientific circles as network neuroscience or brain connectomics.  All the information we need is in these graphs, that are commonly known as  functional brain connectomes . The connectome is a map of the neural network. They inform us about what subjects were doing during their MRI scan   if they were resting or performing some other tasks, for example.

They now report that the effects of the therapy appear to be long-lasting, with 90% of patients who received the treatment eight to 11 years ago still disease-free.ADA-SCID, or adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immunodeficiency, is caused by mutations in the gene that creates the ADA enzyme, which is essential to a functioning immune system. For babies with the disease, exposure to everyday germs can be fatal, and if untreated, most will die within the first two years of life.In the gene therapy approach detailed in the new paper, Dr. Donald Kohn of UCLA and his colleagues removed blood-forming stem cells from each child s bone marrow, then used a specially modified virus, originally isolated from mice, to guide healthy copies of the ADA gene into the stem cells  DNA. Finally, they transplanted the cells back into the children s bone marrow. The therapy, when successful, prompts the body to produce a continuous supply of healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections. Because the transplanted stem cells are the baby s own, there is no risk of rejection.Kohn and his team now report in the journal Blood that of the 10 children who received the one-time treatment between 2009 and 2012 as part of a phase 2 clinical trial, nine have continued to remain stable. The study follows a 2017 paper, also published in Blood, on the initial success of the treatment in those nine children. What we saw in the first few years was that this therapy worked, and now we re able to say that it not only works, but it works for more than 10 years,  said Kohn, senior author of the study and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA.  We hope someday we ll be able to say that these results last for 80 years. While not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration, gene therapy for ADA-SCID represents a potentially life-changing option for children who otherwise must undergo twice-weekly injections of the ADA enzyme   an expensive and time-consuming treatment   or find a matched bone marrow donor who can provide a transplant of healthy stem cells.","Published: October 18, 2021"

Studies by the DZNE, the LMU M nchen and the LMU Klinikum M nchen, published in the journal  Science Translational Medicine , come to this conclusion. These results are of great significance for the interpretation of brain scans depicting the distribution of glucose in the brain. Furthermore, such image-based data could potentially serve as a biomarker to non-invasively capture the response of microglia to therapeutic interventions in people with dementia.In humans, the brain is one of the organs with the highest energy consumption, which can change with age and also due to disease   e. g. as a result of Alzheimer s disease.  Energy metabolism can be recorded indirectly via the distribution of glucose in the brain. Glucose is an energy carrier. It is therefore assumed that where glucose accumulates in the brain, energy demand and consequently brain activity is particularly high,  says Dr. Matthias Brendel, deputy director of the Department of Nuclear Medicine at LMU Klinikum M nchen.The measuring technique commonly used for this purpose is a special variant of positron emission tomography (PET), known as  FDG-PET  in technical jargon. Examined individuals are administered an aqueous solution containing radioactive glucose that distributes in the brain. Radiation emitted by the sugar molecules is then measured by a scanner and visualized.  However, the spatial resolution is insufficient to determine in which cells the glucose accumulates. Ultimately, you get a mixed signal that stems not only from neurons, but also from microglia and other cell types found in the brain,  says Brendel.

They have defence mechanisms to deal with this, including chemicals or sturdier leaves. But it s now been found that when wild black mustard plants defend themselves against an initial enemy, they already anticipate the need to later fend off other, different enemies. In fact, they even prepare for the most likely sequence of attackers. This remarkable research has now been published in the renowned scientific journal Nature Plants.The article is based on doctoral research carried out by Daan Mertens and Maite Fernand z de Bobadilla, working in the team headed by Erik Poelman, associate professor in the Laboratory of Entomology at Wageningen University & Research.  We re increasingly moving towards sustainable forms of agriculture and horticulture, which includes drastically reducing the use of pesticides,  says Poelman.  For arable farmers, that means having to deal with a greater variety of insects attacking their crops. Plant breeders used to focus on resistance to the most problematic insects, while broad-spectrum pesticides were used to deal with other herbivores. Now we have to change our approach, and in doing so we can learn from wild plant species and how they deal with a diversity  a of insects.  This is a substantial shift of direction, explains Mertens.  Previously, there would be a focus on breeding plants that deal with a specific insect problem. Now, plant breeding has to create crops that are flexible in their defences and can deal with all kinds of enemies. It s about moving toward a systems approach. Plants can never be sure if or when they will be subjected to an attack. Most species resolve this uncertainty by only fully investing in defences (such as the production of defensive chemicals) when they re actually being attacked. This means that when herbivorous insects are absent, the plants can fully invest their resources (products of photosynthesis such as sugars and starch) into their own growth and reproduction.  Plants have a fairly specific sense of which insects are attacking them,  says Mertens.  They notice insect attack from the way the cells are damaged, the compounds that are then released, and the characteristics of the insects  saliva. They can  interpret those signals to mount a targeted defence.  However, the defences targeted at one insect species may not be effective against attack by other insect species. An added complication is that a plant s specific reaction to aphids, for example, can reduce its resistance to caterpillars. This is because plants have a variety of mechanisms to develop different kinds of defences. These mechanisms are triggered by plant hormones that may interact when regulating a defence response.So how can a wild plant, with insects literally swarming around it, still manage to look after itself so well?  They re prepared for the damaging insects to arrive in a specific sequence,  says Mertens.  Early in the season it might be a particular species of aphid, and later a particular species of caterpillar. They organise their defences and ensure that they can deal with these different insects over time. It seems like a conscious form of risk management, but it has emerged through natural selection. They can handle the most common sequence of events.  By means of an unusually large experiment, the researchers showed that this is indeed how the plant s strategy works. They observed the defence mechanism used by black mustard on 90 combinations of insect attack and linked these results to three years of research into the frequency of the interactions on plants in the wild. Similar tests in the past were limited to perhaps five combinations. This ambitious approach has resulted in valuable new insights.  We ve linked our understanding of plant physiology to ecology,  explains Poelman.  The old idea that insects feeding on plant sap trigger a reaction which then  diminishes a plant s potential defence against caterpillars has turned out to be too simple. Our work confirms research on the physiological reactions of the plant against aphids and caterpillars, but also reveals that in many instances the plant does not become more susceptible to insects with a different feeding pattern. The presence of a particular combination or sequence of insects in the wild appears to be a better predictor of resistance than the characteristics of the individual insect species.

For decades, California law has allowed the use of unlined ponds to dispose of water extracted during oil and gas production. California is one of the last states in the nation to allow the industry to dispose of oil and gas wastewater known as produced water into unlined ponds. Over time, this produced water percolates underground, raising the salinity of groundwater and contaminating local and regional groundwater resources. The study, published in Environmental Science and Technology, is the first to analyze the statewide impact of the current and historical use of unlined produced water ponds to dispose of produced water. By examining publicly available data, the authors found at least 1,850 active, inactive, and closed produced water ponds throughout the Tulare Basin, where 99% of the state s ponds are located. Of the 1,565 ponds in the Tulare Basin used exclusively for produced water disposal, 484 were unlined and are still being used for the disposal of produced water. In some cases, underground plumes of this contaminated water extend more than four kilometers from the ponds toward agricultural wells.  Since the early 1900s, the oil and gas industry has deposited tens of billions of barrels of highly saline, and otherwise contaminated water into unlined pits,  said PSE Healthy Energy Senior Scientist Dominic C. DiGiulio, PhD.  This practice has impacted groundwater resources necessary for present and future potential agricultural, municipal, and domestic use. Once groundwater is contaminated, it is often too expensive to remediate. The study highlights an ongoing risk to the water supply during a time of historic drought and climate risk in California. The San Joaquin Valley is home to four million people who rely on groundwater for residential use; thousands of wells are expected to run dry this year. Farms in this region rely mainly on surface water from winter and spring snowpack melt. But during droughts, farms often draw on underground water for their crops and livestock. California law does not provide a single standard for water protection. Instead, multiple standards define protected water based on different regulatory programs. In the case of produced water, the law provides a lower standard of protection than for other oil and gas industry practices, such as hydraulic fracturing. It appears that this inconsistency is a key driver for the continued use of unlined ponds.The authors recommend that California increase regulatory protections for groundwater near unlined produced water ponds. Currently, the law does not explicitly protect groundwater containing total dissolved solid levels over 3,000 mg/L when considering produced water ponds. The authors suggest increasing protections of groundwater with total dissolved solid levels up to 10,000 mg/L. This recommended increase is consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies  Safe Drinking Water Act; California s laws governing hydraulic fracturing, pursuant to Senate Bill 4; and the federal Underground Injection Control program.  It is critical to protect California s groundwater,  said DiGiulio.  Climate change and drought mean that we will need these resources to support local communities, businesses, and continued economic growth.

The scientists analysed results from 3,012 adults aged between 18-55   who had not previously taken part in exercise training   to determine how our genes can affect three important types of physical exercise.Muscle strength, cardiovascular fitness, and anaerobic power are all key factors in shaping an individual s fitness, wellbeing, and quality of life, and all participants showed improvements following their exercise training, but to varying degrees, even when performing exactly the same exercise training.By combining data from 24 separate studies, the researchers discovered that genetic differences are responsible for 72% of the variation in outcomes for people following identical exercises designed to improve muscle strength. Meanwhile, genetic variations caused 44% of the differences seen following cardiovascular fitness exercises, measured through V O2max testing, and 10% of the differences in outcomes following exercises to improve anaerobic power, which is key for movement and agility. The remaining variations are influenced by other factors such as diet and nutrition, recovery, and injuries.Each gene possesses alleles, and the allele type can influence how effective that gene is. The researchers believe it is these alleles that cause people s bodies to respond differently to the same exercises. In total, the study identified 13 genes, and associated alleles, as being responsible for how well the body reacts to cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, and anaerobic power exercises. The researchers suggest that gene testing could allow exercises to be tailored so they are more effective for each individual, rather than generic exercise for all.  This could benefit everyone from hospital patients undergoing rehabilitation to elite sportspeople. Lead author Henry Chung, a Postgraduate Researcher at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), said: We know that exercise is good for us, but we all improve at different rates, even when following identical training regimes. This means there are other factors at play. Our study found 13 genes that have a role in exercise outcomes, and we found that specific alleles contained within these genes are more suited to certain aspects of fitness.  For example, with repetition exercises designed to boost muscular strength, genetic differences explained 72% of the variation in outcomes between people following the same training.   Because everyone s genetic make-up is different, our bodies respond slightly differently to the same exercises.  Therefore, it should be possible to improve the effectiveness of an exercise regime by identifying someone s genotype and then tailoring a specific training programme just for them.  This could particularly benefit those who need to see improvements in a short period of time, such as hospital patients, or elite sportspeople, where marginal improvements could mean the difference between success and failure.

It s a bit like keeping a piggy bank or carrying a backup battery pack. One important reserve is known as cyanophycin granules, which were first noticed by an Italian scientist about 150 years ago. He saw big, dark splotches in the cells of the blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) he was studying without understanding either what they were or their purpose. Since then, scientists have realized that cyanophycin was made of a natural green biopolymer, that bacteria use it as a store of nitrogen and energy, and that it could have many biotechnological applications. They have tried producing large amounts of cyanophycin by putting the enzyme that makes it (known as cyanophycin synthetase) in everything from E. coli to tobacco, but without being able to make enough of it to be very useful.Now, by combining two cutting-edge techniques, cryo-electron microscopy (at McGill s Facility for Electron Microscopy Research) and X-ray crystallography, McGill researchers have, for the first time, been able to see the active enzyme in action.  Until now scientists have been unable to understand the way bacterial cells store nitrogen in cyanophycin, simply because they couldn t see the enzyme in action,  says Martin Schmeing, a Professor in McGill s Department of Biochemistry and the senior author on a recent paper on the subject in Nature Chemical Biology.  By stitching 3D images of the enzyme at work into a movie, we were able to see how three different structural units (or domains), came together to create cyanophycin synthetase. It s a surprising and very elegant example of a natural biomachine.  The next steps in the research involve looking at the other enzymes used in the complete biosynthesis and degradation cycle of cyanophycin. Once the researchers are able to see them in action, this would potentially give them a complete structural understanding of the processes involved and would allow them to figure out how to turbo-charge cells to make massive quantities of cyanophycin and related polymers for their green polymer biotech applications, such as in biodegradable water softeners and antiscalants or in the creation of heat-sensitive nanovesicles for use in targeted drug delivery.ReferenceSharon I, Haque AS, Grogg M, et al.

We once thought FMD was a rare disease, but the current estimate is that it may affect more than 3% of the population,  said co-senior and co-corresponding author Santhi Ganesh, M.D., an associate professor of internal medicine and human genetics, and a cardiologist at the University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center.  It s vital that we continue this research to better understand what causes FMD. The disease primarily affects women in the prime of their lives, and the diagnosis often comes after a dangerous cardiovascular complication such as severe high blood pressure, a stroke, or a heart attack. Researchers note the genes identified suggest that the genetic basis of FMD may contribute through altered vascular smooth muscle cell structure and function.Notably, the genetic findings pointed to a correlation with several more common cardiovascular diseases that are often reported in tandem with FMD, including high blood pressure, migraine headache, intracranial aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage. There was a negative correlation to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, while no shared genetics were confirmed with ischemic stroke, which also commonly affects people with FMD. The findings provide new biologic insights into this intriguing condition and genes and pathways to study further, toward the goal of identifying therapeutic targets for FMD,  said co-senior and co-corresponding author Nabila Bouatia-Naji, Ph.D., director of research at France s Institut National de la Sant  et de la Recherche M dicale, also known as INSERM and team leader at the Paris Cardiovascular Research Center.Ganesh and Bouatia-Naji s team combed through data from genome-wide association studies of more than 1,500 FMD cases, comparing them to more than 7,000 control samples from participants without FMD. The three new genes implicated for FMD are ATP2B1, LRP1 and LIMA1, while the fourth that was confirmed is known as PHACTR1. This is the most comprehensive genetic investigation of FMD to date, and was made possible through the collective efforts of our international research teams,  Ganesh noted.Reference: Georges A, Yang M-L, Berrandou T-E, et al.

Radiation dose rates led to the evacuation of over 150,000 residents from an area estimated at 444 square miles. Although people were evacuated, wildlife remained within the Fukushima Exclusion Zone, as it is sometimes called, and generations of animals have since been exposed to radiation levels above the safety threshold for human occupancy.Colorado State University and the University of Georgia launched graduate student programs in collaboration with Fukushima University s Institute of Environmental Radioactivity to conduct research on the effects of life-long radiation exposures to wildlife. Their most recent results were published online in Environment International and appears in the October issue of the journal.Between 2016 and 2018, the multi-disciplinary team studied wild boar and rat snakes across a range of radiation exposures in Fukushima. The team examined biomarkers of DNA damage and stress and did not find any significant adverse health effects. Dr. Kelly Cunningham, first author of the paper and a recent graduate of CSU s Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, said the biggest takeaway is that perhaps people do not need to be as fearful of moving back into the remediated areas   10 years after the accident   following this type of chronic, low-dose environmental radiation exposure. The wildlife study is relevant to humans because human physiology is not so dissimilar to wild boar, said co-author James Beasley, an associate professor from the University of Georgia s Savannah River Ecology Lab and Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. While mice have traditionally been used as a radiation biology model from which human effects are extrapolated, pigs   which are descendants of wild boar   are physiologically more like humans than mice and thus a more appropriate biomedical model species, he said.Hiroko Ishiniwa, a co-author and project assistant professor at Fukushima University, said the research helped respond to questions from local residents. In Fukushima, there have been many unfounded rumors about health effects related to radioactivity, she said.  With hopes of explaining the situation, many local people took part in research activities, including capturing wild boars,  she said. Thomas Hinton, a co-author on the paper and retired professor from Fukushima University, said environmental radiation decreased precipitously after the accident. By the time this research began in 2016 to 2018, cesium-134, one of the major radionuclides released from the accident, had decreased by as much as 90% because of its short half-life. Hinton received his bachelor s, master s and doctoral degrees from CSU.CSU Professor Susan Bailey, senior author on the paper, is an expert on assessing markers of stress and DNA damage due to radiation exposure. She was a principal investigator on the groundbreaking NASA Twins Study, which examined the effects of space on identical twin astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly while one of them remained on Earth during a space mission. Bailey studies telomeres, or the protective  caps  on the ends of human, as well as wildlife, chromosomes. Bailey said the telomeres of the boar and snakes could provide clues as to whether the animals were stressed from radiation exposures.  If the boar were stressed, we would see telomeres shortening,  she explained.  We didn t see any changes related to radiation dose, and we didn t see it in the snakes either.  The researchers thought that with wild boar rooting behavior and snakes living in contaminated soil they would have received large doses of radiation. Hinton said they spent a great deal of time quantifying the dosimetry   how much of the radiation was absorbed by wildlife   as precisely as possible. The researchers also found lower levels of the hormone cortisol, a primary indicator of stress, in wild boar living within the Exclusion Zone. Bailey said this finding is supported by the fact that animal populations are thriving in areas where humans have not returned.  It s similar to what they re seeing in Chernobyl,  she said.  The animals are flourishing mostly because there aren t people around, and they don t experience the related stress that brings.  Cunningham, now working as a veterinarian in New Zealand, said being able to conduct this research while pursuing a DVM degree at CSU was amazing.  It taught me about this other world of science aside from veterinary medicine,  she explained.  I had an opportunity to work with some of the leading radiation scientists from all over the world, and I could contribute with my veterinary skill set.  She said being a member of the research team also helped her develop an interest in public health and epidemiology, which she hopes to explore more as her career progresses.ReferenceCunningham K et al.

This gene contains the encoded blueprint for histone H3.3, which plays an important role in the structure of chromatin. One of these mutations is known to scientists as H3.3G34R/V   meaning the amino acid glycine that s normally found at position 34 has been replaced by either an arginine or a valine.Now an international research team led by the University of Michigan Health Rogel Cancer Center has found a small-molecule inhibitor that was able to suppress tumor growth in animal models of this glioma   offering new hope toward developing therapies for pediatric patients. Their findings appear in Science Translational Medicine. These tumors tend to occur in slightly older children than some of the more well-known types of childhood glioma   usually between the ages of 10 and 18,  said senior study author Sriram Venneti, M.D., Ph.D., the Al and Robert Glick Family Research Professor of Pediatrics in the Department of Pathology at Michigan Medicine.  And the prospects remain quite dismal due to a lack of effective treatments. Led by first author Stefan Sweha, a graduate student in neuroscience, the team investigated epigenetic changes to the tumors   that is, changes that are not permanent mutations to the DNA itself, but which affect how cells access and read DNA sequences. Ultimately, they found alterations that led to increased secretion of a protein known as LIF, for leukemia inhibitory factor. LIF, in turn, activates the STAT3 signaling pathway, which has been implicated in a number of other types of cancer.In mouse models of H3.3G34R/V glioma, a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 called WP1066 was shown to suppress tumor growth and greatly improve how long the mice survived.The drug compound has the important property of being able to cross the blood-brain barrier, which is critical for developing brain cancer treatments, and is currently being tested in clinical trials for glioblastoma in adult patients, Venneti adds. Our goal is to move the compound into clinical trials for pediatric patients,  he said.Reference: Sweha SR, Chung C, Natarajan SK, et al.

Ever since, the genes and the proteins they encode have attracted great scientific attention.Genes may be seen as a codebook for the way in which the cell s building blocks   its proteins   should be produced. If you inherit a mutation in a gene, there is an error in the codebook, leading to an error in the protein. This could potentially disrupt the function of the protein and damage the cell.Today we know that the protein BRCA2   which the gene and namesake BRCA2 is encoding   plays a key role in the repair of certain types of DNA damage in cells. And if DNA damage is not repaired, it can lead to cancer.Now, in a new study, researchers from the University of Copenhagen show that BRCA2 requires a specific enzyme, PP2A-B56, to be able to repair DNA damage. The enzyme is a so-called household enzyme, a term used for the enzymes that have many different functions in the cell.""We found that there is an interaction between BRCA2 and the enzyme which is key to the cell s ability to repair DNA damage. At the same time, we can see that mutations that impair this interaction reduce the ability to repair DNA damage. We made this discovery by studying a part of BRCA2 that no one has previously looked at,"" says Postdoc Sara Marie Ambj rn.""We have tested mutations found in cancer patients that affect the interaction between the enzyme and BRCA2, and we can see that they affect the cells' response to a substance used in chemotherapy,"" she says.The researchers hope the study may provide important information about potential cancer risk and more targeted treatment for cancer patients who have a mutation in this part of BRCA2.","Published: October 18, 2021"

However, scientists have now found that they alter according to the daily demands of our lives, allowing the heart to better accommodate and sustain increased heart rate when we re active.Important new insightsIt is already known there are daily clocks in heart cells, and other tissues that are normally synchronised by hormonal signals that align our internal daily rhythms with the day and night cycle.Daily rhythms of heart function have been known about for years and thought to be due to greater stimulation by the nervous system during the day.This new study by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory for Molecular Biology in Cambridge shows circadian rhythms within each heart cell can also affect heart rate. Explaining heart problems The team behind the study say that understanding how these changes in ion levels alter heart function over the day may help to explain why shift workers are more vulnerable to heart problems.This is because ion rhythms driven by clocks in the heart could get  out of sync  with their stimulation from clocks in the brain.This new understanding could lead to better treatments and preventative measures for combatting heart conditions.Developing our understandingWhile this study was conducted using cells and mice in the lab, its findings are supported by a recent linked study by collaborators, led by Professor David Bechtold at the University of Manchester.Their study demonstrated that circadian rhythms in heart rate and electrical activity are clearly evident in both mice and humans. Abrupt changes in behavioural routine or sleep patterns can disturb these normal heart rhythms.Taken together, these studies suggest that lifestyles that oppose our natural internal clock may cause internal circadian rhythms within heart cells to become de-coupled from our behaviours. This means that heart clocks no longer anticipate the fluctuations in demand that, for most individuals, will be higher in the daytime.Pushing effective treatmentsDr John O Neill, from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said: ""The ways in which heart function changes around the clock turn out to be more complex than previously thought. The ion gradients that contribute to heart rate vary over the daily cycle. This likely helps the heart cope with increased demands during the day, when changes in activity and cardiac output are much greater than at night, when we normally sleep. It opens up the exciting possibility of more effective treatments for cardiovascular conditions, for example by delivering drugs at the right time of day.""Dr Megan Dowie, MRC Head of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, said: ""This really interesting research supported through the MRC AstraZeneca Blue Sky Initiative shows the incredible potential for innovative academic-industry relationships to push the frontiers of discovery science. It addresses fundamental, unanswered questions about how the body works and points to exciting new possibilities for therapeutic innovations.""References: Stangherlin A, Watson JL, Wong DCS, et al.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/cellular-environments-shape-molecular-architecture-354815,Cellular Environments Shape Molecular Architecture Researchers glean a more complete picture of a structure called the nuclear pore complex by studying it directly inside cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Context matters. It s true for many facets of life, including the tiny molecular machines that perform vital functions inside our cells.Scientists often purify cellular components, such as proteins or organelles, in order to examine them individually. However, a new study published on Oct. 13 in the journal Nature suggests that this practice can drastically alter the components in question. The researchers devised a method to study a large, donut-shaped structure called the nuclear pore complex (NPC) directly inside cells. Their results revealed that the pore had larger dimensions than previously thought, emphasizing the importance of analyzing complex molecules in their native environments. We ve shown that the cellular environment has a significant impact on large structures like the NPC, which was something we weren t expecting when we started,  says Thomas Schwartz, the Boris Magasanik Professor of Biology and the study s co-senior author.  Scientists have generally thought that large molecules are stable enough to maintain their fundamental properties both inside and outside a cell, but our findings turn that assumption on its head. In eukaryotes like humans and animals, most of a cell s DNA is stored in a rounded structure called the nucleus. This organelle is shielded by the nuclear envelope, a protective barrier that separates the genetic material in the nucleus from the thick fluid filling the rest of the cell. But molecules still need a way to come in and out of the nucleus in order to facilitate important processes, including gene expression. That s where the NPC comes in. Hundreds   sometimes thousands   of these pores are embedded in the nuclear envelope, creating gateways that allow certain molecules to pass.The study s first author, former postdoc Anthony Schuller, compares NPCs to gates at a sports stadium.  If you want to access the game inside, you have to show your ticket and go through one of these gates,  he explains.The NPC may be tiny by human standards, but it s one of the largest structures in the cell. It s comprised of roughly 500 proteins, which has made its structure challenging to parse. Traditionally, scientists have broken it up into individual components to study it piecemeal using a method called X-ray crystallography. According to Schwartz, the technology required to analyze the NPC in a more natural environment has only recently become available.Together with researchers from the University of Zurich, Schuller and Schwartz employed two cutting-edge approaches to solve the pore s structure: cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).An entire cell is too thick to look at under an electron microscope. But the researchers sliced frozen colon cells into thin layers using the cryo-FIB equipment housed at MIT.nano s Center for Automated Cryogenic Electron Microscopy and the Koch Institute s Peterson (1957) Nanotechnology Materials Core Facility. In doing so, the team captured cross-sections of the cells that included NPCs, rather than simply looking at the NPCs in isolation. The amazing thing about this approach is that we ve barely manipulated the cell at all,  Schwartz says.  We haven t perturbed the cell s internal structure. That's the revolution. What the researchers saw when they looked at their microscopy images was quite different from existing descriptions of the NPC. They were surprised to find that the inner most ring structure, which forms the pore s central channel, is much wider than previously thought. When it s left in its natural environment, the pore opens up to 57 nm   resulting in a 75% increase in volume compared to previous estimates. The team was also able to take a closer look at how the NPC s various components work together to define the pore s dimensions and overall architecture. We ve shown that the cellular environment impacts NPC structure, but now we have to figure out how and why,  Schuller says. Not all proteins can be purified, he adds, so the combination of cryo-ET and cryo-FIB will also be useful for examining a variety of other cellular components.  This dual approach unlocks everything. The paper nicely illustrates how technical advances, in this case cryo-electron tomography on cryo-focused ion beam milled human cells, provide a fresh picture of cellular structures,  says Wolfram Antonin, a professor of biochemistry at RWTH Aachen University in Germany who was not involved in the study. The fact that the diameter of the NPC s central transport channel is larger than previously thought hints that the pore could have impressive structural flexibility.  That may be important for the cell to adapt to increased transport demands,  Antonin explains.Next, Schuller and Schwartz hope to understand how the size of the pore affects which molecules can pass through. For instance, scientists only recently determined that the pore was big enough to allow intact viruses like HIV into the nucleus. The same principle applies to medical treatments: only appropriately-sized drugs with specific properties will be able to access the cell s DNA.Schwartz is especially curious to know whether all NPCs are created equal, or if their structure differs between species or cell types. We ve always manipulated cells and taken the individual components out of their native context,  he says.  Now we know this method may have much bigger consequences than we thought.

The research findings also show that women with PCOS have twice the risk of developing type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes (dysglycemia)   highlighting the urgent need to find treatments to reduce this risk.In addition to the risk of type 2 diabetes, PCOS   which affects 10% of women world-wide - is also associated with a number of other conditions in the long-term, such as endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Symptoms of PCOS include irregular periods or no periods at all, which can lead to fertility issues, and many suffer from unwanted hair growth (known as  hirsutism ) on the face or body, hair loss on the scalp, and oily skin or acne. These symptoms are caused by high levels of hormones called androgens in the blood of women with PCOS.Women with PCOS also often struggle with weight gain and the cells in their body are often less responsive to insulin   the hormone that allows the body to absorb glucose (blood sugar) into the cells for energy.  This reduced response to insulin can lead to elevated blood glucose levels and can cause the body to make more insulin, which in turn causes the body to make more androgens. The androgens further increase insulin levels - driving a vicious circle.The University of Birmingham-led team of scientists carried out two studies to firstly identify the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes in women with PCOS, and secondly to investigate the impact of the use of combined oral contraceptives, often referred to as  the pill , on the risk of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes in women with PCOS.  The pill is often given to women with PCOS to improve the regularity of menstrual bleeds.  Using UK patient GP records of 64,051 women with PCOS and 123,545 matched control women without PCOS, they first carried out a large population-based cohort study to analyse the risk of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes.  They found that women with PCOS were twice at risk of type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, compared to those without PCOS.  They also identified hirsutism (excessive hair growth) - a clinical sign of high androgen levels - as a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes among women with PCOS.To investigate the impact of the pill on type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, the researchers   including experts at the RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences - then carried out a further nested case control study of 4,814 women with PCOS. The scientists found that use of combined oral contraceptives reduced the odds of developing type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes in women with PCOS by 26%.The researchers behind the study, published today in Diabetes Care, are now planning to carry out a clinical trial to further evidence their findings in the hope it will lead to changes in global healthcare policy.Co-senior author Professor Wiebke Arlt, Director of the University of Birmingham s Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said:  We knew from previous, smaller studies, that women with PCOS have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.  However, what is important about our research is that we have been able to provide new evidence from a very large population-based study to show for the very first time that we have a potential treatment option   combined oral contraceptives  to prevent this very serious health risk. Joint first author Dr Michael O Reilly, Health Research Board Emerging Clinician Scientist and Clinical Associate Professor at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, added:  We hypothesise that the pill reduces the risk of diabetes by dampening the action of androgens. How does this work? The pill contains oestrogens which increase a protein in the blood called sex hormone-binding globin (SHBG). SHBG binds androgens and, thereby, renders them inactive. Thus, if the pill is taken, SHBG increases. This decreases the amount of unbound, active androgens, lowering their impact on insulin and diabetes risk. Joint first author Anuradhaa Subramanian, also of the University of Birmingham, added:  With one in 10 women living with PCOS, which is a life-long metabolic disorder, it is incredibly important that we find ways of reducing its associated health risks. Co-senior author Krish Nirantharakumar, Professor in Health Data Science and Public Health at the University of Birmingham s Institute of Applied Health Research, added:  Importantly, our data highlight that normal weight women with PCOS were also at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. This parallels our previous finding of increased NAFLD risk in normal weight women with PCOS, further challenging the notion that PCOS-related metabolic complications are only relevant in the context of obesity. These data suggest that, rather than obesity in isolation, PCOS-specific factors, including androgen excess, underpin the increased metabolic risk. The study was supported by funding from Health Data Research UK, Wellcome Trust, the Health Research Board, and the National Institute for Health Research Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre which is based at the University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust.The research was also carried out in collaboration with the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka, and McGill University in Canada.Reference: Kumarendran B, O Reilly MW, Subramanian A, et al.

In a new study published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany show that moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity can reliably predict whether patients with social anxiety disorder will be receptive to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).Viable predictors of psychiatric treatment response are often sought, but remain elusive. Brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown promise, but low reliability has limited the utility of typical fMRI measures as harbingers of treatment success. Although historically considered a marker of  noise  in the brain, moment-to-moment brain signal variability continues to gain momentum as a sensitive and reliable indicator of individual differences in the effectiveness of neural function. However, neural variability had not yet been examined in relation to psychiatric treatment outcomes. ","Published: October 15, 2021"

The multidisciplinary research team   which includes experts in mathematics, physics, music, neuroscience and computer science   then used the fMRI data to identify how a musician s brain reconfigures connectivity depending on the degree of creativity required during jazz performances, focusing on two major brain networks: the default mode network and the executive control network. We estimated static functional network connectivity as jazz musicians were vocalizing, imagining, improvising or performing pre-learned, memorized scores,  said principal investigator Victor M. Vergara.Martin Norgaard, associate professor in the School of Music and co-author of the study, says the work provides new insight into the minds of expert jazz musicians at work. What s so fascinating is that we saw very similar brain patterns and activity whether they were actually scat singing or just imagining an improvised performance,  said Norgaard.The study builds on previous research demonstrating that subjects  brains show lower functional connectivity during musical improvisation. The new findings reveal that improvisation is associated with a state of weak connectivity to the brain s executive control network and to a feeling of  flow,  which allows unhindered musical creation. The executive control network is typically active in many tasks, including solving problems. The default mode network seems to be more active when a subject is in the resting state,  said Norgaard.   We saw that when expert musicians are improvising, the brain is interfering less with their creativity. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS), which is supported by Georgia State, the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. Vince Calhoun, founding director of TReNDS and a Distinguished University Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience, said the new study allowed researchers to observe widespread and richer effects of connectivity. It is the first analysis of whole brain connectivity during vocalized and imagined real-time production of creative output. The brain is highly dynamic, so mapping how brain function changes over time is a much more natural way to analyze the data and capture functional patterns linked to either behavioral conditions or to resting,  said Calhoun.As part of the team at TReNDS center, Vergara and his colleagues were able to extract signals from the brain using a non-invasive method to reduce any interference in the creative process. The team created a custom algorithm to identify the resting state networks. Brain imaging produces vast amounts of time-varying measurements that are difficult to parse. Pattern recognition algorithms were necessary to pinpoint the relevant brain areas involved in the creative process,  said Vergara.  We then compared the different patterns to understand the differences between performing improvisation and pre-rehearsed music. The study s paradigm allows for the inclusion of expert jazz performers with many different instrument specializations, which suggests the results may be broadly applicable to all improvising musicians. Future research could adapt the same paradigm to other activities where creation happens in real time   like in performing freestyle rap or spoken-word poetry and even playing sports   potentially identifying common threads in the creative process inside the human brain. Now there are more specific questions we can consider, like what changes are happening in the brain while someone improvises or which different networks are involved,  said Norgaard.  That s called dynamic connectivity, and that s what we re hoping to research next. Reference: Vergara VM, Norgaard M, Miller R, et al. Functional network connectivity during Jazz improvisation.

The research, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, is part of the NIMH-funded AURORA study, a large-scale, multisite study that followed more than 3,000 people for up to a year after exposure to a traumatic event.Evidence from previous studies suggests that it s common for people to show a wide range of responses after a traumatic experience, such as a natural disaster or serious accident. One person may show initial symptoms that diminish naturally over time, while another may have long-lasting symptoms that make it difficult to carry out everyday activities. These different responses do not fall neatly into existing diagnostic categories and, although there are known risk and resilience factors associated with mental health outcomes, researchers aren t yet able to predict how a specific person will fare after experiencing a traumatic event.Using a variety of neurobiological, behavioral, and self-report measures, the AURORA study researchers hope to develop a comprehensive picture of the factors that play a role in trauma survivors  mental health over time. To help advance this effort, AURORA study data will be made available to the broader research community through the NIMH Data Archive.As part of the study, Jennifer Stevens, Ph.D., of Emory University in Atlanta, led an investigation of post-trauma brain activity in an initial group of 69 AURORA participants who were seen in an emergency department following a car crash. Stevens and colleagues hypothesized that different patterns of stress-related brain activity may predict participants  long-term mental health symptoms across a range of diagnoses.Two weeks after the accident, the participants had their brain activity measured via functional MRI while they completed a series of standard computer-based tasks. The tasks assessed their brain activity in response to social threat cues, reward cues, and situations that required them to inhibit a response.Over the next six months, the participants also completed digital surveys in which they self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, dissociation, anxiety, and impulsivity.Analyses of the participants  brain activity data revealed four distinct profiles:The researchers then performed the same analyses with a separate group of 77 AURORA participants who also were seen in an emergency department following exposure to a range of traumatic events not limited to car crashes. In this group, they found evidence for three of the four profiles: reactive/disinhibited, low-reward/high-threat, and inhibited. These profiles were not correlated with other demographic, health-related, trauma-related, or site-specific characteristics.Looking at participants  brain activity profiles in relation to their mental health outcomes, Stevens and co-authors found that participants with the reactive/disinhibited profile those who showed high activity related to both threat and reward reported higher levels of symptoms of both PTSD and anxiety over the six-month follow-up period compared with the other profiles.The researchers found no association between any of the brain activity profiles and other mental health outcomes, such as symptoms of depression, dissociation, or impulsivity.The link between high reward reactivity (as part of the reactive/disinhibited profile) and long-term symptoms was unexpected, as previous studies indicated an association between low reward reactivity and post-trauma PTSD and depression. The divergent findings could be explained by the fact that reactivity to reward and threat are rarely examined together in trauma-related studies. The researchers suggest that reward reactivity warrants greater attention in future studies as a potential risk factor for stress-related symptoms following trauma.These findings are preliminary and additional research with larger samples will be needed to confirm and refine these brain-based profiles. However, these initial findings suggest that the profiles could provide meaningful information about a person s vulnerability to stress after experiencing a traumatic event. Establishing reliable, predictive profiles of stress response could improve clinical care, helping providers deliver effective interventions that are tailored to trauma survivors  individual needs and circumstances.Reference: Stevens JS, Harnett NG, Lebois LAM, et al.

You d probably want to have road atlas handy, containing maps at different scales, covering both the major highways and the roads of smaller cities and towns   or at least a GPS that can access a digital atlas with this information. Until recently, cancer researchers have been like cross-country travelers with only a few maps of a few popular cities. And because of how fast some cancers grow, the maps quickly go out of date. This situation has hindered doctors  ability to understand what s really going on inside tumors and develop effective treatments.The Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) was created to change that. It aims to develop high-resolution maps of many kinds of cancer so that doctors could have a more-complete view of the textured terrain of tumors   including how they change over time to become more deadly. HTAN is funded by the National Cancer Institute and involves a consortium of cancer centers across the United States.After several years of painstaking research, the first such atlas from investigators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center   for small cell lung cancer   is now ready for viewing, and it s full of new insights. The most exciting thing we found is a rare population of stem-like cells within these tumors that is closely correlated with patient outcomes,  explains Charles Rudin, a physician-scientist at MSK who co-led the lung cancer project.  The more enriched they are in the tumor, the worse the prognosis. Not only that, but these stem-like cells have metastatic properties   meaning they re prone to spread   and researchers found them across many SCLC tumors that otherwise were very different. That was a massive surprise,  says Dana Pe er, a computational biologist at MSK who is a principal investigator of the HTAN and co-led the lung cancer atlas project.  It raises the possibility that this tiny fraction of cells could be driving metastatic behavior across tumors. Small cell lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers. It tends to spread early and aggressively; two-thirds of cases are already metastatic at diagnosis. Chemotherapy is not very effective. The researchers hope their new atlas, which was published October 14, 2021, in the journal Cancer Cell, will lead to improvements in care for people with the disease.","Published: October 15, 2021"

Most of the energy required to perform these tasks is generated by aerobic metabolism   which explains why the brain depends on the constant supply of adequate amounts of oxygen. Animals must obtain their oxygen from the environment. On the other hand, photosynthetic organisms, such as plants, are capable of producing it themselves, using sunlight as an energy source. A research group led by LMU neurobiologist Hans Straka and LMU molecular plant scientist J rg Nickelsen has now shown that photosynthetic micro-organisms can be used to directly provide the brain with oxygen. Their findings appear in the journal iScience.The researchers introduced photosynthetic micro-organisms   unicellular green algae and cyanobacteria   into the blood vessels of tadpoles of the clawed frog Xenopus laevis, an established experimental model. After isolation, when the brains were exposed to light, measurements of oxygen levels in the ventricles of the tadpole brain revealed that substantial amounts of oxygen were indeed being produced.  Conversely, in an oxygen-poor medium, nerve-cell activity came to a complete halt in darkness,  says Straka.  When the light was turned on again, the micro-organisms generated oxygen, and the neurons restarted firing. So, the oxygen generated by photosynthesis is indeed utilized to rescue neuronal activity. According to the authors, these proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate that unicellular photosynthetic micro-organisms could serve as a novel means of boosting the supply of oxygen to tissues in a controlled fashion. They could, for example, be used to enhance oxygen levels in cell cultures, in explanted organs or in brain slices.  Furthermore, photosynthetic organisms produce not only oxygen, but also sugars, for example. So it s conceivable that their metabolic pathways could be exploited to synthesize nutrients as well,  says Straka. Since the intensity, duration and spectrum of light can be controlled with great precision, the method could also provide new approaches to the investigation of the role of oxygen in metabolic processes.Reference:  zugur S, Ch vez MN, Sanchez-Gonzalez R, Kunz L, Nickelsen J, Straka H.

Using a novel technique, researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have been able to study what happens in the brain when the central nervous system judges a smell to represent danger. The study, which is published in PNAS, indicates that negative smells associated with unpleasantness or unease are processed earlier than positive smells and trigger a physical avoidance response. The human avoidance response to unpleasant smells associated with danger has long been seen as a conscious cognitive process, but our study shows for the first time that it s unconscious and extremely rapid,  says the study s first author Behzad Iravani, researcher at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet.The olfactory organ takes up about five per cent of the human brain and enables us to distinguish between many million different smells. A large proportion of these smells are associated with a threat to our health and survival, such as that of chemicals and rotten food. Odour signals reach the brain within 100 to 150 milliseconds after being inhaled through the nose.The survival of all living organisms depends on their ability to avoid danger and seek rewards. In humans, the olfactory sense seems particularly important for detecting and reacting to potentially harmful stimuli.It has long been a mystery just which neural mechanisms are involved in the conversion of an unpleasant smell into avoidance behaviour in humans. One reason for this is the lack of non-invasive methods of measuring signals from the olfactory bulb, the first part of the rhinencephalon (literally  nose brain ) with direct (monosynaptic) connections to the important central parts of the nervous system that helps us detect and remember threatening and dangerous situations and substances.Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have now developed a method that for the first time has made it possible to measure signals from the human olfactory bulb, which processes smells and in turn can transmits signals to parts of the brain that control movement and avoidance behaviour. Their results are based on three experiments in which participants were asked to rate their experience of six different smells, some positive, some negative, while the electrophysiological activity of the olfactory bulb when responding to each of the smells was measured. It was clear that the bulb reacts specifically and rapidly to negative smells and sends a direct signal to the motor cortex within about 300 ms,  says the study s last author Johan Lundstr m, associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet.  The signal causes the person to unconsciously lean back and away from the source of the smell. He continues: The results suggest that our sense of smell is important to our ability to detect dangers in our vicinity, and much of this ability is more unconscious than our response to danger mediated by our senses of vision and hearing.

This is even more important for unicellular organisms. Yet, Carpediemonas membranifera, a unicellular organism that lives on marine shorelines, misses genes that are vital to copying and distributing its DNA. Eelco Tromer, an evolutionary cell biologist at the University of Groningen, was part of the team that described this strange creature in Nature Communications on 14 October. My expertise is finding genes that other people can t see,  says Tromer. He recently moved from the University of Cambridge to the University of Groningen, after receiving a Veni grant from the Dutch Research Council (NWO). Recently, his Canadian colleagues searched for but could not find some vital genes in the free-living protist Carpediemonas membranifera.  It lives on the seabed in intertidal sediments that are low in oxygen, where it feeds on bacteria,  explains Tromer. Some groups of single-cell protists that live in the sea have lost all or some of their mitochondria, the energy factories that need oxygen to function. Surprisingly, however, the genes that were lost in Carpediemonas were involved in DNA replication and chromosome segregation.","Published: October 15, 2021"

A new study from the University of Central Florida found that the environmental lifestyle that bacteria possess reveal why some go rogue and turn deadly while others remain harmless to humans. The findings, which published recently in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focus on Vibrio vulnificus, better known as the flesh-eating bacteria. However, what the scientists found could help create a model that may well extend to other human pathogens.  From COVID to V. vulnificus the emergence of human pathogens is one of the most concerning public health issues facing us,  says lead author Salvador Almagro-Moreno, an assistant professor of medicine at UCF.  But we know surprisingly very little about what triggers the change from harmless to deadly. We want to answer that question using aquatic pathogens such as the agent of cholera or V. vulnificus as model systems. Our study is a big step in understanding this emergence phenomenon, and will hopefully help us predict, prevent and manage future outbreaks.  V. vulnificus, a bacterium found in the marine environment, often causes necrotizing fasciitis, an infection in which the flesh around an open wound die, giving the bacterium the name  flesh-eating.  Consumption of raw oysters contaminated with this bacterium can also cause the more severe and life-threatening septicemia in patients with underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus. V. vulnificus is one of the fastest-killing human pathogens with a striking mortality rate of more than 50 percent. But not all the strains of this bacterium can kill humans and in fact, most are unable to cause harm, Almagro-Moreno says. Surprisingly, the ecological and genetic reasons behind this drastic difference have remained enigmatic for decades. For this study, Almagro-Moreno, who provides expert opinion to the Food and Drug Administration on flesh-eating bacteria, investigated populations of V. vulnificus in the Indian River Lagoon in East Central Florida because the bacterium is endemic to this region. The aim of the study was to investigate potential genomic and ecological factors that might facilitate the emergence of deadly variants of V. vulnificus. He and his team collected a variety of samples between 2018 and 2019 from two areas of the lagoon, which stretches more than 150 miles from Volusia to Palm Beach County. They investigated a wide range of factors that included variables like the bacterial communities in the environment, water pollutants, dissolved organic matter or the presence of algal blooms among others. Before sampling, the team developed a novel genetic marker that could rapidly screen the samples on a large scale to detect specifically V. vulnificus and discriminate between strains that can cause disease to humans and those that don t.  This accurate marker will aid in the detection of V. vulnificus globally, which we hope will be used by public health authorities to prevent or manage outbreaks  says Almagro-Moreno. Moreno s team found some striking associations between the likelihood of identifying deadly strains of the bacterium and some ecological factors and genomic determinants.  Our results indicate how ecosystems may be generating pressures that facilitate the emergence of specific strains with pathogenic potential within a natural population,  says Almagro-Moreno.  We now have evidence that the environment plays a most critical role in shaping the emergence of this pathogen. Nonetheless, we are pathogen hunters and there is much more research to conduct. But this is a critical starting point in solving the mystery of what are the elements/ingredients that make a pathogen?

We show that optical spectroscopy provides sensitive detection of early changes in the biomolecular composition of tumors,  said Narasimhan Rajaram, associate professor of biomedical engineering.  This is important because these changes predict response to immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, our work is the first step in determining whether Raman spectroscopy can identify treatment responders and non-responders early during the course of therapy. Immune checkpoints act as brakes on the immune system to ensure that the body s immune response is proportional to the threat level detected. Immune checkpoint inhibitors effectively remove these brakes and unleash the body s immune system against cancer cells.The study, published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, describes the use of Raman spectroscopy to determine the molecular composition of colon cancer tumors in mice treated with two types of immunotherapy drugs currently used in the clinical treatment of patients.Raman spectroscopy uses optical fibers to direct near-infrared laser light to biological tissue. The Raman signal scattered from the tissue is especially sensitive to the molecular composition of the tissue.For this study, the researchers used machine-learning approaches to train hundreds of Raman datasets acquired from colon cancer tumors treated with different immunotherapy drugs. They then tested the data from each tumor against the overall dataset to determine the difference between tumors that had received various types of immunotherapy and tumors that did not receive any therapy.The Raman technique demonstrated sensitive detection of early changes in the biomolecular composition of tumors and differentiated tumor response to different treatments. Changes picked up by the non-invasive Raman probe were consistent with changes described by detailed tissue analysis, the researchers found.Unlike other forms of cancer treatment, immunotherapy does not result in an immediate and predictable reduction in tumor size, and there are currently no accurate methods to determine treatment response in patients. Only a small group of patients benefit from immunotherapy, and there are severe side effects associated with specific combinations of immunotherapy.Rajaram partnered with Ishan Barman, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and Alan J.

We identified a major source of how mu-opioids mediate reward,  said lead author Daniel Castro, acting instructor in anesthesiology and pain medicine at UW Medicine and part of The Bruchas Lab, which examines how neural circuits affect motivated behaviors.  We provided a blueprint of how the system works. They studied a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, a key region in the reward circuit of the brain. When we do anything that is considered rewarding, dopamine neurons project to this area of the brain and make us feel good and want more. Mu-Opioids, like morphine act on specific receptors in the brain, like keys in a lock , said Michael Bruchas, UW professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine.  We isolated a new brain pathway where these receptors exert powerful effects to promote reward consumption behavior. They found that opioid receptors are in a part of the brain called the dorsal raphe nucleus located towards the back of the brain by the brain stem. They act to alter the communication between the raphe and nucleus accumbens, which are in the front of the brain. This finding was pretty unexpected,  said Castro.Bruchas said prior work had focused solely on how mu-opioid receptors alter dopamine transmission.To create a safe opioid, pharmaceutical companies would need to either bypass or create ways to bias the drug s effect away from the dorsal raphe to nucleus accumbens pathway, Castro said.The researchers focused on the opioid peptide receptor MOPR. When stimulated, MOPR alters respiration, analgesia, reward behavior, and can induce substance abuse and overdose. This is the most common opioid peptide receptor engaged by opioid pain killers and opiates which are abused. Altering its function can cause agonizing withdrawal and promotes further abuse. This is why people can become unable to abstain from using drugs like heroin or morphine.Researchers were able to make this discovery by using very modern neuroscience tools and pharmacology. The tools include in vivo calcium imaging, CRISPR Cas-9 (a technique that won the 2020 Nobel Prize), fluorescent in situ hybridization and optogenetics, an approach that has revolutionized neuroscience.The study opens many new avenues for more discovery on what other behaviors the system mediates or moderates, providing potentially new avenues for opioids or other drugs, which relieve pain.Meanwhile, the opioid epidemic has been going on for more than 20 years. The first wave began with increased prescribing of opioids in the 1990s, with overdose deaths involving prescription opioids. The second wave began in 2010, with rapid increases in overdose deaths involving heroin, and now we are in a third wave of synthetic opioids.According to the Centers for Disease Control, overdose deaths involving opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids (like fentanyl), have increased over six times since 1999. Overdoses involving opioids killed nearly 50,000 people in 2019, and nearly 73% of those deaths involved synthetic opioids. The Bruchas Lab along with their colleagues in the UW Center for the Neurobiology, of Addiction, Pain and Emotion are actively pursuing the science behind new treatments for drug abuse and mental health disorders.Reference: Castro DC, Oswell CS, Zhang ET, et al.

The study was published in GCB Bioenergy. If we can secure feedstock supply and provide suitable economic incentives along the supply chain, we could potentially produce carinata-based SAF in the southern United States,  said Dwivedi, associate professor in the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. The aviation industry emits 2.5% of all carbon dioxide emissions nationwide and is responsible for 3.5% of global warming.

Much of chemistry and the chemical industry is focused on making substances that are not found in nature with reactions invented in a laboratory.A collaboration between synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has now overcome that hurdle, engineering bacteria that can make a molecule that, until now, could only be synthesized in a laboratory.While the biosynthesis in the bacteria E. coli produced a substance of low value   and in small quantities, at that   the fact that the researchers could engineer a microbe to produce something unknown in nature opens the door to production of a broader range of chemicals from yeast and bacterial fermentation, the researchers said. It s a completely new way of doing chemical synthesis. The idea of creating an organism that makes such an unnatural product, that combines laboratory synthesis with synthetic biology within a living organism   it is just a futuristic way to make organic molecules from two separate fields of science in a way nobody s done before,  said John Hartwig, UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and one of four senior authors of the study.The findings were published online today (Oct. 14) in the journal Nature Chemistry.The achievement could greatly expand the applications of synthetic biology, which is a greener, more sustainable way to make chemicals for consumers and industry, said co-author Aindrila Mukhopadhyay, a Berkeley Lab senior scientist and vice president of the Biofuels and Bioproducts Division at the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) in Emeryville, California. There is just so much need in our lives right now for sustainable materials, materials that won t impact the environment. This technology opens up possibilities for fuels with desirable properties that can be produced renewably, as well as new antibiotics, new nutraceuticals, new compounds that would be exceedingly challenging to make using only biology or only chemistry,  she said.  I think that is the real power of this   it expands the range of molecules we can address. We really need disruptive new technologies, and this most definitely is one of them. Hybridizing metal catalysts with natural enzymesHartwig, the Henry Rapoport Chair in Organic Chemistry at UC Berkeley and a senior faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab, embeds metal catalysts in natural enzymes to make so-called artificial metalloenzymes, which can synthesize chemicals that have been hard to make by other means in the laboratory. One reaction of these systems he and his lab have worked on for the past six years is incorporating a cyclopropane   a ring of three carbon atoms   into other molecules. Such cyclopropanated chemicals are becoming increasingly useful in medicines, such as a drug to cure hepatitis C infections.He and UC Berkeley graduate student Zhennan Liu created one metalloenzyme that is a hybrid of a natural enzyme, P450   widely used in the body, particularly in the liver, to oxidize compounds   and the metal iridium. P450 naturally incorporates a cofactor called heme   also at the core of the hemoglobin molecule that transports oxygen in the blood   that naturally contains a metal atom, iron.Switching out the iron for iridium, Hartwig s lab generated a metalloenzyme that, in test tubes, successfully adds cyclopropanes   by sticking a third carbon onto a carbon-carbon double bond   to other organic molecules. The iridium-based metalloenzyme does this with stereoselectivity   that is, it generates a cyclopropanated molecule, but not its mirror image, which would behave differently in the body.They then teamed up with Berkeley Lab postdoctoral fellow Jing Huang, a synthetic biologist in the labs of Mukhopadhyay and Jay Keasling, UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, senior faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab and CEO of JBEI, to see if they could incorporate the iridium-containing heme into P450 enzymes inside living E. coli cells and give the bacteria the ability to make cyclopropanated molecules completely within the cell.Working with UC Berkeley graduate student Brandon Bloomer, they found a way to transport the heme molecule containing the iridium into E. coli, where a majority of the iridium added to the medium in which the bacteria grow became incorporated into a P450 enzyme.The synthetic biologists then balanced the metabolism of the bacteria so that they could produce the final product   a cyclopropanated limonene   in a living bacterial culture. The product is a relatively simple molecule, but this work demonstrates the potential to combine biosynthesis and chemical synthesis to make molecules that organisms have never made before, and nature s never made before,  Hartwig said.Mukhopadhyay said that incorporating other metalloenzymes into bacteria could be a game changer in terms of microbial production to make pharmaceuticals, as well as sustainable fuels. Today, many drugs are laboriously extracted from plants that are challenging to cultivate and negatively impact the environment. To be able to reliably make these compounds in a lab using biotechnology would really address a lot of these problems,  she said.This applies to making  not just medicines, but precursors to polymers, renewable plastics, biofuels, building materials, the whole gamut of things that we use today, from detergents to lubricants to paints to pigments to fabric,  she added.  Everything can be made biologically. But the challenge lies in developing sustainable renewable pathways to it. And so here, we ve taken a pretty substantial step toward it, where we have been able to demonstrate an artificial chemistry within a cell, a living growing cultured cell, which is inherently then scalable. Hartwig agrees. The bigger view is to be able to create organisms that will make unnatural products that combine nature s chemistry with laboratory chemistry,  Hartwig said.  But the laboratory chemistry would now occur inside the cell. If we could do this in a general way, we could engineer organisms to make all sorts of drugs, agrochemicals and even commodity chemicals, like monomers for polymers, that would take advantage of the efficiency and selectivity of fermentation and biocatalysis.

Neuroinflammation and cognitive problems were not detected in young adult rats that ate the processed diet. The study diet mimicked ready-to-eat human foods that are often packaged for long shelf lives, such as potato chips and other snacks, frozen entrees like pasta dishes and pizzas, and deli meats containing preservatives. Highly processed diets are also associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, suggesting older consumers might want to scale back on convenience foods and add foods rich in DHA, such as salmon, to their diets, researchers say   especially considering harm to the aged brain in this study was evident in only four weeks.  The fact we re seeing these effects so quickly is a little bit alarming,  said senior study author Ruth Barrientos, an investigator in The Ohio State University Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research and associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health.  These findings indicate that consumption of a processed diet can produce significant and abrupt memory deficits   and in the aging population, rapid memory decline has a greater likelihood of progressing into neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease. By being aware of this, maybe we can limit processed foods in our diets and increase consumption of foods that are rich in the omega-3 fatty acid DHA to either prevent or slow that progression.  The research is published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Barrientos  lab studies how everyday life events   such as surgery, an infection or, in this case, an unhealthy diet   might trigger inflammation in the aging brain, with a specific focus on the hippocampus and amygdala regions. This work builds on her previous research suggesting a short-term, high-fat diet can lead to memory loss and brain inflammation in older animals, and that DHA levels are lower in the hippocampus and amygdala of the aged rat brain. DHA, or docosahexaenoic acid, is an omega-3 fatty acid that is present along with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in fish and other seafood. Among DHA s multiple functions in the brain is a role in fending off an inflammatory response   this is the first study of its ability to act against brain inflammation brought on by a processed diet. The research team randomly assigned 3-month-old and 24-month-old male rats to their normal chow (32% calories from protein, 54% from wheat-based complex carbs and 14% from fat), a highly processed diet (19.6% of calories from protein, 63.3% from refined carbs   cornstarch, maltodextrin and sucrose   and 17.1% from fat), or the same processed diet supplemented with DHA. Activation of genes linked to a powerful pro-inflammatory protein and other markers of inflammation was significantly elevated in the hippocampus and amygdala of the older rats that ate the processed diet alone compared to young rats on any diet and aged rats that ate the DHA-supplemented processed food. The older rats on the processed diet also showed signs of memory loss in behavioral experiments that weren t evident in the young rats. They forgot having spent time in an unfamiliar space within a few days, a sign of problems with contextual memory in the hippocampus, and did not display anticipatory fear behavior to a danger cue, which suggested there were abnormalities in the amygdala.  The amygdala in humans has been implicated in memories associated with emotional   fear and anxiety-producing   events. If this region of the brain is dysfunctional, cues that predict danger may be missed and could lead to bad decisions,  Barrientos said. The results also showed that DHA supplementation of the processed-food diets consumed by the older rats effectively prevented the elevated inflammatory response in the brain as well as behavioral signs of memory loss. Researchers don t know the exact dosage of DHA   or precise calories and nutrients   taken in by the animals, which all had unlimited access to food. Both age groups gained a significant amount of weight on the processed diet, with old animals gaining significantly more than the young animals. DHA supplementation had no preventive effect on weight gain associated with eating highly processed foods. That was a key finding: Barrientos cautioned against interpreting the results as a license for consumers to feast on processed foods as long as they take a DHA supplement. A better bet to prevent multiple negative effects of highly refined foods would be focusing on overall diet improvement, she said.  These are the types of diets that are advertised as being low in fat, but they re highly processed. They have no fiber and have refined carbohydrates that are also known as low-quality carbohydrates,  she said.  Folks who are used to looking at nutritional information need to pay attention to the fiber and quality of carbohydrates. This study really shows those things are important. ReferenceButler MJ et al.

Nearly one in 10 people in high income countries show signs of CKD, which is permanent kidney damage and loss of renal function,  Dr Osborne said.Risk factors of developing CKD include age, hypertension and diabetes.Dr Osborne said CKD with no known cause was rising in low-to-middle income countries such as India, Sri Lanka and Mesoamerica. Initially, it was suspected the condition was associated with agricultural workplaces through exposure to heat stress, dehydration, pesticide spraying, heavy metals and agrochemicals,  Dr Osborne said. However, environmental contamination, pesticide residues and herbal medicines potentially containing heavy metals may also be contributing to CKD.  The cause of increased CKD remains unknown but spraying pesticides without personal protective equipment (PPE) and working with contaminated soil have been suggested as likely exposure pathways.Dr Osborne said the UQ study was the first to provide evidence linking Malathion with risk of poor kidney health in humans. The findings suggest we should limit our exposure to pesticides, even in very small doses, as chronic exposure may lead to negative health outcomes,  Dr Osborne said.

Malfunctions of proteins cause diseases across most medical specialties and organ systems, and proteins are also the most common target of drugs that exist today.The findings published today help explain why seemingly unrelated symptoms can occur at the same time in patients and suggest that we should reconsider how diverse diseases can be caused by the same underlying protein or mechanism. Where a protein is a drug target, this information can point to new strategies for treating a variety of conditions, as well as minimising adverse effects.In the study using blood samples from over 10,000 participants from the Fenland study, the team led by senior author Dr Claudia Langenberg at the MRC Epidemiology Unit and Berlin Institute of Health at Charit  Universit tsmedizin in Germany, demonstrated that natural variation in 2,500 regions of the human genome is very robustly associated with differences in abundance or function of 5,000 proteins circulating in the blood.This approach addresses an important bottleneck in the translation of basic science to clinically actionable insights. While large scale studies of the human genome have identified many thousands of variants in our DNA sequence that are associated with disease, underlying mechanisms remain often poorly understood due to uncertainties in mapping those variants to genes. By linking such disease-related DNA variations to the abundance or function of an encoded protein, the team produced strong evidence for which genes are involved, and identified novel mechanisms by which proteins mediate genetic risk into disease onset.For example, multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked a region of the human genome known as KAT8 with Alzheimer s disease but failed to identify which gene in this region was involved. By combining data on both proteins and genes the team was able to identify a gene in the KAT8 region named PRSS8, which codes for the protein prostasin, as a novel candidate gene in Alzheimer s disease. Similarly, they identified a novel risk gene for endometrial cancer (RSPO1).The authors used these new insights to systematically test which of these protein-encoding genes affected a large range of diseases. They discovered more than 1,800 examples in which more than one disease was driven by variations in an individual gene and its protein products. What emerged was a network-like structure of human diseases, because many of the genes connected a range of seemingly diverse as well as related conditions in different tissues. This provides strong evidence that the respective protein is the origin, and points to new potential strategies for treatment.Dr Langenberg explained: An extreme example we discovered of how one protein can be connected to several diseases is the protein Fibulin-3, which we connected to 37 conditions, including hypermobility, hernias, varicose veins, and a lower risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. A likely explanation is atypical formation of elastic fibres covering our organs and joints, leading to differences in elasticity of soft and connective tissues. This is also in line with features that others have observed in mice where this gene was deleted.  Dr Maik Pietzner, a researcher at the MRC Epidemiology Unit and co-lead author of the study, added: Using our genome as the basis was key to the success of this study. Because we know that most of the proteins detected in blood have their origin in cells from other tissues, we integrated different biological layers, like gene expression, to enable us to trace proteins back to disease-relevant tissues. For example, we found that higher activity of the enzyme bile salt sulfotransferase was associated with an increased risk of gall stones through a liver specific mechanism. We linked around 900 proteins to their tissue of origin in this way.  In collaboration with colleagues at the Helmholtz Centre in Munich, Germany, the authors have developed a bespoke web application (www.omicscience.org) to enable immediate dissemination of the results, and allow researchers worldwide to dive deeply into information on genes, proteins and diseases they are most interested in. Dr Eleanor Wheeler, also at the MRC Epidemiology Unit and co-lead author of the study, concluded: For most genomic regions associated with disease risk, the underlying causal gene and mechanism are not known. Our work demonstrates the distinctive value of proteins to zoom in on the causal gene for a disease and helps us to understand the mechanism through which genetic variation can cause disease. We envisage that the large amount of information we are sharing with the scientific community will help ongoing and emerging efforts to connect genes to diseases more directly via the encoded protein, thus facilitating accelerated identification of drug targets.

Not only do they lower one s risk of cancer and premature death, but new research led by Penn State College of Medicine also reveals that these superfoods may benefit a person s mental health.Penn State researchers used data on diet and mental health collected from more than 24,000 U.S. adults between 2005 and 2016. They found that people who ate mushrooms had lower odds of having depression.According to the researchers, mushrooms contain ergothioneine, an antioxidant that may protect against cell and tissue damage in the body. Studies have shown that antioxidants help prevent several mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. Mushrooms are the highest dietary source of the amino acid ergothioneine   an anti-inflammatory which cannot be synthesized by humans,  said lead researcher Djibril Ba, who recently graduated from the epidemiology doctoral program at the College of Medicine.  Having high levels of this may lower the risk of oxidative stress, which could also reduce the symptoms of depression. White button mushrooms, which are the most commonly consumed mushroom variety in the U.S., contain potassium, which is believed to lower anxiety. In addition, certain other species of edible mushrooms, especially Hericium erinaceus, also known as Lion s Mane, may stimulate the expression of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor synthesis, which could have an impact on preventing neuropsychiatric disorders including depression.  According to the researchers, college-educated, non-Hispanic white women were more likely to eat mushrooms. The average age of surveyed participants was 45, and the majority (66%) were non-Hispanic white people. The investigators observed a significant association between mushroom consumption and lower odds of depression after accounting for socio-demographics, major risk factors, self-reported diseases, medications and other dietary factors. They said, however, that there was no clear additional benefit with relatively high mushroom intake. The study adds to the growing list of possible health benefits of eating mushrooms,  said Joshua Muscat, a Penn State Cancer Institute researcher and professor of public health sciences.The team conducted a secondary analysis to see if the risk of depression could be lowered by replacing a serving of red or processed meat with a serving of mushrooms each day. However, findings show that this substitution was not associated with lower odds of depression.Prior to this research, there have been few studies to examine the association between mushroom consumption and depression, and the majority have been clinical trials with fewer than 100 participants. The researchers said this study highlights the potential clinical and public health importance of mushroom consumption as a means of reducing depression and preventing other diseases.The researchers noted some limitations that could be addressed in future studies. The data did not provide details on the types of mushrooms. As a result, the researchers could not determine the effects of specific types of mushrooms on depression. Food codes issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture were used to determine mushroom intake; therefore, some entries may have been misclassified or inaccurately recorded.Reference: Ba DM, Gao X, Al-Shaar L, et al.

At an average of 665 tests per week, the cost, just $0.43 per sample, likely remains the least expensive method to date. The research is published this week in Microbiology Spectrum, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. Our study demonstrates a significant step forward for achieving rapid test results on a large scale, while preserving supplies and reducing costs,  said study author Daniel R. Sharda, Ph.D.Using pools of ten samples, the test provides results in less than 8 hours, and is among the most sensitive available, detecting virus at very low viral load, according to the report. This approach enabled successful screening of 43,884 samples, detecting 83% of the semester s COVID-19 cases.   Future pandemics should use pooled strategies from the very beginning, when tests are otherwise limited,  said Dr. Sharda, who is associate professor and chair in the Department of Biological Sciences, Olivet Nazarene University, Bourbonnais, IL.In the study, students submitted saliva samples once or twice weekly during spring semester, 2021. Saliva samples were collected every weekday before 9am and delivered to the testing lab.  We first combined saliva in pools of 5 and 10 samples on the first RT-qPCR [reverse transcription quantitative PCR] run and then tested positive pools at the individual level in a second RT-qPCR run,  said Dr. Sharda. Positive individuals were notified to begin isolation immediately after being flagged as positive, and close contacts were told to quarantine shortly thereafter,  said Dr. Sharda.The investigators noted that saliva sampling is noninvasive, does not require a transport medium and is stable at room temperature for at least 24 hours. Self-collection by students was handled via the honor system, and fewer than 1% of samples were invalid, with 92% submitted on the assigned date.In the study, 36.2% of those tested were asymptomatic, and 48.3 % of participants reported experiencing  very mild  symptoms at the time of testing. This suggests that without the mandatory testing, 84.5% of students might not have gotten tested on their own at the time of screening, according to the report. Furthermore, only 56% developed flu-like or severe symptoms during their illness. These results raise the possibility that COVID-19 contagion would have swept the college without the testing program.The motivation for this research was  a very difficult and unpredictable fall semester in 2020, when we relied solely on testing self-reporting symptomatic individuals,  said Dr. Sharda. The large caseloads  were challenging to manage, and the college experience was very restrictive. None of us wanted to live through that again. We also recognized that our campus is an integral part of our local community, so our cases would surely spread off-campus and possibly reach more vulnerable individuals. We felt an obligation to our local community to do better,  said Dr. Sharda.  Our pooled saliva approach puts routine COVID-19 testing within reach for smaller organizations and countries where resources are limited. Reference: Vander Schaaf NA, Fund AJ, Munnich BV, et al.

Recently, some have posited that learning in the brain, or biological learning, can be thought of in terms of optimization, which is how learning occurs in artificial networks like computers or robots. A new perspectives piece co-authored by Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh researchers relates machine learning to biological learning, showing that the two approaches aren t interchangeable, yet can be harnessed to offer valuable insights into how the brain works. How we quantify the changes we see in the brain and in a subject s behavior during learning is ever-evolving,  says Byron Yu, professor of biomedical engineering and electrical and computer engineering.  It turns out that in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there is a well-developed framework in which something learns, known as optimization. We and others in the field have been thinking about how the brain learns in comparison to this framework, which was developed to train artificial agents to learn. The optimization viewpoint suggests that activity in the brain should change during learning in a mathematically prescribed way, akin to how the activity of artificial neurons changes in a specific way when they are trained to drive a robot or play chess. One thing we are interested in understanding is how the learning process unfolds over time, not just looking at a snapshot of before and after learning occurs,  explains Jay Hennig, a recent Ph.D. graduate in neural computation and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon.  In this perspectives piece, we offer three main takeaways that would be important for people to consider in the context of thinking about why neural activity might change throughout learning that cannot be readily explained in terms of optimization. The takeaways include i) the inflexibility of neural variability throughout learning, ii) the use of multiple learning processes even during simple tasks, and iii) the presence of large task-nonspecific activity changes. It s tempting to draw from successful examples of artificial learning agents and assume the brain must do whatever they do,  suggests Aaron Batista, professor of bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh.  However, one specific difference between artificial and biological learning systems is the artificial system usually does just one thing and does it really well. Activity in the brain is quite different, with many processes happening at the same time. We and others have observed that there are things happening in the brain that machine learning models cannot yet account for. Steve Chase, professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon and the Neuroscience Institute adds,  We see a theme building and a direction for the future. By drawing attention to these areas where neuroscience can inform machine learning and vice versa, we aim to connect them to the optimization view to ultimately understand, on a deeper level, how learning unfolds in the brain.

The findings were published in the October issue of the journal Pharmaceuticals.Over the past two decades, dramatic increases in opioid overdose mortality have occurred in the United States and other nations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid epidemic has only worsened. The documented effects of YHS, the extract of the plant Corydalis yanhusuo, could have an immediate, positive impact to curb the opioid epidemic. It is critical that we decrease the use and abuse of opiates,  said Olivier Civelli, Ph.D., professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the UCI School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences and corresponding author.  To help achieve this goal, we are proposing the use of this therapeutic plant. When used in animals, the Corydalis extract prevents pain and the negative effects of opiate use. The next step would be to test it with humans. The opioid epidemic was triggered by an overprescription of opioid analgesics. In the treatment of chronic pain, repeated opioid administrations are required. This ultimately leads to tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction.A possible solution consists of a co-medication that maintains the analgesic benefits of opioids while preventing their adverse liabilities. The research findings show that YHS, when co-administered with morphine, inhibits morphine tolerance, dependence and addiction. If YHS is used with morphine at the start or during pain management, there will be less need of morphine and thus less risk of addiction. Opiate tolerance is of utmost importance to opiate users,  Civelli said.  They need to constantly increase the need of opiates to reach the same analgesic response. This is what leads to opiate overdose. YHS prevents opiate tolerance, so there is less need to increase opiate consumption. YHS has been used as analgesic in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. It is considered safe and readily available for purchase, either online or as a  botanical  in certain grocery stores. Along with Civelli, the research team also included Lamees Alhassen, co-first author and a student in UCI s Ph.D. in Pharmacological Sciences program; co-first author Khawla Nuseir of the Jordan University of Science and Technology; along with Allyssa Ha, Warren Phan and Ilias Marmouzi from UCI s Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; and Shalini Shah from the Department of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Care at the UCI School of Medicine.Reference: Alhassen L, Nuseir K, Ha A, et al.

It is thought to contribute to the development of ageing itself, as well as various ageing-related diseases, including Alzheimer s disease, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers.It is known that, in lab specimens, clearing senescent cells from tissues slows age-related degeneration and prolongs lifespan. The challenge is to find a way to do this in humans.Researchers have now devised a new method for removing build-ups of these senescent cells, using antibodies as  smart bombs  designed to recognise and kill them. A so-called antibody-drug conjugate (an antibody loaded with a drug) was designed against a membrane marker of senescent cells, previously described by the authors, and was shown to be effective at specifically eliminate them.Dr Salvador Macip, Associate Professor and head of the Mechanisms of Cancer and Ageing Laboratory at the University of Leicester and corresponding author for the study, said:  Senolytics are a new class of drugs with great potential to ameliorate ageing. However, the ones we have found so far are quite unspecific and thus may have strong side effects. That is why there is much interest in a second generation of drugs, the targeted senolytics, which should eliminate senescent cells without affecting the rest. Copying an idea already in use in cancer therapies, we tweaked an antibody so it could recognise these cells and deliver a toxic cargo specifically into them. The results of this proof-of-concept study will now be used as the basis for further studies of targeted treatments of senescence, which could represent a huge improvement in the treatment of ageing ailments.Reference: Poblocka M, Bassey AL, Smith VM, et al.

The findings contradict earlier reports that indicated the hormone could alleviate the difficulties in social functioning characteristic of ASD. Oxytocin is associated with empathy and social bonding. The study was conducted by Linmarie Sikich, M.D., of Duke University, and colleagues. It appears in the New England Journal of Medicine.Funding was provided by NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.ASD is a complex neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in life and affects how a person interacts with others, communicates and learns. Many individuals with ASD have been prescribed oxytocin by their physicians. Several small studies have tested the potential of oxytocin to improve social functioning in ASD but have produced inconsistent results.For the current study, which the authors believe is the largest of its kind to date, oxytocin was given daily for 24 weeks by nasal spray to children with ASD who are minimally or fluently verbal. Participants ranged from 3 to 17 years old. Of those completing the study, 139 received oxytocin and 138 received a placebo. During the study, participants  caregivers rated them on a questionnaire measuring irritability, social withdrawal and other behaviors associated with ASD. When the participants completed the trial, the differences between the two groups  initial score and last score did not differ significantly. The researchers concluded that the 24-week course of oxytocin did not improve social interaction or other measures of social function related to ASD.Reference: Sikich L, Kolevzon A, King BH, et al.

This breakthrough made by researchers under the supervision of the Professor Charles Ramassamy provides an avenue for preventive intervention: the antioxidants intake.The research team showed that oxidative markers, known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease, show an increase up to five years before the onset of the disease. The results of this study, published in the Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring (DADM) journal, suggest that oxidation may be an early marker of this disease that affects more than 500,000 Canadians. Given that there is an increase in oxidative stress in people who develop the disease, we may regulate the antioxidant systems. For example, we could modulate the antioxidant systems, such as apolipoproteins J and D, which transport lipids and cholesterol in the blood and play an important role in brain function and Alzheimer's disease. Another avenue would be to increase the intake of antioxidants through nutrition , says Professor Ramassamy.This article has been republished from the following materials.

Findings were published today in Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences. The research team, which included College of Agriculture Sciences faculty Robyn Tanguay and Lisa Truong and graduate fellow Claudia Santillan, sought to answer important but largely neglected questions regarding the massive global sunscreen market, predicted by market data firm Statista to be worth more than $24 billion by the end of the decade. The questions: How stable, safe, and effective are sunscreen ingredients in combination rather than as individual compounds   which is how they are considered for Food and Drug Administration approval   and what about the safety of any chemical products that result from reactions caused by exposure to sunlight?  Sunscreens are important consumer products that help to reduce UV exposures and thus skin cancer, but we do not know if the use of some sunscreen formulations may have unintended toxicity because of interactions between some ingredients and UV light,  said Tanguay, an OSU distinguished professor and an international expert in toxicology. What the public thinks about sunscreen safety has caused manufacturers, often based on limited data, to use lots of some ingredients while limiting others, she said. For example, oxybenzone has effectively been discontinued because of concerns that it harms coral reefs.  And sunscreens containing inorganic compounds like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, that block UV rays, are being marketed more and more heavily as safe alternatives to the organic small-molecule compounds that absorb the rays,  Tanguay said. Scientists including the University of Oregon s James Hutchinson and Aurora Ginzburg and the University of Leeds  Richard Blackburn made five mixtures containing the UV filters   the active ingredients in sunscreens   from different products available in the United States and Europe. They also made additional mixtures with the same ingredients, plus zinc oxide at the lower end of the commercially recommended amount. The researchers then exposed the mixtures to ultraviolet radiation for two hours and used spectroscopy to check their photostability   i.e., what did sunlight do to the compounds in the mixtures and their UV-protective capabilities? The scientists also looked at whether the UV radiation had caused any of the mixtures to become toxic to zebrafish, a widely used model organism that goes from egg to swimming in five days, and found that the UV-exposed mixture without zinc oxide did not cause any significant changes in the fish.  There have been several studies that showed sunscreens can quickly react under UV exposure   the specifically intended setting for their use   so it s pretty surprising how little toxicity testing has been done on the photodegradation products,  Truong said.  Our findings suggest that commercially available small-molecule-based formulas, which were the basis for the formulas we studied, can be combined in different ingredient ratios that minimize photodegradation.  But scientists saw big differences in photostability and phototoxicity when zinc oxide particles were added   either nanoparticles or the larger microparticles.  With either size of particle, zinc oxide degraded the organic mixture and caused a greater than 80% loss in organic filter protection against ultraviolet-A rays, which make up 95% of the UV radiation that reaches the Earth,  Santillan said.  Also, the zinc-oxide-induced photodegradation products caused significant increases in defects to the zebrafish we used to test toxicity. That suggests zinc oxide particles are leading to degradants whose introduction to aquatic ecosystems is environmentally hazardous.  Tanguay said she was surprised that all five small-molecule mixtures were generally photostable but not surprised that adding zinc oxide particles led to toxicity upon UV irradiation.

The findings would surprise many consumers who are misled by  nano free  labels on mineral-based sunscreens that imply the sunscreens are safe just because they don t contain those smaller particles. Any size of metal oxide particle can have reactive surface sites, whether it is less than 100 nanometers or not.

This provides effective and personalised pain relief without the common side effects from pain relief drugs. The study, which was conducted on rats, has been published in the research journal Science Advances.The lack of a side effect-free treatment for long-term pain often considerably impairs the quality of life of the patients affected. Without analgesic treatment, the persistent pain makes it difficult for the patient to function in everyday life. Traditional pain-relieving treatment certainly reduces the pain, but at the same time affects the senses and mental function, and there is a considerable risk of developing a drug addiction. Pain also entails a considerable cost for society in the form of sick leave, healthcare costs and lost production. According to a recent American report (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6736a2.htm) about eight per cent of the American population suffer from high-impact chronic pain. In Lund, a research team led by professor of neurophysiology Jens Schouenborg developed a method to combat pain via personalised stimulation using ultra-thin, tissue-friendly microelectrodes. The electrodes are very soft and extremely gentle on the brain. They are used to specifically activate the brain s pain control centres without simultaneously activating the nerve cell circuits that produce side effects. The method involves implanting a cluster of the ultra-thin electrodes and then selecting a sub-group of the electrodes that provide pure pain relief, but no side effects. This procedure enables extremely precise and personalised stimulation treatment that was shown to work for every individual , explains Jens Schouenborg.The pain is blocked by activating the brain s pain control centres, and these in turn block only the signal transfer in the pain pathways to the cerebral cortex. We have achieved an almost total blockade of pain without affecting any other sensory system or motor skill, which is a major breakthrough in pain research. Our results show that it is actually possible to develop powerful and side effect-free pain relief, something that has been a major challenge up to now , explains Matilde Forni, doctoral student and first author of the new pain study. During the project, which has been running for several years, the researchers developed a tissue-friendly, gelatine-based technology and surgical techniques that made it possible to implant the flexible microelectrodes with very high precision. According to the researchers, the new technique should work on all sorts of pain that are conveyed by the spinal cord, i.e. most types of pain. The most common form of pain relief today is through the use of drugs. In our study we also compared our method with morphine, which was shown to deliver considerably less pain relief. In addition, of course, morphine has a powerful sedative effect as well as other cognitive effects. In the study we could also show that pain after sensitisation (hyperalgesia), which is common in chronic pain, was blocked , says Jens Schouenborg. The study in Lund was conducted on rats. Could the results be transferable to humans? That is the aim. The human brain has similar control systems to the rat s and our electrode designs can be scaled up for humans , says Matilde Forni.The researchers hope that within five to eight years the method will lead to satisfactory stimulation treatment of people with particularly severe pain, such as cancer pain or chronic pain in connection with spinal cord injuries, for which no satisfactory pain treatment is available today. The researchers also consider that the method could be used in a broader way to treat conditions besides pain. In principle, the method can be tailored to all parts of the brain, so we believe that it could also be used in the treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson s disease as well as in depression, epilepsy and probably stroke as well. The electrode technique also has applications in diagnostics and not least in research on how the mysterious brain works , says Jens Schouenborg.

Humoral immunity is an antibody-mediated response that occurs when foreign material is detected in the body. Given that the COVID-19 virus has developed substantial mutations in the spike protein this can undermine the efficacy of current vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies.The technology developed by Professor Hegner and his team can assist vaccine development studies in phase 1-3, with focus on comparing protection patterns and analysing novel vaccine candidates.The team s findings have been published in the interdisciplinary journal, Nanoscale Advances, which is a high-impact, peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry. The article can be read here.Professor Hegner said: Our measurements match the statistical analysis of, for example, the transmissibility of the alpha-variant that can otherwise only be gained by analysing the development of the disease proliferation within a population over weeks. We believe that this new technology can improve and speed up the public health guidance process. The direct technique greatly simplifies the preparation protocol that in ELISA includes many washings and waiting steps, hence reducing the amount of consumables needed and thus the relative cost. It will therefore be well suited to use in emergency situations. Reference: Brunetti G, Pastina AD, Hegner M.

These changes are associated with increased risk of preterm birth.The test could help identify women at risk of preterm birth sooner, potentially allowing obstetricians to monitor these women more closely and start preventative treatments earlier and in a more targeted way than currently possible. This is according to the researchers from the March of Dimes Prematurity Research Center at Imperial College London, who have published their work in Nature Communications.""We've known for some time that the vaginal microbiome can contribute to the risk of preterm birth, but now we have developed a device which in just a few minutes can report both the microbiome composition and inflammatory status of a sample collected during pregnancy,"" said Dr. David MacIntyre, from the Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction at Imperial College London.""This is the first rapid testing device of its kind and could be readily transferred to use in a clinical setting. This information could be used by doctors and patients to monitor risk of preterm birth but also to help optimize treatments, such as more selective use of antibiotics.""Rapid analysisThe new test rapidly analyzes chemicals in a clinical swab to determine the type of bacteria in the vagina, and any immune response to the bacteria.In the new study, researchers analyzed more than 1,000 samples from 400 pregnant women. Women with changing and diverse vaginal microbiomes (those that contained many different bacteria or different bacteria during pregnancy) had higher rates of preterm birth and were more likely to have increased inflammation.The test also detected inflammation caused by some treatments received during pregnancy (such as a stitch put into the cervix for ""cervical cerclage"" treatment). This inflammation was most frequently observed in women subsequently experiencing preterm birth.The test was also found to be just as effective as ""gold standard"" chemical profiling tests (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assays). These tests are more time-consuming (up to eight hours per assay), costly, and are difficult to introduce into routine bedside testing.Professor Phillip Bennett, from the Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction at Imperial College London said, ""An unhealthy microbiome is an important cause of preterm birth that, currently, we have no way of diagnosing or treating. The introduction of this test into research studies, and into clinical practice, should have a dramatic effect on our ability to prevent these preterm births and could have wider applications in other areas such as miscarriage and prevention of cervical cancer.""Regulatory approval neededThe researchers now plan to register the new test and seek regulatory approval for its use in the UK, Europe, and eventually, North America. They also are planning development of a miniature version of the test that can be used more widely in clinics and would allow for bedside testing.The researchers say that their test may have broader application to other areas of women's health where the vaginal microbiome has been implicated, including bacterial vaginosis, HIV and HPV infection, cervical dysplasia, IVF failure and miscarriage.Reference: Pruski P, Correia GDS, Lewis HV, et al.

There can be billions of individual parasites in a patient s bloodstream and traditional genetic sequencing techniques can t identify the raw material for evolution: new mutations. If you want to understand if the parasites are related to each other, if they are all from one mosquito or multiple mosquito bites, and what novel mutations are emerging in an infection, then you have to bring it down to the individual genome level,  says Assistant Professor Ian Cheeseman, Ph.D., and Co-lead of the Host-Pathogen Interactions Program at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. Thanks to a combination of advanced techniques, Cheeseman and his collaborators are now able to sequence the genomes of individual parasites found in the blood of infected patients. Notably, they can now do this even when the infection burden is very low, which can occur during asymptomatic infections. They describe their approach this month in the journal Cell Host & Microbe. Gaining this incredibly detailed view of malaria parasite genetics and evolution is expected to give researchers and drug companies ammunition to develop more effective treatments, vaccines or therapies. Malaria infects more than 200 million people a year, killing more than 400,000 in 2019   most of them young children. Of the five malaria parasite species that infect humans, two are the most widespread: Plasmodium falciparum, which is the deadliest; and Plasmodium vivax, which is the leading cause of recurring malaria infections because it can lie dormant in the liver and reemerge later.  We were really excited to understand how this dormant liver stage might impact genetic variation and evolution in a P. vivax infection,  says co-first paper author Aliou Dia, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in Cheeseman s lab who is now at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The challenge is that when P. vivax does emerge, it only infects very young red blood cells, so parasites are rare in the blood. Analyzing such low levels of infection is the microbiology equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack. The scientists start with red blood cells, which become slightly magnetic when infected with malaria parasites. They used a high-powered magnet to separate the infected red blood cells from uninfected cells. The infected cells were then run through a machine called a flow cytometer, which uses a laser and fluorescent tags to detect if there is indeed parasite DNA present. Cells with parasite DNA are plopped one by one into test wells and ultimately run through a genetic sequencing machine to decode each individual parasite genome. Single cell sequencing enables the scientists to precisely compare individual parasite genomes to one another to determine how related they are to each other. They can also really dig down and pinpoint single differences in the genetic code   say an A is changed to a T   to see what happened since the parasite infected that patient.  We would expect these brand-new mutations to be scattered randomly throughout the genome,  Cheeseman says.  Instead, we find they are often targeting a gene family that controls transcription in malaria.  But that s not the only notable thing about the results. What really excites Cheeseman is that when the team compared single cell sequencing data for P. vivax and P. falciparum, the same transcription gene family contained the majority of new mutations for both species.  We have two different species of malaria from two different parts of the world, Thailand and Malawi,  he says.  When we see the same thing happening independently in different species, this is an example of convergent evolution.  In other words, similar processes might be shaping similar mutation patterns in both species, even though their last common ancestor was millions of years ago. The team does not know yet what impact the mutations have on the parasite and its ability to persist and cause damage in human hosts. The mutations may be critical for survival, or something like drug resistance, or may reveal those genes are unimportant.  We don t know what these mutations are doing,  Cheeseman says.  But the fact that they are targeting what is seen to be a fairly fundamental part of the parasite lifecycle is interesting and worthy of a lot of follow up. ReferenceDia A et al.

PFAS pollution affects all communities, from the affluent to those near the fence lines of industrial facilities. More work is urgently needed to identify areas where residents might face greater health risks from contaminated water. EWG researchers analyzed potential sources of PFAS contamination in drinking water supplies nationwide, using public data from the Environmental Protection Agency s Enforcement and Compliance History Online database. The facilities that appeared most often as possible sources were solid waste landfills, wastewater treatment plants, electroplaters and metal finishers, and petroleum refiners. The analysis was published in a special issue of the American Water Works Association Water Science journal featuring the latest PFAS research. PFAS are called forever chemicals because they build up in our bodies and never break down in the environment.  It is critical that the EPA start regulating PFAS   now,  said David Andrews, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and a senior scientist at EWG.  Every community in the U.S. is likely affected by PFAS contamination, but those living near or downstream from industrial facilities may be more at risk.  Our investigation identifies a huge number of potential sources of contamination. It also provides a framework for deciding where and what to test so we can end releases into the environment,  Andrews added. In March, EWG-commissioned tests of tap water samples from throughout Northern Virginia revealed PFAS contamination at levels significantly higher than those previously reported for other parts of the Washington, D.C., metro area. Valuable case studies of data available from California and Michigan show that PFAS contamination is common at many different types of sites and that widespread testing for PFAS in wastewater is crucial.  The results from states like Michigan show there is a wide variety of sources of PFAS in surface water,  said Andrews.  Many landfills and industrial sites release PFAS at detectable concentrations that may exceed state limits or health guidelines for PFAS in water. ""It is urgent that ongoing releases of PFAS be identified. We need to stop non-essential uses of  PFAS and use filters to reduce these compounds from out water,  he said. Industrial PFAS discharges in Michigan have gone down substantially as a result of widespread testing, permitting of discharges and added treatment. In 2018, state officials set water quality standards for PFOA and PFOS, the two most notorious PFAS compounds, for discharges into drinking water supplies. State law prohibits releases from wastewater utilities of more than 420 parts per trillion, or ppt, for PFOA and 11 ppt for PFOS. Results from tests of water downstream from manufacturing facilities and from PFAS users across the U.S. revealed many previously unknown PFAS, which confirmed the need for broad testing of industrial facilities across the entire class of PFAS compounds. PFAS are among the most persistent toxic compounds in existence, contaminating everything from drinking water to food, food packaging and personal care products. They are found in the blood of virtually everyone on Earth, including newborn babies. Very low doses of PFAS chemicals in drinking water have been linked to suppression of the immune system and are associated with an elevated risk of cancer, increased cholesterol, and reproductive and developmental harms, among other serious health concerns. Reducing PFAS levels in surface water and drinking water remains a nationwide challenge. But it s one that can be met through comprehensive tests of surface water and drinking water, along with tests of wastewater from potential PFAS sources. The Biden administration also needs to use the EPA s powers to regulate as many industrial categories of PFAS discharges as possible.  We need to turn off the tap of PFAS pollution from these industrial discharges, which affects more and more Americans every day. That s the first step,  said Scott Faber, EWG s senior vice president for government affairs.  The second step is for the EPA to set a national PFAS drinking water standard. And the third is to clean up legacy pollution,  Faber added. The EPA s proposal to regulate some industrial discharges of PFAS into our drinking water falls short of what s needed to end the pollution flowing from companies. EWG s new research shows that the contamination is likely even more widespread across the U.S. than has been confirmed, further underscoring the need for swift regulatory action.ReferenceAndrews DQ, Hayes J, Stoiber T, Brewer B, Campbell C, Naidenko OV.

Milk s sleep-enhancing properties are commonly ascribed to tryptophan, but scientists have also discovered a mixture of milk peptides, called casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH), that relieves stress and enhances sleep. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry have identified specific peptides in CTH that might someday be used in new, natural sleep remedies.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one-third of U.S. adults don t get enough sleep. Sedatives, such as benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are commonly prescribed for insomnia, but they can cause side effects, and people can become addicted to them. Many sedatives work by activating the GABA receptor, a protein in the brain that suppresses nerve signaling. Scientists have also discovered several natural peptides, or small pieces of proteins, that bind the GABA receptor and have anti-anxiety and sleep-enhancing effects. For example, treating a protein in cow s milk, called casein, with the digestive enzyme trypsin produces the mixture of sleep-enhancing peptides known as CTH. Within this mixture, a specific peptide known as  -casozepine ( -CZP) has been identified that could be responsible for some of these effects. Lin Zheng, Mouming Zhao and colleagues wondered if they could find other, perhaps more powerful, sleep-enhancing peptides in CTH.The researchers first compared the effects of CTH and  -CZP in mouse sleep tests, finding that CTH showed better sleep-enhancing properties than  -CZP alone. This result suggested that other sleep-promoting peptides besides  -CZP exist in CTH. The team then used mass spectrometry to identify bioactive peptides released from CTH during simulated gastric digestion, and they virtually screened these peptides for binding to the GABA receptor and for the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. When the strongest candidates were tested in mice, the best one (called YPVEPF) increased the number of mice that fell asleep quickly by about 25% and the sleep duration by more than 400% compared to a control group. In addition to this promising peptide, others in CTH should be explored that might enhance sleep through other pathways, the researchers say.Reference: Qian J, Zheng L, Su G, Huang M, Luo D, Zhao M.

Advanced genome sequencing is allowing scientists to learn more about the evolution of diseases and more beneficial traits in humans. But limited research on disease genes focuses on evolutionary processes occurring in the last 50,000 years,  explains first author Chenlu Di, a PhD student at the Enard Lab, Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, US.  Our understanding of the relationship between disease and adaptation in the human genome has been hampered by this gap in more recent information. To fill this gap, Di and colleagues compared the rates of recent genetic adaptation in disease-linked genes and non-disease genes in 26 distinct human populations around the world that were included in the 1000 Genomes Project. They only included inherited diseases that are caused by mutations in a single gene, which are called Mendelian diseases. These have a simple pattern of inheritance in which a child may inherit a disease if they get one copy of a dominant disease-causing gene from one their parents, or if they get two copies of a recessive disease-causing gene   one from each parent. The team set out to learn whether genes that cause human Mendelian diseases have undergone more or less positive selection than non-disease-causing genes in the human genome.They found that recessive Mendelian disease-causing genes were far less likely to be swept out of a population. The patterns suggest that a process called genetic interference may have prevented these genes from adapting to changing environments.  Recessive disease-causing gene variants that prevent adaptation from occurring in the genome can dodge gene sweeps that would normally wipe them out in a population,  Di explains.The team also identified some regional variations in patterns of gene adaptation when they compared different parts of the genome of the same population. African populations had a stronger deficit of gene sweeps at disease genes compared to the rest of their genome. In East Asian and European populations, there was a weaker sweep deficit at disease genes relative to other parts of the genome. The authors say this is likely due to severe population bottlenecks that occurred in human populations that migrated out of Africa and later settled in Asia and Europe. Even a small number of people migrating would have been enough to cause the loss of a significant amount of recessive gene variants that were at low frequencies in the genome. We also see a clearer sweep deficit at disease genes in African populations because they have overall clearer genome-wide sweep signals,  says senior author David Enard, Assistant Professor at the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Department, University of Arizona.  This provides a better contrast for us to distinguish between disease genes and the rest of the genome. While the study provides some interesting new information, Enard cautions that more research is needed to confirm these results and to ensure that biases in the data they used did not skew the results. For example, he notes that many of the Mendelian diseases in the study were identified in Europe. Our work improves on previous studies trying to address this important question by using larger gene datasets and carefully controlling for confounding factors that could result in disease-causing genes and non-disease genes showing different patterns,  Enard concludes.  But there is more work to do to better understand recent genetic adaptation in humans. Reference: Di C, Murga Moreno J, Salazar-Tortosa DF, Lauterbur ME, Enard D.

The compound, called MM3122, was studied in cells and mice and holds promise as a new way to prevent infection or reduce the severity of COVID-19 if given early in the course of an infection, according to the researchers.In an interesting twist, the compound targets a key human protein called transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that coronaviruses harness to enter and infect human cells.The study is published online Oct. 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Great vaccines are now available for SARS-CoV-2, but we still need effective antiviral medications to help curb the severity of this pandemic,  said senior author James W. Janetka, PhD, a professor of biochemistry & molecular biophysics.  The compound we re developing prevents the virus from entering cells. We are examining the therapeutic window within which the molecule can be administered to mice and protect them from disease. Our ultimate goal is to advance the molecules into an inhibitor that can be taken by mouth and that could become an effective part of our armamentarium of inhibitors of COVID-19. The new drug compound potently blocks TMPRSS2 and another related protein called matriptase, which are found on the surface of the lung and other cells. Many viruses   including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza   depend on these proteins to infect cells and spread throughout the lung. After the virus latches onto a cell in the airway epithelia, the human protein TMPRSS2 cuts the virus s spike protein, activating the spike protein to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, initiating the process of infection. MM3122 is blocking the enzymatic activity of human protein TMPRSS2. When the enzyme is blocked, it perturbs the activation of the spike protein and suppresses membrane fusion. The SARS-CoV-2 virus hijacks our own lung cells  machinery to activate its spike protein, which enables it to bind to and invade lung cells,  Janetka said.  In blocking TMPRSS2, the drug prevents the virus from entering other cells within the body or from invading the lung cells in the first place if, in theory, it could be taken as a preventive. We re now testing this compound in mice in combination with other treatments that target other key parts of the virus in efforts to develop an effective broad-spectrum antiviral therapy that would be useful in COVID-19 and other viral infections. Studying cells growing in the lab that were infected with SARS-CoV-2, MM3122 protected the cells from viral damage much better than remdesivir, a treatment already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with COVID-19. An acute safety test in mice showed that large doses of the compound given for seven days did not cause any noticeable problems. The researchers also showed that the compound was as effective against the original Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The majority of inhibitors of viral infection work by blocking steps of replication once the virus is inside the cell,  said co-author Sean Whelan, PhD, the Marvin A. Brennecke Distinguished Professor and head of the Department of Molecular Microbiology.  Dr. Janetka has identified and refined a molecule that stops the virus from entering the cell in the first place. As the target of MM3122 is a host protein, this may also pose a larger barrier to the emergence of viruses that are resistant to the inhibitor. Added Janetka:  This compound is not just for COVID-19. It could potentially inhibit viral entry for other coronaviruses and even influenza virus. These viruses all rely on the same human proteins to invade lung cells. So, by blocking the human proteins, we prevent any virus that tries to hijack those proteins from entering cells. Janetka and his colleagues are now collaborating with researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to test the effectiveness of MM3122 in treating and preventing COVID-19 in animal models of the disease. In animal studies, the drug is given as an injection, but Janetka said they are working to develop an improved compound that could be taken by mouth. He also is interested in developing an intranasal route that would deliver the drug more directly to the nasal passages and lungs.Reference: Mahoney M, Damalanka VC, Tartell MA, et al.

The researchers are now calling for national health guidelines to be updated to reflect their important findings.The ANU study, published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, found participants with high blood pressure had older and therefore less healthy brains, increasing their risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia.Participants with an elevated blood pressure, but within the normal range, also had older looking brains and were at risk of health problems.  ""This thinking that one's brain becomes unhealthy because of high blood pressure later in life is not completely true,"" Professor Nicolas Cherbuin, Head of the ANU Centre for Research on Ageing, Health and Wellbeing, said. ""It starts earlier and it starts in people who have normal blood pressure.""  Normal blood pressure is defined by pressure below 120/80, whereas an optimal and healthier blood pressure is closer to 110/70.  The new research comes after a large international study found the number of people over 30 with high blood pressure has doubled globally. Cardiologist and co-author of the study, Professor Walter Abhayaratna, said if we maintain optimal blood pressure our brains will remain younger and healthier as we age.  ""It's important we introduce lifestyle and diet changes early on in life to prevent our blood pressure from rising too much, rather than waiting for it to become a problem,"" he said. ""Compared to a person with a high blood pressure of 135/85, someone with an optimal reading of 110/70 was found to have a brain age that appears more than six months younger by the time they reach middle age."" The ANU team, in collaboration with colleagues in Australia, New Zealand and Germany, examined more than 2,000 brain scans of 686 healthy individuals aged 44 to 76.  The blood pressure of the participants was measured up to four times across a 12-year period. The brain scan and blood pressure data was used to determine a person's brain age, which is a measure of brain health. Lead author, Professor Cherbuin, said the findings highlight a particular concern for young people aged in their 20s and 30s because it takes time for the effects of increased blood pressure to impact the brain.   ""By detecting the impact of increased blood pressure on the brain health of people in their 40s and older, we have to assume the effects of elevated blood pressure must build up over many years and could start in their 20s. This means that a young person's brain is already vulnerable,"" he said.  Professor Abhayaratna said the research findings show the need for everyone, including young people, to check their blood pressure regularly.  ""Australian adults should take the opportunity to check their blood pressure at least once a year when they see their GP, with an aim to ensure that their target blood pressure is closer to 110/70, particularly in younger and middle age groups,"" he said.  ""If your blood pressure levels are elevated, you should take the opportunity to speak with your GP about ways to reduce your blood pressure, including the modification of lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity.""

Now comes a deeper dive into what role these cells play.A study published Oct. 7 in the journal Neuron reports on the function of glutamatergic neurons in mice. These cells are located in the lateral hypothalamic area of the brain, a hub that regulates motivated behaviors, including feeding.The researchers found that these neurons communicate to two different brain regions: the lateral habenula, a key brain region in the pathophysiology of depression, and the ventral tegmental area, best known for the major role it plays in motivation, reward and addiction.  We found these cells are not a monolithic group, and that different flavors of these cells do different things,  said Stuber, a joint UW professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine and pharmacology. He works at the UW Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction, Pain, and Emotion, and was the paper's senior author. Mark Rossi, acting instructor of anesthesiology and pain medicine, is the lead author.The study is another step in understanding the brain circuits involved in eating disorders.The Stuber Lab studies the function of major cell groups in the brain's reward circuit, and characterizes their role in addiction and mental illness  in hopes of finding treatments. One question is whether these cells can be targeted by drugs without harming other parts of the brain.Their recent study systematically analyzed the lateral hypothalamic glutamate neurons. Researchers found that, when mice are being fed, the neurons in the lateral habenula are more responsive than those in the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that these neurons may play a greater role in guiding feeding.Researchers also looked at the influence of the hormones leptin and ghrelin on how we eat. Both leptin and ghrelin are thought to regulate behavior through their influence on the mesolimbic dopamine system, a key component of the reward pathway in the brain. But little has been known about how these hormones influence neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area of the brain. The investigators found that leptin blunts the activity of neurons that project to the lateral habenula and increases the activity of neurons that project to the ventral tegmental area. But ghrelin does the opposite.This study indicated that brain circuits that control feeding at least partially overlap with brain circuitry involved in drug addiction.The study adds to the growing body of research on the role of the brain in obesity, which the World Health Organization calls a global epidemic. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed 16 states now have obesity rates of 35% or higher. That's an increase of four states  Delaware, Iowa, Ohio and Texas  in just a year.Reference: Rossi MA, Basiri ML, Liu Y, et al.

When SIRP  binds to CD47, this triggers a signal which prevents the killing of the target cell. Most tumor cells also produce high amounts of CD47 and hence prevent being attacked by immune cells. Current tumor therapies using antibodies could block CD47 and at the same time activate immune cells. Nevertheless, serious side effects to healthy organs and blood cells limit this approach.The novel therapy concept presented here ensures that tumor cells on their own produce a CD47-blocking and immune activating protein. For this, scientists introduced a DNA gene vector into the tumor cells. DNA sequences were designed to ensure the expression of a protein with maximized CD47-blocking and immune activating properties. After successful DNA transfer, tumor cells produced and secreted the protein into the tumor vicinity.Results: CD47 was successfully blocked not only on tumors cells producing the fusion protein but also on the tumor cells in their vicinity. Tumor growth was stopped and one third of tumors were eradicated, when applying this therapy in an in vivo model of highly malignant human breast cancer. ""We observed a tumor infiltration of macrophages, which was due to the therapy. Also, other immune cells recognized and destroyed tumors cells marked with fusion protein.  We were relieved, that we did not observe any organ related toxicities"", Manfred Ogris explains. ""Next we aim at a further optimization of this approach, which should enable further preclinical studies paving the way for a potential new tumor therapy.""Reference: Billerhart M, Sch nhofer M, Schueffl H, et al.

While much work has been done to study the antibodies produced in response to these vaccines, less is known about the response by the immune system s T cells, which offer longer-term protection against the virus. Now, researchers at Gladstone Institutes have carried out a detailed survey of T cells before and after COVID-19 immunization.The team concludes, in the scientific journal eLife, that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines lead to the generation of long-term populations of T cells that can recognize multiple variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But they also identified key differences in the T cell responses of individuals who had been infected with COVID-19 prior to vaccination compared to those who had never been infected. Overall, our data support the idea that vaccines are eliciting a very robust T cell response in healthy individuals,  says Gladstone Associate Investigator Nadia Roan, PhD, senior author of the study.  But they also suggest there may be some ways to improve them further, by getting more of the vaccine-elicited T cells to park themselves in the respiratory tract. ","Published: October 13, 2021"

This antibody is one of the most powerful identified so far against SARS-CoV-2. Structural characterization of the antibody indicates that it binds to an area that is not subjected to mutations of the spike protein. Through this tight interaction, the antibody blocks the spike protein from binding to cells expressing the ACE2 receptor, which is the receptor the virus uses to enter and infect lung cells. That means the antibody halts the viral replication process, enabling a patient s immune system to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from the body. This protective mechanism was proven through in vivo tests on hamsters; specimens that were administered the antibody were protected against infection even after receiving a highly infectious dose.In addition to its antiviral properties, the new antibody is designed to have a lasting effect in humans. A typical unaltered antibody provides protection for up to 3 4 weeks. But this new one can protect patients for 4 6 months. That makes it an interesting preventive-treatment option for unvaccinated at-risk individuals or for vaccinated individuals who are unable to produce an immune response. Immunocompromised patients, organ transplant recipients and those suffering from certain kinds of cancer could be protected against SARS-CoV-2 by receiving antibody injections two or three times a year.CHUV and EPFL now plan to build on these promising results in association with a start-up company which will perform clinical development and production of the antibody-containing drug, through cooperation and intellectual property agreements. Clinical trials of the drug should begin in late 2022.","Published: October 13, 2021"

But it turns out a few animals, such as gorillas, can not only recognize familiar voices but also connect those voices to pleasant or not so pleasant memories.A new study from the University of Georgia is the first to show that gorillas are able to recognize familiar human voices based on their relationship with the speaker. The researchers found that captive gorillas responded negatively when they heard the voices of people they didn t know or with whom they d had negative interactions. Their reaction indicates that the apes likely recognized who the voices belonged to and possibly the nature of their relationship with those individuals. Although this project focused specifically on gorillas at Zoo Atlanta, the findings, published in the journal Animal Cognition, have wider implications for the captive animals  wild cousins. I worked mostly with wild gorillas, and one downside of working with wild primates is that through the habituation process we could make them much more susceptible to hunters because they become used to seeing and hearing people,  said Roberta Salmi, lead author of the study and director of the Primate Behavioral Ecology Lab in the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.

Following the successful completion and publication of the results of the second clinical trial of the biosensor, the team behind the technology won second place in the finals of the prestigious IDea Incubator Competition, which took place online on Wednesday, September 29. It is the first time in the history of the highly competitive contest that a non-USA based team is among the winners.Assays targeting antigenic moieties of the respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recognized as one of the most promising approaches to successfully identify asymptomatic carriers of the virus, especially during the first two weeks following infection and taking into consideration the fact that asymptomatic infection rates range globally between 18% to 42%. The interest in screening individuals for COVID-19 infection in point-of-care (POC) settings is concomitant with the wide vaccination against the virus.In 2020, researchers at the Agricultural University of Athens (AUA), Greece, reported the development of a bioelectric recognition assay-based biosensor able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus in just three minutes, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The working principle was established by measuring the change of the electric potential of membrane-engineered mammalian cells bearing the human chimeric spike S1 antibody after attachment of the respective viral protein. The novel system has been validated by an independent research team on 110 positive and 136 negative SARS-CoV-2 samples tested by RT-PCR. A total sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 97.8% was demonstrated. More recently, a second clinical trial was completed on patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples, with absolutely no sample pretreatment. The plug-and-apply novel biosensor was able to detect the virus in positive samples with a 92.8% success rate compared to RT-PCR. No false negative results were recorded.Following these milestones, the AUA team, in collaboration with the Pediatric Hospital of the University of Athens, entered the finals of the IDea Incubator Competition, held under the auspices of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Foundation and Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JLABS.

The resulting annual economic burden is between $40 billion and $47 billion, a value more than quadruple that of previous estimates.For decades, phthalates have been shown to pose a potential danger to human health because the chemicals can interfere with the function of hormones, which are signaling compounds made in glands that circulate to influence processes throughout the body, experts say. Exposure is believed to occur through buildup of these toxins as consumer products break down and are ingested, with exposure linked to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.Led by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the new investigation of more than 5,000 adults between the ages of 55 and 64 showed that those with the highest concentrations of phthalates in their urine were more likely to die of heart disease than those with lesser exposure.Similarly, Americans in this high-exposure group were more likely to die of any cause than those in low-exposure groups. However, high levels of the toxins did not appear to increase risk of death due to cancer. Our findings reveal that increased phthalate exposure is linked to early death, particularly due to heart disease,  says study lead author Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD, Professor of Pediatrics in the Department of Pediatrics and professor in the Departments of Environmental Medicine and Population Health.  Until now, we have understood that the chemicals connect to heart disease, and heart disease in turn is a leading cause of death, but we had not yet tied the chemicals themselves to death. Dr. Trasande cautions that the new study does not establish a direct cause and effect association between phthalate exposure and early deaths, in part because the specific biological mechanism that would account for the connection remains unclear. The study investigators say they plan to further study the role these chemicals may play in hormone regulation and inflammation in the body.However, according to Dr. Trasande, the new results add to mounting evidence of societal costs related to continued heavy exposure to the chemicals. For example, past research has linked more than 10,000 deaths a year to lowered testosterone levels in adult men attributed to phthalate exposure. These deaths cost Americans nearly $9 billion in lost economic productivity.To see if there were similar mortality and economic costs from other disorders, the new study, published online October 12, 2021, in the journal Environmental Pollution, was designed to further examine links between phthalate exposure and deaths of all causes in the United States and quantify the resulting economic costs, according to Dr. Trasande.For the investigation, the research team analyzed data including phthalates found in urine samples obtained from adults who participated in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Survey from 2001 to 2010. The researchers limited their analysis to those whose cause of death had been tracked through 2015. In addition, they focused on a subgroup of Americans between 55 and 64, since previous studies had based estimates of phthalate-driven death in this population. This way, the team could accurately compare their study results to the prior estimates.The study investigators also used data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database, the U.S. Census Bureau, and models from earlier studies to estimate the economic cost of early death for this group. Our research suggests that the toll of this chemical on society is much greater than we first thought,  says Dr. Trasande, who also serves as director of NYU Langone s Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.  The evidence is undeniably clear that limiting exposure to toxic phthalates can help safeguard Americans  physical and financial wellbeing. Reference: Trasande L, Liu B, Bao W.

This raises the question: If this keeps up, in the future will year-round sea ice and the creatures who need it to survive persist anywhere?A new study addresses this question, and the results are daunting. The study targets a 1 million-square kilometer region north of Greenland and the coasts of the Canadian Archipelago, where year-round sea ice has traditionally been thickest, and thus likely to be most resilient. It says that under both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, by 2050 summer ice in this region will dramatically thin. Under the optimistic scenario, if carbon emissions can be brought to heel by then, some summer ice could persist indefinitely. However, under the pessimistic scenario, in which emissions continue on their current path, summer ice would disappear by 2100, along with creatures such as seals and polar bears. The study appears in the journal Earth s Future.  Unfortunately, this is a massive experiment we re doing,  said study coauthor Robert Newton, a senior research scientist at Columbia University s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.  If the year-round ice goes away, entire ice-dependent ecosystems will collapse, and something new will begin.  Scientists have been pondering the fate of Arctic sea ice for decades. Around 2009, researchers including Newton s coauthors Stephanie Pfirman and L. Bruno Tremblay first coalesced around the idea of what they have called the Last Ice Area the region where summer ice will likely make a last stand. In winter, most of the Arctic Ocean surface freezes, and probably will for the foreseeable future, even as climate warms. Ice can grow up to a meter thick each winter, and if it survives one or more summers, it can reach several meters. In summer, some melting usually occurs, and scattered open-water areas appear. This helps winds and currents carry floating ice great distances in various gyres, including the overarching Transpolar Drift, which carries ice clockwise from off Siberia toward Greenland and Canada. Each year, some ice is expelled into the North Atlantic via straits between Greenland and Norway. But much of it gets driven against the Arctic s farthest-north coasts, along Greenland and the Canadian islands. Here, repeated inflows of ice can build layers and pressure ridges as high as 10 meters. Much of it will remain for 10 years or more before eventually breaking off and moving back off. The result is a rich marine ecosystem. Along the edges and bottoms of multiyear ice, photosynthetic diatoms bloom and build up thick mats over time. These feed tiny animals living in and near the ice, who feed fish, who feed seals, who feed polar bears. Among other things, the thick, irregular topography provides ample hiding places for seal lairs, and ice caves for polar bears to winter over and raise their young. It also provides safe haven from humans, who can barely navigate here, even with icebreakers. Historically, most of the ice that ends up in the Last Ice Area has come from the continental shelves off Siberia via the Transpolar drift. Siberian ice also mixes with ice formed in the central Arctic Ocean, which also may travel into the Last Ice Area. But the ocean is now forming progressively thinner ice, which is melting faster in summer s increasingly open waters. As this trend progresses, the researchers say, this will starve the Last Ice Area in the next few decades. Some ice will continue to drift in from the central Arctic, and some will form locally, but neither will be enough to maintain current conditions. By mid-century, under the researchers  low-emissions scenario, even ice from the central Arctic will wane, and thick, multiyear ice will become a thing of the past; locally formed summer ice will persist in the Last Ice Area, but only a meter thick. The good news: at least some seals, bears and other creatures may survive, as they currently do under similar summer conditions along western Alaska and parts of Hudson Bay. The bad news: under the higher-emissions scenario, by 2100, even the locally formed ice will give up the ghost in summer. There will be no more summer ice anywhere, and no ice-dependent ecosystems.  This is not to say it will be a barren, lifeless environment,  said Newton.  New things will emerge, but it may take some time for new creatures to invade.  Fish, diatoms or other biota may come up from the North Atlantic, but it is not clear if they could survive there year round; it may be getting warmer, but the planet s rotation around the sun will not change, and any new occupants including photosynthetic organisms would have to deal with the long, sunless Arctic winter. The researchers look on the bright side. Newton says that if the world can make enough progress toward curbing carbon in the atmosphere during the 21st century, the region could hang on long enough for temperatures to start going down again, and the Last Ice Area might start to regrow. One hopeful sign: in 2019 Canada established the 320,000-square kilometer Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area in the Inuit territory of Nunavut, spanning the middle third of the Last Ice Area. This protects against mining, transport and other development for five years while Canada considers permanent protection. The rest of the region lies within Canada s mining-friendly Northwest Territories, which so far has resisted declaring protection, and off Greenland, which has so far been noncommittal. In any case, if the last ice area is to be preserved, say the researchers, it will require the formation of other marine protected areas across the Arctic. This, because the Arctic Ocean and its coasts are home to many billions of dollars in oil reserves and mineral deposits such as nickel and copper. As summer waters open up, there will be increasing pressure to dig, drill and open up transport corridors, and this might well export pollution, not ice, to the last ice area. Already the Russian oil company Rosneft has leases on some areas that traditionally have fed ice to the Last Ice Area.  Spilled oil and industrial or agricultural contaminants have been identified as potential hazards,  the researchers write.ReferenceNewton R, Pfirman S, Tremblay LB, DeRepentigny P.

Now an international team, including investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), has developed a resource to help uncover the impact of these genetic variants.The work, which is described in Cell Reports, relies on the knolwedge that abnormalities in groups of pancreatic cells called islets, which produce and release hormones that regulate blood sugar levels, drive the development of type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, however, it s very difficult to obtain samples of human islets. To overcome this challenge, scientists from Spain, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Finland, the UK, and the US banded together to obtain more than 500 human islet samples from patients with and without type 2 diabetes and to extract genomic and gene expression data from these samples. With these data, the researchers created what they named TIGER (for Translational human pancreatic Islet Genotype tissue-Expression Resource).The research required collecting and examining an enormous amount of information, which was made possible through the use of supercomputing resources and new statistical methods.Analyses of TIGER revealed that certain genetic variants in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes control the expression of particular genes. So far, 32 novel genes were identified that may contribute to type 2 diabetes risk. This resource will be very useful to identify genes that may be related with the genetic variants that we have found associated with type 2 diabetes,  says co senior author Josep M. Mercader, PhD, a research-scientist at MGH s Diabetes Unit and Center for Genomic Medicine.  Knowing the gene behind a given genetic association is the first step for identifying potential drug targets, or to better understand the physiology of different types of diabetes. TIGER s data are publicly available and easily accessible to the diabetes research community through the TIGER web portal (tiger.bsc.es). We are proud that we are now able to share this wealth of data to the scientific community in an easily accessible way for all researchers in the type 2 diabetes field, without the need of computational or bioinformatic expertise,  says co lead author Lorena Alonso, of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, in Spain, one of the developers of the TIGER portal.Reference: Alonso L, Piron A, Mora n A et al.

Elahi and his team looked at how anemia   a condition in which a person lacks enough mature red blood cells to carry oxygen in the body   can be due to an iron deficiency or loss of blood, and can generate different immunological responses in males versus females. Knowing females are generally more predisposed than males to anemia due to monthly blood loss or pregnancy and childbirth, Elahi said looking at the impact of anemia on the immune systems in a controlled environment was the key.  We have shown in this study that females in general have more immature red blood cells in their blood circulation than males. One main reason for the presence of immature red blood cells in the blood circulation is anemia. In particular, the proportion of these cells expands in anemic women and these immature red blood cells in return suppress the immune system, making females more susceptible to infections,  said Elahi, who is also a member of the Women and Children s Health Research Institute (WCHRI), the Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta (CRINA) and the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology.  Anemia results in the suppression of the immune system.  Elahi s group further found that women have more immature red blood cells in their blood circulation after their menstrual cycle than before it. The finding suggests women s immune systems might be less active after menstruation and their odds of getting an infection increase. According to Elahi, childbirth and menstrual cycles contribute to women being more anemic than men, but the proof-of-concept study shows that anemia suppresses the female immune system more and makes women more prone to infections. The study also highlights the importance of anemia as a condition that can impair the immune system and cause females to be more susceptible than males to infections. One size does not fit all What the researchers discovered further cements the need to stop treating both sexes with the same strategies, Elahi noted. With the emergence of precision medicine in recent years and the rejection of one-size-fits-all diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, the significance of sex as a variable   and its impact on prevention, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies   have become more evident, he said.  The basis for personalized medicine is that males and females have different biology and immune responses. Sex influences the immune system resulting in sex-specific outcomes from autoimmune and infectious diseases, cancers and even response to immunization,  said Elahi.  In the past, we treated males and females the same, but in recent years there has been substantial attention to the role of sex in immune responses, as both respond differently to the same disease or treatment.  Elahi hopes future studies will identify the precise factors associated with sex differences in the immune responses.  Understanding such mechanisms will define important new strategies for effective prevention and treatment of immune-related conditions,  he said.  Males and females have different physiology and immune systems. Therefore, we need to be taking into account these differences between females and males from the very start of any research or clinical trial.

The big challenge is thus not to keep the drinking water completely clean, but to ensure it is unpolluted and safe to drink.It goes without saying that dead rats, rotten leaves, industrial waste and toxins do not belong in the drinking water.

Today, the remnants of those mines pepper the landscape, especially in the Navajo Nation, in northeast Arizona. Mine tailings and dust still circulate through the ecological system, spreading radioactive particles on soils, waterways, and homes.This radioactive dust is taken up by plants and spreads through the leaves and shoots. Grazing animals like sheep, a common livestock consumed by Navajo people, eat the contaminated plants and incorporate the radioactive materials into their tissues. Thus, uranium exposure is concentrated further through the food chain. A new study presented at the Geological Society of America s Connects 2021 annual meeting examines how chronic uranium exposure in the food chain might be reduced. Professor Laura Wasylenki, of Northern Arizona University, is presenting the work of her former graduate student Katherine Dunlap, where they examined how root fungi might alter the uptake of uranium in plants. Plants absorb elements, including uranium, from the soil and spread the material from  root to shoot,  says Wasylenki. Animals that graze on the plants will then ingest uranium, where it accumulates in tissue. The Navajo community raises sheep, which are an important source of food and part of their cultural heritage. The uranium stored in the sheep move up the food web into humans. Wasylenki says hardly anything is known about the role of fungi in the uptake of elements by plants.  We saw one experimental paper saying the fungi made the plants take up more uranium total, but only in the roots it didn't transport up into the shoots or leaves of the plants.  She explains that in grazers, some pull up the whole plant to munch on, while others (like sheep) pluck the tops of the plants. Wasylenki and Dunlap wanted to test whether there was a way to stimulate growth of the right fungi and sequester uranium underground.  Then at least you would be helping to reduce the uranium consumption of guys that just crop the tops [of the plants],  notes Wasylenki. The team grew sunflowers with and without symbiotic root fungi (called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). In particular, they were curious how the mineralogy of the soil and the presence of fungi would influence the uptake of uranium in sunflowers. Artificial soil (Turface) with no uranium present was used in the pots, and a layer of clay-rich material was added. Uranium was added in a known concentration when the plants were watered. When they looked at the uranium concentrations in plant tissues, they found that the presence of fungi decreased the spread of uranium from roots to shoots. They also found that the presence of a clay layer in the soil increased the uptake of uranium in the plants. Wasylenki hypothesizes that  uranium would sorb to the clay surfaces, holding it there, so that it had a longer residence time around the roots.  She adds that while more uranium was taken up in clay-rich soils, less was translocated throughout the plant more was stored in the root system of the sunflowers. Wasylenki notes that their sample size for the initial experiment was small but has plans to expand the testing with a larger sample size and various soil types. The team notes that this work is an important first step in understanding whether fungi can help mitigate uranium exposure for grazing animals, which ultimately make their way into the human food chain, especially for those in the Navajo community.ReferencePresented at the Geological Society of America s Connects 2021 annual meeting.

Now, researchers have found a possible treatment for the neurodegenerative disease in a surprising place: a database of drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Researchers at Gladstone Institutes teamed up with scientists from UC San Francisco (UCSF) and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and discovered that bumetanide used for more than 30 years to treat the retention of fluids associated with conditions like hypertension and heart failure reverses signs of Alzheimer s disease in mice, as well as in human brain cells. Moreover, when they analyzed electronic health records from two independent institutions, the team discovered that people over 65 who took bumetanide were less likely to develop Alzheimer s disease than those who didn t.

The research, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, elucidates how chaperones display ""selective promiscuity"" for the specific proteins -- their ""clients"" -- they serve. This property enables them to play an essential role in maintaining healthy cells and is a step forward in understanding the origins of a host of human illnesses, from cancer to ALS.There are four ""letters"" in the linear DNA code: A, C, G and T. Through the complex processes of transcription, followed by protein synthesis and finally protein folding, those four, two-dimensional letters turn into a 20-letter, three-dimensional recipe for proteins. Most of the time, this process works flawlessly, and our cells can build and reproduce themselves smoothly. But when something goes awry, the results can be catastrophic. Luckily, cells rely on a rigorous quality control to offset the devastating consequences.The protein folding process, during which a chain of amino acids assumes its final shape as a protein, can be especially fraught. Researchers have long known that special molecules called chaperones help shepherd the protein into its final, correct shape. These ""chaperones"" can figure out which proteins are at risk of being deformed and can then lend that protein additional help. But how exactly they do their work has been poorly understood: ""The chaperones do some kind of magic,"" says Alexandra Pozhidaeva, co-lead author of the paper who contributed to this study as a postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amherst and is currently a postdoctoral fellow at UConn Health. ""What we've done is to reveal the mechanics behind the trick.""The trick is that, though there are tens of thousands of different proteins in our cells, each with a different shape and function, there are far fewer chaperones. ""How is it,"" asks Lila Gierasch, Distinguished Professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UMass Amherst and the paper's senior author, ""that the same chaperones can help many different proteins?"" The answer lies in what the authors call the chaperones' ""selective promiscuity.""The team relied on the cutting-edge, in-house resources of UMass Amherst's Institute for Applied Life Sciences for a novel combination of x-ray crystallography, which yields an incredibly detailed high-resolution but static snapshot of the chaperone's interaction with its protein client, and nuclear magnetic resonance, which can capture a fuller, more dynamic picture of this complex process. The team focused their efforts on a specific chaperone family known as the Hsp70s. Hsp70s, according to co-lead author Rachel Jensen, a UMass undergraduate at the time she conducted this research and now a graduate student at Berkeley, are among the most important of chaperones because ""they carry out a wide range of critical roles within the cell and help execute many crucial cellular functions.""Whereas previous researchers used artificially shortened protein chains, the team used much longer chains to study how Hsp70's interaction with their clients. ""We studied a much more complex system,"" says Eugenia Clerico, co-lead author and research professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UMass. ""We were able to study in the lab something that mimics what happens in our bodies.""What they discovered is that Hsp70s are both promiscuous -- they can service many different proteins -- but also selective: the range of proteins they can work with is limited. Additionally, Hsp70s ""read"" ambidextrously: they can identify which protein chains to help by reading their sequences either from left to right, or right to left.Not only is this breakthrough an advance in our understanding of how cells stay healthy, it has real-world applications. ""Hsp70s,"" says Gierasch, ""are involved in so many pathological diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer's, and host Hsp70s are exploited by parasites and viruses. Understanding how Hsp70s work can help us develop therapeutic strategies against these terrible diseases.""Reference: Clerico EM, Pozhidaeva AK, Jansen RM,  zden C, Tilitsky JM, Gierasch LM.

The work is published in Cancer Discovery (Impact Factor: 39.4), a Journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.The central aim of personalized medicine is to find the right treatment for the right patient at the right time by analyzing and using specific characteristics of the patient s tumor. Until now, personalized therapy-matching has been primarily done based on genetic biomarkers. However, these provide treatment options for less than 10% of cancer patients. On the other hand, functional precision medicine (FPM) utilizes functionally evaluates the efficacy of numerous drugs directly on cancer cells, similar to the testing of antibiotics in an antibiogram.This study tested a novel approach of FPM, specifically termed  single-cell functional precision medicine (scFPM) , where the response to drugs on healthy and malignant cells, isolated from freshly removed tissue from cancer patients, is investigated with an in-depth analysis. Consequently, the method facilitates the identification of drugs that show cancer cell specific efficacy, while plausibly exhibiting a reduction in side effects. High precision of this platform is achieved with automated high-content microscopy and computerized image analysis, formerly called  pharmacoscopy .Within the framework of the EXALT (Extended Analysis for Leukemia/Lymphoma Treatment) study, focusing on patients with advanced hematological cancers, physicians and scientists led by Philipp Staber (MedUni Vienna/University Hospital Vienna), Ingrid Simonitsch-Klupp (MedUni Vienna/University Hospital Vienna), Giulio Superti-Furga (CeMM), and Berend Snijder (ETH Zurich, formerly CeMM) were for the first time able to show that therapy guidance by a functional test is clinically feasible and beneficial for cancer patients.

The findings, published recently in the journal Hepatology, have extensive biomedical implications for Alagille syndrome and for liver disease in general, including cancer. We ve been aware of the regenerative power of the liver for a long time, possibly even going back to the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus,  says lead author Duc Dong, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Human Genetics Program at Sanford Burnham Prebys.  But the existence and nature of liver stem cells remains an intensely debated topic. The new study suggests that the reason these cells have been so hard to find may be that researchers have been looking in the wrong place. The stem cells that we found are actually outside the liver, not within it, which may have made their discovery difficult,  adds Dong.  We think these  outside the box  liver stem cells act more like reserves, only traveling into the liver when all other options are exhausted. It only requires a few of these cells to enter the liver and multiply to repopulate all of the cells lost to the disease. Over 4 thousand babies each year are born with Alagille syndrome, which is caused by a mutation that prevents duct cells from forming in the liver. And while the syndrome can occasionally resolve naturally, and there are treatments available to manage the symptoms, the disease is incurable, carrying a 75% mortality rate by late adolescence for those without a liver transplant. ""We have known and supported Dr. Dong for years and we feel the work he and his team have done on this disease to date is extraordinary,"" says Cher Bork, Executive Director of the Alagille Syndrome Alliance. ""Hope can be difficult to come by for families dealing with any incurable disease, and discoveries like this help give that hope back to families living with this life-dominating condition.""Using zebrafish, which have many of the same genes and cellular pathways as humans, Dong s research team were able to create a model of Alagille syndrome by selectively deactivating genes associated with Alagille syndrome. These genes encode for chemical messengers from the Notch pathway, a signaling system found in most animals that is involved in embryonic development and adult cell maintenance. Our work suggests that there is potential for liver regeneration in Alagille patients, but because this signaling pathway is mutated, the regenerative cells fail to fully mature into functioning liver duct cells,  says Dong.In further animal studies, the team showed that by genetically restoring this signaling pathway, the regenerative cells could remobilize to form liver ducts, restoring the function of the liver and improving survival. The researchers are now leveraging their discovery to develop new therapies for Alagille syndrome. We ve shown not just that regeneration is possible in models of Alagille syndrome, but, importantly, how it can be enhanced,  says Dong.  These missing duct cells can regenerate if Jagged/Notch is restored, and our lab has developed the first drug that can boost this pathway.  While the new drug requires further studies to advance into clinical trials, the team has already found that it could enhance regeneration and survival in animal models and can trigger the Notch pathway in cells from Alagille patients. These results will be published in separate studies.  We re hopeful that this drug will restore the regenerative potential of the liver in Alagille patients, to be more like the liver of Prometheus,  adds Dong.Reference: Zhao C, Lancman JJ, Yang Y, et al.

We can then target or disrupt these processes to either treat symptoms or cure the disease. For conditions of the brain, such as neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, this has proven challenging. Despite a wave of advances in neuroscience research techniques over the last few decades, the brain is still somewhat of an elusive character, and treatments for brain disorders are lacking.However, a closer look at the chemistry of the brain might open up new research avenues. Like all tissues and organs of the body, regulation of the brain's pH level   the balance of acidity and alkalinity   is an important homeostatic function. Research studies have demonstrated a decrease in brain pH   meaning the conditions are more acidic   in neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to the proposal that it is a shared endophenotype for such conditions. As is often the case with new theories, it is somewhat controversial, as it can be challenging to conclude whether such pH changes are a primary feature of the disorder, or an outcome of other factors such as medication. Animal models of brain disorders are useful here, as they can be used experimentally to apply or remove such factors to determine further what role brain pH is having.You're likely familiar with lactate (or, lactic acid), the chemical by-product of anaerobic respiration that can cause pain in your muscles when you are exercising. Enhanced levels of lactate in the brain have also been observed in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. What effect can the enhanced lactate levels have? Recently, a new type of post-translational modification was discovered known as lysine lactylation. Post-translational modifications can cause epigenetic modifications, triggering changes in gene transcription   i.e., turning genes ""on"" or ""off"", altering the physiology of a cell. In macrophages, lysine lactylation can be stimulated by lactate. Can lactate have a similar effect in the brain, causing changes to gene transcription?A new, comprehensive study by researchers at the Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science at Fujita Health University in Japan, in collaboration with Ibaraki University and the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, explored this query. Their study is published in Cell Reports.In animal models, the team identified that protein lactylation occurs within neurons of the brain, and that this was positively correlated with lactate levels. The application of stressors known to increase lactate   such as exposure to aggression   enhanced lysine lactylation of histone proteins. The exact role of the protein lactylation in the neurons requires further exploration, but the researchers are confident that their study has opened up a ""new area of neuroscience"".Technology Networks interviewed Tsuyoshi Miyakawa, professor at the Division of Systems Medical Science Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science at Fujita Health University, and corresponding author of the study, to learn more about this research and what it means for the neuroscience field.Molly Campbell (MC): For readers that may be unacquainted with this area of research, please can you discuss the evidence that suggests changes in pH/lactate levels could be a primary feature of neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative disorders?Tsuyoshi Mikayawa (TM): First, we found pH/lactate levels were changed in many strains of mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders. We also found that pH is changed in the post-mortem brains of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In fact, there have been many previous research studies that showed pH/lactate is changed in post-mortem brains and also in the brain of living people with various neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative disorders. MC: Protein lactylation is a recently discovered post-translational modification. Can you explain what it is and why you wanted to test whether it occurs in brain cells?TM: In 2019, Zhang et al (Nature) first reported this phenomenon, lactylation, in immune cells (macrophages). Lactylation of a protein called histone changes gene expressions in those cells and changes the properties and functions of those cells. We thought that, if a similar process might be happening in the brain, it would be a big thing, since changes of lactate levels can be commonly seen in various brain disorders. Changes in the properties of neurons by lactylation might be playing some important roles in those disorders.MC: Can you summarize the key findings of your study that you think are the most important to convey to the public/research community?TM: A. Lactate, which was considered an energy source of neurons, may also change functions of proteins in the cells in the brain.B. This phenomenon, lactylation, can be induced by neural activities and by physiologically-relevant stimuli like social stress. When you feel social stress, a lot of proteins in your brain get lactylated and may change their functions.C. Since lactate levels are known to be changed in the brains of various brain disorders, lactate might be playing important roles in pathophysiology of those disorders.MC: You state that lactate is believed to have an antidepressant effect. Please can you explain this in the context of the study results?TM: Lactate has been reported to have an antidepressant effect acutely, but it may exert unknown long-term effects on the functions of the cells in the brain. Such effects could be preferable ones or unpreferable ones. We actually don t know and so we need to study them in the future.MC: Are there limitations to this work that you wish to highlight? You emphasize that the results are entirely correlational. Can you expand on this?TM: Yes, we don t even know whether lactylation is good or bad. We just know it is happening in our brain.That s what we mean by  entirely correlational .MC: What are your next research steps?TM: We need to know the functions of lactylation in the brain. To know them, we need to check one by one by mutating each lactylation site of the proteins and seeing what happens in the cells and in animals, including animal models of those disorders. Then, some of the proteins or molecular pathways that lead to such protein modifications could potentially be the targets of drug discovery for those disorders.Professor Tsuyoshi Miyakawa was speaking to Molly Campbell, Science Writer for Technology Networks.Reference: Hagihara H. et al.

However, Washington State University researchers found that while going 24 hours without sleep impacted study participants  mood, it did not change their performance on tests evaluating their ability to process emotional words and images. People do become less happy through sleep deprivation, but it s not affecting how they are processing emotional stimuli in their environment,  said Anthony Stenson, a WSU psychology doctoral student and lead author of the study in Plos One.The findings have implications for healthcare providers, law enforcement and people in other long-hour professions who need to be able to control their own emotions during stressful and emotionally trying situations. Sleep loss in not likely to make them numb to emotional situations, the researchers found, but it is likely to make them less able to control their own emotional responses.For the study, about 60 adult participants spent four consecutive days in the Sleep and Performance Research Center at the WSU Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine. All participants were allowed to sleep normally the first night and then given a set of baseline tests to judge their mood as well as their emotional regulation and processing ability. Then, the researchers divided the participants into two groups: one group of 40 people spent the second night awake, while a control group of 20 were allowed a normal sleep period. The tests were then re-administered at different intervals.The emotional regulation and processing tests both involved viewing a series of images with positive and negative emotional connotations. In the emotional regulation tests, participants were given a prompt to help them recontextualize negative images before seeing them and asked to control their feelings. The sleep-deprived group had greater difficulty reducing the emotion they felt when instructed to do so. The processing tests involved responding to words and images with emotional content, for example rating the emotions conveyed by a smiling family, a growling dog or a crying child  All participants performed similarly on these tests whether they were sleep deprived or not.The distinction between processing the emotional content of the world around you and being able to regulate your own emotional responses is an important one, especially for some professions, said co-author Paul Whitney, a WSU professor of psychology. I don t think we want our first responders being numb to the emotional nature of the situations they encounter, and it looks like they are not,  he said.  On the other hand, reacting normally to emotional situations, but not being able to control your own emotions, could be one reason sleep loss sometimes produces catastrophic errors in stressful situations. A lot of previous research has looked at how sleep deprivation impacts so called  cold  cognitive tasks supposedly emotionally neutral tasks like recalling facts. These studies have also found that regulation, which is considered a  top-down  cognitive process, is a major problem with cold cognitive tasks. For instance, mental flexibility is compromised by sleep deprivation. This is the ability an emergency room doctor might need to quickly change tactics if a patient isn t responding to a treatment.The current study shows that top-down regulation is a problem as well with  hot  or emotional cognitive processes. Future research is needed to understand whether the effects of sleep loss on the two top-down processes are linked.This study is the result of an ongoing collaboration among WSU psychology researchers and sleep experts at WSU College of Medicine. Other authors include psychology post-doctoral fellow Courtney Kurinec as well as psychology Professor John Hinson and College of Medicine Professor Hans Van Dongen. All are also affiliated with the WSU Sleep and Performance Research Center.Reference: Stenson AR, Kurinec CA, Hinson JM, Whitney P, Dongen HPAV.

Modern physics is filled with complex concepts and ideas that have revolutionized the way we see (and don't see) the universe. The mysteries of the physical world are increasingly being revealed by physicists who delve into non-intuitive, unseen worlds, involving the subatomic, quantum and cosmological realms. But how do the brains of advanced physicists manage this feat, of thinking about worlds that can't be experienced?In a recently published paper in npj: Science of Learning, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have found a way to decode the brain activity associated with individual abstract scientific concepts pertaining to matter and energy, such as fermion or dark matter.Robert Mason, senior research associate, Reinhard Schumacher, professor of physics and Marcel Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Psychology, at CMU investigated the thought processes of their fellow CMU physics faculty concerning advanced physics concepts by recording their brain activity using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).Unlike many other neuroscience studies that use brain imaging, this one was not out to find ""the place in the brain"" where advanced scientific concepts reside. Instead, this study's goal was to discover how the brain organizes highly abstract scientific concepts. An encyclopedia organizes knowledge alphabetically, a library organizes it according to something like the Dewey Decimal System, but how does the brain of a physicist do it?The study examined whether the activation patterns evoked by the different physics concepts could be grouped in terms of concept properties. One of the most novel findings was that the physicists' brains organized the concepts into those with measureable versus immeasurable size. Here on Earth for most of us mortals, everything physical is measureable, given the right ruler, scale or radar gun. But for a physicist, some concepts like dark matter, neutrinos or the multiverse, their magnitude is not measureable. And in the physicists' brains, the measureable versus immeasurable concepts are organized separately.Of course, some parts of the brain organization of the physics professors resembled the organization in physics students' brains such as concepts that had a periodic nature. Light, radio waves and gamma rays have a periodic nature but concepts like buoyancy and the multiverse do not.But how can this interpretation of the brain activation findings be assessed? The study team found a way to generate predictions of the activation patterns of each of the concepts. But how can the activation evoked by dark matter be predicted? The team recruited an independent group of physics faculty to rate each concept on each of the hypothesized organizing dimensions on a 1-7 scale. For example, a concept like ""duality"" would tend to be rated as immeasurable (i.e., low on the measureable magnitude scale). A computational model then determined the relation between the ratings and activation patterns for all of the concepts except one of them and then used that relation to predict the activation of the left-out concept. The accuracy of this model was 70% on average, well above chance at 50%. This result indicates that the underlying organization is well-understood. This procedure is demonstrated for the activation associated with the concept of dark matter in the accompanying figure.","Published: October 12, 2021"

Here, the authors have taken advantage of CRISPR/dCas9 technology adapted for epigenetic editing through site-specific targeting of DNA methylation to characterize the transcriptional changes of the candidate gene and the functional effects on cell fate in different tumor settings.Strikingly, this modification led to opposing expression profiles of the target gene in different cancer cell models and affected the expression of mesenchymal genes CDH1, VIM1, TGFB1 and apoptotic marker BCL2. Moreover, methylation-induced changes in expression profiles was also accompanied by a phenotypic switch in cell migration and cell morphology.Dr. Miguel Vizoso and Dr. Jacco van Rheenen said, ""Increasing number of studies report that proteins do not work in isolation but are part of a complex network of biomolecules, that may differ at various settings (e.g., different tumor types [1, 2] or stages of tumor progression.""Various examples of genes with opposing roles, e. DNA methylation may be one of the drivers of these opposing roles. For example, the same DNA methylation mark can lead to very opposite outcomes depending on which allele is tagged with this modification. Here they test whether the same epigenetic modification could also orchestrate molecular and phenotypic diversity in non-imprinted genes.In this study, the authors focus on the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, a recently discovered multitasked gene regulated by DNA methylation which has also been reported to function both as a tumor-promoting and -suppressing gene. The diverse phenotypes upon single alterations in cancer driver genes may simply reflect the various roles of these genes in distinct signaling pathways, but it may also be caused by differential gene expression patterns of these genes.DNA methylation comprises a significant mechanism involved in transcriptomic regulation based on the occupancy of CpG dinucleotides by 5 -methylcytosine chemical groups. Whether the consequence of DNA methylation on the expression of the target genes and cell fate is uniform regardless of the cell type or can drive to opposing phenotypes depending on the tumor cell context is still unknown, and it has remained elusive for many years due to the lack of technologies to target DNA methylation in-situ.The Vizoso/van Rheenen Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output, ""our study highlights the significance of exploring the effects of the epigenetic editing in different tumor settings by revealing the important consequences that this can have on transcriptomic regulation and tumor cell behavior.""Reference: Vizoso M, Rheenen J van.

It was cancelled entirely in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. On March 24, SfN announced that the upcoming conference would switch to a  hybrid  model, with an in-person offering on November 13-16 paired with an earlier online program taking place November 8-11.That course of action was dramatically altered on October 8, just four days after advance registration for the event closed. An announcement emailed to attendees cancelled the in-person event at Chicago s McCormick Place Convention Center, blaming the coronavirus for once again disrupting the event:  The decision to transition to a fully virtual Neuroscience 2021 experience was necessary due to the impact of the continuing spread of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, causing a significant number of in-person speakers to withdraw and preventing SfN from holding a major portion of its in-person programming. An accompanying statement from SfN president Barry Everitt expressed the society s extreme disappointment, but initially contained no mention of a refund. A salve was offered to out-of-pocket attendees, who were promised a 50% discount on society membership in 2022.Many reacted with anger to the statement online, noting that an  FAQ  section stated that due to the existence of a virtual option for the event, no refunds would be offered to those who booked in-person tickets. While refunds for SfN-backed housing were made available, academics online bemoaned the inflexible policy. Bj rn Brembs, a professor at Regensburg University in Germany, told Technology Networks that, prior to SfN s U-turn, he intended to attend the event in-person with his postdoc (accompanied by their husband and baby) and a graduate student.  I should be able to cover all remaining costs from [my lab] budget, but it is a big hit for our small lab. As bad as that is, it is much worse for the less well-off. As a graduate student, I paid all my conferences entirely out of pocket, as my supervisor thought conferences were unnecessary. I'm sure there are many more like him,  he said.  Others stated that SfN s initial policy made them less likely to attend future conferences. Vernon Garc a Rivas, a postdoc at Yale University School of Medicine, told Technology Networks,  I just recently arrived to the US as a postdoc and was looking forward to the networking/collaboration opportunities that SfN represents. I will now be putting more effort into going to conferences organized by smaller neuroscience societies closer to my research interests. Over the weekend, online pressure provoked a new statement from Everitt.  When we made the decision to move ahead with [the] in-person Neuroscience 2021 experience in the spring, vaccine optimism was high and the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant had not taken hold in the US. Infection rates were low, and we believed that enthusiasm for an in-person meeting would be high and that international travel bans would be lifted. We were wrong,  the October 11 statement read.  However, as announced today, if you choose not to participate in the virtual meeting, you can submit a refund request for Neuroscience 2021 registration prior to October 25 for a full refund. The U-turn, which both Brembs and Rivas had sought, was welcomed by some prospective attendees, but it is unclear whether abstract submission costs would also be refunded to those who chose not to attend. SfN were contacted for comment. ","Published: October 12, 2021"

Until the early 20th century, allergy was thought to be a rare disease. But since in the 1920s to 1930s and especially since the second half of the 20th century, the prevalence of allergies has exploded in Western societies. For example, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology estimates that half of the population of the EU will have allergies by 2025: an increase by 20 percent points since 2015. Similarly, a survey from 2020 estimated that approximately 100 million (30%) Americans of all ages have allergies today.What drives this ongoing explosion? Multiple lifestyle and environmental risk factors have been proposed. These include increases in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, detergents, antiseptic soap, and cesarian births, as well as changes in the home, such as decreased ventilation, increased carpeting and furnishing, and increased temperature. Another probable factor is the steady decrease in the time spent playing outside by children, resulting in less physical activity, a higher body mass index, shallower breathing patterns, less exposure to bacteria, and a greater exposure to indoor allergens.","Published: October 12, 2021"

Deep Neural Networks are often presented as the current best model of human decision-making behaviour, achieving or even exceeding human performance in some tasks. However, even deceptively simple visual discrimination tasks can reveal clear inconsistencies and errors from the AI models, when compared to humans.Currently, Deep Neural Network technology is used in applications such a face recognition, and while it is very successful in these areas, scientists still do not fully understand how these networks process information, and therefore when errors may occur.In this new study, the research team addressed this problem by modelling the visual stimulus that the Deep Neural Network was given, transforming it in multiple ways so they could demonstrate a similarity of recognition, via processing similar information between humans and the AI model.Professor Philippe Schyns, senior author of the study and Head of the University of Glasgow s Institute of Neuroscience and Technology, said:  When building AI models that behave  like"" humans, for instance to recognise a person s face whenever they see it as a human would do, we have to make sure that the AI model uses the same information from the face as another human would do to recognise it. If the AI doesn t do this, we could have the illusion that the system works just like humans do, but then find it gets things wrong in some new or untested circumstances. The researchers used a series of modifiable 3D faces, and asked humans to rate the similarity of these randomly generated faces to four familiar identities. They then used this information to test whether the Deep Neural Networks made the same ratings for the same reasons   testing not only whether humans and AI made the same decisions, but also whether it was based on the same information. Importantly, with their approach the researchers can visualise these results as the 3D faces that drive the behaviour of humans and networks. For example, a network that correctly classified 2,000 identities was driven by a heavily caricaturised face, showing it identified the faces processing very different face information than humans.Researchers hope this work will pave the way for more dependable AI technology that behaves more like humans and makes fewer unpredictable errors.Reference: Daube C, Xu T, Zhan J, et al.

This ability is key to our survival, enabling us to safely navigate our surroundings and quickly understand and respond to new situations. It is perhaps unsurprising that the brain devotes considerable space to these sensitive skin surfaces that are specialized for fine, discriminative touch and continually gather detailed information via the sensory neurons that innervate them. But how does the connection between sensory neurons and the brain result in such exquisitely sensitive skin? A new study led by researchers at Harvard Medical School has unveiled a mechanism that may underlie the greater sensitivity of certain skin regions. The research, conducted in mice and published Oct. 11 in Cell, shows that the overrepresentation of sensitive skin surfaces in the brain develops in early adolescence and can be pinpointed to the brain stem. Moreover, the sensory neurons that populate the more sensitive parts of the skin and relay information to the brain stem form more connections and stronger ones than neurons in less sensitive parts of the body.  This study provides a mechanistic understanding of why more brain real estate is devoted to surfaces of the skin with high touch acuity,  said senior author David Ginty, the Edward R. and Anne G. Lefler Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School.  Basically, it's a mechanism that helps explain why one has greater sensory acuity in the parts of the body that require it. While the study was done in mice, the overrepresentation of sensitive skin regions in the brain is seen across mammals suggesting that the mechanism may be generalizable to other species. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals have dramatically varied body forms, which translates into sensitivity in different skin surfaces. For example, humans have highly sensitive hands and lips, while pigs explore the world using highly sensitive snouts. Thus, Ginty thinks this mechanism could provide the developmental flexibility for different species to develop sensitivity in different areas. Moreover, the findings, while fundamental, could someday help illuminate the touch abnormalities seen in certain neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. Scientists have long known that certain body parts are overrepresented in the brain as depicted by the brain s sensory map, called the somatosensory homunculus, a schematic of human body parts and the corresponding areas in the brain where signals from these body parts are processed. The striking illustration includes cartoonishly oversized hands and lips. Previously, it was thought that the overrepresentation of sensitive skin regions in the brain could be attributed to a higher density of neurons innervating those skin areas. However, earlier work by the Ginty lab revealed that while sensitive skin does contain more neurons, these extra neurons are not sufficient to account for the additional brain space.  We noticed that there was a rather meager number of neurons that were innervating the sensitive skin compared to what we d expect,  said co-first author Brendan Lehnert, a research fellow in neurobiology, who led the study with Celine Santiago, also a research fellow in the Ginty lab.  It just wasn t adding up,  Ginty added. To investigate this contradiction, the researchers conducted a series of experiments in mice that involved imaging the brain and neurons as neurons were stimulated in different ways. First, they examined how different skin regions were represented in the brain throughout development. Early in development, the sensitive, hairless skin on a mouse s paw was represented in proportion to the density of sensory neurons. However, between adolescence and adulthood, this sensitive skin became increasingly overrepresented in the brain, even though the density of neurons remained stable a shift that was not seen in less sensitive, hairy paw skin.  This immediately told us that there s something more going on than just the density of innervation of nerve cells in the skin to account for this overrepresentation in the brain,  Ginty said.   It was really unexpected to see changes over these postnatal developmental timepoints,  Lehnert added.  This might be just one of many changes over postnatal development that are important for allowing us to represent the tactile world around us and helping us gain the ability to manipulate objects in the world through the sensory motor loop that touch is such a special part of. Next, the team determined that the brain stem the region at the base of the brain that relays information from sensory neurons to more sophisticated, higher-order brain regions is the location where the enlarged representation of sensitive skin surfaces occurs. This finding led the researchers to a realization: The overrepresentation of sensitive skin must emerge from the connections between sensory neurons and brain stem neurons.  To probe even further, the scientists compared the connections between sensory neurons and brain stem neurons for different types of paw skin. They found that these connections between neurons were stronger and more numerous for sensitive, hairless skin than for less sensitive, hairy skin. Thus, the team concluded, the strength and number of connections between neurons play a key role in driving overrepresentation of sensitive skin in the brain. Finally, even when sensory neurons in sensitive skin weren t stimulated, mice still developed expanded representation in the brain suggesting that skin type, rather than stimulation by touch over time, causes these brain changes.  We think we've uncovered a component of this magnification that accounts for the disproportionate central representation of sensory space.  Ginty said.  This is a new way of thinking about how this magnification comes about. Next, the researchers want to investigate how different skin regions tell the neurons that innervate them to take on different properties, such as forming more and stronger connections when they innervate sensitive skin.  What are the signals?  Ginty asked.  That s a big, big mechanistic question.  And while Lehnert describes the study as purely curiosity-driven, he noted that there is a prevalent class of neurodevelopmental disorders in humans called developmental coordination disorders that affect the connection between touch receptors and the brain and thus might benefit from elucidating further the interplay between the two.  This is one of what I hope will be many studies that explore on a mechanistic level changes in how the body is represented over development,  Lehnert says.  Celine and I both think this might lead, at some point in the future, to a better understanding of certain neurodevelopmental disorders. Reference: Lehnert BP, Santiago C, Huey EL, et al.

Baer, infectious disease physician at the Medical College of Georgia and chief of Infection Control and Epidemiology at the Charlie Norwood Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta. Kidney transplant patients are at risk for all kinds of infections,  says Dr. Sandeep Padala, nephrologist at MCG and the Augusta University Health System.While the dose and selection of immunosuppressive drugs are often adjusted, some combination of these drugs which help prevent the immune system from attacking a transplanted kidney, must be taken as long as the transplanted organ is present, and the longer those drugs are taken, the higher the infection risk, Padala says.To look at how that increased vulnerability impacted these patients  risk for nocardiosis, the investigators used the U.S. Renal Data System, a national database that collects, analyzes and distributes information on end-stage renal disease in the country, to look at 203,233 kidney transplant recipients from 2001-11.For the study, published in the Journal of Investigative Medicine, they looked for patients who had been diagnosed with nocardiosis, failure of the kidney after the infection, along with demographics and risk factors.They found 657 patients   less than 1% of the total, .32% exactly   had been diagnosed with a nocardia infection, a lower percentage than previous, smaller studies. Being older, having a brain abscess or being on specific immunosuppressants ended up translating to a higher risk of transplant rejection for these patients,  says corresponding author Baer.Those infected tended to be age 65 and older, have a history of transplant rejection and/or failure and to have received their kidney from the more common deceased donor source rather than a living donor.  In 2020, for example, there were 33,310 deceased donor transplants compared with 5,726 living donor transplants, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.Those infected also had been treated with a handful of common immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Those treated with a drug called antithymocyte globulin, which reduces the action of drivers of the immune system called T cells, and who developed a brain abscess as a result of their nocardia infection were most likely to have their transplanted organs fail, the investigators report.All told nearly 43% of all transplant patients experience failure of their transplanted organ, and that percentage jumped to 67% with nocardia infection. One surprise was that those who had a history of transplant organ failure or rejection, a factor for many of these patients with nocardiosis, actually had decreased risk of their transplanted organ failing potentially because of heightened attention by patients and physicians alike because of their previous troubles, they write.They say their analysis was the first large study in the country to look at risk  factors for transplant failure in patients with a nocardia infection, and that the findings provide new information to enhance early recognition and targeted treatment of nocardiosis in these patients.The take-home message: Don t forget to screen for nocardia in these patients especially if they have a combination of pneumonia and brain abscess, Baer says. It they don t respond to the routine antibiotics, then you have to start looking for unusual things,  Baer says.They can look first in the blood for the bacterium, but when not present there in the face of classic symptoms, they may also need to do the much-more invasive bronchoalveolar lavage, essentially a lung rinsing often used to find the bug culprit in bacterial pneumonia, which enables sample collection for testing or an actual lung biopsy.Blood cultures are routine in transplant patients but they don t routinely look for nocardia, plus it can be present in the lungs and not show up in the blood, Padala notes. It s only when more common bugs are not found that nocardia comes on the radar, he says.  It s a very difficult organism to both diagnose and treat because it s a higher order bacteria; it s more sophisticated than most bacteria,  Baer says.  It only likes to infect specific places in the body like the lungs and the brain and you have to use special stains to see it. Another major wrinkle is nocardia only responds to specific antibiotics, some of which are toxic to the kidneys, which is a primary reason they were looking at the impact of the bacterium in these patients, she says.Baer notes that nocardia can be misdiagnosed as actinomyces, another bug found in the soil which is actually important to soil ecology and likes mucosal surfaces like the inside of the mouth. In fact, Baer notes the same diagnostic code is used for both infections, so they also looked at symptoms to try to zero in on nocardia, which may mean some nocardia cases were inadvertently left out of the study and reported numbers in reality might actually be higher in this cohort, Baer says.When a patient with the infection is identified, infectious disease specialists like Baer work closely with nephrologists like Padala to find the best strategy for managing his/her care.Nocardia hit Baer s radar because of a patient who had what they suspected as the bacterium in his lungs but they could not detect it in his sputum. The infection eventually crossed over into the blood where it was readily diagnosed. They were able to clear up the bacterial infection but he ultimately died of other complications.More study is needed to examine when infections occur and to identify preventive strategies to prevent the infection and its consequences, the investigators say.People might get nocardia in their lungs by breathing in some dust or by digging in the dirt when a finger has a cut, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacterium also can be present on medical equipment and get into a surgical wound, for example, following a procedure.The brain is the most common site for a disseminated infection, which means it has spread in the body, and up to 44% of patients with infection in the brain or spinal cord die, the CDC says. Like a weakened immune system increases the risk of infection, it s also known to increase the risk of death from the infection, the CDC says. Baer says less than 10 people died among the more than 600 they studied.Reference: Gibson M, Yang N, Waller JL, et al. Nocardiosis in renal transplant patients. J. Investig.

The work could potentially contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, that evade certain elements of the body's immune response.The results were reported Oct. 8 in Angewandte Chemie, a leading chemistry journal. The study was led by Yan Yu, an associate professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Chemistry. The particles in the study were designed to understand phagocytosis, the process by which immune cells uptake and destroy pathogens in the body. During this important process, pathogens are engulfed into cellular compartments called phagosomes, which then ""mature"" through a complex sequence of chemical reactions, killing invading disease. ""Many important cell functions, including phagocytosis, rely on the orchestration of complex chemical reactions, but measuring these different reactions in real time inside a living cell is extremely challenging,"" Yu said. ""This study shows that particles of the type designed in our lab are broadly applicable to understanding many types of complex chemical interactions in living cells."" The particles used in the study are called Janus particles, named for the two-faced Roman god. The artificially constructed particles are so-named since two sides of the same particle are ""coated"" with different chemical sensors. These sensors can act as detectors, or ""reporters,"" for various chemicals involved in the biological process under investigation. Yu's lab has perfected a technique to pack these receptors very close together across a Janus particle's surface, significantly increasing their effectiveness as an investigative tool. Yu's previous research on Janus particles has yielded new insights into the body's ability to resist fungal infection, as well as a new method to activate the body's T-cells, which are used to fight cancer, enhance immune therapy, fight viral infection and induce tolerance in autoimmune disease. The latter work is the subject of a patent filing with U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. She has also filed a provisional patent on the newly reported discovery. In the new study, Yu's team designed a Janus particle whose two sides consist of a 3-micrometer pH reporter and a 500-nanometer proteolysis reporter. As a result, the researchers were able to simultaneously measure two chemical processes involved in phagocytosis -- acidification and proteolysis -- within a single maturing phagosome in real-time. They identified that phagosomes require an ""acidic lumen"" to activate enzymes that digest pathogens encapsulated inside, a critical step for preventing the pathogens from reproducing inside host immune cells. They also showed that lipopolysaccharide, a sugar compound found in many bacteria's outer-wall membranes, can affect acidification and proteolysis in phagosomes. Understanding these processes is especially important in bacterial infections that evade the body's immune response by hijacking one or more events in phagosome maturation process, thwarting the phagosome's protective function. These diseases include tuberculosis, which is the world's leading infectious disease killer, claiming about 1.5 million lives annually. ""The Janus particles created in this study act as a sensor to detect these chemical changes inside immune cells during pathogen degradation,"" Yu said. ""But, more broadly, the work showcases the feasibility of Janus particles as a general tool for monitoring multiple reactions within a cell -- as well as highlights their potential for the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases.""ReferenceLee S, Zhang Z, Yu Y.

This is shown in a nationwide study performed by researchers at Ume  University, Sweden. The results strongly suggest that vaccination is important not only for individual protection, but also for reducing transmission, especially within families, which is a high-risk environment for transmission,  says Peter Nordstr m, professor of geriatric medicine at Ume  University.There is a vast body of research showing that vaccines strongly reduce the risk of COVID-19. However, less is known about the influence of vaccination on transmission of the virus in high-risk environments, such as within families. This is what researchers at Ume  University aimed to investigate in a new study.In the study, the researchers found that there was a dose-response association between the number of immune individuals in each family and the risk of infection and hospitalization in non-immune family members. Specifically, non-immune family members had a 45 to 97 per cent lower risk of infection and hospitalization, as the number of immune family members increased. The study is a nationwide, registry-based study of more than 1.8 million individuals from more than 800,000 families. The researchers combined registry data from the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and from Statistics Sweden, which is the government agency that oversees statistical data. In the analysis, the researchers quantified the association between the number of family members with immunity against COVID-19 and the risk of infection and hospitalization in nonimmune individuals. The researchers accounted for differences in age, socioeconomic status, clustering within families, and several diagnoses previously identified as risk factors for COVID-19 in the Swedish population. It seems as if vaccination helps not only to reduce the individual s risk of becoming infected, but also to reduce transmission, which in turn minimizes not only the risk that more people become critically il, but also that new problematic variants emerge and start to take over. Consequently, ensuring that many people are vaccinated has implications on a local, national, and global scale,  says Marcel Ballin, doctoral student in geriatric medicine at Ume  University and co-author of the study.Reference: Nordstr m P, Ballin M, Nordstr m A.

Across 32 species of seabirds sampled from around the globe, an international team from 18 institutions in seven countries found that up to 52 % of the birds not only ate plastic, but also accumulated the plastic s chemical components in their bodies.The researchers published their results on October 11th, 2021 in Environmental Monitoring and Contaminants Research.  Globally, approximately 400 million metric tons of plastics are produced each year, and a portion of these escape into the environment, eventually find their way into the oceans,  said corresponding author Hideshige Takada, professor in the Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry (LOG), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology.  When floating on the sea surface or stranded on beaches, plastics are exposed to UV radiation from the sun and break down into smaller fragments.  These fragments, as well as resin pellets used as plastic feedstock that also make their way into the waterways, are not biodegradable nor do they sink. They are similar in size to seabirds  natural prey of small fish and insects, and they are light enough to float or move with the currents.  Consequently, huge amounts of plastics are available to a suite of consumers in the world s oceans,  Takada said.  As of 2020, 180 species of seabirds, corresponding to half of the total species of seabirds around the globe, have been reported to have ingested plastics. It has also been predicted that by 2050, 99% of seabird species will have ingested plastics.  While eating plastic can cause physical damage and be a direct cause for seabird death, according to Takada, little is known about the biological consequences of consuming the chemicals added to bind, stabilize or otherwise improve plastic used in food packing, fishing gear and more.  It was believed that additives are not easily available for leaching or accumulation in biological tissues as they are kneaded into the polymer matrix during plastic production,  Takada said.  However, it has been demonstrated that oily components in digestive fluids can act as organic solvents to facilitate additive leaching.  As a result, Takada said, plastic additives can be accumulated in seabirds  tissue.   In this study, we aimed to understand the spread threat of plastic-mediated accumulation of chemical additives to seabirds on a global basis,  Takada said. The researchers analyzed oil from the preen gland, located just above the tail, from 145 seabirds in 16 different locations around the world. By examining the chemical concentrations in this oil, the researchers can determine the contaminant burden of the bird s internal fat stores. They procured the oil by wiping the gland, which can be done without harm to the bird. They also examined the preen gland oil and stomach contents of 54 bird carcasses found on the beaches. The researchers found one additive accumulated in 16 of the birds, and other additives in 67 of the birds.  High concentrations of additives were detected in seabirds that also contained large, ingested plastic loads,  Takada said, noting that the birds could also receive additives initially ingested by their natural prey, these occurrence patterns suggest that additives are derived mainly from directly ingested plastics.  The detection additives demonstrated that significant portions of the world s seabirds   10 to 30%   are likely the accumulate chemicals directly from ingesting plastics, but the health consequences of this are not fully understood.  The researchers plan to further explore the biological effects of the accumulated additives in seabirds.ReferenceYamashita R, Hiki N, Kashiwada F, et al.

For these patients miRNAs may serve as preclinical markers, which expression levels are deregulated in cancer and which are stable to the damaging factors partly through complex formation with proteins or packaging into exosomes. The second question was whether saliva miRNA expression levels   both exosomal and non-exosomal   are associated with primary liver cancer.These authors evaluated exosomal and non-exosomal miRNAs   let-7a-5p, -16-5p, -18a-5p, -21-5p, -22-3p, -34a-5p, -103a-3p, -122-5p, -221-3p, -222-3p   in plasma and saliva of patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis, primary liver cancer and healthy volunteers.In this study, non-exosomal miRNAs normalized to non-exosomal miRNA-16-5p showed strong association with liver cancer in plasma. Three miRNAs, those with the mostly pronounced change of expression levels in plasma,   miRNA-21-5p, 122-5p, 221-3p   were detected in saliva.Dr. Alisa A. Petkevich from The Peoples' Friendship University of Russia said, ""Liver cancer despite its relatively low incidence rate with a geographically varied global burden is a fatal disease due to its high mortality rate: 5-year survival rate changes from 2% to 33% depending on the stage of the disease at the time of the diagnosis.""Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of primary liver cancer reaching 80 90% of all primary liver cancers. In 20% of all cases, this is an out of the blue disease developing without any liver cirrhosis. Anyway, despite the relative low incidence rate of malignancy of an HCV-related cirrhosis and the era of direct antivirals, there is an accumulated pool of patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis who are at risk group of liver cancer development. Surely, in these cases liver cancer is not that much an out of the blue disease but anyway it may be clinically silent during early stages of the disease, thus, methods for identifying molecular changes developing in preclinical stages of the disease are essential.The microvesicles may contain different proteins, DNA and various RNA including miRNA, a small non-coding nucleic acid of 18-24 nucleotides involved in epigenetic regulation of the gene expression. Exosomes along with other microvesicles may serve as a target delivery system and mechanism for preserving the structure of the molecules being their defense from different enzymes.The Petkevich Research Team concluded in their Oncotarget Research Output, ""remembering the primary liver cancer has a strong dependance on geography, its incidence rate is relatively low in Russian Federation [3]. This relative low incidence rate along with other factors including unwillingness of patients of the risk group to come systematically to the research center for blood collection without personal interests make the prospective cases database formation an issue in the Russian Federation. Considering the fact, the Liver Research Center of the RUDN Medical Institute has a database of patients with HCV-associated cirrhosis with the contact information, a possible solution to this problem could be the use of a biomaterial that does not require the presence of medical personnel for its collection, for example, such as a saliva. In our research, we proved saliva was a promising approach as a source for exosomal and non-exosomal miRNAs. The exosomal miRNAs normalized to exosomal miRNA-16-5p seem to be the form of miRNA normalization, which give the strongest association with primary liver cancer in saliva samples.""Reference: Petkevich AA, Abramov AA, Pospelov VI, et al.

Botanists at the University of Basel have now developed a model that can be used to determine the origin of food in an efficient and low-cost manner.Strawberries from Switzerland or olive oil from Italy can be sold at much higher prices than the same products from other countries. Both the authorities and the food industry spend a great deal of time fighting false declarations of geographical origin that are assumed to cause an estimated USD 30 million to 40 billion a year in economic damage. One method for detecting food fraud is to determine the  18O (delta-O-18) value of a product sample, which characterizes the oxygen isotope ratio. Until now, this procedure has been highly time consuming and costly. A case of suspected fraud involved not only collecting reference data from the claimed country of origin, but also comparative data from other regions to validate or disprove the product s origin.Basel botanist Dr. Florian Cueni has now developed a model in collaboration with Agroisolab GmbH, a company specializing in isotope analysis. This model is intended for use in simulating the oxygen isotope ratio in plants from individual regions, thereby eliminating the need for the time-consuming collection of reference data. The model is based on temperature, precipitation and humidity data and information about the growing season of a plant, all of which are available from publicly accessible databases. Cueni tested and validated the model on a unique  18O reference dataset for strawberries collected across Europe over 11 years. The case study has shown that the model can simulate the origin of the strawberries with a high degree of accuracy. With minor adjustments to the parameters, our model can be used to determine all plant products,  says Professor Ansgar Kahmen, who led the research project. This makes it possible to simplify and speed up conventional isotope analysis by accurately simulating the regions of origin of agricultural foodstuffs. The model developed by the Basel botanists is of interest to food forensics officials or the investigating authorities when it comes to the origin of confiscated drugs, for example, as well as to private forensic institutes that inspect food or serve as expert witnesses in court. NGOs such as WWF or Greenpeace are also interested   especially with regard to determining the origin of illegally logged timber   as is the food industry, which suffers reputational damage due to the sale of products that may have been falsely declared.ReferenceCueni F, Nelson DB, Boner M, Kahmen A.

Three months after their cancer surgery, more than three times as many patients who did not receive dexamethasone died, compared to those who received the drug, researchers found.Dexamethasone is given to patients to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery and during chemotherapy. Researchers found dexamethasone can improve mid- to long-term outcomes in patients with non-immunogenic cancers (those that don t provoke a strong immune response) such as sarcoma and cancers of the breast, uterus, ovary, esophagus, pancreas, thyroid, bones and joints. Dexamethasone has positive and negative effects   it inhibits cancer growth, but also suppresses the immune system,  said Maximilian Schaefer, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study and director of the Center for Anesthesia Research Excellence, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston.  Previous research has reported that in cancers in which the immune system controls cancer growth, the positive and negative effects of dexamethasone balance each other, so there is no benefit. Ours is the first large study to show that for a wide variety of cancers where the immune system does not play a major role, the positive effects seem to predominate. Researchers analyzed the records of 74,058 patients who had surgeries to remove non-immunogenic cancerous tumors between 2005 and 2020 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and between 2007 and 2015 at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. Overall, 25,178 (34%) patients received dexamethasone during surgery. After 90 days, 209 (0.83%) of the patients who had received dexamethasone died vs. 1,543 (3.2%) of patients who did not receive the drug.After taking into account various factors, including that dexamethasone is often administered to younger patients, those who received the drug still had a 21% reduced risk of dying within one year after surgery. A second analysis determined dexamethasone was particularly beneficial for patients with cancers of the ovary, uterus or cervix. Based on our data, physician anesthesiologists should feel more confident in administering dexamethasone to patients undergoing surgery for non-immunogenic cancers,  said Dr. Schaefer.  It not only helps with nausea, but it also may result in improved survival. This article has been republished from the following materials. Note: material may have been edited for length and content.

Multiple drug resistant (MDR) TB has become a global health emergency, an emerging European crisis, and an important Irish public health concern. Many challenges remain in the global fight against this disease including a clinical need for effective treatments against MDR-TB.Now a research team at Trinity College, based in the Trinity Translational Medical Institute (TTMI) at St James s Hospital are offering fresh hope for improving treatments for what remains a deadly disease, by focusing on identifying potential host-directed therapies that can target a patient s own immune response to help them recover from TB.The research team has previously discovered that human immune cells change the way they use energy when they become infected. This change results in the generation of lactate, which was once considered a waste product of metabolism. New work by the team has shown that lactate can influence cells in the lung environment, to support immune defenses against infection and at the same time limit collateral damage to the delicate lung caused by excessive inflammation. Their study is published in leading journal, Frontiers in Immunology today, (Wednesday, 6th October 2021).The research team is based in Professor Joseph Keane s TB Immunology lab at TTMI.Dr Cilian   Maoldomhnaigh undertook this research as part of a PhD project funded by the National Children s Research Centre and the Royal City of Dublin Hospital Trust.He said: Lactate has an immediate and striking effect on the metabolic function of human immune cells and reduces their ability to change their metabolism in response to subsequent infection. This has the knock-on effect of reducing inflammation, which can cause damage in the lung. We ve also found that lactate can promote a cell s waste removal processes, allowing it to effectively dispose of the infection. This waste removal process, called  autophagy , also plays a role in a wide range of other disease states such as Crohn s disease, cancer and heart disease, this indicates that lactate may hold therapeutic potential in many disease settings.Senior author on the paper, Dr Sharee Basdeo, Clinical Medicine, TTMI is excited about the impact this work may have.She said: Our data indicate that aerosolised lactate delivered to the lungs may hold potential as a host-directed therapy for people battling lethal pneumonias - such as TB and COVID-19, where there is destruction of pulmonary tissue due to an unchecked pro-inflammatory response.

Traditional diagnostic imaging cannot detect tumors smaller than a certain size, causing missed opportunities for early detection and treatment. Circulating tumor exosomes are especially small cancer biomarkers and easy to miss. These nanovesicles are composed of molecules that reflect the parental cells. But, because they are tiny (~30-150nm in diameter) and complex, the precise detection of exosome-carried biomarkers with molecular specificity is elusive. Until now, reports Wei-Chuan Shih, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering, in IEEE Sensors journal.  This work demonstrates, for the first time, that the strong synergy of arrayed radiative coupling and substrate undercut can enable high-performance biosensing in the visible light spectrum where high-quality, low-cost silicon detectors are readily available for point-of-care application,  said Shih.  The result is a remarkable sensitivity improvement, with a refractive index sensitivity increase from 207 nm/RIU to 578 nm/RIU.  Technically speaking, Shih has restored the electric field around nanodisks, providing accessibility to an otherwise buried enhanced electric field. Nanodisks are antibody-functionalized artificial nanostructures which help capture exosomes with molecular specificity.  We report radiatively coupled arrayed gold nanodisks on invisible substrate (AGNIS) as a label-free (no need for fluorescent labels), cost-effective, and high-performance platform for molecularly specific exosome biosensing. The AGNIS substrate has been fabricated by wafer-scale nanosphere lithography without the need for costly lithography,  said Shih.  This allows fast screening of the surface proteins of exosomes for diagnostics and biomarker discovery. As an example, Shih has shown that multiple surface antigens (CD9, CD63 & CD81) were more plentiful in cancer-derived exosomes than those from normal cells. Current exosome profiling relies primarily on DNA sequencing technology, fluorescent techniques such as flow cytometry, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which involves sophisticated sample preparation procedures and requires labeling and amplification, all processes that are labor-intensive and costly. Shih s goal is to amplify the signal by developing the label-free technique.  By decorating the gold nanodisks surface with different antibodies (e.g., CD9, CD63, and CD81), label-free exosome profiling has shown increased expression of all three surface proteins in cancer-derived exosomes,  said Shih.  The sensitivity for detecting exosomes is within 112-600 (exosomes/ L), which would be sufficient in many clinical applications. Reference: Misbah I, Ohannesian N, Qiao Y, Lin SH, Shih WC.
