The Green Super Rice project is supported by the Chinese government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and aims to increase the income of resource-limited rice producers by the development and wide-adoption of GSR varieties and corresponding crop management technology. The long-term goal of the project is to benefit at least 20 million resource-limited rice farmers and to boost rice productivity by 20% in the target countries. We are excited and very happy to see that the efforts of the rice community in the Green Super Rice project coming to fruition. The Green Super Rice project is the world s first rice project that is helping lead the scientific and breeding breakthroughs achieved by the efforts of the Chinese rice scientists to release elite cultivars suitable for growth in the target countries,  stated Professor Zhikang Li, project director of GSR, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.  We selected the Axiom genotyping platform fromAffymetrix due to the platform s capability to screen millions of markers and accurately transfer them to smaller 384HT format arrays. Such precision and fidelity is not available on any other genotyping platform.  The genotyping array, specifically designed for the Green Super Rice project, reflects an unprecedented effort by the rice community to leverage over 20 million SNP markers that were discovered in the 3000 Rice Genomes Project. This array uses a novel SNP genotyping marker screening process to screen more than 2 million selected rice SNP markers to identify relevant and valuable markers with high accuracy and precision. A subset of the 2 million markers identified on the rice screening genotyping array will be transferred with 100 percent accuracy onto the Axiom 384HT-format to create the new array. This new Axiom GSR Rice Array, consisting of approximately 55,000 markers, will enable ultra high-throughput processing and analysis of 384 samples simultaneously and will be used to screen thousands of samples in a highly cost-effective manner.  We are pleased to be able to support the goals of the Green Super Rice Project to help the rice community develop new varieties, address the needs of rice breeders, and to help achieve self-sustainable rice production and food security,  said Laurent Bellon, Ph.D., senior vice president and general manager, Genotyping Business Unit at Affymetrix.  The superior array design, bioinformatics and software capabilities available with the Axiom platform are playing a key role in advancing multiple agriculture projects around the world. Affymetrix is committed to meet the agricultural community s needs with advanced technologies that are practical, easy to use, and cost effective.  With Affymetrix  advanced bioinformatics and innovative design strategies, Axiom genotyping array designs routinely support genome-wide genotyping applications and accurately call the genotypes of both diploid and polyploid species.","Published: September 22, 2015"

Professor Susan Tett from the School of Pharmacy   one of three UQ schools involved in the study   said the results had particular relevance for Australia s older female population.  Use of PPIs in women aged 77 and over was associated with increased risk of poor bone health,  Professor Tett said.  Our study showed the most commonly prescribed PPI, esomeprazole, was associated with increased use of osteoporosis medication and fractures, as was rabeprazole. These are among the most prescribed medications worldwide, however there is growing concern regarding potential negative effects.  These findings foreshadow the need for more caution than the current widespread-prescription approach to PPIs.  The study included data from 4432 Australian participants, cross-referenced with medication information from a national pharmaceutical administrative database and fracture statistics from hospitals. UQ s School of Public Health and School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences representatives Dr Geeske Peeters, Professor Annette Dobson and Marielle van der Hoorn were co-authors of the study, which involved collaboration with resarchers from VU University in Amsterdam. Professor Tett said the problem could be having widespread impact on people s heath.  Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporotic fractures, PPI use could be having a notable effect on population health and health-related costs,  Professor Tett said.  PPI treatment is often continued without consideration for safeguards or tests to confirm it is still a suitable treatment.   Therefore we should be considering treatment-on-demand and step-down therapy more often.  In Australia, PPI prescription tripled between the years 2001 and 2005, and in 2014 there were 6.9 million prescriptions of the drug group nationwide. Further investigation is needed to establish if the results of the study also apply to men and populations of other age groups.","Published: September 22, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/targeting-dna-211162,Targeting DNA Protein based sensor could detect viral infection or kill cancer cells  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. MIT biological engineers have developed a modular system of proteins that can detect a particular DNA sequence in a cell and then trigger a specific response, such as cell death. This system can be customized to detect any DNA sequence in a mammalian cell and then trigger a desired response, including killing cancer cells or cells infected with a virus, the researchers say.  There is a range of applications for which this could be important,  says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT s Department of Biological Engineering and Institute of Medical Engineering and Science (IMES).  This allows you to readily design constructs that enable a programmed cell to both detect DNA and act on that detection, with a report system and/or a respond system.  Collins is the senior author of a Sept. 21 Nature Methods paper describing the technology, which is based on a type of DNA-binding proteins known as zinc fingers. These proteins can be designed to recognize any DNA sequence.  The technologies are out there to engineer proteins to bind to virtually any DNA sequence that you want,  says Shimyn Slomovic, an IMES postdoc and the paper s lead author.  This is used in many ways, but not so much for detection. We felt that there was a lot of potential in harnessing this designable DNA-binding technology for detection.  Sense and respond To create their new system, the researchers needed to link zinc fingers  DNA-binding capability with a consequence - either turning on a fluorescent protein to reveal that the target DNA is present or generating another type of action inside the cell. The researchers achieved this by exploiting a type of protein known as an  intein  - a short protein that can be inserted into a larger protein, splitting it into two pieces. The split protein pieces, known as  exteins,  only become functional once the intein removes itself while rejoining the two halves. Collins and Slomovic decided to divide an intein in two and then attach each portion to a split extein half and a zinc finger protein. The zinc finger proteins are engineered to recognize adjacent DNA sequences within the targeted gene, so if they both find their sequences, the inteins line up and are then cut out, allowing the extein halves to rejoin and form a functional protein. The extein protein is a transcription factor designed to turn on any gene the researchers want. In this paper, they linked green fluorescent protein (GFP) production to the zinc fingers  recognition of a DNA sequence from an adenovirus, so that any cell infected with this virus would glow green. This approach could be used not only to reveal infected cells, but also to kill them. To achieve this, the researchers could program the system to produce proteins that alert immune cells to fight the infection, instead of GFP.  Since this is modular, you can potentially evoke any response that you want,  Slomovic says.  You could program the cell to kill itself, or to secrete proteins that would allow the immune system to identify it as an enemy cell so the immune system would take care of it.  The MIT researchers also deployed this system to kill cells by linking detection of the DNA target to production of an enzyme called NTR. This enzyme activates a harmless drug precursor called CB 1954, which the researchers added to the petri dish where the cells were growing. When activated by NTR, CB 1954 kills the cells. Future versions of the system could be designed to bind to DNA sequences found in cancerous genes and then produce transcription factors that would activate the cells  own programmed cell death pathways. Research tool The researchers are now adapting this system to detect latent HIV proviruses, which remain dormant in some infected cells even after treatment. Learning more about such viruses could help scientists find ways to permanently eliminate them.  Latent HIV provirus is pretty much the final barrier to curing AIDS, which currently is incurable simply because the provirus sequence is there, dormant, and there aren t any ways to eradicate it,  Slomovic says. While treating diseases using this system is likely many years away, it could be used much sooner as a research tool, Collins says. For example, scientists could use it to test whether genetic material has been successfully delivered to cells that scientists are trying to genetically alter. Cells that did not receive the new gene could be induced to undergo cell death, creating a pure population of the desired cells. It could also be used to study chromosomal inversions and transpositions that occur in cancer cells, or to study the 3-D structure of normal chromosomes by testing whether two genes located far from each other on a chromosome fold in such a way that they end up next to each other, the researchers say.","Published: September 22, 2015"

The algorithm developed enables the identification of NASH patients that should be treated with Elafibranor (GFT505) or any other appropriate drug.  In terms of public health, the management of the NASH epidemic is a priority. However, NASH is currently under-diagnosed since: i) NASH is a silent, asymptomatic disease, ii) NASH diagnosis necessitates an invasive procedure, the liver biopsy, that can only be performed by an experienced person, iii) there is currently no approved medicine for this indication.  The efficient management of the NASH patient population thus requires new, non-invasive, diagnostic tools, that are simple, rapid, reliable, and can be widely distributed, in order to screen and detect NASH patients that should be treated.  GENFIT has launched an R&D initiative in the field of NASH diagnosis biomarkers based on its expertise in transcriptomics applied to small circulating non-coding RNAs, in particular miRNA.  GENFIT has constituted a large bank of plasma samples from NASH patients with a liver biopsy. This patient cohort is extremely well-characterized (complete anthropometric and biochemical data, centralized biopsy reading), and covers a wide spectrum of NASH disease activity and severity.  After developing and validating a reliable method for the systematic measurement of different miRNAs in the plasma, GENFIT has introduced these measurements into the data set and challenged their diagnostic values versus over 70 variables using two independent biostatistical approaches. Two methods were used to generate thousands of cohorts from the initial patient population in order to mimic real-life NASH variability and assure the translatability of the results to the global NAFLD/NASH population. These parallel approaches independently identified the same two specific miRNA species within the top 3 most powerful diagnostic markers of NASH. The two resulting algorithms combine the identified miRNAs and known markers of liver damage. A comparative study demonstrates that these algorithms are more powerful than existing scoring systems for the identification of NASH patients that deserve to be treated. New patent applications have been filed for the use of the technologies developed by GENFIT for the diagnosis of NASH.  A new proprietary diagnostic tool will be used in the Phase 3 trial for Elafibranor. Moreover, GENFIT has established international scientific collaborations to widen its use in multiple cohorts of NASH patients. Finally, GENFIT is open to partnerships with NASH and/or diagnostic stakeholder companies with the objective of providing an FDA/EMA-approved NASH diagnosis kit available at the time of drug commercialization.  Jean-Fran ois Mouney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT, declared:  For several years now, GENFIT has established an integrated R&D strategy in NASH based on the parallel development of a non-invasive diagnostic test and on the development of Elafibranor as a first-line medicine. After the recent demonstration of the efficacy of Elafibranor for NASH treatment, today we are announcing a new success in the NASH diagnostics field. We are thus ideally positioned to meet the future medical and public health challenges linked to the identification and management of millions of NASH patients. Professor Arun Sanyal, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA, commented:  Circulating miRNAs undeniably represent a new research domain for the development of novel diagnostic methods in numerous chronic diseases and cancers. GENFIT s algorithmic approach combining the levels of specific miRNAs with other known markers of liver damage is extremely promising. The results provide the proof of the added value of miRNAs as diagnostic markers in NASH. They open the way to the development of a new type of non-invasive diagnostic test for NASH.","Published: September 22, 2015"

The awards are for three years each, and total approximately $13 million, pending the availability of funds. They are administered by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute, both parts of NIH. Comparing the genomes of many people suggests that there are tens of millions of genetic variants, or DNA spelling differences. For the last decade, scientists have used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to find regions of the genome associated with diseases and traits. In GWAS, the genomes of thousands of people with and without a disease are compared to find the genomic regions containing variants that affect disease risk. Although GWAS may find hundreds of variants that appear to be associated with a disease, it remains a challenge to find out which variants actually have a role in the disease process, and what that role might be.  Before we can understand how a variant or gene functionally contributes to a disease   and then develop prevention and therapeutic strategies   we have to identify which genes and variants actually are involved in raising the risk,  said Lisa Brooks, Ph.D., program director of the NHGRI Genetic Variation Program.  We are looking for approaches that can find the causal variants out of the many variants associated with a disease, or at least narrow down the set.  Most variants, including many that contribute to disease risk, response to drugs, and traits such as height, are in genomic regions that do not code for proteins. These variants usually affect the regulation of genes, residing within  switches  in the genome that determine when and where proteins are made.  We know a great deal about the protein-coding genes and what they do,  said Mike Pazin, Ph.D., program director in the NHGRI Functional Genomics Program.  For variants sitting outside the coding regions, it is difficult to know which parts of the genome they affect, let alone how the variants cause differences in function. However, we know that 90 percent of associated variants found in GWAS are outside of the protein-coding areas. Eventually, we want to understand mechanistically how the variants function in regulating genes, and how differences in the way they function affect disease risk.  The researchers are developing computational approaches to combine many different sets of data to identify disease-causing variants or narrow down the set of candidate variants. They will use data from experiments to determine the accuracy of the computational predictions.","Published: September 22, 2015"

Patients either received text message reminders, an electronic medication monitor, both, or no reminders for their six month treatment period. Patients receiving no reminders missed taking 29.9% of their medication doses and patients receiving text messages missed 27.3% of their doses. However, patients with an electronic medication monitor box   which beeped if not opened at the agreed time   only missed 17% of their medication doses. Patients who received both text messages and an electronic medication monitor missed just 13.9% of medication doses.  According to the World Health Organization, China has the world s second largest number of TB cases, accounting for 11% of the estimated 9 million global cases.  TB treatment usually lasts for six months and is effective if taken fully, but patients missing drug treatment doses is a major problem. This increases the risk of having a relapse of TB and also TB becoming drug resistant, making the disease more difficult to treat and potentially fatal.  Senior author Dr Katherine Fielding of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said:  Global plans to reduce TB advise that treatment be taken under the direct observation of a healthcare worker to reduce missed doses, something which has been difficult to carry out in many parts of China, particularly in rural areas, as in other parts of world. Innovative approaches are needed to tackle this problem.  Our study is the first large-scale randomised trial to carefully evaluate whether electronic reminders can help patents to take their tuberculosis treatment on their own. Our findings show real promise. A low-cost, reliable electronic medication monitor could improve TB treatment for thousands of people across China.  Project investigator Dr Shiwen Jiang of the National Center for Tuberculosis Control and Prevention, added:  Directly observed therapy is difficult to implement in China due to limited human resources, poor acceptance and other factors. Our study aimed to assess whether the use of the medication monitor and/or text messaging can improve adherence to TB drugs. Our results are encouraging. We are currently planning a further evaluation of a management model including the use the medication monitor on long-term TB outcomes including TB recurrence. China plans to scale up the use of medication monitors in some provinces in the next five years. ","Published: September 22, 2015"

Many traditional assessment strategies in medical education rely on tabulating learners' scores in order to obtain grades,  says Dr. Szulewski.  In the real world, medical learners are faced with the need to make many decisions in a short time period, which increases their cognitive load and puts a strain on working memory. We have shown that we can now measure cognitive load in an unobtrusive way during medical assessments.  For the study, Dr. Szulewski recruited 10 novice medicine trainees and 10 trained physicians and outfitted them with eye-tracking glasses to assess changes in pupil diameter during a test. Changes in pupil size correlate with changes in cognitive processing demands. It was revealed novices expend more mental effort than experts when answering medical questions   which is true even when both the novices and the experts answer the same question correctly.  These results are preliminary still, but have implications for optimal assessment strategies in medical testing,  says Dr. Szulewski.  This is especially true in the new era of competency-based medical education where trainees are required to demonstrate competence in particular skills before they move forward in their training.  Dr. Szulewski is continuing his research and evaluating cognitive load and expert versus novice performance in simulated as well as real world resuscitation scenarios.

The body controls food intake by balancing a need for food to survive with a desire for food for pleasure. By shifting the balance between these systems, defective brain signaling can cause pleasure to take over, resulting in overeating and obesity. The researchers, from the Neuroscience Program in Substance Abuse (N-PISA) at Vanderbilt University, USA, say understanding the mechanisms behind overeating could help prevent it and reduce the incidence of obesity. ""We have always been struck by how much animals - and even people - will over-consume tasty high-fat foods, even though they might be technically feeling full,"" said Dr. Aurelio Galli, one of the authors of the study. ""A high fat diet causes people to eat more, which ultimately impairs the ability of obese people to successfully control their caloric intake, lose weight and maintain weight loss. We have conducted several studies trying to understand why a high fat diet has this effect."" Worldwide, obesity has more than doubled since 1980. Today around two billion people are overweight, and 600 million of these are obese. A number of factors contribute to the obesity epidemic, including economic stresses, changes in the built environment and changing food trends. Biologically, obesity is the result of defects in the central nervous system that mean the body can't match its energy intake through food with its energy expenditure. The amount we eat is controlled by survival and reward (hedonic eating) the body's metabolism and our pleasure senses, like taste and smell. When specific signals in the brain are impaired, these two systems can fall out of balance, resulting in overeating. The new study reveals a novel mechanism behind overeating high fat foods for pleasure. A specific signaling pathway in brain cells that control motivation, movement and attention determines the amount of high fat foods consumed. When the signaling is defective, the person only overeats high fat foods. ""We distilled the neurobiological mechanisms involved specifically in overeating for fat,"" said Dr. Kevin Niswender, one of the authors of the study. ""We defined the why, where, and how of 'hedonic' obesity and found that disrupting a specific signaling pathway in the brain can lead to overeating specifically food high in fat."" The researchers studied one particular signaling pathway in the brain - insulin signaling - and the way it works in specific brain cell circuits. Defects in insulin signaling can override the body's natural homeostatic mechanisms in favor of the reward mechanisms, leading to obesity. Rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a group of proteins involved in insulin signaling in the brain. The researchers wanted to find out how insulin signaling and mTORC2 affect how rewarding high fat foods are. They genetically altered brain cells in mice by taking out a part of mTORC2 and found that the mice without a functioning mTORC2 ate high-fat food excessively. However, when provided only with low-fat food they did not overeat. Furthermore, they found that the mice whose mTORC2 does not function also had less dopamine in specific regions of the brain. Lower dopamine transmission in brain cells is associated with obesity in humans and animals, and also in escalating substance abuse. ""Our findings reveal a system that is designed to control eating of rewarding foods that are high in fat and possibly sugar,"" said Dr. Galli. ""This system can be hijacked by the very foods that it is designed to control. Eating a high-fat or high-carbohydrate diet feels rewarding, but also appears to cause changes in the brain areas that are involved in controlling eating, by causing for example insulin resistance. Our study shows that when specific signaling in these areas of the brain is disrupted, it leads to a vicious cycle of increasing, escalating high-fat diet intake that likely further cements changes in these brain areas."" The researchers now plan to find out whether the effect of disrupting the signaling system works.

But a new study has shown that there are circumstances under which the opposite is true for small children: they can remember a piece of information better days later than they can on the day they first learned it. While playing a video game that asked them to remember associations between objects, 4- and 5-year-olds who re-played the game after a two-day delay scored more than 20 percent higher than kids who re-played it later the same day. ""An implication is that kids can be smarter than we necessarily thought they could be,"" said Kevin Darby, a doctoral student in psychology at The Ohio State University and co-author of the study. ""They can make complex associations, they just need more time to do it."" The study, which will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Psychological Science, is the first to document two different but related cognitive phenomena simultaneously: so-called ""extreme forgetting"" -- when kids learn two similar things in rapid succession, and the second thing causes them to forget the first -- and delayed remembering -- when they can recall the previously forgotten information days later. The findings ""give us a window into understanding memory and, in particular, the issue of encoding new information into memory,"" said lead study author Vladimir Sloutsky, professor of psychology at Ohio State and director of the university's Cognitive Development Lab. ""First, we showed that if children are given pieces of similar information in close proximity, the different pieces interfere with each other, and there is almost complete elimination of memory,"" Sloutsky said. ""Second, we showed that introducing delays eliminates this interference."" ""It seems surprising that children can almost completely forget what they just learned, but then their memories can actually improve with time."" The study involved 82 4- and 5-year-olds from central Ohio preschools. The kids played a picture association game on a computer three separate times. The first time, they were shown pairs of objects, such as a baseball cap and a rabbit, and told whether the pairs belonged to Mickey Mouse or Winnie the Pooh. To win the game, they had to match the pairs with the correct owner. Kids learned the associations fairly easily. At the start of the game, they were scoring an average of 60 percent, but by the end of the game their average scores had risen to around 90 percent. The kids then played the game again immediately after, but the researchers scrambled the pairs belonging to Mickey and Pooh, so that the kids had to learn a completely new set of associations with the exact same objects. Again, the kids started out scoring around 60 percent, and ended around 90 percent -- scores that proved they were able to learn the new picture associations. The researchers wanted to test whether learning the new associations in the second game caused the kids to forget what they learned in the first game, so they had half of the kids play one more time the same day. For this last game, the researchers brought back the original pair associations from the first game. And it seemed that the kids did indeed experience extreme forgetting. They began the third game scoring around 60 percent, and ended scoring around 90 percent -- as if they were learning the same information all over again from scratch. The other half of the kids didn't play the third game until two days later. Darby explained why. ""We know from previous research that kids struggle to form complex associations in the moment, so we thought that with some time off and periods of sleep they might be able to do better,"" he said. ""And it turned out that when they had time to absorb the information, they did better."" A lot better, actually: Kids who had a two-day break began the game with an average score of nearly 85 percent, and finished with a score just above 90 percent. Their final scores were similar, but they remembered enough to start out with a 25-point advantage over kids who didn't get a two-day break. Sloutsky said that, for kids, learning the pair associations is analogous to learning things like rules, schedules, or arrangements. For example, a child may have to remember that on Saturdays she can use the scooter and her brother plays video games, but on Sunday she plays video games and her brother uses the scooter. The study suggests that kids may have difficulty remembering such things in the moment, but given a few days to absorb the new information, they can remember it later. Sloutsky cautioned that the study does not in any way suggest that kids can absorb adult-sized quantities of information if only they are given time to sleep on it. Rather, it means that they can absorb kid-sized quantities of information given time, even if they seem to forget in the moment. ""We've shown that it's possible for children's memories to improve with time, but it's not like we uncovered a method for super-charging how much they can remember,"" he said. ""The takeaway message is that kids can experience extreme forgetting, and the counter-intuitive way to fight it is to let time pass.""

He also thanked the Committee for their recommendations on policy issues and welcomed the opportunity to review them. NIH plans to move quickly to build the infrastructure so that participants can begin enrolling in the cohort in 2016, with a goal of enrolling at least 1 million participants in three to four years.  We have an incredible opportunity to advance research and make new medical breakthroughs through precision medicine, which tailors disease prevention and treatment to individuals based on genetics, environment and lifestyle,  said Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell. In order to advance this approach to medicine, President Obama proposed the Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to enable a new era of medicine through research, technology and policies that empower patients, researchers and providers to work together toward development of individualized care. The Initiative includes many components with efforts from across the federal government and was budgeted at $215 million in fiscal year 2016 by the President. NIH will lead efforts in cancer genomics, as well as the development of the participant cohort. Of the total proposed in FY16, $130 million was allocated to NIH to build the research cohort. Dr. Collins established the Precision Medicine Initiative Working Group of his ACD and tasked the group to develop a plan for creating and managing a large research cohort, with data and specimens that can be accessed by all researchers, for studies to understand the variables that contribute to health and disease, with the ultimate goal of developing more effective treatments tailored to individuals. The report drafted by the working group makes numerous recommendations on cohort assembly, participant engagement, data, biological specimens, policy and governance. The recommendations are based on a set of high-value scientific opportunities that were identified by the working group following extensive stakeholder engagement, including four public workshops and two requests for information. Among the scientific opportunities presented by this cohort is the ability to:   develop quantitative estimates of risk for a range of diseases by integrating environmental exposures, genetic factors and gene-environment interactions;   identify the causes of individual variation in response to commonly used therapeutics (commonly referred to as pharmacogenomics);   discover biological markers that signal increased or decreased risk of developing common diseases;   use mobile health (mHealth) technologies to correlate activity, physiological measures and environmental exposures with health outcomes;   develop new disease classifications and relationships;   empower study participants with data and information to improve their own health; and   create a platform to enable trials of targeted therapies.  Many factors have converged to make now the right time to begin this ambitious project,  said Dr. Collins.  Americans are engaging in improving their health and participating in health research more than ever before, electronic health records have been widely adopted, genomic analysis costs have dropped significantly, data science has become increasingly sophisticated and health technologies have become mobile. We have to seize this moment to invest in these promising scientific opportunities to help Americans live healthier lives. ","Published: September 21, 2015"

A recently published study  provides the first comprehensive view of how cellular proteins age in different organs, revealing major differences between the liver and brain in young and old rats. The findings suggest that how an organ ages may depend on its unique cellular properties and its physiological function in the body.  Our study showed that organs have different aging mechanisms and that aging is largely driven by changes in protein production and turnover,  says co-senior author Martin Hetzer, Salk professor and holder of the Jesse and Caryl Philips Foundation Chair.  Changes that occur in aging can be diverse and difficult to pin down, and looking simply at one parameter might result in not seeing the whole picture,  says co-first author Brandon Toyama, Salk research associate. However, harnessing the power of several state-of-the-art technologies has let the group see age-dependent changes that could not be seen before. The result, according to Toyama, is  a rich resource that should stimulate the generation of new experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a better understanding of aging on the organism level.  Aging causes the progressive deterioration in the function of organs, as well as the functions of cells and proteins within them. Past studies have shown that the activity level of genes also changes with age, with most genes showing similar changes in expression across organs. However, a recent large-scale study showed that the vast majority of proteins across different organs don t change in abundance during aging. These findings have left it unclear how aging affects cellular proteins and whether age-related changes that affect proteins differ across organs. To answer these questions, Toyama and Hetzer, along with co-first author Alessandro Ori of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), and senior authors Nicholas Ingolia of the University of California, Berkeley and Martin Beck of EMBL took an integrated  omics  approach instead of focusing on one isolated aspect of gene expression as in past studies. The combination of genomics and proteomics allowed them to simultaneously analyze changes in transcription, translation, protein levels, alternative splicing and protein phosphorylation to gain a comprehensive and quantitative view of protein differences in the liver and brain of young and old rats. They identified 468 differences in protein abundance between young and old animals, mainly due to changes in protein synthesis. Another set of 130 proteins showed age-related changes in their location within cells, phosphorylation state, or splice form changes expected to affect the activity level or function of the proteins.  Our work significantly expands the list of proteins that are affected by chronological age in mammals,  Beck says.  In most cases, individual datasets would not have been sufficient to extrapolate these networks, highlighting the complexity of the effects of chronological age on the proteome and the benefits of our integrative approach.  Strikingly, most of these age-related protein differences were specific to one organ. The protein aging patterns seem to relate to the organ s specific cellular properties or function. Because cells in the liver are frequently replaced throughout adulthood, this organ has ample opportunity to replenish its proteins. By contrast, most neurons in the adult brain are non-dividing cells that must survive for an organism s entire lifetime, so the longer-lived proteins in the brain are more vulnerable to the accumulation of damage and loss of function over time. As a result, a larger fraction of proteins was affected by aging in the brain compared to the liver. In the brain, aging altered proteins involved in neuronal plasticity and memory formation, whereas several metabolic networks were altered in the liver.  Based on our findings, we would define aging as an organ-specific deterioration of the cellular proteome,  says Hetzer. In future studies, the researchers will analyze other organs such as the heart to further examine the general and organ-specific effects of aging, and investigate how and why these changes occur.  We expect these organs to have specific aging signatures, like the brain and liver,  Hetzer says.  An interesting open question is whether one organ can affect the aging of another organ, that is, is aging sensed at the organismal level? Answering this question would give us a more comprehensive understanding of the aging process and how it relates to disease.  The researchers will also study how aging differs across individuals to determine the role of genetic variability.  This research may shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying age-related diseases, enabling the identification of risk factors to predict which individuals are most susceptible based on their genetic makeup,  Beck says.  In the end, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging could lead to the development of novel therapies to prevent or treat a range of age-related diseases.

The work carried out at the Crick will be for research purposes and will not have a clinical application. However, the knowledge acquired from the research will be very important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops. This knowledge may improve embryo development after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and might provide better clinical treatments for infertility. Dr Niakan said: ""To provide further fundamental insights into early human development we are proposing to test the function of genes using gene editing and transfection approaches that are currently permitted under the HFE Act 2008. We also propose to use new methods based on CRIPSR/Cas9, which allows very specific alterations to be made to the genome. By applying more precise and efficient methods in our research we hope to require fewer embryos and be more successful than the other methods currently used. ""Importantly, in line with HFEA regulations, any donated embryos would be used for research purposes only. These embryos would be donated by informed consent and surplus to IVF treatment.""  Genome editing has been used in research for a number of years but recent advances and the introduction of the CRISPR-Cas9 system mean that work can be done in a more precise way than before.

But how do these ""germ cells"" form, and how do they pass genetic traits from one generation to the next? Researchers working at Kyoto University have created a lab-based human germ cell development model that should shed light on these basic questions. The hope is that their accomplishment may lead to a molecular-level understanding of conditions such as infertility. The underlying mechanisms of early germ cell development in humans have remained unclear because of a lack of robust experimental methods, as well as inherent difficulties with studying human embryos. In a promising breakthrough the research team has recreated human germ cell development in the laboratory, revealing specific key elements and events that occur at the beginning of human life.""When I read about his work I knew I had to come back [to Japan"", said co-first author Kotaro Sasaki, referring to lead researcher Mitinori Saitou's previous work in the field. Sasaki, who had established a pathology career in the United States, returned to join Saitou's team in Kyoto. For this study, five laboratories at the university's Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA) collaborated. To date, most such research has been restricted to mice. While this work provides useful information that is generally applicable to mammals, there has still been a lack of information specific to humans. To that end, Saitou's team recreated the developmental process of human germ cells, which gives rise to reproductive sperm and eggs. In addition to illustrating key transcription interactions and signaling events, the scientists gained insight into how epigenetic marks -- traits that are inherited without changes to the DNA sequence -- are ""erased"" at the beginning of germ cell development. ""We demonstrated the early events in human germ cell development,"" explains Sasaki. ""Our work should provide a basis to gain a better understanding of how certain disorders such as infertility and growth impairment come about."" The team's model, still in its early stages, is hoped to form a foundation for continuing studies on germ cell lineage.

GLP-1 agonists are a group of injectible drugs usually prescribed to patients who have not been able to bring their condition under control through lifestyle changes. They are designed to regulate blood sugar levels both by stimulating the release of the hormone insulin which naturally controls levels. They also work by inhibiting glucagon, a peptide which raises the concentration of glucose, or sugar, in the bloodstream. But the study found one such treatment had the unrecognised potential to activate receptor sites for glucagon - promoting the release of sugars into the blood. Dr Graham Ladds, from St John's College, said the results point to a lack of knowledge about the impact of the GLP1 treatments. He said: ""What we have shown is that we need a more complete understanding of how anti-diabetic drugs interact with receptors in different parts of our bodies. ""GLP-1 agonists clearly benefit many patients with Type 2 diabetes and there is no reason to presume that our findings outweigh those benefits. ""Understanding that picture, and being able to consider all the components of target cells for such treatments, is vital if we want to design drugs that have therapeutic benefits for diabetes patients, without any unwanted side effects."" The team, from Cambridge and Warwick universities, carried out a series of lab based tests on yeast and mammalian cell culture containing glucagon and found that it was activated by GLP-1 agonists. Dr Ladds added: ""The work shows that, contrary to our previous assumptions, glucagon receptors can potentially be activated by anti-diabetic treatments."" Current GLP-1 agonists available in the UK include Bydureon, Byetta and Victoza. People with diabetes suffer from high blood sugar levels caused by their bodies not producing enough insulin, the hormone that enables the uptake of sugar from food.

Plants rely on structures called chloroplasts within their cells to carry out photosynthesis   the process used to capture energy from sunlight by converting carbon dioxide from the air into sugars. During times of stress such as drought, though, the same reaction can also generate substances known as reactive oxygen species, which are toxic to plants and cause them to become damaged or even die. The development of chloroplasts is controlled by the presence of a gene known as SP1, which governs the passage of the proteins involved in photosynthesis through the chloroplast s outer membrane. Professor Paul Jarvis, from the Oxford University s Department of Plant Sciences, suspected that the gene might use this ability to help plants survive in hostile conditions. 'With the human population growing rapidly, increasing pressure on natural resources and the threat of climate change, it s more essential than ever to develop crops that can survive sub-optimal growing conditions,' explains Professor Jarvis. 'We wanted to find out if SP1 helped plants to remain healthy by limiting the production of the toxic compounds made during photosynthesis in harsh conditions.' A team of researchers led by Professor Jarvis has now carried out experiments to investigate the idea. The group worked with three versions of a cress plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana: the naturally occurring wild type, a mutant plant lacking SP1, and an engineered plant that over-expressed SP1. In separate experiments, the three types of plant were exposed to different stressful conditions: high salt concentrations, drought, and the herbicide paraquat, which stimulates production of the toxic reactive oxygen compounds. In each case, the mutant plants that lacked SP1 failed to develop. Meanwhile, the SP1 overexpressors were more tolerant of the conditions than the normal plants. These results indicated that SP1 was responsible for the resilience. The researchers then tested the plants for the build-up of hydrogen peroxide   a common reactive oxygen species produced during photosynthesis in stressful conditions. The team found high levels of hydrogen peroxide in the mutant plants but low levels in the normal plants and even less in the SP1 overexpressors 'In fact, the overexpressors were indistinguishable from healthy, unstressed control plants,' explains Professor Jarvis. 'The production of the toxic compounds was reduced to a background level   it was as if the plants were not experiencing stress at all, instead of struggling to survive like the others.' Another set of experiments was carried out to establish how SP1 works at a molecular level. The team found that the movement of proteins used in photosynthesis into the chloroplast was significantly reduced in the overexpressors. That demonstrated that SP1 reduces the production of toxic compounds by limiting photosynthesis in times of stress, making plants less likely to suffer serious or fatal damage. The discovery that SP1 helps plants cope with adverse conditions like drought and high salt concentrations suggests that it should be possible to create crops that can grow more easily in harsh environments. 'All plants have the SP1 gene,' explains Professor Jarvis. 'Now it s just a question of getting plants to over-express it so that they can survive in adverse conditions.' The team is now working with wheat, rice, tomatoes and brassicas in order to establish if their findings can be used in a wider variety of plants. 'We expect the gene to behave the same way in crops like wheat as it does in cress,' explains Professor Paul Jarvis. 'We hope that this kind of SP1 technology will be used to improve crop performance around the world.'","Published: September 21, 2015"

Postdoctoral fellow Brian Altman, PhD, and doctoral student Annie Hsieh, MD, both from the lab of senior author Chi Van Dang, MD, PhD, director of the Abramson Cancer Center, study body clock proteins associated with cancer cells. The researchers found that MYC may affect circadian rhythm and metabolism by promiscuously binding to promoter regions in key genes for maintaining these daily cycles. Co-first authors Altman and Hsieh, Dang and colleagues report their results online.    Our data suggest that MYC-driven cancers have altered circadian oscillation due to upregulation in another clock protein called REV-ERB , and that these Myc cancers may be good candidates for chronotherapy,  Altman said.  This work ties together the study of cell metabolism and cancer chronotherapy   If cells don t have to  rest,  they may replicate all the time, with no breaks at all.  Cancer chronotherapy is based on the concept that the right time of treatment during the day could decrease side effects to normal cells while killing cancer cells.Understanding these basic mechanisms should lead to better cancer treatment strategies that reduce side effects and increase effectiveness  Hsieh said. The team found that MYC is a double-duty protein. In addition to its role in metabolic pathways, MYC also works directly on damping BMAL1 in its tumor-suppressor role via spurring increased REV-ERB  activity. Essentially MYC suppresses a suppressor -- BMAL1. In the current paper, knowing that MYC, a transcription factor that binds the genome through sites that are identical to the binding sites of BMAL1, the team hypothesized that aberrant MYC expression perturbs the clock by deregulating components of the circadian network in cancer cells. They found that deregulated expression of MYC disrupts the molecular clock in cell lines by directly inducing REV-ERB  to dampen expression and oscillation of BMAL1. What s more, the disrupted circadian oscillations in the MYC-expressing cancer cells could be partially rescued by inhibiting expression of REV-ERB .  We thought that some cancer cells  metabolites oscillate and some don t, but we had not tested it,  Altman recalled. To address these questions, Dang, Altman, and Hsieh collaborated with Penn colleague, Aalim Weljie, PhD, research assistant professor of Pharmacology, using an osteosarcoma cancer cell line to study the interaction of MYC and metabolism in cancer cells. The glucose pathway in this cell line oscillates normally. However, when they increased MYC, the oscillations vanished and glucose was taken up at a much great rate.  This led us to better understand how and why cancer cells efficiently hijack the cell s energetics machinery to be able to keep up rapid replication,  Hsieh said. Knowing that cancer cells have a different metabolic profile, the team surmises that this can inform when to treat cancer -- when normal cells are quiet -- to decrease toxicity, while increasing efficacy against the always-awake cancer cell.  Our results demonstrate an unsuspected link between the cancer-causing abilities of some cells and abnormal circadian and metabolic rhythms, which we surmise to be advantageous for cancer,  Dang said.","Published: September 21, 2015"

These building blocks of life are constantly changing. They can spontaneously express different proteins and genes, change shape and size, die or resist dying, or become damaged and cancerous. Even within a population of the same type of cell, there is immense random variability between cells' structures, levels of protein expression, and sizes. ""High dimensionality and noise are inherent properties of large intracellular networks,"" said Adilson E. Motter, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Physics and Astronomy in Northwestern University's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. ""Both have long been regarded as obstacles to the rational control of cellular behavior.""Motter and his collaborators at Northwestern have challenged and redefined this long-held belief. Using a newly-developed computational algorithm, they showed that this randomness within and among cells, called ""noise,"" can be manipulated to control the networks that govern the workings of living cells -- promoting cellular health and potentially alleviating diseases such as cancer. Supported by the National Cancer Institute Physical Science-Oncology Center at Northwestern and the National Science Foundation, Motter and William L. Kath, professor of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics, are coauthors of the paper. Daniel K.Wells, a graduate student in applied math, is the paper's first author. ""Noise refers to the random aspects of cell behavior, especially gene regulation,"" Wells said. ""Gene regulation is not like a train station, where gene expression-regulating proteins are shipped in at regular intervals, turn a gene on or off, and then are shipped out. Instead, gene expression is constantly, and randomly, being modified."" By leveraging noise, the team found that the high-dimensional gene regulatory dynamics could be controlled instead by controlling a much smaller and simpler network, termed a ""network of state transitions."" In this network cells randomly transition from one phenotypic state to another -- sometimes from states representing healthy cell phenotypes to unhealthy states where the conditions are potentially cancerous. The transition paths between these states can be predicted, as cells making the same transition will typically travel along similar paths in their gene expression. The team compares this phenomenon to the formation of pathways at a university campus. If there is no paved path between a pair of buildings, people will usually taken the path that is the easiest to traverse, tromping down the grass to reveal the dirt beneath. Eventually, campus planners may see this pre-defined path and pave it. Similarly, upon initially analyzing a gene regulatory network the team first used noise to define the most-likely transition pathway between different system states, and connected these paths into the network of state transitions. By doing so the researchers could then focus on just one path between any two states, distilling a multi-dimensional system to a series of one-dimensional interconnecting paths. ""Even in systems as complex and high-dimensional as a gene regulatory network, there's typically only one best path that a noisy transition will follow from one state to the next,"" Kath said. ""You would think that many different paths are possible, but that's not true: one path is much better than all of the others."" The team then developed a computational approach that can identify optimal modifications of experimentally-adjustable parameters, such as protein activation rates, to encourage desired transitions between different states. The method is ideal for experimental implementations because it changes the system's response to noise rather than changing the noise itself, which is nearly impossible to control. ""Noise is extremely important for systems,"" Wells said. ""Instead of directly controlling a cell to move from a bad state to a good state, which is hard, we just make it easier for noise to do this on its own. This is analogous to paving just one path departing a building and leaving all the others unpaved--people leaving the building are more likely to walk on the paved path, and will thus preferentially end up where that path goes."" Though the current research is theoretical and focuses on biological networks, the team posits that this strategy could be used for other complex networks where noise is present, like in food webs and power grids, and could potentially be used to prevent sudden transitions in these systems, which lead to ecosystem collapses and power grid failures.","Published: September 21, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/repairing-the-brain-207211,Repairing the Brain Two genes unlock potential for treatment of schizophrenia  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Research led by scientists from Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore (Duke-NUS) has linked the abnormal behaviour of two genes (BDNF and DTNBP1) to the underlying cause of schizophrenia. These findings have provided a new target for schizophrenia treatment. Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder that affects nearly 1% of the total human population. The dominant cause of the disorder lies in impaired brain development that eventually leads to imbalanced signals within the brain. This imbalance within the brain is thought to cause hallucinations and paranoia in people with schizophrenia. ""We wanted to understand the mechanism by which the brain circuit operates,"" explained senior author Assistant Professor Shawn Je, from the Neuroscience and Behavioural Disorders Programme at Duke-NUS. ""In particular, we wanted to understand the ability of a specific type of cell in the brain, termed interneurons, to modulate brain network activity to maintain a balance in brain signalling.""Dr. Je and his team analysed signalling activity in neuronal cultures that either did not have the DTNBP1 gene or had lowered levels of the gene, because reduced DTNBP1 levels and genetic disruptions of DTNBP1 in mice resulted in schizophrenia-like behaviours. Using multiple model systems, they found that the low levels of DTNBP1 resulted in dysfunctional interneurons and over-activated neuronal network activity. Reducing levels of DTNBP1 also lowered the levels of the secreted protein molecule, BDNF. BDNF was then shown to be one of the most important factors that regulate the development of a normal brain circuit. It plays an important role in the interneurons ability to connect to the brain. Interneurons receive BDNF via a transport system run by DTNBP1. This can be likened to the delivery of a parcel: DTNBP1 is the driver of the delivery van and without the driver, the parcel BDNF cannot be delivered to the required destination. Without BDNF, the abnormal circuit development and brain network activity observed in schizophrenia patients results. Additionally, Dr. Je and his team also found that when BDNF levels were restored, brain development and activity were rescued and returned to more normal levels, despite the absence of DTNBP1. While the two genes DTNBP1 and BDNF have been singled out as risk genes for schizophrenia in studies before, this is the first study to show that the two function together. Pinpointing the importance of the abnormal delivery of BDNF has shed considerable insight into how the brain network develops. It also presents possibilities for potential treatments for schizophrenia designed around enhancing BDNF levels. In a follow-up study, Dr. Je plans to test if these findings are viable in an animal model. If proven successful, this could mean that correcting the imbalance within the brain circuits of schizophrenia patients may bring us closer to producing a treatment.","Published: September 21, 2015"

Now, University at Buffalo researchers and their colleagues at other institutions are publishing a paper about a new method they developed to more precisely capture how brain cells interact. The work was led by scientists at UB s Hunter James Kelly Research Institute (HJKRI) who conduct research to better understand myelin, the fatty insulator that enables communication between nerve cells. The researchers study how damage to myelin occurs, and how that damage may be repaired. The institute, part of UB s New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, was established in 1997 by Buffalo Bills Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly and his wife Jill after their infant son Hunter, was diagnosed with Krabbe Leukodystrophy, an inherited fatal disorder. He died in 2005 at the age of 8.The researchers explained that cellular interactions that trigger the production of myelin are especially hard to pinpoint. That s because the crucial point of contact between two types of cells   the connection between axons, along which nerve impulses travel, and glial cells, which support neurons   is essentially hidden.  Myelin is made by a glial cell wrapping around an axon cell,  explained M. Laura Feltri, MD, senior author on the paper and an HJKRI researcher and professor of biochemistry and neurology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB.  To study myelin, you really need to study both cells. The glial cell wraps like a spiral around the axon, so every time you try to study the region of contact between the two cells, you end up studying the whole combination. It s very hard to look just at the interface.  And studying this interface is critical in certain diseases, she added.  In Krabbe s, for example, the problem is not just that there isn t sufficient myelin, but that the glial cell is not providing proper support to the neuron. But to figure out exactly what s going wrong, we needed a better way to study that interface.  The new technique for achieving this involves using the second cell (the neuron) as a trigger to attract the first cell (the glial cell). The researchers use a system with two chambers, separated by a membrane.  When the cells in the upper chamber  recognize  the cells in the bottom chamber, they kind of  reach  through the holes in the membrane for each other and touch. That is the intersection that we can then isolate and study,  Feltri explained. Using this technique, the researchers discovered novel proteins at that intersection called prohibitins, which, they found, are necessary for the production of myelin. The discovery will help improve the understanding of and development of new treatments for myelin diseases. It also will make it easier to study all kinds of cellular interactions, not just those in the brain.  Using this method, we can isolate the portion of a cell that comes in contact with another cell, and analyze all the proteins that are present only in this subcellular fraction,  Feltri explained.  It s provides a glimpse into the social life of cells.   This work has important implications for diseases of myelin such as Krabbe disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases, because the communication between glial cells and neurons is vital for neuroprotection,  she said. Yannick Poitelon, PhD, postdoctoral research scientist at HJKRI and first author of the paper, explained that glial cells support neurons metabolically and protect axons that can measure up to one meter in length, extending far away from the glial cell.  This has profound implications for glial disease like Krabbe s, Charcot-Marie Tooth, peripheral neuropathies or Multiple Sclerosis, because the dysfunction of glial cells end up impairing the interactions with neurons, which as a result suffer and degenerate causing devastating clinical symptoms,  said Poitelon.  Similarly, neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington s disease or Lou Gehrig's, that were considered uniquely diseases of neurons in the past, are now considered diseases of cellular communications between neurons and glial cells.

The new study shows that this crosstalk is important not only for launching immune responses against tumors, but also for regulating the inflammatory responses that may result in autoimmune diseases.  This finding could be helpful for developing strategies to target cancer and inflammatory diseases,  said TSRI Assistant Professor of Immunology Young Jun Kang, who collaborated on the study with the lab of TSRI Institute Professor Richard A. Lerner, who is also Lita Annenberg Hazen Professor of Immunochemistry. Previous studies have shown RIPK3 controls the induction of a type of programmed cell death, called necroptosis, which protects the body from harmful mutations and infections. However, scientists had not fully understood RIPK3 s role in the immune system. For the new study, the scientists investigated the role of RIPK3 by studying RIPK3-deficient mice. Their research suggests that RIPK3 regulates the activation of natural killer T cells (NKTs), the immune cells that play dual roles in the development of autoimmune diseases and the destruction of cancers. RIPK3 doesn t directly cause necroptosis; instead, it regulates the activity of a mitochondrial enzyme (PGAM5) to trigger the expression of inflammatory cytokines in NKTs. To the scientists  knowledge, this is the first study showing the pathway between the mitochondria and the NKTs. By understanding the pathway, scientists may be able to develop ways to better control NKTs to attack tumors. The new study also suggests there may be a way to intervene in the pathway to block inflammation. When the researchers deleted the gene for RIPK3 or inhibited other parts of the pathway, they found they could actually protect mice from the induction of acute liver damage, implying a role for RIPK3 in autoimmune diseases. Kang said future studies will focus on understanding the details of this new signaling pathway, possibly paving the way for new therapies that can either hone the pathway s cancer-killing role or reduce its role in inflammation.","Published: September 21, 2015"

One of these actions is called mitosis, the series of steps through which a cell divides itself into two daughter cells, each of which has the same genetic material. Mitosis involves copying or  replicating  each of the cell s DNA-containing chromosomes, and then separating them so that each of the two newly created cells has a complete set of chromosomes, just like the parent cell. Since each chromosome carries distinct genes, the daughter cells need to have all of them, and it is also damaging for the daughter cell to have too many of any of them.  Errors in mitosis can lead to cancer and other diseases, so understanding every detail of cell division is of great interest beyond basic scientific discovery. It s known that the act of chromosome separation is facilitated by a structure called the spindle, a framework composed of interconnected fibrous microtubules. The two copies of each chromosome (made through DNA replication) are attached to the spindle s microtubule fibers and then moved apart to opposite sides of the dividing cell. In this way each of the two daughter cells receives one complete copy of the genetic material. This process requires the microtubule fibers to be organized into a spindle-like structure. Besides the microtubule fibers, the spindle also contains other densely packed materials that are visible under the electron microscope. These poorly understood materials are referred to as the spindle matrix and are believed to be important for cell division.  New work from a team led by Carnegie s Yixian Zheng zeroes in on one particular spindle matrix protein, called BuGZ. The team s findings show that BuGZ supports the assembly of the spindle matrix and microtubules. The team found that under spindle-assembly conditions, many copies of the BuGZ protein condense along the microtubule fibers to form droplets. This condensation occurs because molecules of the BuGZ protein can assemble with each other, and is referred to as phase transition. During mitosis, these condensed BuGZ droplets promote the assembly of the spindle matrix, which makes additional microtubule fibers and links the fibers together, thereby promoting assembly of the spindle itself. The formation of BuGZ droplets is the result of an evolutionarily conserved water-repelling (or hydrophobic) segment of BuGZ, which rejects interaction with the surrounding cellular fluid. Instead BuGZ proteins self-associate into these  inward-looking  droplet shapes. The team found that several other proteins found in the spindle matrix in both frogs and fruit flies have segments that resemble the water-repelling portion of BuGZ. They speculate that the whole spindle matrix could be formed through self-association of the hydrophobic segments of these proteins. This could help explain why many seemingly unrelated proteins make up the spindle matrix, which has been one of the central mysteries of the cell-division process.   Because BuGZ is evolutionarily conserved and found in both vertebrates and invertebrates, our findings should open the door to further research on spindles and their matrices in a wide variety of organisms,  Zheng said.","Published: September 21, 2015"

The Visible Molecular Cell Consortium aims to bring together the best minds from different disciplines to understand and articulate how the body s cells work, which will lay important groundwork to understanding health and disease.   Leveraging existing strengths at UC San Diego and Scripps, the collaboration will advance scientific excellence and research infrastructure at both institutions,  said Pradeep K. Khosla, chancellor of UC San Diego.  The goal of building virtual cells poses an important challenge to researchers in fields from experimental biology to computation and information analysis.  The Visible Molecular Cell Consortium (VMCC) will be directed jointly by TSRI Professor Art Olson and UC San Diego Associate Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Rommie Amaro. The consortium will offer fellowship funding for some 10 to 12 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to work on collaborative projects that build bridges between the campuses and different disciplines to assemble and simulate a virtual model of a cell, down to an atomic level of detail.  Even the simplest living cells contain 1 to 2 million proteins of 3,000 to 4,000 different types,  said Olson.  Figuring out how they work together over time will shed light on the cell as a living, working individual entity. Just like you couldn't build a car from just its wiring diagram, we can't have a complete understanding of a cell unless we know how all of its physical parts work together in 3D.  The researchers hope one day to be able to zoom into cells at the atomic level and zoom out to see  nano neighborhoods,  where cells interact. On top of that, they aim to visualize protein interactions in real time to better understand cellular function. This is a  big data  challenge, Olson points out, applied to the uncharted territory of cellular architecture and ecology. In recent years, better more powerful imaging devices and automated programs in high resolution imaging have provided more detailed pictures of cells and their proteins than ever before, but scientists have not yet translated the huge amounts of data into a single, atomic-level cellular model. The new consortium will help scientists put the pieces together. TSRI is well-known for its structural biology using both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, and Olson's lab develops and uses graphics programs (similar to those in the gaming industry) to visualize complex cellular machinery. UC San Diego is home to the only publicly available supercomputer in California and the National Biomedical Computation Resource (NBCR), a National Institutes of Health-sponsored national resource that develops multi-scale modeling tools.  This is a particularly exciting time for such efforts, due to a number of technological and scientific factors,  said Amaro.  Advances in various imaging technologies, modeling frameworks and cyber-infrastructure are enabling us to make new strides in the creation of 3D virtual cells. This timely new inter-institutional alliance will provide new insights into the inner workings of cell machinery, some of which may present opportunities for novel therapeutics.  Olson and Amaro plan to host their first  lightning talk  workshop, where any scientist can present his/her work and seek out collaborators, on October 2. They also plan to organize a biannual conference to encourage new collaborations and share results. The organizers anticipate the consortium will be particularly strong in neurological diseases and infectious diseases, such as influenza, HIV and Ebola virus, although Olson said the insights into cellular behavior will be applicable across many fields.","Published: September 21, 2015"

An effective HIV-1 vaccine has proven elusive, partly due to the difficulty of causing an immune response that can neutralize the diverse viral strains circulating in the human population,  said Alan Perelson, of Los Alamos  Theoretical Biology and Biophysics group.  Harnessing the power of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which emerge years into a chronic HIV infection, could help overcome this challenge.  Shishi Luo and Perelson, published their findings in the paper  Competitive exclusion by autologous antibodies can prevent broad HIV-1 antibodies from arising. They used a mathematical model to examine how broadly neutralizing antibodies coevolve with HIV. By simulating the co-evolution of multiple viral strains and antibody populations, Perelson and Luo show that broadly neutralizing antibodies emerge late in infection due to competition from the highly specific antibody response to the dominant viral species in an infected person. In their model, broadly neutralizing antibodies emerge earlier, and face less competition, in infections caused by multiple distinct strains of HIV compared with single strains. The findings support the view that a vaccine containing a mixture of diverse viral strains might reduce this competition, reduce the number of antibody mutations and elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies earlier in infection. Traditional vaccine design is based on the premise that infection is protective and that a vaccine should mimic a natural infection. However, Luo and Perelson s findings suggest that a vaccine should instead present the host with high levels of multiple diverse strains. ","Published: September 21, 2015"

However, a recent study by the team of Dr. Sylvie Belleville, PhD, Director of the Research Centre at the Institut universitaire de g riatrie de Montr al (Montreal Geriatric Institute) and Professor of Psychology at Universit  de Montr al, has shed light on this progression by showing the typical patterns of the brain's progression to dementia. For the study, the team compared changes that occurred over many years in people with stable MCI with changes in people for whom MCI progressed to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Dr. Belleville worked with doctoral student Simon Cloutier and a team of clinician researchers from Montreal. This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. The study showed that different cognitive areas (language, inhibition, visuo-spatial processing, working memory, executive functions, etc.) do not change in a uniform way. Cognitive decline does not occur in a linear fashion; instead, the path to dementia is complex and may sometimes be characterized by periods of stability followed by accelerated decline one or two years before diagnosis.  We've identified a profile of changes that characterizes people who progress towards dementia. In reality, a quick decline in episodic and working memory associated with language problems appears to be the typical profile of people who have a high risk of developing dementia within a short amount of time,  the researcher explained. Instead of seeing this as bad news, Dr. Belleville views these results as hope for seniors who are worried about their memories.  Many people complain about their memories. However, the presence of a change is what determines the risk of progression. This study has let us characterize the parameters of decline in people who will eventually develop Alzheimer's, which means we can better identify both benign symptoms and those that warrant particular attention. Rapid memory decline suggests that the onset of symptoms is probably due to a loss of the brain's compensatory mechanisms.  Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed late in its progression and sometimes up to fifteen years after its first effects on the brain. It is important to identify the early indicators so that patients can receive treatment as soon as possible. Universit  de Montr al  press release Belleville S et al.

Key areas of collaboration include clinical exome and whole genome sequencing, cross-leveraging proprietary mutation databases and clinical interpretation by a panel of clinical geneticists. Diploid s CEO, Dr Peter Schols said  Sengenics has performed the highest number of genomics tests on children with developmental delay in Asia and the Middle-East to date, which has led to the development of their GalaxC  database of Asian human disease mutations. We believe Sengenics experience coupled with Diploid s advanced analysis and interpretation pipeline will benefit our current and future customers who mainly consist of clinicians who utilize exome sequencing for improving the accuracy of diagnosis. This integrated solution will be mutually advantageous in assisting both companies to work alongside doctors to enhance management of debilitating genetic disorders in the region.  Sengenics and Diploid are also launching their new Exomax  clinical exome sequencing services which offer enhanced coverage and fast turnaround options. Exomax -Plus has a coverage that is nearly twice as high as standard exome capture methods. It includes additional exons, genes and UTRs. Whereas, Exomax-Rapid provides a shorter turnaround at just 20 working days. Both Exomax options are offered at 30-40% lower in cost than the closest accredited competitor, which allows healthcare professionals to offer diagnoses and disease management in a timely fashion to more patients that really need it. In addition, from January 2016, Sengenics Exomax  service will come with a free user license to GalaxC  for referring physicians. GalaxC  is a proprietary Allele Frequency Database with more than 6.5 million unique Asian and Middle East pathogenic mutations and variants. It is designed to provide accurate clinical genomics information to physicians dealing with patients with inherited genetic diseases. Exomax  is the only clinical exome service that leverages the GalaxC  allele frequency database to rule in pathogenic mutations and rule out population-based polymorphisms. This results in increased accuracy and diagnostic yield, and reduced false positives. Diploid and Sengenics will collaborate to widen the usage of the GalaxC  database throughout the region. Dr Stephen Moss, Head of Bioinformatics at Sengenics said  We are very much looking forward to merging our expertise, scalability and ideas with Diploid since their clinical genome interpretation service is among the best in the world.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/ages-apart-185461,Ages Apart Multifaceted approach measured how brain and liver age differently  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Age may seem like a straightforward measurement: the number of years, months, days since you were born. But for cells in different parts of your body, age can mean very different things. Scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany, and the Salk Institute and the University of California at Berkeley, both in the USA, have now measured and compared just how ageing affects rats  liver and brain cells. In a study published online in Cell Systems, they were able to tease out general ageing processes from those that are specific to each of these organs.  We found that in brain, age-related changes very often have to do with the loss of molecules that help signals to spread among neurons. This could explain why old rats have a reduced ability to form new connections between neurons, as well as other traits observed in the aging brain,  says Martin Beck, who led the work at EMBL.  And it is very similar to what has been found in previous studies that have looked at gene expression in humans.  The scientists compared brain and liver cells of rats in the prime of life - 6 months old, roughly equivalent to 18 year-old humans - to those of old rats - 24 months old. Rather than focus solely on gene expression - which genes are turned on or off - as most previous studies had done, the team employed a variety of techniques to assess several steps in the cells  protein production assembly line. They measured which parts of the genome had been transcribed into RNA, what proteins the cells had produced, what rates proteins were being produced at, and what chemical markers were added to proteins in  post-production .  Integrating data from different levels was crucial,  says Beck.  When you see how the data sets cluster, it reveals what s actually going on. Often it was only then that we could see that a whole network of reactions is affected.  Ageing impacted some networks equally in liver and brain - notably immune response and inflammation, and stress responses - implying that these are probably general effects of ageing, felt throughout the body. But other effects were very specific. The livers of old rats showed changes in metabolic processes - i.e. how cells process molecules - mostly at the level of regulating how the genome is  read . In the brain, by contrast, the tell-tale signs of ageing were mostly at the level of protein production, and mainly affected signalling processes that enable neurons to communicate with each other.  We chose to compare brain and liver because these two organs have very different capacities for self-renewal,  says Martin Hetzer, who led the work at the Salk Institute.  The liver has a very high regeneration rate, so even in an old animal   or person   most of the molecules in liver cells will actually be relatively young. In the brain, it s the opposite: in our previous work we have shown that many sets of molecules in the brain are effectively there for life.   This is just the beginning,  says Nicholas Ingolia, who led the work at Berkeley.  Our study provides a rather large resource of proteins, RNAs and post-translational modifications that are affected by age, which we hope others can use to propose new hypotheses which can be tested experimentally.

The CDMO believes it is imperative to improve the mechanism by which drugs are discovered, developed, and even manufactured through advances in Process Analytical Technology (PAT), and a commitment to continuous improvement by implementing green chemistry earlier in the drug development cycle. Piramal Pharma Solutions believes that far too often life sciences companies examine the efficiency of the chemical processes used much too late in the drug development process, if at all. It is widely accepted that over 100 kg of waste can be produced during the manufacture of one kg of API or advanced intermediate. In response, Piramal has launched a series of green chemistry initiatives and is fundamentally asking all its partners to evaluate the greenness of the chemical pathways (routes) they are using in any project. There are two potential areas for implementing greener routes (processes) in drug development: a) when the drug demonstrates efficacy, during Phase II, as the clinical risk is reduced enough to consider putting R&D resources into developing a more efficient and greener route; and b) Life Cycle Management (LCM), post-commercialization, where the onset of generic manufacture requires more efficient processes to remain competitive. Vivek Sharma, CEO - Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, comments:  Green Chemistry by design (GCbD) presents us with a great opportunity to look at the bigger picture during route scouting and move ahead with green chemistry principles. I am sure that further down the line the FDA will look at bringing in these principles more formally, but as an industry we should be taking action and doing this now. The routes used for many drugs   whether generic or patented   are often atom inefficient and have significant room for improvement using route scouting methodologies including GCbD principles. We need to start the GCbD process early   not after a NDA or DMF has been filed, but as early as Phase I for innovators and as early as NDA approval for Generic players. This is where the Greener routes are established, after which they tend to remain with the product through its life cycle, and that is where the fundamental change needs to occur.  The CDMO believes that, in the future, new chemistries for improved and greener routes are urgently needed if the industry is to see the bigger picture of GCbD followed by optimization of these routes using QbD. Already, there are a number of tools available; from changing the initial routes, using biocatalysis, flow systems and chemo catalysis, and by implementing a key R&D function called  route scouting  The problem is that the industry as a whole is still comfortable in trying the tested methods. A number of CMOs - Piramal included - are developing new chemistries that enable greener routes using GCbD principles but there needs to be a collective desire in pharma to improve its overall greenness and efficiency. Ultimately, drugs could be produced significantly cheaper and with green footprints. As an example, Dr. Dhileepkumar Krishnamurthy, VP & Head R&D (API), Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises states that:  Piramal scientists re-designed the route for a patented product during the development of a new generic, resulting in over a 25 fold improvement in efficiency  waste was reduced from 1500kg/kg down to under 50kg/kg. Even in the generic industry, where reducing cost is a key, re-examining routes is not a regular occurrence prior to DMF filing. Therefore, we, as a collective industry, need to invest in investigating potential new routes for patented products that drive atom efficiency and a step change reduction in costs, instead of doing incremental improvements for a quick DMF and ANDA submission.  Vivek Sharma, CEO   Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, continued:  At CPhI Worldwide, Piramal is urging its partners and the wider industry to take up greener, and often cost effective routes to market, as we believe that as an industry we have a greater responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint while also assisting patients. In what is largely unique to pharma, once approval is granted, there is little incentive for continuous process improvement as regulatory hurdles present significant challenges to rework routes. As an industry, we need to change this paradigm by investing in GCbD principles, early and to drive cost effective and elegant chemical transformations.  Piramal has instilled and nurtured a green culture over the last few years and is currently exploring a number of new, green, chemical processes and at CPhI the company will be looking for new partners to commercialize these waste-reduction technologies.","Published: September 19, 2015"

A University of Kansas study shows that the communication between the brain and quadriceps muscles of people who take part in endurance training, such as running long distances, is different than those who regularly took part in resistance training and those who were sedentary. The findings may offer clues to the type of physical activity humans are most naturally suited to. Trent Herda, assistant professor of health, sport and exercise sciences, and Michael Trevino, a doctoral student, conducted studies in which they measured muscle responses of five people who regularly run long distances, five who regularly lift weights and five sedentary individuals who regularly do neither. The studies have been published in the Journal of Sports Sciences and Muscle and Nerve. Among the findings, Herda and Trevino showed that the quadriceps muscle fibers of the endurance trainers were able to fire more rapidly. ""The communication between the brains and their muscles was slightly different than the resistance trainers and sedentary individuals,"" Herda said of endurance trainers. ""This information also suggested that resistance trainers and those who are sedentary were more likely to fatigue sooner, among other things."" Survey participants were 15 healthy volunteers. The endurance trainers had consistently taken part in a structured running program for at least three years prior to the study and ran an average of 61 miles a week and did not take part in resistance training. The resistance trainers had consistently taken part in a weight-training program for at least four years prior to the study. They took part in resistance training four to eight hours per week and reported doing at least one repetition of a back squat of twice their body mass. One reported doing a squat of 1.5 times his or her body weight, but none engaged in aerobic activity such as swimming, jogging or cycling. The sedentary participants did not take part in any structured physical exercise for three years prior to the study. Participants wore mechanomyographic and electromyographic electrode sensors on their quadriceps muscle and extended their leg while seated. The researchers measured submaximal contraction and total force by having participants extend their leg, then exert more force, attempting to achieve from 40 to 70 percent of total force, which they could see represented in real time on a computer screen. While it is not immediately clear why the communication between the brain and muscle was different as a result of different types of exercise as evidenced by the difference in rates of muscle fibers firing, Herda said it offers leads for new means of research into neuromechanical differences in muscle function, muscle performance, muscle stiffness and other areas. It also provides several clues into the type of exercise humans are more naturally built for. While not claiming that one type of exercise or sport is superior to another, Herda said the findings suggest that the human body's neuromuscular system may be more naturally inclined to adapt to aerobic exercise than resistance training for strength as the communication between the brain and muscles was similar between resistance training and sedentary individuals.

And it turns out that aside from humans, great apes (in this case, chimpanzees and bonobos) also remember events in films -- and can anticipate what takes place in memorable scenes. Researchers at Kyoto University's Wildlife Research Center, writing in the journal Current Biology, adapted eye-tracking technology for the apes, enabling the team to record how the apes were viewing various video clips. ""When shown a video for the second time, after a 24-hour delay, the apes clearly anticipated what was coming next,"" explains first-author Fumihiro Kano. ""This demonstrates their ability to encode single-experience events into long-term memory."" The team began by creating two series of short films, King Kong Attack and Revenge to King Kong, in which the apes are shown a familiar sort of environment where rather shockingly unfamiliar events take place. For example in the first series, two doors are visible, but an attacking 'King Kong' (in reality, a researcher dressed in a Kong costume) only emerges from the right or left side. 24 hours later, when shown the film again, the apes' attention focused on the side they had seen previously, even before Kong emerged. Previous studies in this area have been based on prior long-term training of apes.

These findings have provided a new target for schizophrenia treatment. Schizophrenia affects nearly 1% of the total human population. The dominant cause of the disorder lies in impaired brain development that eventually leads to imbalanced signals within the brain. This imbalance within the brain is thought to cause hallucinations and paranoia in people with schizophrenia. ""We wanted to understand the mechanism by which the brain circuit operates,"" explained senior author Assistant Professor Shawn Je, from the Neuroscience and Behavioural Disorders Programme at Duke-NUS. ""In particular, we wanted to understand the ability of a specific type of cell in the brain, interneurons, to modulate brain network activity to maintain a balance in brain signaling."" Dr. Je and his team analyzed signaling activity in neuronal cultures that either did not have the DTNBP1 gene or had lowered levels of the gene, because reduced DTNBP1 levels and genetic disruptions of DTNBP1 in mice resulted in schizophrenia-like behaviours. Using multiple model systems, they found that the low levels of DTNBP1 resulted in dysfunctional interneurons and over-activated neuronal network activity. Reducing levels of DTNBP1 also lowered the levels of the secreted protein molecule, BDNF. BDNF was then shown to be one of the most important factors that regulate the development of a normal brain circuit. It plays an important role in the interneurons ability to connect to the brain. Interneurons receive BDNF via a transport system run by DTNBP1. This can be likened to the delivery of a parcel: DTNBP1 is the driver of the delivery van and without the driver, the parcel BDNF cannot be delivered to the required destination. Without BDNF, the abnormal circuit development and brain network activity observed in schizophrenia patients results. Additionally, Dr. Je and his team also found that when BDNF levels were restored, brain development and activity were rescued and returned to more normal levels, despite the absence of DTNBP1. While the two genes DTNBP1 and BDNF have been singled out as risk genes for schizophrenia in studies before, this is the first study to show that the two function together. Pinpointing the importance of the abnormal delivery of BDNF has shed considerable insight into how the brain network develops. It also presents possibilities for potential treatments for schizophrenia designed around enhancing BDNF levels. In a follow-up study, Dr. Je plans to test if these findings are viable in an animal model. If proven successful, this could mean that correcting the imbalance within the brain circuits of schizophrenia patients may bring us closer to producing a treatment.

Hydrocortisone is one of the 15 most frequently prescribed medications in extremely low birth weight ( 1000 g) infants in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). Despite widespread use, the effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes of stress doses of hydrocortisone or of dosing after 1 week of age have not been assessed in randomized trials. Additionally, the benefit of giving hydrocortisone in relation to infant risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is not well documented. ""Despite advances in perinatal care, one of every two extremely low birth weight infants develops bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or neurodevelopmental impairments,"" says Nehal Parikh, DO, principal investigator in the Center for Perinatal Research at The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital. ""We've been using hydrocortisone in these patients without randomized, placebo-controlled studies."" BPD is characterized by systemic inflammation, pointing toward a potential link among BPD, abnormal brain development and neurodevelopment. The idea that an anti-inflammatory medication, such as hydrocortisone, could offer benefits in all of these areas has taken hold without necessarily having data to support it. In a new study recently published in PLoS ONE, Dr. Parikh and colleagues assess the long- and short-term effects of stress doses of hydrocortisone after 1 week of age via randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Extremely low birth weight, ventilator-dependent infants between 10 and 21 days old were administered a seven-day taper of hydrocortisone or a saline placebo while being treated at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Texas. The study period ended with neurodevelopmental checks in the 18 to 22 month corrected age period. ""Unlike dexamethasone, higher/stress dose hydrocortisone does not appear to be associated with brain injury or neurodevelopmental impairments,"" Dr. Parikh says. The team found no evidence that the doses of hydrocortisone used in the study prevented BPD, but Parikh suggests even though lower doses of hydrocortisone do not appear to benefit the lungs, they may improve cognitive outcomes. ""Hydrocortisone as prescribed in our trial did not reduce the risk of BPD when compared to placebo, possibly because we used anti-inflammatory doses that were not sufficiently high and/or the enrolled population of extremely preterm infants was too sick,"" Dr. Parikh says. As a result of this work, Dr. Parikh suggests neonatologists be more liberal with the use of stress dose hydrocortisone for relative adrenal insufficiency in extremely preterm infants (a common condition that can result in refractory hypotension) as the current data do not indicate adverse effects on neurodevelopment. In follow-up work, Dr. Parikh and his team at Nationwide Children's are examining the relationship between hydrocortisone and risk of a common inflammatory brain abnormality - diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI) - which occurs in up to 75 percent of extremely preterm infants. ""Data from our pilot trial suggests a trend towards reduced cognitive deficits in hydrocortisone treated preterm infants,"" says Dr. Parikh. ""Our initial study may have lacked sufficient power to show a significant difference. However, we have shown that increasing DEHSI volume is a significant predictor of lower cognitive score. Thus, examining a short term surrogate measure of cognitive outcomes, such as DEHSI, may reveal that stress dose hydrocortisone reduces risk of DEHSI and may indeed improve neurodevelopmental outcomes if tested in a larger trial.""

Now, University at Buffalo (UB) researchers and their colleagues at other institutions have published a paper in Nature Communications about a new method they developed to more precisely capture how brain cells interact. The work was led by scientists at UB s Hunter James Kelly Research Institute (HJKRI) who conduct research to better understand myelin, the fatty insulator that enables communication between nerve cells. The researchers study how damage to myelin occurs, and how that damage may be repaired. The institute, part of UB s New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, was established in 1997 by Buffalo Bills Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly and his wife Jill after their infant son Hunter, was diagnosed with Krabbe Leukodystrophy, an inherited fatal disorder. He died in 2005 at the age of 8. The researchers explained that cellular interactions that trigger the production of myelin are especially hard to pinpoint. That s because the crucial point of contact between two types of cells   the connection between axons, along which nerve impulses travel, and glial cells, which support neurons   is essentially hidden.  Myelin is made by a glial cell wrapping around an axon cell,  explained M. Laura Feltri, MD, senior author on the paper and an HJKRI researcher and professor of biochemistry and neurology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB.  To study myelin, you really need to study both cells. The glial cell wraps like a spiral around the axon, so every time you try to study the region of contact between the two cells, you end up studying the whole combination. It s very hard to look just at the interface.  And studying this interface is critical in certain diseases, she added.  In Krabbe s, for example, the problem is not just that there isn t sufficient myelin, but that the glial cell is not providing proper support to the neuron. But to figure out exactly what s going wrong, we needed a better way to study that interface.  The new technique for achieving this involves using the second cell (the neuron) as a trigger to attract the first cell (the glial cell). The researchers use a system with two chambers, separated by a membrane.  When the cells in the upper chamber  recognize  the cells in the bottom chamber, they kind of  reach  through the holes in the membrane for each other and touch. That is the intersection that we can then isolate and study,  Feltri explained. Using this technique, the researchers discovered novel proteins at that intersectioncalled prohibitins, which, they found, are necessary for the production of myelin. The discovery will help improve the understanding of and development of new treatments for myelin diseases. It also will make it easier to study all kinds of cellular interactions, not just those in the brain.  Using this method, we can isolate the portion of a cell that comes in contact with another cell, and analyze all the proteins that are present only in this subcellular fraction,  Feltri explained.  It s provides a glimpse into the social life of cells.   This work has important implications for diseases of myelin such as Krabbe disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases, because the communication between glial cells and neurons is vital for neuroprotection,  she said. Yannick Poitelon, PhD, postdoctoral research scientist at HJKRI and first author of the paper, explained that glial cells support neurons metabolically and protect axons that can measure up to one meter in length, extending far away from the glial cell.  This has profound implications for glial disease like Krabbe s, Charcot-Marie Tooth, peripheral neuropathies or Multiple Sclerosis, because the dysfunction of glial cells end up impairing the interactions with neurons, which as a result suffer and degenerate causing devastating clinical symptoms,  said Poitelon.  Similarly, neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington s disease or Lou Gehrig's, that were considered uniquely diseases of neurons in the past, are now considered diseases of cellular communications between neurons and glial cells.

However, with advancing age the potential for regeneration in the brain dramatically declines. Scientists of the University of Zurich (UZH) now identified a novel mechanism of how neural stem cells stay relatively free of aging-induced damage. A diffusion barrier regulates the sorting of damaged proteins during cell division. Yeast are good for making wine, bread, and brewing beer. But they are also a good model for neural stem cells in the mammalian brain. It was known that with every division cellular aging factors are asymmetrically distributed between the mother and the daughter cell, allowing for rejuvenation and full life span of the daughter independent of the age of the mother cell. At least partially responsible for this is the presence of a diffusion barrier that restricts movement of molecules from one side to the other side of the cell during cell division. A group of scientists led by Sebastian Jessberger of the Brain Research Institute showed now that also the stem cells of the adult mouse brain asymmetrically segregate aging factors between the mother and the daughter cells. Responsible for this is a diffusion barrier in the endoplasmic reticulum (a channel system within the cell that is for example important for protein synthesis and transport). The barrier prevents retention of damaged proteins in the stem cell daughter cell keeping the stem cells relatively clean. ""Neural stem cell divisions appear to be much more asymmetric than we had previously anticipated,"" states Darcie Moore, postdoc in the group of Sebastian Jessberger and lead author of the study. In addition, the authors of the new study published in Science found that the strength of the barrier weakens with advancing age. This leads to reduced asymmetry of damaged protein segregation with increasing age of the stem cell. This could be one of the mechanisms responsible for the reduced regeneration capacity in the aged brain as stem cells that retain larger amounts of damaged proteins require longer for the next cell division. Sebastian Jessberger says ""this is an exciting new mechanism involved in stem cell division and aging. But as of now we are only just beginning to understand the molecular constituents and the true meaning of the barrier for stem cell division in the brain."" One key question to be answered is whether the barrier is established in all somatic stem cells of the body. The answer to this question may open new routes to target age-dependent alterations of stem cell activity in human disease. University of Zurich   press release Jessberger S et al.

He argues that for far too long we have allowed the status quo to continue, and that for true continual improvement we need to make it easier for companies to make vital alterations to manufacturing processes, without being hindered by a full re-approval process. Under his guidelines the pharmaceutical industry will be allowed to commercialise process improvements (yield, process/operating conditions, operating parameters, cycle time) in the manufacture of approved APIs and their formulations. Guarantees on quality will then be provided from the manufacturing company, and they must ensure that the product efficacy and performance will not lessen, and the product will be equal to or better than the approved product produced by the company. Crucially, if for any reason these standards are not met, he suggested a stipulation that the company proposing improvements will be barred from making the product using the alternate process for the next two or three years. And, if they do decide to use the alternate process, they will have to go through the full re-approval process. Additionally, Girish states that minor changes that do not change the current filed processing methods will be excluded, and this will apply to OTC, brand and generic products. The FDA established 21CFR314.7[1] and it assures that there is no  by manufacturer s choice  deviation from the manufacturing methods and practices that have been filed for the components involved in the manufacture of any saleable drug   the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and their formulation   and labelling, packaging etc. However, as every change has to be reported, drastic process changes, even when there are clear benefits for the finished drug and patient, are summarily discouraged. Girish, commented:  21 CFR314.70 encourages  continuous improvements  in the processes that will create the best product for clinical trials and that s the way it should be. However, in my estimation under the current rules all of this has to be done prior to going to clinical trials. QbD (quality by design) becomes a natural part of the process development before a process is commercialised. But after the fact process change is extremely difficult.  Girish believes that the benefits of a new regulatory regime far outweigh the risks, as cost reduction, improved profits and a larger customer base due to improved manufacturing technologies and efficiencies, will be a huge step forward. Despite a commitment to continuous improvement anything  after the fact , under the current regulatory environment, simply will not happen due to the financial and time constraints of re-approval. Thus, although the current regulations and QbD are well intentioned, they do not yet breed a culture of continuous improvement. He added:  I admit that my proposal is a quite audacious, but unless such bold steps are considered, very little will change in the current pharma s manufacturing methodologies or anywhere, for that matter. If incorporated in pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape, continuous improvements and innovation could become a routine and it could be extended to the whole healthcare industry. It has an opportunity to add as much as 20% of the global population (~1.4 billion) to its customer base, an unprecedented opportunity for any industry on the planet. Profits will improve and healthcare costs can come done. It would be a win-win. ","Published: September 18, 2015"

The CDMO believes it is imperative to improve the mechanism by which drugs are discovered, developed, and even manufactured through advances in Process Analytical Technology (PAT), and a commitment to continuous improvement by implementing green chemistry earlier in the drug development cycle.  Piramal Pharma Solutions believes that far too often life sciences companies examine the efficiency of the chemical processes used much too late in the drug development process, if at all.  It is widely accepted that over 100 kg of waste can be produced during the manufacture of one kg of API or advanced intermediate.  In response, Piramal has launched a series of green chemistry initiatives and is fundamentally asking all its partners to evaluate the greenness of the chemical pathways (routes) they are using in any project.  There are two potential areas for implementing greener routes (processes) in drug development: a) when the drug demonstrates efficacy, during Phase II, as the clinical risk is reduced enough to consider putting R&D resources into developing a more efficient and greener route; and b) Life Cycle Management (LCM), post-commercialisation, where the onset of generic manufacture requires more efficient processes to remain competitive.   Vivek Sharma, CEO   Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, comments:  Green Chemistry by design (GCbD) presents us with a great opportunity to look at the bigger picture during route scouting and move ahead with green chemistry principles. I am sure that further down the line the FDA will look at bringing in these principles more formally, but as an industry we should be taking action and doing this now. The routes used for many drugs   whether generic or patented   are often atom inefficient and have significant room for improvement using route scouting methodologies including GCbD principles. We need to start the GCbD process  early   not after a NDA or DMF has been filed, but as early as Phase I for innovators and as early as NDA approval for Generic players. This is where the Greener routes are established, after which they tend to remain with the product through its life cycle, and that is where the fundamental change needs to occur.  The CDMO believes that, in the future, new chemistries for improved and greener routes are urgently needed if the industry is to see the bigger picture of GCbD followed by optimisation of these routes using QbD. Already, there are a number of tools available; from changing the initial routes, using biocatalysis, flow systems and chemo catalysis, and by implementing a key R&D function called  route scouting  The problem is that the industry as a whole is still comfortable in trying the tested methods. A number of CMOs   Piramal included   are developing new chemistries that enable greener routes using GCbD principles but there needs to be a collective desire in pharma to improve its overall greenness and efficiency. Ultimately, drugs could be produced significantly cheaper and with green footprints. As an example, Dr. Dhileepkumar Krishnamurthy, VP & Head R&D (API), Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises states that:  Piramal scientists re-designed the route for a patented product during the development of a new generic, resulting in over a 25 fold improvement in efficiency  waste was reduced from 1500kg/kg down to under 50kg/kg. Even in the generic industry, where reducing cost is a key, re-examining routes is not a regular occurrence prior to DMF filing. Therefore, we, as a collective industry, need to invest in investigating potential new routes for patented products that drive atom efficiency and a step change reduction in costs, instead of doing incremental improvements for a quick DMF and ANDA submission.  Vivek Sharma, CEO   Pharma Solutions, Piramal Enterprises, continued:  At CPhI Worldwide, Piramal is urging its partners and the wider industry to take up greener, and often cost effective routes to market, as we believe that as an industry we have a greater responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint while also assisting patients. In what is largely unique to pharma, once approval is granted, there is little incentive for continuous process improvement as regulatory hurdles present significant challenges to rework routes. As an industry, we need to change this paradigm by investing in GCbD principles, early and to drive cost effective and elegant chemical transformations.  Piramal has instilled and nurtured a green culture over the last few years and is currently exploring a number of new, green, chemical processes and at CPhI the company will be looking for new partners to commercialise these waste-reduction technologies.

5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-better-class-of-cancer-drugs-184754,A Better Class of Cancer Drugs An SDSU chemist has developed a technique to identify potential cancer drugs that are less likely to produce side effects  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A class of therapeutic drugs known as protein kinase inhibitors has in the past decade become a powerful weapon in the fight against various life-threatening diseases, including certain types of leukemia, lung cancer, kidney cancer and squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. One problem with these drugs, however, is that they often inhibit many different targets, which can lead to side effects and complications in therapeutic use. A recent study by San Diego State University chemist Jeffrey Gustafson has identified a new technique for improving the selectivity of these drugs and possibly decreasing unwanted side effects in the future. Why are protein kinase inhibiting drugs so unpredictable? The answer lies in their molecular makeup.Many of these drug candidates possess examples of a phenomenon known as atropisomerism. To understand what this is, it s helpful to understand a bit of the chemistry at work. Molecules can come in different forms that have exactly the same chemical formula and even the same bonds, just arranged differently. The different arrangements are mirror images of each other, with a left-handed and a right-handed arrangement. The molecules   handedness  is referred to as chirality. Atropisomerism is a form of chirality that arises when the spatial arrangement has a rotatable bond called an axis of chirality. Picture two non-identical paper snowflakes tethered together by a rigid stick. Some axes of chirality are rigid, while others can freely spin about their axis. In the latter case, this means that at any given time, you could have one of two different  versions  of the same molecule. Watershed treatment As the name suggests, kinase inhibitors interrupt the function of kinases a particular type of enzyme and effectively shut down the activity of proteins that contribute to cancer.  Kinase inhibition has been a watershed for cancer treatment,  said Gustafson, who attended SDSU as an undergraduate before earning his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Yale University, then working there as a National Institutes of Health poctdoctoral fellow in chemical biology.  However, it s really hard to inhibit a single kinase,  he explained.  The majority of compounds identified inhibit not just one but many kinases, and that can lead to a number of side effects.  Many kinase inhibitors possess axes of chirality that are freely spinning. The problem is that because you can t control which  arrangement  of the molecule is present at a given time, the unwanted version could have unintended consequences. In practice, this means that when medicinal chemists discover a promising kinase inhibitor that exists as two interchanging arrangements, they actually have two different inhibitors. Each one can have quite different biological effects, and it s difficult to know which version of the molecule actually targets the right protein.  I think this has really been under-recognized in the field,  Gustafson said.  The field needs strategies to weed out these side effects.  Applying the brakes So that s what Gustafson did in a recently published study. He and his colleagues synthesized atropisomeric compounds known to target a particular family of kinases known as tyrosine kinases. To some of these compounds, the researchers added a single chlorine atom which effectively served as a brake to keep the atropisomer from spinning around, locking the molecule into either a right-handed or a left-handed version. When the researchers screened both the modified and unmodified versions against their target kinases, they found major differences in which kinases the different versions inhibited. The unmodified compound was like a shotgun blast, inhibiting a broad range of kinases. But the locked-in right-handed and left-handed versions were choosier.  Just by locking them into one or another atropisomeric configuration, not only were they more selective, but they  inhibited different kinases,  Gustafson explained. If drug makers incorporated this technique into their early drug discovery process, he said, it would help identify which version of an atropisomeric compound actually targets the kinase they want to target, cutting the potential for side effects and helping to usher drugs past strict regulatory hurdles and into the hands of waiting patients.","Published: September 18, 2015"

However, tumor cells often evade destruction by prompting immature T-cells to become regulatory T-cells, or Tregs. These cells are marked by a protein inside them, Foxp3+, which suppresses the ability of killer T-cells to attack tumors. Protected from the immune system, the tumor can grow unrestrained and spread cancer throughout the body.One potential solution is a cell surface protein called glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor, or GITR. Scientists have known that GITR can prevent the production of Foxp3+ Tregs, eliminating the tumor's natural bodyguard against the immune system. Concurrently, GITR directs immature T-cells to become activated tumor killers called Th9 cells that express a cancer-fighting protein known as interleukin 9 (IL-9). However, until the findings reported today, the mechanism by which this switch from tumor protector to tumor destroyer occurs was poorly defined. ""We want to be able to harness GITR's power to change the CD4 'cell fate'--in other words, determine how the protein directs CD4 differentiation--to yield more tumor killers than tumor protectors. This knowledge might help us develop new therapies that mobilize immune cells against tumors,"" said Xian C. Li, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Immunobiology & Transplant Science Center at Houston Methodist Research Institute and last author on the paper. Li and his colleagues looked at GITR's influence on immature T-cells in relation to a specific type of cancer, aggressive melanoma, in mice. The team determined that GITR signaling controls whether or not an acetyl group (the same chemical group found in acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin) is removed from a histone protein in the genome of an immature T-cell. If this ""deactylation"" occurs, the portion of the genome that regulates Foxp3+ production shuts down. This tips the ""cell fate"" of the immature T-cell in favor of its becoming a Th9 cell, and at the same time, stimulates the production of IL-9. ""Immune cells such as the Th9 are powerful tools for eliminating cancer cells, as long as they are properly stimulated through the right molecular pathways,"" Li said. ""Our study has shown how one such pathway works and that is exciting, especially when a companion study in South Korea found GITR yielded similar anti-tumor activity against four different cancers.""","Published: September 18, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/personalized-heart-models-for-surgical-planning-205089,Personalized Heart Models For Surgical Planning System can convert MRI scans into  D printed  physical models in a few hours  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at MIT and Boston Children s Hospital have developed a system that can take MRI scans of a patient s heart and, in a matter of hours, convert them into a tangible, physical model that surgeons can use to plan surgery. The models could provide a more intuitive way for surgeons to assess and prepare for the anatomical idiosyncrasies of individual patients.  Our collaborators are convinced that this will make a difference,  says Polina Golland, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, who led the project.  The phrase I heard is that  surgeons see with their hands,  that the perception is in the touch.  This fall, seven cardiac surgeons at Boston Children s Hospital will participate in a study intended to evaluate the models  usefulness. Golland and her colleagues will describe their new system at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention in October. Danielle Pace, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, is first author on the paper and spearheaded the development of the software that analyzes the MRI scans. Medhi Moghari, a physicist at Boston Children s Hospital, developed new procedures that increase the precision of MRI scans tenfold, and Andrew Powell, a cardiologist at the hospital, leads the project s clinical work. MRI data consist of a series of cross sections of a three-dimensional object. Like a black-and-white photograph, each cross section has regions of dark and light, and the boundaries between those regions may indicate the edges of anatomical structures. Then again, they may not. Determining the boundaries between distinct objects in an image is one of the central problems in computer vision, known as  image segmentation.  But general-purpose image-segmentation algorithms aren t reliable enough to produce the very precise models that surgical planning requires. Human factors Typically, the way to make an image-segmentation algorithm more precise is to augment it with a generic model of the object to be segmented. Human hearts, for instance, have chambers and blood vessels that are usually in roughly the same places relative to each other. That anatomical consistency could give a segmentation algorithm a way to weed out improbable conclusions about object boundaries. The problem with that approach is that many of the cardiac patients at Boston Children s Hospital require surgery precisely because the anatomy of their hearts is irregular. Inferences from a generic model could obscure the very features that matter most to the surgeon. In the past, researchers have produced printable models of the heart by manually indicating boundaries in MRI scans. But with the 200 or so cross sections in one of Moghari s high-precision scans, that process can take eight to 10 hours.  They want to bring the kids in for scanning and spend probably a day or two doing planning of how exactly they re going to operate,  Golland says.  If it takes another day just to process the images, it becomes unwieldy.  Pace and Golland s solution was to ask a human expert to identify boundaries in a few of the cross sections and allow algorithms to take over from there. Their strongest results came when they asked the expert to segment only a small patch  one-ninth of the total area   of each cross section. In that case, segmenting just 14 patches and letting the algorithm infer the rest yielded 90 percent agreement with expert segmentation of the entire collection of 200 cross sections. Human segmentation of just three patches yielded 80 percent agreement.  I think that if somebody told me that I could segment the whole heart from eight slices out of 200, I would not have believed them,  Golland says.  It was a surprise to us.  Together, human segmentation of sample patches and the algorithmic generation of a digital, 3-D heart model takes about an hour. The 3-D-printing process takes a couple of hours more. Prognosis Currently, the algorithm examines patches of unsegmented cross sections and looks for similar features in the nearest segmented cross sections. But Golland believes that its performance might be improved if it also examined patches that ran obliquely across several cross sections. This and other variations on the algorithm are the subject of ongoing research. The clinical study in the fall will involve MRIs from 10 patients who have already received treatment at Boston Children s Hospital. Each of seven surgeons will be given data on all 10 patients   some, probably, more than once. That data will include the raw MRI scans and, on a randomized basis, either a physical model or a computerized 3-D model, based, again at random, on either human segmentations or algorithmic segmentations. Using that data, the surgeons will draw up surgical plans, which will be compared with documentation of the interventions that were performed on each of the patients. The hope is that the study will shed light on whether 3-D-printed physical models can actually improve surgical outcomes.  Absolutely, a 3-D model would indeed help,  says Sitaram Emani, a cardiac surgeon at Boston Children s Hospital who is not a co-author on the new paper.  We have used this type of model in a few patients, and in fact performed  virtual surgery  on the heart to simulate real conditions. Doing this really helped with the real surgery in terms of reducing the amount of time spent examining the heart and performing the repair.   I think having this will also reduce the incidence of residual lesions   imperfections in repair   by allowing us to simulate and plan the size and shape of patches to be used,  Emani adds.  Ultimately, 3D-printed patches based upon the model will allow us to tailor prosthesis to patient.   Finally, having this immensely simplifies discussions with families, who find the anatomy confusing,  Emani says.  This gives them a better visual, and many patients and families have commented on how this empowers them to understand their condition better. ","Published: September 18, 2015"

The funding will support ongoing work to identify microRNA molecules that can serve as biomarkers to help predict outcomes in patients with heart disease. The grant provides the second phase of support for the team s original project,  Plasma miRNA Predictors of Adverse and Electrical Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction,  which launched in 2013 with $4 million in funding from the NIH.  Each year, complications from heart attacks [myocardial infarctions] contribute to more than 550,000 cases of heart failure and 300,000 cases of sudden cardiac arrest,  said Das.  Both of these conditions are closely related to a process known as remodeling, in which the structure and function of the heart changes   or remodels   following a heart attack.  Das, who is a faculty member in BIDMC s Institute for RNA Medicine, conducts research on a type of extracellular RNA called microRNAs. These small, noncoding RNAs have only recently been identified in blood and other tissues, and Das has been exploring the role that these tiny molecules play in in predicting which heart-attack patients might go on to develop remodeling complications.  Over the past two years, we have been using RNA sequencing technology to identify characteristics in extracellular RNAs in plasma that might enable us to better predict patient outcomes following a heart attack,  said Das.  Our ultimate goal is to use microRNA-based tests to predict which patients might be at risk of complications related to remodeling. That way we can more aggressively monitor their conditions and intervene with medications or implantable devices if needed.  The team has completed the first phase of the project, and has identified a number of microRNA biomarker candidates. In line with their recently published work, they have found that one of these molecules, microRNA-30d, is an important predictor of beneficial cardiac remodeling in patients following a heart attack.  Even more important, we ve found that microRNA-30d plays a functional role in preventing cell death,  said Das.  We think that having higher levels of this microRNA is an adaptive response to the increased stress of heart failure and allows cardiac cells to better remodel. We re now incorporating this new discovery in studies in mice to see if microRNA-30d can serve as a therapy to protect against different models of heart disease. ","Published: September 18, 2015"

MX-ICP is a high sensitivity DNA amplification technology that allows the detection of mutations in multiple genes from either tumors or any liquid sample, such as blood or urine. The first commercial license follows a 2014 research agreement between Transgenomic and the University of Melbourne for the conduct of clinical validation studies of the MX-ICP technology. Under the terms of the new agreement, Melbourne University receives an exclusive license in Australia to Transgenomic s new EGFR liquid biopsy cancer assays. The four licensed tests detect specific actionable mutations associated with sensitivity or resistance to targeted drugs used for colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer in many sample types but mainly in blood/plasma. The assays are highly accurate and provide precision detection levels down to as low as 0.01% from small amounts of blood or tissue samples. They will be available to researchers and also for diagnostic use through Melbourne University s National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) certified laboratory. Transgenomic will sell the EGFR kits to the University and will also receive royalties. In addition, Transgenomic will partner with Melbourne University to provide Biomarker Identification services to biopharmaceutical companies. Prof. Paul Waring, Chair of Pathology at the University of Melbourne, Head of Molecular Pathology at Melbourne Health and Director of the Centre for Translational Pathology at Melbourne University, commented,  We have been working with the MX-ICP liquid biopsy technology for about a year and have been very favorably impressed with its accuracy, exceptional sensitivity and overall utility. We are delighted we will now be able to put it to work for our cancer patients and, in partnership with Transgenomic, to drug developers here in Australia.

Drugs called HDAC inhibitors cause a build-up of certain types of tags, leading to potentially damaging changes in gene activity that can kill cancer cells. But while HDAC inhibitors can successfully treat certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma, other types survive this disruption. Scientists from the University of Birmingham suggest that they do this by activating an in-built  survival  response to HDAC inhibitors which rebalances the tags, maintaining normal gene activity and keeping the cells alive. These findings could help identify which patients are suitable for treatment with these drugs. And could help develop future therapies that override the survival mechanism in tumour types that don t respond.   Lead author Dr John Halsall, Cancer Research UK scientist from the University of Birmingham, said:  Our work has shown that some cancer cells can survive the gene damage caused by HDAC inhibitor drugs, so we ve unveiled a new layer of the cancer cell s defence that we need to target to destroy tumours.  If we work out exactly which types of cancer are vulnerable to these drugs we can use them in a smarter way to treat patients more effectively.  Dr Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK s science information manager, said:  Working out how genes are switched on and off in cancer is vital if we re to truly understand and beat the disease. This study could help us tailor how we use HDAC inhibitors so that more patients could benefit from them, and we ll continue to work towards finding more effective ways to target cancer s control mechanisms in the future.

Roeder wanted to improve patients  options.The researchers boosted the contrast of mammography X-rays by modifying gold nanoparticles with molecules that bind specifically to microcalcifications. They injected a low dose of these nanoparticles into the mammary glands of mice with dense tissue. The engineered particles made the microcalcifications brighter on the X-rays   and therefore, easier to distinguish. The mice showed no obvious side effects. Although further research would be required, the scientists say the technique could eventually translate into more reliable breast cancer detection for women with dense mammary tissue.","Published: September 18, 2015"

These platelet-mimicking nanoparticles, developed by engineers at the University of California, San Diego, are capable of delivering drugs to targeted sites in the body   particularly injured blood vessels, as well as organs infected by harmful bacteria. Engineers demonstrated that by delivering the drugs just to the areas where the drugs were needed, these platelet copycats greatly increased the therapeutic effects of drugs that were administered to diseased rats and mice.  This work addresses a major challenge in the field of nanomedicine: targeted drug delivery with nanoparticles,  said Liangfang Zhang, a nanoengineering professor at UC San Diego and the senior author of the study.  Because of their targeting ability, platelet-mimicking nanoparticles can directly provide a much higher dose of medication specifically to diseased areas without saturating the entire body with drugs. The study is an excellent example of using engineering principles and technology to achieve  precision medicine,  said Shu Chien, a professor of bioengineering and medicine, director of the Institute of Engineering in Medicine at UC San Diego, and a corresponding author on the study.  While this proof of principle study demonstrates specific delivery of therapeutic agents to treat cardiovascular disease and bacterial infections, it also has broad implications for targeted therapy for other diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders,  said Chien. The ins and outs of the platelet copycats On the outside, platelet-mimicking nanoparticles are cloaked with human platelet membranes, which enable the nanoparticles to circulate throughout the bloodstream without being attacked by the immune system. The platelet membrane coating has another beneficial feature: it preferentially binds to damaged blood vessels and certain pathogens such as MRSA bacteria, allowing the nanoparticles to deliver and release their drug payloads specifically to these sites in the body. Enclosed within the platelet membranes are nanoparticle cores made of a biodegradable polymer that can be safely metabolized by the body. The nanoparticles can be packed with many small drug molecules that diffuse out of the polymer core and through the platelet membrane onto their targets. To make the platelet-membrane-coated nanoparticles, engineers first separated platelets from whole blood samples using a centrifuge. The platelets were then processed to isolate the platelet membranes from the platelet cells. Next, the platelet membranes were broken up into much smaller pieces and fused to the surface of nanoparticle cores. The resulting platelet-membrane-coated nanoparticles are approximately 100 nanometers in diameter, which is one thousand times thinner than an average sheet of paper. This cloaking technology is based on the strategy that Zhang s research group had developed to cloak nanoparticles in red blood cell membranes. The researchers previously demonstrated that nanoparticles disguised as red blood cells are capable of removing dangerous pore-forming toxins produced by MRSA, poisonous snake bites and bee stings from the bloodstream. By using the body s own platelet membranes, the researchers were able to produce platelet mimics that contain the complete set of surface receptors, antigens and proteins naturally present on platelet membranes. This is unlike other efforts, which synthesize platelet mimics that replicate one or two surface proteins of the platelet membrane.  Our technique takes advantage of the unique natural properties of human platelet membranes, which have a natural preference to bind to certain tissues and organisms in the body,  said Zhang. This targeting ability, which red blood cell membranes do not have, makes platelet membranes extremely useful for targeted drug delivery, researchers said. Platelet copycats at work In one part of this study, researchers packed platelet-mimicking nanoparticles with docetaxel, a drug used to prevent scar tissue formation in the lining of damaged blood vessels, and administered them to rats afflicted with injured arteries. Researchers observed that the docetaxel-containing nanoparticles selectively collected onto the damaged sites of arteries and healed them. When packed with a small dose of antibiotics, platelet-mimicking nanoparticles can also greatly minimize bacterial infections that have entered the bloodstream and spread to various organs in the body. Researchers injected nanoparticles containing just one-sixth the clinical dose of the antibiotic vancomycin into one of group of mice systemically infected with MRSA bacteria. The organs of these mice ended up with bacterial counts up to one thousand times lower than mice treated with the clinical dose of vancomycin alone.  Our platelet-mimicking nanoparticles can increase the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics because they can focus treatment on the bacteria locally without spreading drugs to healthy tissues and organs throughout the rest of the body,  said Zhang.  We hope to develop platelet-mimicking nanoparticles into new treatments for systemic bacterial infections and cardiovascular disease. ","Published: September 18, 2015"

A team at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in Trieste, Italy will join forces with London-based MRC Technology to take on the project, with funding provided by Alzheimer s Research UK. While people with ALS (also known as motor neurone disease or Lou Gehrig s Disease) and FTLD, the most common cause of dementia in people under the age of 50, experience different symptoms, both diseases are associated with the same biological processes. Both are characterized by the build-up of  protein clumps  - aggregates of misfolded versions of a protein called TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). This build-up can disrupt vital nerve cell communication and eventually cause nerve cell death. Sadly, no treatments exist to halt the spread of damage in these diseases. MRC Technology and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in Trieste have set out to tackle this lack of treatments and aim to identify agents capable of clearing misfolded proteins, which could form the basis of future much-needed drug development programmes. Using new investment from the Dementia Consortium, a unique charity-private partnership between Alzheimer s Research UK, MRC Technology and the pharmaceutical companies Eisai and Lilly, researchers at ICGEB will develop assays and perform high-content screening to test libraries of potential compounds for their ability to clear clumps of misfolded TDP-43. By uniting expertise across the continent, the two research teams will work in partnership to test promising drugs in cells and animals, to understand how they work and explore whether they can improve symptoms of ALS and FTLD. Dr Marco Baralle, Group Leader in Biotechnology Development at the ICGEB, commented:  Our initial research into TDP-43 has showed promising results, with some compounds able to enhance aggregate clearance by more than 50% and fully restore TDP 43 function. This funding will allow us to progress our research in collaboration with MRC Technology to the next stage.  Dr Justin Bryans, Director of Drug Discovery at MRC Technology said:  Combining the experience of ICGEB and Alzheimer s Research UK together with MRC Technology s expertise in drug discovery and translation, means we can progress promising science from academia towards effective new treatments for patients.  Dr Eric Karran, Director of Research at Alzheimer s Research UK, added:  FTLD is a rare form of dementia, but one that disproportionately impacts people under 65. Typical symptoms include behavioural and personality changes, as well as a lack of social awareness. Managing these symptoms can be incredibly challenging and we ve gone too long without a therapy that can halt nerve cell damage in the brain. By combining expertise through the Dementia Consortium, we hope to accelerate progress from academic laboratories across the world into much sought-after treatments in the clinic.  The Dementia Consortium is a unique  3m drug discovery collaboration between Alzheimer s Research UK, MRC Technology and the pharmaceutical companies Eisai and Lilly. By uniting expertise, this focused cash injection will bridge the gap between academic research and the pharmaceutical industry in the search for new drugs to slow the development of neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia. The Dementia Consortium is open to global research teams with innovative targets that need accelerating through the drug discovery process.","Published: September 18, 2015"

But you're able to slam on the brakes, just in time. Johns Hopkins University researchers, working with scientists at the National Institute on Aging, have revealed the precise nerve cells that allow the brain to make this type of split-second change of course. In the journal Nature Neuroscience, the team shows that these feats of self-control happen when neurons in the basal forebrain are silenced. ""The study discovered a new role for basal forebrain neurons in the control of action,"" said Michela Gallagher, the Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins. ""This work opens the door to novel approaches focused on this circuit in certain neurological and psychiatric conditions that affect basic cognitive functions of the brain."" The ability to rapidly stop a behavior is critical for everyday functioning -- allowing people crossing the street to freeze if a car surprises them, to not reach for their phone when it vibrates in their pocket during a meeting or, in the case of a batter, to stop from swinging at a bad pitch. A better understanding of the cognitive mechanics behind what's known as reactive inhibition could help people suffering from neurological conditions where such control is diminished -- everything from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and normal aging. Scientists had assumed the ability to stop a planned behavior occurred in the basal ganglia, an area in the brain responsible for a variety of motor control functions including the ability to start an action or a behavior. This study demonstrates, however, that the stop response happens in the basal forebrain, a part of the brain best known for regulating sleep, but also recognized as a site for early neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The researchers trained rats to play a game: If the rats quickly moved after hearing a tone, they got a treat. The rats were also rewarded if they stopped moving when a light flashed. All the while, the team monitored the rats for electrical signals in the basal forebrain. The researchers trained rats to move quickly to get a treat. After hearing a tone, the rats would rush into a new port to lick sucrose water. But, when the tone was followed by a flash of light, the rats would have to immediately stay in place to get a treat. In other words, when the light flashed, the rule of reward reversed -- instead of moving quickly to get reward, the rats had to cancel that planned response and stay still to get their treat. While the rats performed the tasks, the team monitored the activity of individual basal forebrain neurons. The researchers were also able to get the rats to stop without using the flash of light by stimulating the same neurons with a small pulse of electricity. ""In the lab, we were able to manipulate these neurons, which caused rats to stop their behavior even though they had no reason to do so,"" said lead author Jeffrey D. Mayse, who conducted the research as a Johns Hopkins doctoral student and is now a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University. ""Understanding how these cells are involved in this form of self-control expands our knowledge of the normal brain circuits involved in everyday decision-making,"" he said, ""and will be absolutely critical to developing future treatments and therapies for diseases and disorders with impaired reactive inhibition as a symptom.""

The finding could lead to more highly targeted research and, eventually, new treatments for the debilitating neurological disorder, which robs people of their memories. The study further found that one of the three variations, the cortical subtype, appears to be fundamentally a different condition than the other two, said Dr. Dale Bredesen, the study's author, a UCLA professor of neurology and member of the Easton Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Disease Research. ""Because the presentation varies from person to person, there has been suspicion for years that Alzheimer's represents more than one illness,"" said Bredesen, who also is the founding president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. ""When laboratory tests go beyond the usual tests, we find these three distinct subtypes. ""The important implications of this are that the optimal treatment may be different for each group, there may be different causes, and, for future clinical trials, it may be helpful to study specific groups separately."" The subtypes are: The findings of the two-year study, which involved metabolic testing of 50 people, appear in the current issue of the peer-reviewed journal Aging. No effective therapy for Alzheimer's exists. And scientists have yet to completely identify the cause, although multiple studies have pointed to metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, hormonal deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of an amino acid in the blood. In a 2014 paper, Bredesen showed that making lifestyle, exercise and diet changes designed to improve the body's metabolism reversed cognitive decline in nine out of 10 patients with early Alzheimer's disease or its precursors. The current finding grew out of an extensive evaluation of the data from last year's study, and it could eventually help scientists pinpoint more precise targets for treatments -- the same approach that has led to major advances in treating other diseases. For example, Bredesen explained, researchers have recently been able to develop precise treatments for cancer by sequencing tumor genomes and comparing them to the patients' genomes to better understand what drives the formation and growth of tumors. ""However, in Alzheimer's disease, there is no tumor to biopsy,"" Bredesen said. ""So how do we get an idea about what is driving the process? The approach we took was to use the underlying metabolic mechanisms of the disease process to guide the establishment of an extensive set of laboratory tests, such as fasting insulin, copper-to-zinc ratio and dozens of others."" Going forward, Bredesen and his team will seek to determine whether the subtypes have different underlying causes, and whether they respond differently to potential treatments. The need for a new approach to treat Alzheimer's is urgent. It is the most common age-related dementia, and the number of people with the disease in the U.S. is expected to increase to 15 million in 2050, from nearly 6 million today. The cost to treat people in the U.S. with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to be $226 billion in 2015 alone, and could reach $1.1 trillion in 2050.

But a new study led by the University of Colorado (CU) Boulder and the Medical Research Council s Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England shows for the first time that evening caffeine delays the internal circadian clock that tells us when to get ready for sleep and when to prepare to wake up. The research team showed the amount of caffeine in a double espresso or its equivalent three hours before bedtime induced a 40-minute phase delay in the roughly 24-hour human biological clock.   The study also showed for the first time how caffeine affects  cellular timekeeping  in the human body, said CU-Boulder Professor Kenneth Wright, who co-led the study with John O Neill of the Medical Research Council s Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge. While it has been known that caffeine influences circadian clocks of even primitive creatures like algae and fruit flies, the new study shows that the internal clocks in human cells can be impacted by caffeine intake.  This is the first study to show that caffeine, the mostly widely used psychoactive drug in the world, has an influence on the human circadian clock,  said Wright, a professor in CU-Boulder s Department of Integrative Physiology.  It also provides new and exciting insights into the effects of caffeine on human physiology.  A paper on the subject led by Wright and O Neill is being published online in the Sept. 16 issue of Science Translational Medicine. For the study the team recruited five human subjects, three females and two males, who went though a double-blind, placebo-controlled 49-day protocol through CU-Boulder s Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory, which is directed by Wright. The subjects were tested under four conditions: low light and a placebo pill; low light and the equivalent of a 200-milligram caffeine pill dependent on the subject s weight; bright light and a placebo pill; and bright light and the caffeine pill. Saliva samples of each participant were tested periodically during the study for levels of the hormone melatonin, which is produced naturally by the pineal gland when directed to do so by the brain s  master clock.  The master clock is re-set by exposure to light and coordinates cellular clocks throughout the human body. Melatonin levels in the blood increase to signal the onset of biological nighttime during each 24-hour period and decrease at the start of biological daytime, said Wright. Those who took the caffeine pill under low-light conditions were found to have a roughly 40-minute delay in their nightly circadian rhythm compared to those who took the placebo pill under low light conditions, said Wright. The magnitude of delay from the caffeine dose was about half that of the delay induced in test subjects by a three-hour exposure to bright, overhead light that began at each person s normal bedtime. The study also showed that bright light alone and bright light combined with caffeine induced circadian phase delays in the test subjects of about 85 minutes and 105 minutes respectively. There were no significant differences between the dim light/caffeine combination and the bright light/placebo combination. Nor were there significant differences between the bright light/placebo and bright light/caffeine combinations. The results may indicate a  ceiling  was reached in the phase delay of the human circadian clock due to the external factors, Wright said. In addition, researchers at O Neill s lab at the LMB in Cambridge used  reporter  genes that made cells glow when the clock genes were expressed to measure changes caused by caffeine. O Neill s group showed that caffeine can block cell receptors of the neurotransmitter adenosine, which normally promotes sleep and suppresses arousal. The results may help to explain why caffeine-drinking  night owls  go to bed later and wake up later and may have implications for the treatment of some circadian sleep-wake disorders, said Wright. The new results could benefit travelers. Properly timed caffeine use could help shift the circadian clocks of those flying west over multiple time zones, said Wright. In a 2013 study, Wright and his research team showed one week of camping in the Rocky Mountains with no artificial light, not even flashlights, synchronized the circadian clocks of the eight study subjects with the timing of sunrise and sunset.

The potential game-changer is an ex vivo (out of body) circulatory system that has come to be called  heart in a box.   Its manufacturer is TransMedics of Andover, Mass.  The technological advance of this device is that it circulates blood into the aorta and the coronary arteries, and the heart will be beating again all the way to its new home,  said Jason Smith, a cardiothoracic surgeon and transplant specialist at UW Medical Center.  When someone dies and their heart is made available for transplant, a four- to six-hour window exists between harvest and implant. That s how long the organ can be packed in an icy saline slush in a hand-held cooler   the standard of care for decades   and still be reliably restarted. That window of viability dictates the distance from which transplant centers accept donor hearts.   The idea with heart in a box is that because blood is perfusing the heart, you can keep the organ out of the body considerably longer. In Europe, they ve gone up to 11 hours on the machine and still had a successful transplant,  Smith said. Beyond extending the range of organ procurement, the device might also increase the number of intended donor hearts that are actually transplanted. This is what the trial will examine. Hospitals are cautiously selective about the donor hearts they accept in order to give transplant procedures the best chance to succeed. If a prospective donor s heart has an abnormal echocardiogram or electrocardiogram, it is usually rejected, Smith said.  We avoid any donor organ we think might have a performance problem. But sometimes, we think the poor echo or EKG is related to the injury that caused the donor to be brain-dead.   It s an important consideration. In January, UW and other researchers suggested that half of all rejected donor hearts may in fact be transplant-viable. Their study said that chemicals released by the injured brain  stuns  the hearts and makes them function poorly, but that this may be a temporary state from which the hearts recover.  With the new technology, we think we could go get some of these hearts whose function is marginal, put it on the device for four to six hours and, if the heart function maintains or improves, then that increases our confidence in its viability for transplant,  he said. In the box, the heart s function   how well it s squeezing, how the muscle walls are moving, the metabolic output   all can be monitored.   This would allow us to look at these hearts out of the donor environment and potentially utilize some of them that we re not currently using,  Smith said. The trial of the TransMedics  portable Organ Care System will evaluate its effectiveness to  recruit, preserve and assess donor hearts that may not meet current standard donor-heart acceptance criteria for transplantation,  the study protocol states.","Published: September 17, 2015"

This is thanks to systems of precise control over the expression of the genes required for each type of cell, for which an enzyme called RNA polymerase II is largely responsible. Now, a multidisciplinary team of Stanford scientists has observed this enzyme transcribing DNA in real time in the highest detail ever. The work is a crucial piece in understanding one of the most fundamental mechanisms in biology, and could some day lead to several medical advances. ""If you ask about the fundamental molecules in all of life, the conversation starts with the molecules that carry out replication, transcription and translation of genetic code into protein,"" said Steven Block, a Stanford professor of applied physics and of biology. ""There is no biology without them, and in higher organisms, RNA polymerase II is one of these molecules."" RNA polymerase II (pol II) plays the key role of transcribing genetic code from DNA into segments of RNA, which pass those instructions on to the molecular machinery that assemble proteins. In order to do this, pol II needs the help of other molecules to form a multi-protein assembly called the preinitiation complex (PIC), which can pry apart the DNA's double-stranded helix and begin the process. As the PIC attaches to a section of DNA, it unwinds the helix and separates the two strands, forming a sort of ""bubble"" for the enzyme to sneak in and commence its work. The project was made possible by what Block, the senior author, describes as a ""tour de force"" of biochemistry from study co-author Kenji Murakami, a former postdoc in Roger Kornberg's lab at Stanford School of Medicine, to build a PIC. Working at Stanford with Kornberg, Murakami, now at the University of Pennsylvania, expressed and assembled 32 different proteins from yeast into the exact molecular machine that is required in higher organisms. ""What he built is fully functional, and together, we got it to work in my lab at the single-molecule level, which is the first time it has even been attempted with an assembly this complex,"" Block said. ""Even without everything else we learned during this work, this is a significant technical breakthrough."" Next, they loaded the handmade PIC and a section of template DNA into a custom-built apparatus called an optical trap, in which two powerful lasers essentially hold on to either end of the genetic material. As the PIC initiated pol II activity and began to transcribe the template DNA, it either pulled or pushed the strands of DNA, and this motion affected the light scattered from a third laser in the apparatus. This tiny change in light scattering allowed the researchers to measure the motions of the PIC all the way down to the nanometer level. The sensitivity of their apparatus allowed the researchers not only to measure the size of the bubble created by the PIC but also to observe the activity of a separate transcription factor, called TFIIH, that serves as the molecular motor to help push the PIC along at the start. (Their equipment is so sensitive, Block said, that the researchers have to conduct their measurements during the night or on weekends, so that it doesn't pick up vibrations from recent campus construction.) The researchers were pleased to see the motor in action, as it hadn't been documented before, but it was the size of the transcription bubble   the loop of DNA created to allow the gene to be converted to DNA   that was particularly exciting. Although scientists had seen a similar bubble in bacteria, the version they observed in higher organisms was enormous, at over 10 times larger. Block said that these discoveries all together add to a growing picture of both how the transcription of genes gets turned on and the factors that control and modulate that activity. ""If you want to understand how genetics works, you need to understand how genes are controlled, and the decision about whether or not to transcribe a gene is control at its most fundamental level,"" Block said. ""There's great merit in understanding something that's truly fundamental in science. It doesn't matter if you're a pathogen, a plant or a person, this process is central to your biology."" A better understanding of the transcription mechanism, Block said, may allow scientists to begin to devise ways to interfere with it or manipulate the rate at which it operates. Both these approaches could inform the design of drug therapies to treat diseases that hinge on the activation or regulation of various genes.","Published: September 17, 2015"

The  Train the Trainer  session enabled bioinformaticians engaged in training to develop their training skills in particular, in designing and delivering de novo assembly training. A topic identified as one of the key training needs for Australia, given the breadth of species that the collaborative groups are researching.De novo allows genome analysis without previous DNA material as a reference using short reads of DNA to assemble longer, more complex, reads to construct the whole genome. The processes involved in de novo assembly, and crucially steps in quality assessment of DNA assemblies, are essential for researchers studying non-model organisms i.e. non-human species, the study of which can provide further insight into unique biological traits. Designed and delivered by Head of the 361  Division at TGAC, Dr Vicky Schneider, the course allowed delegates to develop their own training style and course materials for a modular approach in training researchers across Australia who aim to study non-model organisms. As well as shaping the research carried out by the delegates, the workshop impacted upon their delivery of key skills to colleagues and further afield, including a comprehensive training materials library. Dr Schneider, said:  I am thrilled to launch the TGAC  Train the Trainer  programme which will bring sustainability and long-term impact of our efforts in bioinformatics training and related areas. I have been involved previously with the design and launch of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) train the trainer and roll-out of the courses across Australia.   It s fantastic to have the opportunity to engage in discussions about improving training for genome assembly. I hope the subsequent training courses in Australia will enable users with biological and computational background alike to have a deeper understanding of the de novo method, and ultimately conduct better genomic research, said Bernardo Clavijo, Algorithmic Development Project Leader at TGAC.  I am looking forward to continuing this effort in Australia when I visit to help with the first round of training later this year.  Dr Emily Angiolini, Scientific Training and Education Team Manager at TGAC, said:  The impact of this course is far reaching, given that we had representatives from Australian research centres with diverse research interests but one commonality   non-model organisms   we have the opportunity to cascade these skills to enable an entire continent to carry out de novo assembly with further application of this training model to groups of trainers across the UK, Europe and beyond.   Australia has a unique and diverse flora and fauna, and a unique opportunity to describe this resource with modern genomics. But to do this we need to strengthen bioinformatics literacy and capacity for Australian researchers,  said Andrew Gilbert, General Manager of Bioplatforms Australia. Developing the skills of our trainers and imparting this knowledge to the local research community is an essential and integral part of our program and we look forward to continue our collaboration with TGAC. Dr Annette McGrath, Bioinformatics Core Leader at CSIRO, added:  This was a really fantastic opportunity for our researchers to learn more about best practices in developing and delivering training courses to professional scientists. The lessons learnt during this programme, and which will be applied during the subsequent roll-out of the courses in Australia, will help our researchers to successfully impart their de novo genome assembly knowledge, to enhance bioinformatics capability in Australia.""","Published: September 17, 2015"

Protein therapeutics represent a significant share of the top 50 drugs globally and are increasingly present in developmental pipelines.  The provision and licensing of bioproduction cells for their manufacture, however, can be cost prohibitive and are often tied to long-term revenue-based licensing terms. Horizon s flexible licensing model with simplified terms and no associated royalties allows any organization with ambitions in the biopharmaceutical marketplace, including small to medium size biotechs and Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs), to access state of the art bioproduction cell lines. For this program, Horizon used its gene editing expertise to introduce specific genetic changes into the CHO K1 cell line, leading to a functional knockout of the Glutamine Synthetase (GS) gene. This enables metabolic selection of cells producing high levels of valuable recombinant protein-based drugs. The GS knockout reduces the timelines and costs involved in identifying a final manufacturing clone, and eliminates the need for use of toxic and expensive chemical inhibitors. The potential market for such cell lines for biopharmaceutical production is significant, with over 1,600 active programs in pipelines worldwide.   LakePharma has adapted Horizon s CHO cell for suspension growth, the preferred cell cultivation method for many manufacturing applications.  Subsequently, LakePharma carried out a full evaluation of protein expression on the CHO cell line, showing significantly higher antibody production levels relative to their previous system. The evaluation also demonstrated the ability to identify a final expression clone after a relatively simple screening effort.     In alignment with strategic priorities, Horizon has leveraged this development effort in order to ensure that this cutting edge cell line is now available for other organizations to license from Horizon for the manufacturing of biological therapeutics.  Dr Darrin M Disley, Horizon s Chief Executive Officer, said:  The license agreement with LakePharma, the first of its kind, serves as recognition and validation of our approach to developing novel bioproduction cell lines. Until now, cell line development has been a rate-limiting step for improving upstream bioprocessing. With precise gene editing we are able to provide a key step in the path toward delivering next generation biological medicines. We look forward to seeing further uptake of this approach within the industry.  Dr. Fan Chen, Director of Bioprocessing, LakePharma, said:  The license agreement with Horizon allows us to offer a superior expression cell line to our customers, providing better value to them, while the one-time fee allows us maximal flexibility to utilize the cells to their best effect. I am delighted that the hard work we put in to adapting these cells has been reflected in their commercialization by Horizon. ","Published: September 17, 2015"

""Epigenetic modifications do not involve structural alterations of the DNA sequence, as in the case of genetic mutations. Instead, they are chemical modifications of the DNA structure at specific sites that lead to the 'hypermethylation' or 'hypomethylation' of specific DNA elements that regulate gene expression. ""Cancer was the first human disease in which epigenetic modifications were found to play an important role in development and progression,"" explained Maio. Maio said that his team recently provided comprehensive evidence demonstrating that epigenetic changes play a major role in downregulating or shutting off the expression of certain cell-surface molecules that play a crucial role in the efficient recognition and elimination of cancer cells by the immune system. As a result, cancer cells become ""invisible"" to the immune system, which cannot eliminate them from the body. ""Based on experimental evidence from our studies, we expect that epigenetic drugs could be efficiently utilized to restore the expression of these molecules, thus rendering cancer cells again 'visible' to the immune system to effectively eliminate them,"" Maio said. In addition, epigenetic drugs can also act by lowering or eliminating specific subsets of immune cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which have been shown to facilitate tumor growth, Maio explained.  Maio and colleagues delineated in this review article evidence from preclinical studies that provides the rationale behind combining epigenetic therapies with immunotherapies such as interleukin-2 therapy, adoptive T-cell transfer, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, among others. ""The data we generated in a mouse model demonstrated that combining epigenetic drugs, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine and guadecitabine, with immunomodulating antibodies that target CTLA-4 or the PD-1/PDL-1 immune checkpoint improves the therapeutic efficacy of each drug utilized alone. Based on this experimental evidence, we have now designed a phase Ib clinical trial in which guadecitabine and the anti-CTLA-4 immunomodulating monoclonal antibody ipilimumab will be given in sequence as first-line or second-line therapy to metastatic melanoma patients; this study is sponsored by the NIBITFoundation and partially supported by Astex Pharmaceuticals,"" Maio added. The review article also provides a comprehensive overview of all ongoing clinical trials that are evaluating combinations of epigenetic drugs and immunotherapy against many cancer types, including leukemias, metastatic melanoma, metastatic kidney cancer, peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, non-small cell lung cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer. ""The major and well-known side effect of DNMTi is myelotoxicity, which poses limits to their dosage and length of administration, and needs to be carefully monitored in the course of treatment,"" Maio cautioned. ""Along this line, combination regimens with these epigenetic drugs have to be carefully reasoned and evaluated for potential additive myelotoxicity,"" he added. ""Like the tango, which takes two and in perfect syntony, the most successful results with cancer immunotherapies will require a perfect interaction between patients' immune systems and their cancer cells. In light of their powerful immunomodulating potential, epigenetic drugs are seemingly the best 'partner drugs' to emerging immunotherapies to achieve this perfect interaction, and will most likely provide additional clinical benefit to cancer patients treated with state-of-the-art immunotherapeutic drugs,"" Maio said.","Published: September 17, 2015"

Transplanted stem cells can differentiate into just about any other kind of cell, including neurons to potentially reconnect a severed spinal cord and repair paralysis. A variety of agents have been shown to induce transplanted stem cells to differentiate into neurons.  Exosomes are very small, hollow particles that are secreted from many types of cells. They contain functional proteins and genetic materials and serve as a vehicle for communication between cells. In the nervous system, exosomes guide the direction of nerve growth, control nerve connection and help regenerate peripheral nerves.In a series of experiments  the Tufts researchers showed that exosomes from PC12 cells (neuron-like progenitor cells derived from rats) at various stages of their own differentiation could, in turn, cause hMSCs to become neuron-like cells. Exosomes had not previously been studied as a way to induce human stem cell differentiation. The biomedical engineers also showed that the exosomes contain miRNAs tiny pieces of RNA that regulate cell behavior and are known to play a role in neuronal differentiation. The researchers hypothesize that the exosomes caused the hMSCs to differentiate by delivering miRNA into the stem cells. The researchers plan future studies to determine the exact mechanism. Synthetic Exosomes Could Avoid Need for Neural Progenitor Cells ""In combination with synthetic nanoparticles that my laboratory is developing, we may ultimately be able to use these identified miRNAs or proteins to make synthetic exosomes, thereby avoiding the need to use any kind of neural progenitor cell line to induce neuron growth,"" said the paper's senior and corresponding author Qiaobing Xu, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Tufts School of Engineering.  Xu's work focuses on material science engineering, specifically nanoscience and its biomedical application: the development of new synthetic materials for the delivery of therapeutic proteins and genetic material. In 2015, he received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the National Science Foundation (NSF), funding research into a new way to deliver protein-based cancer-fighting drugs and other therapeutics directly into cells.

This stretch of DNA, called an enhancer, controls the molecular switch BCL11A. This switch, in turn, determines whether a red blood cell produces the adult form of hemoglobin--which in SCD is mutated--or a fetal form that is unaffected by and counteracts the effects of the sickle mutation. Other studies indicate that sickle cell patients with elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin have a milder form of the disease. The new study--led by Stuart Orkin, MD, and Daniel Bauer, MD, PhD, of Dana-Farber/Boston Children's, and Feng Zhang, PhD, of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard--was spurred by the discovery that naturally occurring beneficial variations in the DNA sequence in this enhancer dial down BCL11A only in red blood cells.To mimic and improve upon the effects of these variations, the research team used recently developed CRISPR-based gene editing tools to systematically cut out tiny sections of DNA step-by-step along the entire length of the enhancer in blood stem cells from human donors. They then allowed the cells to mature into red blood cells and found that the amount of fetal hemoglobin the cells produced had increased substantially. The team's experiments revealed a specific location in the enhancer that when cut leads to production of high levels of fetal hemoglobin. Parallel experiments in an animal model revealed that removal of this part of the enhancer affected BCL11A's expression only in red blood cells, not in immune or brain cells, where BCL11A is also active. These findings show that the effects are restricted to red blood cells, and that other cell types are unaffected. ""There was no efficient way of conducting this kind of experiment until now,"" said Bauer, a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's. ""Our goal was to break the enhancer, rather than fix the hemoglobin mutation, but to do so in very precise ways that are only possible since gene editing technologies like CRISPR became available."" Interest in exploring the potential clinical uses of the BCL11A switch has grown since Orkin's laboratory revealed its direct role in the transition from fetal to adult hemoglobin in Nature in 2009. Another important step came in 2013, when the journal Science published their report of the discovery of the enhancer that directs expression of BCL11A only in red blood cells. ""We've now targeted the modifier of the modifier of a disease-causing gene,"" explained Orkin, a leader of Dana-Farber/Boston Children's who serves as chairman of pediatric oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and associate chief of hematology/oncology at Boston Children's Hospital. ""It's a very different approach to treating disease."" The data provide proof of principle that targeted edits to BCL11A's enhancer in blood stem cells could be an attractive approach for curing SCD and related conditions. ""These experiments may have revealed the genetic Achilles heel of sickle cell disease,"" said Orkin. ""Alterations to these specific portions of the enhancer have the same effect as knocking the whole enhancer out altogether, suggesting that this could be a promising strategy to translate into the clinic."" ""Although fixing the sickle mutation itself would seem the most straightforward approach, it turns out that blood stem cells, the ultimate targets for this kind of therapy, are much more resistant to genetic repair than to genetic disruption,"" Bauer added. ""Therefore, making a single DNA cut that breaks the enhancer solely in blood stem cells could be a much more feasible strategy.""","Published: September 17, 2015"

The expanded documentation and regulatory information facilitates drug product manufacturers  risk assessment workflows and supplier qualification. The enhancements also help drug product manufacturers meet their own internal quality guidelines as well as those recently published by the European Commission. This was the first regulatory body to formalize risk assessment requirements for pharmaceutical excipients, despite the practice being common in industry. The EMPROVE  portfolio includes approximately 400 raw and starting materials used in the manufacture of drug products and includes excipients, process chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The newest enhancements enable the selection of raw and starting materials best suited for applications, based on their risk assessment:   EMPROVE  Essential products target moderate risk level applications.  EMPROVE  Expert products are specified for higher risk applications where low microbiological and endotoxin levels are critical. Our manufacturing processes are designed to create products with low microbiological and endotoxin levels.  EMPROVE  API products provide the quality and regulatory documentation required for active pharmaceutical ingredients. GMP requirements are fulfilled, as all products are produced in Europe, according to the ICH Q7 guideline. In addition to the currently-available Material Qualification Dossier (formerly referred to as the Basic Dossier) drug manufacturers can obtain two new dossiers for regulatory information. These new dossiers help streamline and accelerate the costly and time consuming information collection and risk assessment process. The GxP Dossier is structured according to the new EU guideline 2015/C 95/02 and supports risk assessment and supplier qualification for excipients. With greater detail on raw material properties, the new Operational Excellence Dossier helps drug manufacturers design more consistent and predictable processes and quality. This dossier includes elemental impurity profiles that address the ICH Q3D guideline requirements published in December 2014. Drug manufacturers have an option to use the new online EMPROVE  Suite website. This platform provides product information and dossiers for the entire EMPROVE  portfolio and enables direct, 24/7 access to the comprehensive regulatory information.  The global pharmaceutical industry adheres to the strictest standards, and risk assessment plays a critical role in supplier qualification,  said Andrew Bulpin, Executive Vice President, Process Solutions, Merck Millipore.  With these enhancements, customers can continue to rely on the EMPROVE  documentation to guide, facilitate and speed their process of qualifying raw materials from Merck Millipore. The content is invaluable when filing their drug products, resulting in greater confidence and minimized risk throughout the manufacturing process.  Merck Millipore representatives will be available at stand #7K40 at the CPhI conference in October in Madrid, Spain to discuss the EMPROVE  portfolio and these new enhancements.","Published: September 17, 2015"

The two closely related regulatory genes are active in the normal development of mammals and govern how RNAs produced from the genes are joined to make final versions of the encoded protein, a process called alternative splicing. The study concerns the genes Esrp1 andEsrp2, which have become the focus of much research in recent years, due to their evident roles in development and cancer.  Clearly there are many important roles for these genes in facial, skin and, organ development, and we re only just starting to catalogue them,  said Russ P. Carstens, MD, an associate professor of Medicine (Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension Division) and Genetics.Carstens and his colleagues were the first to identify Esrp1 and Esrp2,in 2009, as molecular switches for alternative splicing, in which the initial RNA transcript of a gene s DNA code is cut up and put back together in different arrangements. Alternative splicing affects most mammalian genes, and effectively enables the production of distinct protein variants (called isoforms) from the same gene. Which protein isoforms are produced depends on the cell type and other physiological circumstances. Esrp1 and Esrp2 are active specifically in epithelial cells, which form the skin, the inner layers of the gut and lung, and other tissues in the body. In those cells the Esrp1 and Esrp2 proteins enforce epithelial-specific splicing isoforms for hundreds of different genes, as Carstens and his team have shown in studies since 2009. What s more, the researchers discovered two years ago that the suppression of Esrp activity helps to enable a process called the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells acquire properties allowing them to detach and develop into new tissue. EMT is crucial for normal embryonic development, but also operates in wound healing, and when abnormally switched on, can enable the spread of tumor cells. These early studies were in laboratory-cultured cells. In the eLife study, Carstens and his colleagues engineered mice without Esrp1, Esrp2, or both. They found that mice lacking Esrp1 alonewere born alive but with cleft palate and cleft lip deformities that prevented feeding. All died within hours.  This finding really shows that epithelial-specific splicing is important for the normal development of the face and palate cleft lip and palate are among the most common congenital conditions,  Carstens said. Mice lacking only Esrp2, which is likely to have evolved as a backup duplicated copy to cover some functions of Esrp1, appeared normal, as long as Esrp1 was present. Mice lacking both genes displayed more pronounced abnormalities. Their embryos had more profound defects than were seen in the Esrp1-null mice, including craniofacial and forelimb defects, and the complete absence of lungs and salivary glands two organs made up largely of epithelial cells. In collaboration with Yi Xing from UCLA, the team catalogued and analyzed how gene expression patterns in skin cells differed among the Esrp knockouts and found hundreds of significant changes. The analysis suggested, among other findings, that the lack of both Esrp1 and Esrp2 leads to serious defects in skin development. Because mice lacking both genes would not be born alive, the scientists followed up this lead by making  conditional knockout mice,  in which Esrp1 and Esrp2 activity was normal early in fetal development, but then was switched off in skin epithelial cells. The resulting mice perished within a day of being born.  They basically became dehydrated and died because their skin couldn t keep water and fluid in,  Carstens said. These flaws, called epithelial barrier defects, feature in human disorders, including in the skin, gut, and lung. Carstens hopes that further study of Esrp1 and Esrp2, and in particular the proteins whose splice isoforms they control, will uncover useful clues about how these defects arise and how they might be remedied. He also hopes that the Esrp1-knockout mice will prove to be a valuable new model for studying cleft lip.  There have been many knockout mouse models of cleft palate, but very few of cleft lip, which is actually the more common defect in humans,  Carstens said. The team is now working on other conditional knockout and gene expression studies of Esrp1 and Esrp2 s roles in the face, lungs, gut, kidney, and other organs.","Published: September 17, 2015"

Matus: The fourth-year PhD student in computational and systems biology at MIT is part of a team collecting samples of sewage to understand community health and behavior.  Although sewage is something most people prefer to leave out of sight and out of mind, Matus says that it is a gold mine of information. A small sample of sewage is likely to contain a variety of biomarkers that can yield data on infectious and chronic diseases such as influenza and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  It s not something that people really like to talk about,  Matus says.  But human waste can actually tell us a lot about health. A worldly scholar Unsurprisingly, it wasn t exactly her dream from day one to study sewage and stool samples; Matus  research arose from interests in water scarcity and treatment. She grew up in San Luis Potos , Mexico   an arid, landlocked city plagued by water shortages. Today s residents of San Luis Potos  only receive water two or three days a week from deep underground wells, which they have to ration to last until the next delivery. But well water can be dangerous if not filtered properly, and after finishing college in Mexico, Matus moved to the Netherlands for graduate school to study water treatment at Wageningen University. There, sewage was seen as something to treat and swiftly dispose of. But she began to wonder if there could be anything useful about it, too. In the MIT lab of Eric Alm, an associate professor of biological engineering, she found that the answer is yes. Community health The project that Matus is now involved in has two goals: collecting sewage samples from manholes around Cambridge and Boston, and collecting stool samples from individuals. Though both have the same aim   to use human waste as a resource for understanding health   one is firmly entrenched in community health, while the other focuses on individuals  health. All of the sewers Matus samples service at least 4,000 people, enabling her to get a picture of when and where infectious diseases crop up, and how they spread   allowing her to potentially contribute this information toward efforts to keep such diseases at bay. The project, called  Underworlds,  has been piloted in several locations throughout Cambridge, and will soon move to a full-size experiment in 10 locations across the greater Boston area. The engineers Matus works with at the Alm Lab and MIT s Senseable City Lab are in the process of designing automated collectors to be stationed at each of the 10 manholes. The system will both eliminate the need for a person to sample sewage   not a job that Matus or her colleagues are especially quick to volunteer for   and will also synchronize collection across all 10 locations, making it easier to compare samples. In selecting sewage collection locations, Matus was looking to capture snapshots of health in a variety of communities   commercial, residential, and academic   and across socioeconomic boundaries. Because the areas she collects from service thousands of people, it s impossible to trace the information back to any one person, building, or household   but that s exactly what she s going for, aiming to gather biomarkers for a population without infringing on privacy. Soon, a $4 million grant will kick in from the the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences, through Kuwait-MIT Center for Natural Resources and the Environment, which will continue to fund this work for three years. Working with the public Using a similar approach, Matus hopes to tackle health predictions on the individual level to better understand IBD. This gastrointestinal disease disrupts everyday life for about 1 million Americans, yet very little is known about what causes flares. By analyzing stool samples and keeping a record of what individuals are eating, Matus, along with researchers from the MIT Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, aims initially to predict flares   to at least provide sufferers of IBD with some kind of warning that discomfort may be around the corner. But going forward, she hopes her research will yield a better understanding of what causes the disease in the first place. Convincing people to donate stool samples can be a barrier to the research, so Matus hopes to work with engineers to develop technologies to obtain samples more easily and seamlessly.   In this work, she s become acutely aware of the importance of tone in working with the public. She has found that while those with IBD want answers, they are also sensitive to blame. So she steers clear of phrasing such as,  You ate mushrooms two days ago, and that s why a flare might occur.  Instead, she might opt for something less accusatory, such as,  We found traces of mushroom in your sample, which your body is having a hard time metabolizing.  Her work with the public extends beyond just the IBD study; Matus has been working closely with the Boston Public Health Commission and the Cambridge Public Health Department to keep both arms of her research grounded.  I want to design systems to tackle problems that have real people on the other end of them,  says Matus. She expects that her desire to guide her experiments with real-world needs will nudge her toward a career in industry after she completes her PhD.","Published: September 17, 2015"

In the U.S. it is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of LDL-C; and as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies for the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), who require additional lowering of LDL-C. In July, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for Repatha for the treatment of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or from whom a statin is contraindicated; and as a treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies.  The effect of Repatha on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Corlanor was approved by the FDA in April to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35 percent, who are in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate > 70 beats per minute (bpm) and either are on maximally tolerated doses of beta blockers or have a contraindication to beta blocker use. Omecamtiv mecarbil is a small molecule activator of cardiac myosin in Phase 2, which is being investigated for the treatment of heart failure in collaboration with Cytokinetics.","Published: September 17, 2015"

The research collaboration brings together Amgen's capabilities in target discovery and protein therapeutics with Xencor's XmAb  bispecific technology platform. The collaboration includes molecular engineering by Xencor and the preclinical development of bispecific molecules for five programs proposed by Amgen, leveraging XmAb bispecific Fc domains to make half-life extended T cell engagers and dual targeting bispecific antibodies. The agreement also includes a preclinical bispecific T cell engager program directed at CD38 and CD3 for multiple myeloma. Amgen will be fully responsible for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization worldwide. Under the terms of the agreement, Xencor will receive a $45 million upfront payment and up to $1.7 billion in clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments in total for the six programs. Xencor is eligible to receive mid to high single-digit royalties for candidates directed against Amgen's targets, and high single to low double-digit royalties for Xencor's CD38 bispecific T cell engager. ""We are pleased to be joining forces with Xencor to expand our immuno-oncology and inflammation position by leveraging Amgen's antibodies and Xencor's bispecific antibody platform,"" said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""We are especially excited about the T cell engaging bispecific antibody directed against CD38, which complements Amgen's BiTE  platform, while growing our hematology and oncology portfolio that includes two bispecific T cell engager antibodies, BLINCYTO  (blinatumomab) and AMG 330, as well as Kyprolis  (carfilzomib) for relapsed multiple myeloma."" Bispecific technologies seek to engineer monoclonal antibodies to bind two unique drug targets, as opposed to traditional antibodies designed to bind to a single antigen target. This approach represents a powerful opportunity in immuno-oncology to simultaneously engage immune cells and tumor cells to localize anti-tumor immune activity where it is needed most. ""Amgen, which has pioneered the use of bispecific antibodies, has chosen to access our XmAb bispecific technology for its robustness, long half-life, and the plug and play ease-of-development of our platform,"" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Xencor.

Introduction of this application system sets the stage for the network to advance its core mission: to diagnose patients who suffer from conditions that even skilled physicians have been unable to diagnose despite extensive clinical investigation. These diseases are difficult for doctors to diagnose because they are rarely seen, have not previously been described or are unrecognized forms of more common diseases. The new system streamlines the application process. All applications for the UDN will go through the Gateway, rather through individual clinical sites in the network. The Gateway replaces what had previously been a paper-and-mail application process for the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP), which is now part of the UDN.  Although undiagnosed conditions present an array of challenges for clinicians, once identified, they may lead to treatments for individual patients. They also may lead to new, generalizable medical insights,  said James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of NIH s Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), which provides financial support and joint leadership for the network via the NIH Common Fund.  The UDN Gateway will provide patients and their families access to the nation s leading diagnostic teams and sophisticated diagnostic tools.  The UDN grew out of both the success of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Since its 2008 launch, the UDP has reviewed more than 3,100 applications from patients around the world. More than 800 patients have been enrolled for a one-week evaluation. While approximately 25 percent of those have received some level of clinical, molecular or biochemical diagnosis, many patients remain undiagnosed. By adding six additional clinical sites to the original NIH UDP, the UDN will broaden its diagnostic expertise while expanding the opportunity for patients to participate. These additional clinical sites are:   Baylor College of Medicine, Houston   Duke Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, with Columbia University, New York City   Harvard Teaching Hospitals (Brigham and Women s Hospital, Boston Children s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital), Boston   Stanford Medical Center, Stanford, California   University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center   Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. By the summer of 2017, each new clinical site will accept about 50 patients per year. The network has also brought on board two DNA sequencing facilities. One is at the Baylor College of Medicine, and the other is at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama, with Illumina in San Diego. The broader geographic distribution of sites in the UDN is intended to better serve patients. To support this collaboration on undiagnosed diseases, the UDN Coordinating Center at Harvard Medical School Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) created the UDN Gateway as a centralized online application site.  The Gateway is an important part of the infrastructure that we are establishing for the UDN,  said Rachel Ramoni, D.M.D., Ph.D.  Our goal is to match 21st century medicine with 21st century technology by creating a comprehensive and streamlined online application process.  Dr. Ramoni serves as executive director and a principal investigator of the UDN Coordinating Center at DBMI. Those who are accepted will be seen by researchers and physicians from a wide array of medical specialties and may have their DNA sequenced to detect variations in genes that may underpin their disorders.  The UDN aims to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases,  said Anastasia Wise, Ph.D., program director, NHGRI Division of Genomic Medicine and co-coordinator for the NIH Common Fund's Undiagnosed Diseases Network.  Based upon the experience of the NIH UDP, we know that the need and potential are great. The UDN Gateway will expand our ability to connect with patients who may benefit from the UDN. We want to make it as easy as possible for patients and their families to apply to participate in the network. ","Published: September 17, 2015"

Led by Harvard s Pardis Sabeti, an international team of researchers sequenced the genomes of hundreds of samples of Lassa fever collected from patients in Africa, and found that, unlike Ebola, which is most often spread through human contact, Lassa cases largely come through contact with infected rodents.   With Ebola, you have an initial spillover event, and then you have a consistent human-to-human transmission chain,  said researcher Kristian Andersen, a former postdoctoral fellow at the Broad Institute and now an assistant professor at the Scripps Research Institute.  Most new Ebola patients get the disease from other patients, so the focus needs to be on isolation to break that chain.  But for Lassa it s very different,  he continued.  What we found is each patient coming in is a new spillover event. So every Lassa patient we see, we believe   got infected from the rodent reservoir.  As a result, what works for halting the spread of one disease isn t effective against the other.  When you look at the clinical symptoms they re quite similar, but the viruses themselves are quite different, and the way they behave is different   and because of that the way we intervene is different,  he said.  In Lassa, our focus needs to be on preventing that spillover event.  The team began work on Lassa several years ago, developing techniques   particularly the notion of sequencing the virus  genome to understand how it is transmitted   that established the groundwork for their Ebola research. The Sabeti lab s interest in Lassa began after research found signals of selection that suggested humans might have evolved a genetic resistance to the disease, Andersen said.  When a patient comes in with Lassa, a blood sample is taken for diagnostic purposes,  he said.  We take whatever is left over and developed methods to sequence the virus and analyze the results.  Among those results were some surprises, particularly the idea that certain individuals may be infected with Lassa long before showing symptoms.  There s data to suggest that some individuals   maybe about 5 percent of our patients   have carried the virus for months rather than weeks,  Andersen said. That seeming immunity, Andersen said, could be linked to previous infection. Because the earlier infection produced antibodies to the disease, the patient s immune system initially fights off reinfection. Eventually, however, mutations in the virus can allow it to escape the antibodies, so that it can replicate and cause illness. It s a process researchers are hoping to better understand, Andersen said, in part through working with clinicians to ensure their data is used both in diagnosis and toward development of possible Lassa vaccines.  One thing this paper shows is that Lassa is very diverse,  Andersen said.  That s something we need to take into consideration as we try to develop any vaccine. Lassa in Sierra Leone, from a genetic perspective, is very different from Lassa in Nigeria, so we may need to think about a country-specific vaccine strategy.  What is clear, Andersen said, is that genetic sequencing represents a powerful new weapon against disease.  We re no longer guessing, we re looking at hard data,  he said.  The advent of genetic sequencing allows us to detect the presence of these viruses, but also to understand how it is they re transmitting, how they re spreading, and how they re changing over time.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/preventing-crystallization-to-improve-drug-efficiency-205907,Preventing Crystallization to Improve Drug Efficiency Esther Amstad and an international team of researchers have developed a method to increase the solubility of poorly soluble substances  such as many of the newly developed drugs  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. ""Each year, pharmaceutical companies refuse many drugs during early stages of their development because of their poor solubility in the body which prevents their efficient uptake by the human body"" explains Esther Amstad. In collaboration with a Harvard University team, she has developed a process that increases the solubility for example of drugs. The findings are encouraging: ""With this technique, we can increase the solubility of these drugs more than ten-fold."" How is this possible? Most drugs have a crystalline molecular structure, meaning that the molecules are arranged very regularly. However, these drugs would be much more soluble, if their structure was amorphous, meaning, molecules are arranged randomly. The challenge was to find a way to prevent the crystallization of these drugs without blending them with crystallization-inhibiting additives that decrease the drug loading and add complexity to the formulation of these drugs.Twice the speed of sound ""You have to imagine that the molecules will naturally group themselves in a crystalline form, if they are formulated using standard procedures, as molecules have enough time to arrange regularly. The method developed to suppress this process is very innovative,"" said Esther Amstad. In fact the crystals are dissolved in a liquid solution, such as ethanol. A microfluidic nebulizer, developed specifically to produce very small nanoparticles, creates drops in a stream of air that flows with a speed of 600 meters per second (almost twice the speed of sound). These drops are formed in a 2cm long pipe, thin as a human hair. The very fast airflow results in a fast evaporation of the alcohol drops. Indeed, drops dry so quickly, that molecules do not have time to arrange; as a result, crystals cannot form. Thus, the spray-dried particles are amorphous. Moreover, as these particles are very small, they also dissolve quickly, further facilitating their uptake by the body. This technique to produce amorphous nanoparticles is not yet ready to be industrialized. It requires one hour to transform 5 milligrams of material into amorphous nanoparticles. However, potential applications are numerous, especially in pharmacology. The increase in solubility of drugs means that the body will be able to absorb more active ingredients. This will reduce the amount of a medicament required to act against a given disease. It could also be applied to the food industry. Tackling water pollution Thanks to their higher solubility, the body can more readily take up these amorphous particles. This should reduce the amount of active ingredients released through the urine, which eventually reaches lakes or groundwater. ""Although this was not the main goal of the project, this is a beneficial side-effect.  said Esther Amstad. This process to suppress crystallization could have very interesting perspectives for fundamental research. ""Through this process we can make different kinds of amorphous materials, and thus study for example their magnetic or optic properties."" Currently, Esther Amstad and her team use this method to study early stages of crystallization. These early stages are very difficult to study experimentally as they require a high spatial and temporal resolution. Hence, early stages of crystallization of certain materials, such as one of the most prevalent inorganic biomaterial, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is contained in seashells and chalk, are still unknown. Yet, they are important in as they strongly affect the structure of the final crystal, which influences its properties.","Published: September 17, 2015"

Eating a healthy diet and getting exercise have been shown in earlier studies to protect against AMD, a leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. Findings from this latest study, conducted by a team of investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, suggest that genetic and lifestyle factors may contribute to AMD in a synergistic way.   If you have a family history of AMD, the good news is that the study findings suggest that there are things you can do to potentially lower your risk of developing AMD yourself,  said Julie A Mares, Ph.D., of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The study teams were led by Dr. Mares and Barbara A. Blodi, M.D., in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, in collaboration with investigators from the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and Oregon Health Science University, Portland. The researchers studied the risk among women ages 50 to 79 years who had participated in the Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study (CAREDS), an ancillary investigation of the much larger Women s Health Initiative, an observational study that has tracked the health-related behaviors and outcomes of more than 160,000 women since 1991. For the current study, first author Kristin J. Meyers, Ph.D., and her team evaluated the diet and exercise patterns of 1663 women and categorized them into lowest-, moderate- and highest-risk groups. They also evaluated whether the women smoked and, if so, how many years they smoked a pack of cigarettes or more each day. They also assessed genetic data from the women to determine whether they carried known genetic risk factors for AMD. They looked most closely at an allele (version) of the complement factor H (CFH) gene that is known to be associated with greater AMD risk, probing whether the women had zero, one, or two copies of the allele. A total of 337 women in the study developed AMD, of whom 91 percent had early-stage disease. Among women with stable diets, those who carried two high-risk genetic alleles, smoked at least seven pack-years, and were in the highest-risk diet and exercise categories were more than four times more likely to have AMD compared to those women who did not have genetic risk factors and who ate a healthy diet and got at least 10 hours/week of light exercise (such as housework or walking at a pace you could sing to) or at least eight hours of moderate activity (such as brisk walking).  In addition to lifestyle contributions, vitamin D levels may play a synergistic role with genetic factors, according to the findings of another study by the same team involving 913 CAREDS participants. Amy E. Millen, Ph.D., that study s first author, found that blood levels indicating vitamin D deficiency (less than 12 ng/mL of 25 hydroxyvitamin D) were associated with a 1.8-fold increase in the odds of having AMD among women with no risk alleles, but a 6.7-fold increase in the odds of having AMD among women with two risk alleles, compared with women who had no genetic risk alleles and adequate levels of vitamin D.   The findings of both studies support the notion of biologic synergy. That is, that one s genes, lifestyle factors and nutrition all come together in a synergistic way to mediate inflammation, which is a key mechanism involved in AMD,  said Dr. Mares.  There s a large body of evidence that unhealthy lifestyle habits are associated with inflammation and that CFH risk alleles augment inflammatory responses. Vitamin D is believed to suppress inflammation, which is thought to enhance the AMD disease processes both directly and indirectly. ","Published: September 17, 2015"

The terms of the license include an upfront fee, milestones payments and royalties on net sales. Under the agreement Nestl  Health Science is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of LT-02 in its territories, with Phase III clinical trials in the US planned to start in 2016. These trials will primarily assess LT-02 as an add-on therapy in patients with UC not adequately responding to standard doses of 5-aminosalicylic acid, the current standard treatment for the condition. In October 2014, Lipid Therapeutics  European co-development partner, Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH, a pharmaceutical company specialized in gastroenterology, announced the start of a pivotal Phase III trial with the same compound in Europe. The European and US Phase III trials form part of a global Phase III development programme that aims to provide clinical evidence to support regulatory approval of LT-02. Dr. Gerhard Keilhauer, CEO of Lipid Therapeutics, said:  The licensing agreement with Nestl  Health Science represents a major further step towards bringing LT-02 to patients suffering from UC and another key milestone met for Lipid Therapeutics. Together with Dr. Falk, our development partner in Europe, Nestl  Health Science will provide the resource and expertise to progress LT-02 through Phase III development and approval in the key US and European markets. With these agreements in place I am confident that the huge potential of our novel therapy is being successfully translated into significant value for our company.  Dr. Jan Adams, Partner at EMBL Ventures commented:  Lipid Therapeutics is a prime example of our investment approach where we build companies from scratch aiming to forge strategic partnerships after proof of concept has been reached. With two licensees now covering global rights for its lead product LT-02, Lipid Therapeutics is looking to receive a very attractive combined payment stream. Being the majority shareholder in the company this will have a significant impact on our fund performance . Greg Behar CEO of Nestl  Health Science, said:  LT-02 has paradigm changing potential in the management of ulcerative colitis in terms of improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for biologics and corticosteroids. Chronic gastrointestinal conditions are on the rise worldwide and we are determined to make an impact, through innovative, integrated therapeutic approaches such as LT-02.  More than one million people worldwide are estimated to suffer from UC, a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the large intestine. It is estimated that 40% of patients receiving the recommended dose of 5-aminosalicylic acid continue to experience flares of disease activity. There therefore exists a significant need for safe and more efficacious UC treatments. LT-02 is a proprietary delayed release formulation of phosphatidylcholine designed as an add-on therapy to 5-aminosalicylic acid to improve the barrier function of the mucosal layer of the colon.","Published: September 17, 2015"

Certain immune checkpoints present in the tumor microenvironment have been shown to inhibit T cells, which are a critical component of the anti-tumor immune response, and therefore suppress the immune system s ability to destroy malignant cells, thus allowing tumor growth. The new target validation data presented at the conference demonstrate, as expected from an immune checkpoint target candidate, that the expression of CGEN-15052 on cancer cells in a syngeneic mouse animal model enhances tumor growth compared with control cancer cells. In addition, CGEN-15052 was previously shown to bind to activated T cells and inhibit human and mouse T cell activation. Combined with the high expression of CGEN-15052 found in the tumor microenvironment of multiple cancers, such as lung and breast cancers, these results suggest that this Compugen-discovered protein has the potential to serve as a highly promising immunotherapeutic target for multiple cancer types.  We are very pleased to report further progress in validating CGEN-15052 as a novel immune checkpoint target candidate for the treatment of cancer,  said Anat Cohen-Dayag, Ph.D., Compugen s President and Chief Executive Officer.  The validation results to date, both in vitro and in an animal setting, support the therapeutic potential of inhibiting CGEN-15052 and thus restoring immune response against cancer.  Dr. Cohen-Dayag added,  The excitement being generated by the clinical results of the few cancer immunotherapy drugs now available highlights the need for additional immuno-oncology drugs to treat the majority of cancer patients for whom these current therapies are of little, if any, benefit. Therefore, the continuing demonstration of the potential of the large number of novel immune checkpoint target candidates discovered by the Company in a variety of cancers and immune cell sub-types is very exciting from both a medical and commercial standpoint.

The studies aim to inform the development of new strategies to diagnose and monitor cancer and to help establish ctDNA as an important marker in the study and eventual treatment of cancer. Traditional biopsies for acquiring tumor DNA are typically invasive and risky and are often not possible. Additionally, single biopsies may not be able to measure the heterogeneity that is often present in tumors. Fortunately, scientists have discovered that dying tumor cells release small pieces of their DNA into the bloodstream. These pieces are called cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and can be detected in a blood sample via DNA sequencing. As global leaders in cancer care and in next-generation sequencing, MSK and Illumina will conduct research trials designed to answer biological and clinical questions about ctDNA in multiple cancer types. MSK will collect samples, and Illumina will apply its best-in-class sequencing technology to detect ctDNA in those samples. The program will work to validate a ctDNA assay to demonstrate correlation between ctDNA signal and cancer burden.  The possibility of reducing the number of invasive and expensive diagnostic and monitoring procedures with a simple blood draw is a game-changer for cancer patients and for oncology,  said Jose Baselga, MD, PhD, Physician-in-Chief and Chief Medical Officer at MSK.  This relationship between Illumina and MSK will create important data regarding the value, the significance and the potential applications of measuring ctDNA via deep sequencing,  said Dr. Rick Klausner, SVP and Chief Medical Officer of Illumina.  Is ctDNA not simply equivalent to, but superior to current methods of cancer diagnosis and monitoring? Can we replace expensive and invasive monitoring with a blood test? Does ctDNA reflect the total burden of cancer clones, and is it equivalent to or better than biopsies at predicting outcome and therapeutic response? These are the types of questions we will work towards answering. ","Published: September 17, 2015"

While the rapamycin did great things for the mice, scientists in the Andersen lab at the Buck Institute also got an unexpected plus from the research - a new understanding of the role parkin plays in cellular dynamics, one that challenges the current dogma in PD research and presents new opportunities for drug discovery. The study is currently online in the Journal of Neuroscience. ""Given its side effects as an immunosuppressant, there are issues with long-term use of rapamycin, but the results of our study suggest that use of derivatives of rapamycin or other agents with similar biological properties may constitute novel therapeutics for the disorder,"" said senior scientist and Buck faculty Julie Andersen, PhD. ""Our discoveries regarding parkin may provide an even more important therapeutic target for PD."" Parkin is a protein encoded by the PARK2 gene in humans. Mutations in PARK2 are most commonly linked to both sporadic and familial forms of PD; they diminish the cell's ability to recycle its internal garbage. PD is characterized by the accumulation of damaged proteins and mitochondria in the area of the brain where the neurotransmitter dopamine is produced. Rapamycin prevented PD symptoms from occurring in middle-aged mice who had a human mutation in the PARK2 gene. Researchers in the Andersen lab expected this benefit to come via the accepted role of parkin - they thought rapamycin would boost the mutated protein's ability to label certain types of cellular garbage for recycling. Instead they discovered that parkin plays a much broader role in the actual recycling of garbage and the manufacturing of new mitochondria. ""This is a completely new, unrecognized, function for parkin,"" said Andersen. ""Our work shows that parkin plays a much broader role than was originally thought in getting rid of damaged mitochondria and proteins. It's very exciting because it gives us new ways to look at potential therapeutics to boost cellular clean up."" Working in both neuronal stem cell models and mouse tissue, scientists found that rapamycin not only boosted the mutated protein's ability to label cellular garbage, but also affected the process of recycling the garbage itself via up-regulation of a protein known as TFEB which increased the degradation and purging of both damaged proteins and mitochondria via a process known as lysosomal autophagy. Apart from rapamycin's effects, Andersen's team also discovered that parkin is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis - via up-regulation of PGC1alpha, a protein which drives increased mitochondrial synthesis. ""Problems with autophagy, which result in the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles, have long been linked to PD,"" said Ana Maria Cuervo, MD, PhD, professor and recipient of the Robert and Ren e Belfer Chair for the Study of Neurodegenerative Diseases at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. ""This novel role of parkin in the regulation of the overall process of autophagy gives us new ways to address its dysfunction in PD.""

Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health problems during pregnancy, with around 12% of women in the UK experiencing depression at some point during pregnancy and the postnatal period. The use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat depression during pregnancy has become increasingly common, however, it is unclear whether any increased risk to the fetus, and health problems for the woman or baby, can be attributed directly to these drugs or may be caused by other factors. The research published today examines the effects of SSRI use on the health of both the mother and the long term development of the child. A study from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health looked at the effects of prenatal exposure to SSRIs on motor skill development at 3 years old in 51,404 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. In this cohort 159 mothers reported a prolonged use of SSRIs during pregnancy. Their children had a slight delay in the development of fine and gross motor skills compared to children unexposed during pregnancy. However, the authors of this paper acknowledge that the numbers are so small, no change in clinical practice is warranted. Marte Handal, lead author of the study from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said,  our results show that treatment with SSRIs during longer time periods in pregnancy was weakly associated with a delayed motor development at age 3. However, only a very small number of children had a severe delay. Even though we did take into account maternal symptoms of depression we still did not have complete information on the severity of the maternal depression in the different groups. Effective treatment of depression during pregnancy is essential and these results should not discourage healthcare professionals from prescribing or continuing antidepressant treatment to those who need it.  In another study, an Australian team analyzed data from 49,000 women registered on the Danish National Birth Cohort, to examine the impact of prenatal exposure to SSRIs on behavioral problems at aged 7 years. Results found that untreated prenatal depression (231 children) was associated with an increased risk of problem behavior in the children, hyperactivity, inattention, and peer problems. This increased risk was not seen in the children (210 children) whose mothers took antidepressants, including SSRIs. In a separate study, the same team examined the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (the loss of between 500 and 1,000ml of blood within the first 24 hours after giving birth) in mothers taking antidepressants in the final 3 months of their pregnancy, at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide, Australia. For women without psychiatric illness (28,000 women) or who were not taking antidepressants (1,292) the risk of postpartum hemorrhage was 11%. This increased to 16% for women taking antidepressants (558). Risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage and of postpartum anemia were almost doubled by SSRI use. Dr Luke Grzeskowiak, lead author of the studies from The University of Adelaide, Australia, said,  it is reassuring to find that prenatal exposure to antidepressants did not affect a child s behaviour at age 7, however as with any medication, the benefits and risks but always be considered. ""Regarding our other study, overall the risks for postpartum hemorrhage are largely unknown. We found separate increases in risk with placenta previa, prolonged labor, hypertension and assisted vaginal delivery, as well as the increased risk seen with antidepressant use. However we did not have data on known risks such as use of oxytocin during delivery, nor did we have any data on the severity of the underlying maternal psychiatric illness. Consequently, it is possible that the women who took antidepressants late in pregnancy were those with the most severe illness and it is this which is responsible for the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and not the antidepressant. Based on this study alone we do not recommend that women stop taking medication for depression during pregnancy, but are closely monitored in order to reduce the risk of any potential increased risk of bleeding as much as possible.  ""These studies add to a growing body of evidence about the safety of taking antidepressants during pregnancy. While there are some increased risks, the evidence so far seems to be that the risks of untreated depression outweigh the risks of taking them. But the more we understand the better prepared the medical profession will be to help women through their pregnancy and birth.""

Cocoa extracts contain polyphenols, which are micronutrients that have many health benefits, including reducing age-related cognitive dysfunction and promoting healthy brain aging, among others. Dr. Giulio Maria Pasinetti, MD, PhD, Saunders Family Chair and Professor of Neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Director of Biomedical Training at J.J. Peters Bronx VA Medical Center, is leading author of a recent paper entitled  Recommendations for development of new standardized forms of cocoa breeds and cocoa extract processing for the prevention of Alzheimer s disease,  to be published in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease. This research suggests that  there is strong scientific evidence supporting the growing interest in developing cocoa extract, and potentially certain dietary chocolate preparations, as a natural source to maintain and promote brain health, and in particular to prevent age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease, which is the most common form of age-related dementia affecting an estimated 44 million people worldwide.  Previous studies from Dr. Pasinetti s laboratory and others suggest that certain cocoa extract preparations may prevent or possibly delay Alzheimer s disease in animal experimental models of the disease, in part by inhibiting the generation and promoting the clearance of toxic proteins, including  -amyloid (A ) and abnormal tau aggregates, in the brain through mechanisms mediated by polyphenols. Most importantly, the role of cocoa polyphenols in preventing abnormal accumulation of toxic protein aggregates in the brain would play a pivotal role in preventing the loss of synapses that are critical for functional connection among neurons. Recent clinical studies appear to confirm the potential beneficial role of certain cocoa extracts in delaying cognitive aging. The benefits of cocoa polyphenols in preventing synapse loss and, therefore, in preserving/restoring synaptic function may provide a viable and important strategy for preserving cognitive function and, thereby, protecting against the onset and progression of Alzheimer s disease. In spite of the promises of cocoa polyphenols for treating and/or preventing Alzheimer s disease, Dr. Pasinetti hypothesizes in his new publication that there is a need for multidisciplinary collaborative efforts involving cocoa producers, wholesalers, and the biomedical community if we want to succeed in the development of cocoa extract for health benefits. For example, there are still major issues relating to the diminishing global supply of cocoa and the lack of consistency and reproducibility of cocoa extract processing, which should be carefully addressed. Changes in growth, climate/conditions, and cocoa plant diseases are decreasing the supply of cocoa. To address this, new breeds of cocoa, engineered to be fruitful, more resistant to disease, and more flavorful, are currently being investigated. Furthermore, little is known about how cocoa processing may influence the biological effect of cocoa extracts. Evidence suggests that certain procedures used in cocoa processing can significantly influence its polyphenol content, ultimately influencing its biological activity. Interestingly, two of the most common processing techniques for the chocolate we consume have been reported to result in the loss of as much as 90% of the polyphenols in cocoa. Dr. Pasinetti notes that ongoing interdisciplinary research will provide an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen our understanding of the beneficial roles of cocoa polyphenols and improve cocoa development and processing in order to promote healthy brain aging and possibly prevent Alzheimer s disease.

Amitriptyline is a prototypical antidepressant that is currently used worldwide. Generally, effects of antidepressants such as amitriptyline in depressive patients become evident after treatment for a few weeks. However, no study has investigated the reasons why effects are not immediately evident. Previous studies have shown that amitriptyline increases the mRNA expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in rat astrocytes, not neurons, slowly over 24 hours. However, the cellular mechanism that leads to the expression of FGF2 following amitriptyline treatment remains unclear. In this study, the research group treated rat primary cultured astrocytes with amitriptyline. They found that it results in the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; fibroblast growth factor receptor [FGFR] and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), which in turn increased FGF2 mRNA expression, as depicted in the illustration above. Professor Yoshihiro Nakata at Hiroshima University and Dr Minoru Takebayashi at National Hospital Organization Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center said, ""activated RTK induces the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and increases EGR1 mRNA and protein expression followed by FGF2 mRNA expression."" Professor Nakata said, ""the current findings expand previous findings, in that the transcription factor EGR1 could be the de novo synthesized protein that is necessary for increasing FGF2 mRNA expression evoked by amitriptyline treatment."" The amitriptyline-induced signaling cascade is essential for the expression of FGF2 mRNA in primary cultured astrocytes. This cascade could be used to guide the development of antidepressants with novel mechanisms. Hiroshima University Takebayashi M et al.

All assay steps are performed within the fully enclosed cartridge, thus eliminating the potential for contamination, reducing user error, and streamlining workflow.  The CARD s design enables adoption of advanced molecular technology by laboratories of all types, from small community hospital labs to highly complex, centralized laboratories. The design also facilitates implementation across a wide range of market opportunities, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) sample prep, research-use-only testing, food and beverage industry applications, and in vitro diagnostics.  The  398 patent allows researchers and clinicians to quickly, easily, and cost-effectively run several samples through a fully integrated and automated nucleic acid amplification test, from raw sample input through detection, with no user intervention. Each CARD allows for simultaneous testing of four different samples and can handle a broad range of sample types, such as fresh tissue, urine, whole blood, serum, saliva, swabs, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. The Rheonix CARD performs multiple molecular techniques, including sample preparation, such as chemical and enzymatic lysis and DNA purification; amplification, such as endpoint polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR, and quantitative PCR; and detection on a low-density microarray or lateral flow strip.   The  398 patent recognizes the groundbreaking achievement we have reached with the Rheonix CARD. From the device s hardware to its process, it will help make molecular diagnostics a reality in laboratories worldwide,  said Tony Eisenhut, president of Rheonix.  With the lowest cost of ownership of any molecular platform, the patent confirms the novelty of the Rheonix approach to molecular diagnostics. Where other systems have traditionally emphasized either multiplex or throughput, Rheonix has designed single-use cartridges that do both and can perform sophisticated functions with a simple design. This lowers laboratory costs by eliminating waste in time, equipment and consumables, and reduces the amount of highly skilled labor. Rheonix is helping bring powerful molecular tools to laboratories that could not previously afford to purchase or run them.   The dual-layer design of the Rheonix CARD automatically manipulates reagents internally with its active fluidic network of pumps, valves and channels. The upper surface of the CARD contains reservoirs that hold reagents used in the extraction, purification, amplification and detection process and any resulting liquid waste. The channels and pumps located on the lower surface of the CARD are used to transport and mix reagents and move wastes into the reservoirs on the top. By actively pumping fluids from reservoir to reservoir within the CARD, molecular diagnostic tests can be performed automatically.","Published: September 16, 2015"

The terms of the license cover commercial use of a genetically-engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line, developed by Horizon and adapted to manufacturing conditions by LakePharma. Protein therapeutics represent a significant share of the top 50 drugs globally and are increasingly present in developmental pipelines. The provision and licensing of bioproduction cells for their manufacture, however, can be cost prohibitive and are often tied to long-term revenue-based licensing terms. Horizon s flexible licensing model with simplified terms and no associated royalties allows any organization with ambitions in the biopharmaceutical marketplace, including small to medium size biotechs and Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs), to access bioproduction cell lines. For this program, Horizon used its gene editing expertise to introduce specific genetic changes into the CHO K1 cell line, leading to a functional knockout of the Glutamine Synthetase (GS) gene. This enables metabolic selection of cells producing high levels of valuable recombinant protein-based drugs. The GS knockout reduces the timelines and costs involved in identifying a final manufacturing clone, and eliminates the need for use of toxic and expensive chemical inhibitors. The potential market for such cell lines for biopharmaceutical production is significant, with over 1,600 active programs in pipelines worldwide. LakePharma has adapted Horizon s CHO cell for suspension growth, the preferred cell cultivation method for many manufacturing applications. Subsequently, LakePharma carried out a full evaluation of protein expression on the CHO cell line, showing significantly higher antibody production levels relative to their previous system. The evaluation also demonstrated the ability to identify a final expression clone after a relatively simple screening effort. In alignment with strategic priorities, Horizon has leveraged this development effort in order to ensure that this cutting edge cell line is now available for other organizations to license from Horizon for the manufacturing of biological therapeutics. Dr Darrin M Disley, Horizon s Chief Executive Officer, said:  The license agreement with LakePharma, the first of its kind, serves as recognition and validation of our approach to developing novel bioproduction cell lines. Until now, cell line development has been a rate-limiting step for improving upstream bioprocessing. With precise gene editing we are able to provide a key step in the path toward delivering next generation biological medicines. We look forward to seeing further uptake of this approach within the industry.  Dr. Fan Chen, Director of Bioprocessing, LakePharma, said:  The license agreement with Horizon allows us to offer a superior expression cell line to our customers, providing better value to them, while the one-time fee allows us maximal flexibility to utilize the cells to their best effect. I am delighted that the hard work we put in to adapting these cells has been reflected in their commercialization by Horizon. ","Published: September 16, 2015"

This whitepaper describes their experiences with OGT s CytoSure  Medical Research Exome Array and explores how this customisable array targets a variety of genetic disorders to complement next generation sequencing (NGS) for clinical genetic research. The overwhelming complexity of genetic disorders is increasingly evident, and rarely caused by isolated mutations within single genes. Copy number variations (CNVs) play a significant role in many disorders and cannot be reliably detected by NGS. Microarray technologies offer the opportunity to detect CNVs and analyse thousands of genes simultaneously. The CytoSure Medical Research Exome Array was developed in collaboration with Emory Genetics Laboratory, utilising its extensive expertise to provide a focused array that combines the latest genomic content with high-resolution exon-level probe design. It includes the most up-to-date gene content and is research-validated, maximising the likelihood of detecting causative variation. As Dr Farrow and Dr Lewis explain, the key to a high-resolution array is the number of probes in the specific region of interest, meaning that high-density coverage with a focus on exons is important. The CytoSure Medical Research Exome Array retains complete genomic backbone coverage while covering each exon of over 4600 medically-relevant hand-curated genes, grouped into disease- and syndrome-specific panels. Dr Farrow comments:  The CytoSure Medical Research Exome Array provides us with the exon-level resolution needed to detect CNVs over the medical exome that are currently missed by NGS and traditional microarray designs, providing additional insights into the mutation spectrum of the sample.  In addition, the ability to customise the array enables researchers to utilise this single research-validated platform as a base for a host of more specific studies. An explanation from Dr Lewis about how this has been implemented, as well as the benefits it brings to her research, is included in the whitepaper.  The whitepaper follows Dr Lewis and Dr Farrow as they describe how they employ microarrays alongside NGS for the ideal complementary strategy in clinical genetic research. The combination provides a cost-effective workflow for comprehensive mutational analysis, as Dr Farrow explains:  Even as NGS continues to develop, microarrays remain critical to detecting CNVs .

A link between mitochondria, energy failure, and neurodegeneration has long been hypothesized. However, no previous studies were able to comprehensively investigate the connection because sufficiently sensitive tests, or assays, were not available to measure ATP (the energy unit of the cell that is generated by mitochondria) in individual neurons. In the current study the scientists created novel assays to more accurately measure the brain's energy production. Using a model of Leigh's disease, a genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorder that affects mitochondria, the researchers tested energy levels in neurons using the new assays. They found that the genetic mutation associated with Leigh's disease compromised ATP levels, and this reduction of ATP was enough to cause significant cellular dysfunction. ""It was always assumed that defects in mitochondria would result in a depletion of energy levels, which would be toxic to neurons,"" says first author Divya Pathak, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease. ""But no one had been able to prove this because the necessary assays were not available. Now that we've demonstrated the link between impaired mitochondria, a loss of ATP, and neuronal dysfunction, the next step is to see if this connection holds true in conditions like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease."" Applying their new assay in healthy neurons, the researchers also determined the energy threshold needed to support synaptic vesicle cycling--the process by which brain cells release neurotransmitters to communicate with each other. The scientists blocked glycolysis, another way that cells make ATP, so that the cells had to rely solely on their mitochondria for energy. This allowed the researchers to more accurately assess the contribution of mitochondrial ATP to different steps in the cycle, and how this process goes awry when mitochondria malfunction. From this exploration, the scientists revealed that bringing the vesicles back up into the cell after they have released their neurotransmitters is the most energy-demanding process. Indeed, in the model of Leigh's disease, the cells did not have enough ATP to complete this step. The researchers also compared energy levels in boutons--the docks from which neurotransmitters are shipped--with and without mitochondria. Remarkably, there was no difference in energy levels between the two, and both types of boutons had sufficient ATP to support synaptic vesicle cycling. From this, the scientists concluded that under normal conditions, ATP diffuses rapidly from boutons with mitochondria to those without, so that even those boutons lacking mitochondria have sufficient energy to function under normal conditions. They note it will be important to determine if boutons lacking mitochondria will still be able to function properly in diseases that disrupt the distribution of mitochondria. Senior author Ken Nakamura, MD, PhD, an assistant investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, says that conducting this research in both healthy and diseased cells is essential for interpreting the findings. ""We really need to understand the basics of cell biology in a normal setting in order to comprehend changes in disease,"" he explains. ""It's worth taking the time to study these underlying biological processes so that we can identify the best therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders.""","Published: September 16, 2015"

It uses natural or tailored light-sensitive proteins in order to switch nerve cells on and off without electrodes with unprecedented accuracy in respect to time and location. The discovery of the light-gated ion channel channel rhodopsin in algae in 2002 was a key finding for this field. In 2005, Frankfurt scientists working with Prof. Alexander Gottschalk succeeded in transferring the protein to the translucent nematode C. elegans in order to control its movements with light. Together with the lab of Georg Nagel at the University of W rzburg, Gottschalk has now added another tool to the optogenetics toolbox: The protein 'CyclOp' from the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii. As the research group under Prof. Alexander Gottschalk reports the CyclOp produces the second messenger cGMP when exposed to light. This important cellular signal is involved in vision, regulating blood pressure, induced cell death and also male erection. The compound Viagra, for example, leads to an increase in the cGMP level in the cells. If CyclOp is introduced to an organism like the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, then one can specifically study cGMP-dependent signal pathways within the cell. This allows optogenetics to go a step beyond previous research. ""The light-activated enzyme CyclOp has outstanding molecular properties which qualify it as a valuable addition to the optogenetics toolbox for cell biologists and neurobiologists"", explains Prof. Gottschalk from the Buchmann Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (BMLS) at Goethe University. His research group has introduced the protein into oxygen sensing cells in order to find out what role the second messenger cGMP plays in these cells. To do so, the translucent nematode is exposed to light leading to intracellular generation of cGMP. The cells respond by acting as if they had detected an increase in the oxygen level. In this way the researchers can use CyclOp to get a better understanding of how the natural signal for these cells is turned into a cellular response.","Published: September 16, 2015"

Clear Labs merges clinical-grade genomic analysis and big data analytics allowing the most respected food brands to gain a new level of transparency into their supply chains, differentiate on quality, and ultimately enhance their value. With this announcement, Clear Labs is rolling out its first product, Clear View, into private beta. Clear View enables food retailers and manufacturers to verify the quality of their foods, optimize their supply chains, choose the best products to buy and sell, and track trends and performance of their food over time. The food analytics platform is built on a proprietary next-generation genomic sequencing workflow, a comprehensive big data platform, and the world s largest molecular food database. The database, built in-house over the last 18 months, compares large amounts of individual food samples with genomic markers and other metadata to analyze food products against their label. The platform tests for ingredient accuracy including authenticity, GMOs, bacterial contamination, and allergens, as well as nutritional data and off-label additives. Consumer concerns over food quality are at an all-time high as recalls are on the rise and transparency is becoming an increasingly important value. A recent report from Daymon Worldwide found that 40% of consumers have lost their appetites for the foods they typically eat due to safety and quality concerns. Many are changing their shopping behaviors and looking for alternative products they can trust. Clear Labs is the only platform that can validate the entirety of label claims -- from ingredient lists, to nutritional content, to off-label additives, to marketing claims like  gluten-free.  The company is also expanding the types of foods that can be analyzed, to include a wide variety of packaged goods that couldn t previously be tested.  More than ever, consumers want to better understand what they are eating and buy food that aligns with their values,  said Clear Labs CEO and co-founder, Sasan Amini.  Clear Labs is a new technology that helps retailers and manufacturers seize the opportunity to enhance their brands and prove out the values they promise. For the first time, the food industry can test for complete content accuracy, not just spot-check for contamination. By allowing brands to capitalize on the advances in big data and genomics, we re moving beyond food safety, which is largely reactive, and into food quality, which is wholly proactive.  With the $6.5M Series A with participation from Khosla Ventures, Felicis Ventures, and others, Clear Labs plans to expand its headcount, specifically in technical and product roles. It will also use the investment to begin rolling out its technology to pilot customers in a private beta.  We re pleased to add Clear Labs to our portfolio of successful food technology companies,  said Samir Kaul, founding general partner at Khosla Ventures.  The food industry is at a turning point. The market is ready and waiting for new technologies that will transform how they do business. Clear Labs is poised to lead the charge in bringing ground-breaking food analytics to the industry.

They found that 59 percent of breast cancer samples had evidence of exposure to BLV, as determined by the presence of viral DNA. By contrast, 29 percent of the tissue samples from women who never had breast cancer showed exposure to BLV.  The association between BLV infection and breast cancer was surprising to many previous reviewers of the study, but it s important to note that our results do not prove that the virus causes cancer,  said study lead author Gertrude Buehring, a professor of virology in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology at UC Berkeley s School of Public Health.  However, this is the most important first step. We still need to confirm that the infection with the virus happened before, not after, breast cancer developed, and if so, how.  Bovine leukemia virus infects dairy and beef cattle s blood cells and mammary tissue. The retrovirus is easily transmitted among cattle primarily through infected blood and milk, but it only causes disease in fewer than 5 percent of infected animals. A 2007 U.S. Department of Agriculture survey of bulk milk tanks found that 100 percent of dairy operations with large herds of 500 or more cows tested positive for BLV antibodies. This may not be surprising since milk from one infected cow is mixed in with others. Even dairy operations with small herds of fewer than 100 cows tested positive for BLV 83 percent of the time. What had been unclear until recently is whether the virus could be found in humans, something that was confirmed in a study led by Buehring and published last year inEmerging Infectious Diseases. That paper overturned a long-held belief that the virus could not be transmitted to humans.  Studies done in the 1970s failed to detect evidence of human infection with BLV,  said Buehring.  The tests we have now are more sensitive, but it was still hard to overturn the established dogma that BLV was not transmissible to humans. As a result, there has been little incentive for the cattle industry to set up procedures to contain the spread of the virus.  The new paper takes the earlier findings a step further by showing a higher likelihood of the presence of BLV in breast cancer tissue. When the data was analyzed statistically, the odds of having breast cancer if BLV were present was 3.1 times greater than if BLV was absent.  This odds ratio is higher than any of the frequently publicized risk factors for breast cancer, such as obesity, alcohol consumption and use of post-menopausal hormones,  said Buehring. There is precedence for viral origins of cancer. Hepatitis B virus is known to cause liver cancer, and the human papillomavirus can lead to cervical and anal cancers. Notably, vaccines have been developed for both those viruses and are routinely used to prevent the cancers associated with them.  If BLV were proven to be a cause of breast cancer, it could change the way we currently look at breast cancer control,  said Buehring.  It could shift the emphasis to prevention of breast cancer, rather than trying to cure or control it after it has already occurred.  Buehring emphasized that this study does not identify how the virus infected the breast tissue samples in their study. The virus could have come through the consumption of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat, or it could have been transmitted by other humans.","Published: September 16, 2015"

The Emerging Technologies Opportunity Program (ETOP) was launched in 2013 by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Program aims to bring new technologies developed at other institutions into the DOE JGI, making them available to its users for energy and environment applications. A half a dozen proposals were approved during the Program s first year. Among the projects approved in the inaugural ETOP call was one from metagenomics pioneer Jill Banfield at the University of California, Berkeley. Banfield proposed building and characterizing a pipeline that would allow researchers to isolate and study both near-complete and complete microbial genomes from environmental samples.  Natural ecosystems and the diverse communities of microbes (and other organisms) within them are extremely difficult to study because they are not closed systems, where all inputs and outputs can be accessed. To make the compositions and activities of microbial communities more tractable for analyses with genomic methods, this study focused on microbial communities in laboratory bioreactors that were being studied as a potential method of treating wastewater contaminated by gold ore processing. From these bioreactors, the team reconstructed draft and curated microbial genomes using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing of biofilm and supernatant samples. In one bioreactor, a mixture of cyanide (CN-)   used for processing gold ore   and thiocyanate (SCN-)   a byproduct of the process   was being degraded, while in the other bioreactor, only thiocyanate was being degraded.  This is the first application of genome-resolved metagenomics to characterize SCN  and CN  bioreactors,  the team noted,  revealing a complex community containing novel organisms and genes.  The analyses allowed the team to outline the structures of the microbial communities and diagram potential nutrient flow paths. For example, they found evidence indicating that the microbes were not relying on the molasses included in the media as an energy source, which could help reduce bioreactor operating costs on the commercial scale. They also recovered several genome sequences allowing them to determine the composition of the communities in the bioreactors. They found some functions are shared, such as the ability to adapt to temperature and oxygen fluctuations. Others are less so; they found a complete denitrification pathway in one microbial species in the CN-SCN processing bioreactor. Ultimately, this study will provide new approaches for the scientific community towards characterizing microbial communities involved in activities of major interest to DOE, including support of bioenergy feedstock plants, terrestrial carbon cycling, and waste cleanup.","Published: September 16, 2015"

The new device uses miniaturized channels and valves to replace  benchtop  assays   tests that require large samples of blood or other fluids and expensive chemicals that lab technicians manually mix in trays of tubes or plastic plates with cup-like depressions.  The main advantage is cost   these assays are done in labs and clinics everywhere,  said Mehdi Ghodbane, who earned his doctorate in biomedical engineering at Rutgers and now works in biopharmaceutical research and development at GlaxoSmithKline.The lab-on-chip device, which employs microfluidics technology, along with making tests more affordable for patients and researchers, opens doors for new research because of its capability to perform complex analyses using 90 percent less sample fluid than needed in conventional tests.  A great deal of research has been hindered because in many cases one is  not able to extract enough fluid,  Ghodbane said. The Rutgers breakthrough also requires one-tenth of the chemicals used in a conventional multiplex immunoassay, which can cost as much as $1500.  Additionally, the device automates much of the skilled labor involved in performing tests.  The results are as sensitive and accurate as the standard benchtop assay,  said Martin Yarmush, the Paul and Mary Monroe Chair and Distinguished Professor of biomedical engineering at Rutgers and Ghodbane s adviser.Until now, animal research on central nervous system disorders, such as spinal cord injury and Parkinson s disease, has been limited because researchers could not extract sufficient cerebrospinal fluid to perform conventional assays.  With our technology, researchers will be able to perform large-scale controlled studies with comparable accuracy to conventional assays,  Yarmush said. The discovery could also lead to more comprehensive research on autoimmune joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis through animal studies. As with spinal fluid, the amount of joint fluid, or synovial fluid, researchers are able to collect from lab animals is minuscule. The Rutgers team has combined several capabilities for the first time in the device they ve dubbed  ELISA-on-a-chip  (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). A single device analyzes 32 samples at once and can measure widely varying concentrations of as many as six proteins in a sample.

The investigators used a drug to block production of this substance in mouse models, staving off damage to insulin-producing cells and preventing the onset of the autoimmune disorder. The drug, which is currently used in Europe and Asia for treating gallstone-related spasms, has an excellent safety record, the researchers said. The findings suggest that it may be possible to prevent the onset of Type 1 diabetes in humans if a similar treatment is initiated before the insulin-producing cells, or beta cells, are attacked by misguided immune cells. Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, afflicts one in 300 people in the United States. The study is the first to link the progression of Type 1 diabetes to changes in the architecture of the extracellular matrix, the carbohydrate- and protein-rich lattice in which the cells composing our tissues are embedded, said Paul Bollyky, MD, PhD, assistant professor of infectious diseases. Bollyky is the study s senior author. The lead author is postdoctoral scholar Nadine Nagy, PhD. Most pancreatic cells are engaged in manufacturing and secreting digestive enzymes. But the pancreas is also studded with tiny, hormone-producing cell clusters called islets. A human pancreas contains thousands of islets, scattered throughout the organ like raisins in a loaf of cinnamon bread. Inflamed islets A pancreatic islet is composed of several cell types, each making a different hormone. Beta cells, for example, produce insulin.   In Type 1 diabetes, only the beta cells get destroyed,  said Bollyky. Why this happens is poorly understood. But it s known that during the disorder s early, pre-symptomatic stage, pancreatic islets become inflamed   that is, they get infiltrated by immune cells. At first quiescent, these warrior cells at some point begin attacking beta cells, eventually destroying enough of them to effectively erase insulin output. By the time a person begins to manifest the disease s hallmark symptom, chronic hyperglycemia, some 90 percent of pancreatic beta cells have been killed off. Neither the cause of immune cells  initial infiltration of pancreatic islets nor the trigger for their transition from mere passive presence to active aggression is yet understood. But the new study provides important clues. In a 2014 study, Bollyky s team measured the levels of dozens of substances in the extracellular matrix of human postmortem pancreatic tissue. One substance, called hyaluronan, was overly abundant near the pancreatic beta cells of people with Type 1 diabetes. But this was seen only in pancreatic tissue from patients who had been somewhat recently diagnosed, not patients who d lived with the disease for decades. If you twist your ankle or stub your toe, that swelling you see afterwards is due to hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is usually present at trace concentrations in the extracellular matrix that pervades all tissues. But hyaluronan levels spike markedly at the site of an injury.  If you twist your ankle or stub your toe, that swelling you see afterwards is due to hyaluronan,  Bollyky said. This substance is prone to soaking up water, causing fluid buildup in the injured region, a cardinal feature of inflammation. Bollyky said the absence of increased hyaluronan in long-term patients  pancreatic islets didn t mean much, as these people s beta cells had long since bit the dust. But finding excessive deposits of hyaluronan near pancreatic beta cells in recent-onset cases was intriguing. Curious, Bollyky and his colleagues sought to determine whether this association was incidental or whether hyaluronan s increased presence actually played any causal role. So, they employed a bioengineered strain of laboratory mouse whose immune system is guaranteed to attack its pancreatic beta cells. Essentially 100 percent of these mice eventually develop Type 1 diabetes, and always over about the same period of time, making it easy to study the effects of an experimental manipulation upon the disease s progression. The scientists also looked at another mouse strain often afflicted with a version of Type 1 diabetes that more closely parallels the human form of the disease. (These mice are tougher to study because only about half of them contract the disease, and they do so at variable rates.) In both strains, Bollyky said, hyaluronan accumulated in pancreatic islets, but not in all of them   just in those where inflammatory immune cells had parked themselves. No excessive hyaluronan deposition was seen in the mice s heart, lung or liver tissue, consistent with the idea that the phenomenon occurs only in inflamed tissues. The islet-associated hyaluronan buildup eventually crescendoed and began tapering off, analogous to the investigators  observations in recent-onset versus long-established Type 1 diabetes cases in their earlier study of human tissue. Preventing hyaluronan buildup  We wondered what would happen if we prevented that buildup,  Bollyky said.  And we knew a drug that does that.  The drug was hymecromone, or 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU for short). Prescribed in many European and Asian countries for painful, gallstone-associated spasms and sold by about 60 companies worldwide for research purposes, 4-MU inhibits hyaluronan synthesis. It is inexpensive, can be given orally and, over four decades of use, has what Bollyky described as an  extremely boring safety profile : a very low rate of associated adverse events.  It s even approved in Europe for kids,  he said. (The Food and Drug Administration has not licensed 4-MU for any indication in the United States.) In the mice used in the study, as in people, there s a window of time during which immune cells have infiltrated pancreatic islets but most beta cells are still intact. When the researchers initiated 4-MU treatment before the majority of the mice s beta cells had been wiped out, none of the mice developed hyperglycemia. Mice that didn t get 4-MU did. If mice stayed on a 4-MU regimen, they remained diabetes-free for at least a year. But if the regimen was stopped, they quickly became diabetic. Tissue analysis revealed the continued presence of immune cells situated close to beta cells even in mice getting 4-MU, but the beta cells themselves seemed normal; the immune cells had evidently refrained from attacking them. The scientists also found reduced hyaluronan levels in 4-MU-treated mice s pancreatic islets, indicating that the drug was performing as expected. Further experiments in the mice showed that hyaluronan prevents the induction of a class of regulatory immune cells, known as Tregs, whose job is to rein in their aggressive fellow immune cells and keep them from damaging healthy tissue. Bollyky likened Tregs  function to that of military police. In the absence of appropriate supervision, immune cells can get trigger-happy, he said. But by impeding hyaluronan synthesis, 4-MU re-establishes the induction of enough Tregs to prevent beta-cell destruction. No drug has previously been shown to do this in humans, Bollyky said. His group has received preliminary funding from SPARK, a Stanford-based program devoted to fostering drug-development entrepreneurship, and is working with the FDA in preparation for a clinical trial of 4-MU for preventing Type 1 diabetes. The Stanford Office of Technology Licensing has applied for a use patent on associated intellectual property.","Published: September 16, 2015"

But this new research found that in certain patients with AML   a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells and the bone marrow   this gene was wrongly switched on inside the patient s cancer cells. When it is switched on in blood cell tissue, FOXC1 stunts the development of blood cells and stops them maturing into normal specialised blood cells.This triggers the cancer to be more aggressive, as young cells are able to replicate more than mature cells   causing cancer cells to grow faster and become more difficult to treat. Around 2,900 people were diagnosed with AML in the UK in 2011. Of these, around 20 per cent would have had the FOXC1 gene wrongly switched on in their cancer. Dr Tim Somervaille, lead author from the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute at The University of Manchester, said:  This is an important finding which helps us understand how acute myeloid leukaemia develops and why some cases of AML are more aggressive than others. Here, instead of being faulty or mutated, this normal gene is turned on in the wrong place at the wrong time which makes the cancer grow more rapidly.  There are certain situations where this gene is necessary, as in the development of the eye and skeleton before birth. But when it s switched on in the wrong tissue, it causes more aggressive forms of leukaemia.  Nell Barrie, senior science communication manager at Cancer Research UK, said:  It s essential that we continue to research basic biology to further understand how cells become cancerous. In this study, identifying a specific gene behind more aggressive forms of acute myeloid leukaemia could give clues for new ways to personalise treatments for select patients. The better we understand the nuts and bolts of each cancer, the sooner we can find new ways to stop it. ","Published: September 16, 2015"

The web-based repository is an important step in moving the fight against cancer toward precision medicine. The goal is to accelerate cancer research to improve the way we diagnose, treat and conduct further research on the disease. The resulting database, called the Oncology Models Forum (OMF), will be accessible to researchers through the National Institutes of Health, to encourage scientists to use existing validated cancer models, rather than creating new ones.  There are incredible new discoveries happening in cancer research today, such as detecting cancer cells and DNA in the blood stream, and even harnessing the immune system to fight cancers,  said Atul Butte, MD, PhD, director of the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at UCSF and principal investigator for the grant.  These research methodologies generate enormous amounts of data that can and should be harnessed by researchers and engineers to yield new drugs and diagnostics.  Cell lines and mice have been placeholders for studying human cancer for decades, resulting in thousands of mouse models for all cancer types. While results from those studies are chronicled in scientific papers and journals, it is difficult to know how relevant the data from these experimental systems are to the actual research and development of drugs and diagnostics in actual human cancers.  This is particularly important, Butte said, because there can be a gap of up to 10 years between the early basic science discoveries from experimental systems and the actual clinical trial of the drug candidates that are developed from that science, with many drug candidates failing in those clinical trials. As a result, it is critically important to ensure that early scientific discoveries are in fact relevant to human cancers, to provide every possible hope that the eventual drugs developed from those discoveries will work in clinical trials and be available to cancer patients. The project aims to create an online cache of molecular data that oncologists and cancer researchers could use to validate the current models that best translate to humans, make predictions about the disease and move toward a collaborative, precision medicine approach to cancer. Ultimately, Butte said, the effort also has the potential to create computer-based cancer models that greatly reduce the need for using animals in research. The project, led by the UCSF Institute for Computational Health Sciences, will collaborate with Alejandro Sweet-Cordero, MD, Julien Sage, PhD, and Nigam Shah, PhD, at Stanford University, who will provide support with the latest genetically-engineered cancer models, as well as standardized nomenclatures.

Lateral flow immunoassays represent popular point of care diagnostics, as they are easy to use, cost-effective and produce rapid results. Both companies, SCIENION and Axxin, take an active part in this market segment and contribute with its technologies towards products and services for its customers. Joining forces in this field brings together SCIENION s picoliter dispensing technology and Axxin s proven track record in commercializing diagnostic instrument systems for point of care diagnostics. The first joint project will be the development of a colorimetric reader system for multiplexed lateral flow microarrays for point of care and R&D applications. Multiplexed lateral flow assays can benefit from a dedicated detection device that provides optimal and quantitative analysis of results that eye-only interpretation could not match. A series of early field tests with selected beta customers has already been initiated and shows very promising results. Initial applications focus on lateral flow microarrays with the capability of analyzing up to 20 parameters for infectious diseases, drugs of abuse, and allergies. Holger Eickhoff, CEO of SCIENION, says:  Axxin is a well-known provider of reader platforms and diagnostic products for lateral flow applications. When we met first earlier this year, we immediately anticipated the benefits of a collaboration to generate added value for our customers.

In research published in the journal eLife, a team led by Prof. Matthew P. Scott at the University's School of Medicine tested a drug called Roflumilast in mice with a brain tumor that is resistant to Vismodegib, the drug in current use. Roflumilast is normally used to treat inflammatory lung diseases. It dramatically inhibited tumor growth from the first day of treatment. As expected, Vismodegib had no effect. Roflumilast is already FDA-approved so it is readily available for patients. However, it also causes side effects, so further studies are needed to find ways to reduce them or to develop other drugs that avoid this problem. ""New drugs beyond Vismodegib are needed because the current treatments for medulloblastoma have severe side effects, cure only about two-thirds of patients, and leave treated patients with lasting damage,"" says Dr. Xuecai Ge, the first author of the study. Some birth defects and tumors are caused by abnormalities in the way cells communicate with one another as an embryo grows. The Hedgehog signalling pathway is a cell-to-cell communication system essential for the normal growth of many tissues and organs in animal embryos. Among other roles, Hedgehog signalling proteins stimulate the proliferation of certain type of precursor cells before they mature into neurons in the developing cerebellum - the lower rear part of the brain. When genes that encode components of the Hedgehog signalling system are damaged by mutation, cells may think they are receiving a growth-stimulating signal when they are not. This leads to loss of growth control, and contributes to a wide range of tumors, including medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. The most common human cancer, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, is also due to loss of control of Hedgehog signalling and is treatable with Vismodegib. However those tumors, like the brain tumors, can mutate further to become resistant to the drug. Within medulloblastomas, the cancer cells mutate continuously, so even cancers that can initially be treated with Vismodegib will selectively lose sensitive cells while mutated resistant cells eventually proliferate and take over. Vismodegib targets a particular molecule in the Hedgehog signalling pathway, inhibiting cell division. In the current study, the scientists uncover an important new way in which the response to a Hedgehog signal is regulated. This could provide a new target for treatment. They found that a protein called Semaphorin 3 enhances the response to a Hedgehog signal. Elevated levels of Semaphorin 3 have been found in medulloblastoma. They reasoned that blocking the effect of Semaphorin 3 could inhibit the response to Hedgehog and therefore cell division. Semaphorin 3 activates an enzyme called PDE4D. By inhibiting PDE4D with a drug, Roflumilast, the scientists were able to inhibit tumor growth that had arisen from loss of control of Hedgehog signalling. Since Roflumilast affects a process that is independent of the one affected by Vismodegib, it works against Vismodegib-resistant tumors. Roflumilast is already used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It and other PDE4D inhibitors are also in clinical trials to improve cognitive and psychological disorders including memory loss. However, they have severe side effects, such as depression and weight loss. ""Our study shows that it is a priority to repurpose PDE4D inhibitors, perhaps in combination with other medicines, as a promising therapy for devastating and potentially fatal childhood brain tumors,"" says Dr. Ge. PDE4D inhibitors could also be effective against more common cancers such as basal cell carcinoma that also arise from damage to Hedgehog signalling. eLife Scott MP et al.

Researchers found that fetuses with enlarged ventricles were more likely to require a second surgery to relieve a life-threatening build-up of pressure within the brain. Given the risks that fetal surgery poses for mother and newborn, the findings indicate that, in these cases, it may be better to wait until after birth to perform the corrective spinal surgery. The scientists made this discovery by analyzing data from the NIH's Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) study. Myelomeningocele is the most serious form of spina bifida, a condition in which the spinal column fails to close around the spinal cord. With myelomeningocele, the spinal cord protrudes through an opening in the spine. People with the condition often experience weakness or paralysis below the defect and may need a wheelchair or other assistive device to get around. In 2011, MOMS researchers reported that surgically correcting the spinal defect while the fetus is in the womb greatly reduces the need to divert, or shunt, fluid away from the ventricles to relieve hydrocephalus, the life-threatening buildup of pressure inside the skull that sometimes accompanies myelomeningocele. In their recent analysis of data from the original MOMS study, the researchers found that fetuses who had larger ventricles were equally as likely to require placement of a shunt during the first year after birth, regardless of when they underwent the spinal repair surgery. ""These results indicate that physicians should proceed with caution before recommending in utero surgery for a fetus with enlarged ventricles,"" said Rosemary Higgins, M.D., of the Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch at NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), who oversaw the study. The study appears in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics. The study's first author is Noel B. Tulipan, M.D., of the Department of Neurosurgery and Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. The original MOMS study found that infants who had undergone the surgery before birth were more likely to walk without crutches or other devices. At 30 months of age, the fetal surgery group also had higher scores in tests of mental and motor development. However, as with any surgery, the procedure presented risks. Babies who underwent surgery in the uterus were more likely to be born preterm than were those who had the surgery after birth. Additionally, mothers in the fetal surgery group were at risk for having the surgical scar on the uterus tear or rupture during subsequent pregnancies. ""A major rationale for performing the surgery is to avoid having to place a shunt later on,"" Dr. Higgins said. ""If it's likely that a second surgery will be needed anyway, then it doesn't appear that the potential benefits of an initial fetal surgery outweigh the risks."" In the current analysis, researchers tabulated the results in a single, composite outcome, to highlight the differences between treatment and control groups. The primary combined outcome for this analysis was whether a child had died, had a shunt placed in the first year after birth, or met the study's criteria for when to place a shunt. Dr. Higgins explained that when the researchers began the original study, there were no formal recommendations for shunt placement, so the researchers developed a set of objective criteria to guide the treatment of patients in the study. Of the women who took part in the study, 91 were randomized to the prenatal surgery group and 92 to the postnatal group. Of these, 72.5 percent in the prenatal surgery group and 97.8 percent in the postnatal surgery group met the criteria for inclusion in the primary outcome. Overall, 44 percent of children in the prenatal surgery group had a shunt placed, compared to 83.7 percent in the postnatal group. When the women were first enrolled in the study, the researchers took magnetic resonance imaging scans of the fetuses' brains. Irrespective of whether they were in the prenatal or postnatal surgery group, children with the largest ventricles were more likely to require a shunt than those with smaller ventricles. For the prenatal surgery group, shunts were eventually placed in 20 percent of those with ventricles less than 10 mm, 45.2 percent with ventricles from 10 to just below 15 mm, and 79 percent with ventricle size of 15 mm or greater. For the postnatal surgery group, shunts were placed in 79.4 percent, 86 percent, and 87.5 percent, respectively. The researchers concluded that fetuses with ventricles smaller than 10 mm are the ideal candidates for fetal surgery, while there appears to be no benefit, in relation to shunting, for fetuses with ventricles 15 mm or larger. Cases in between should be evaluated carefully before deciding whether to refer them for fetal surgery, the authors wrote.

The findings are published in the journal Cerebral Cortex. Scientists conduct millions of experiments every year with mice, which have been genetically modified to mimic human disease. Having a far more precise model of the mouse brain will enhance knowledge about the connection between genetics and corresponding human disease, according to G. Allan Johnson, director of the Duke Center for In Vivo Microscopy. ""Interest in structural brain connectivity has grown with the understanding that abnormal neural connections play a significant role in neurologic and psychiatric diseases,"" Johnson said. ""Examining brain connectivity in small animals can help us better identify problems in the diseased brain, and apply that knowledge to humans."" The scientists created the connectome, or map of brain circuitry, by performing an MRI scan of the brain of a healthy mouse at spatial resolution more than 100,000 times greater than that of a conventional clinical MRI. Data were acquired using diffusion MRI, which traces the pathways of nerve fibers called axons throughout the brain. The accuracy of the connectome is determined by the spatial resolution and the number of different angles scanned. These new data are more than 1,000 times more precise than previous diffusion MRI scans of the mouse brain, Johnson said. ""Prior approaches to provide maps of the mouse brain have relied on fluorescent dyes injected into the brain,"" Johnson said. ""The brain is then cut in thin slices, digitized and put back together again in a computer. It's pretty tedious."" Producing these high-resolution MRI images also has its challenges, he said. Scanning even a tiny mouse brain at such close detail creates a daunting amount of data that has in the past made such a project impractical, Johnson said. But banks of high-powered computers have now allowed the scientists to capture and house the data and mathematically manipulate them to create the large 3-dimensional, digital models. The colorful connectivity matrix charts each region of the mouse brain and its probable connectivity to other brain structures.The researchers are currently building an online portal for scientists around the world to access the full directory of digital files to guide their own research into mouse neurocircuitry.

Now, a team led by Wyss Institute Core Faculty member David Mooney, Ph.D., has developed a new strategy   embedding stem cells into porous, transplantable hydrogels   that has experimentally improved bone repair by boosting the survival rate of transplanted stem cells and influencing their cell differentiation. Mooney   who is also the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)   and his team published their findings recently. The team included Georg Duda, Ph.D., who is a Wyss Associate Faculty member and the director of the Julius Wolff Institute and Professor of Biomechanics and Musculoskeletal Regeneration at Charit    Universit tsmedizin Berlin, and Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.  Stem cell therapies bear tremendous hopes for the repair of many tissues and bone or even the replacement of entire organs. Tissue specific stem cells can now be generated in the laboratory. However, no matter how well they grow in the laboratory, stem cells must survive after they are transplanted and function correctly at the site of injury to be useful for clinical regenerative therapies. As of now, transplanted cell death remains a major challenge. To improve the therapeutic ability of transplanted stem cells, Mooney's team has drawn inspiration from naturally occurring stem cell ""niches"". A 'stem cell niche' is a unique support system for stem cells consisting of other cell types and an extracellular molecular matrix that affects their fate.  Recently, Mooney's team as well as other researchers have identified specific chemical and physical cues from the niche that act in concert to promote stem cell survival, multiplication and maturation into tissue. Whereas chemical signals that control stem cell behavior are increasingly understood, much less is known about the mechanical properties of stem cell niches. Stem cells like those present in bone, cartilage or muscle cultured in laboratories, however, have been found to possess mechanosensitivities; meaning they require a physical substrate with defined elasticity and stiffness to proliferate and mature on.  ""So far these physical influences had not been efficiently harnessed to propel real world regeneration processes,"" said Nathaniel Huebsch, a Graduate Student who worked with Mooney and who is the study's first author. ""Based on our experience with mechanosensitive stem cells, we hypothesized that hydrogels could be leveraged to generate the right chemical and mechanical cues in a first model of bone regeneration.""  Key to the method developed by Mooney's team is the combination of two water filled hydrogels with very different properties. A more stable, longer lasting 'bulk gel' is filled with small bubbles of a second, so called 'porogen' that degrades at a much faster rate, leaving behind porous cavities.  By coupling the bulk gel with a small peptide derived from the extracellular environment of genuine stem cell niches, and mixing it with a tissue specific stem cell type as well as the porogen, the team can create a bone forming artificial niche. While the bulk gel provides just the right amount of elasticity plus a relevant chemical signal to coax stem cells into proliferation and send them on their maturation path, the porogen gradually breaks down, leaving open spaces for the stem cells to expand into before they naturally migrate out of the gel structure altogether to form actual mineralized bone tissue. In small animal experiments conducted so far, the researchers show that a void forming hydrogel with the correct chemical and elastic properties provides better bone regeneration than transplanting stem cells alone. Of further interest, the maturing stem cells deployed by the hydrogel also induce nearby native stem cells to contribute to bone repair, thus further amplifying their regenerative effects. ""This study provides the first demonstration that the physical properties of a biomaterial can not only help deliver stem cells but also tune their behavior in vivo,"" said Mooney. ""While so far we have focused on orchestrating bone formation, we believe that our hydrogel concept can be broadly applied to other regenerative processes as well."" The collaborative, cross disciplinary work was supported by the Harvard University Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), which is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).  ""This is an exquisite demonstration of MRSEC programs' high impact,"" said Dan Finotello, program director at the NSF.

The UK10K study was designed to explore the contribution of these rare genetic variants to human disease and its risk factors. ""The project has made important new contributions towards describing the role of rare genetic variants in a broad range of disease scenarios and human traits."" says Dr Nicole Soranzo, corresponding author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. ""It has shown that the value of sequencing a few thousand individuals is high for highly penetrant, rare diseases, but that for complex traits and diseases much larger sample sizes will be required in future studies. The data and results produced by this project will be instrumental for these future efforts."" The project studied nearly 10,000 individuals, both healthy and affected by disease. The conditions included very rare disorders inherited in families, and more common diseases such as autism, schizophrenia and obesity. In healthy people, 64 different biomedical risk factors such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels were studied. By characterising the DNA sequence of these individuals, the project gained insight into the contribution of rare variants to a broad range of disease scenarios, and discovered new genetic variants and genes underpinning disease risk. ""The UK10K project has increased the resolution of genetic discoveries. It has enabled access to a much denser set of variants within the genome in the UK population, which can be used to refine our understanding of genetic effect on phenotypic traits,"" explains Richard Durbin, senior UK10K researcher at the Sanger Institute. ""In earlier studies either very rare variants with big effects or common variants, which usually only have small effects, could be analysed. Now we have been able to explore an increased part of the spectrum of variation in between the very rare and the common ones."" A series of papers published in collaboration with other investigators demonstrates the value of these data for genetic discoveries. As efforts continue to characterise the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases, the data and results of this study are expected to enable the next wave of discoveries. The UK10K sequence reference panel, described in greater detail in a companion paper published in Nature Communications, has been shown to greatly increase the ability to characterise rare variants in large population samples available to the worldwide research community. This resource will enable researchers to 'fill in' missing data from lower resolution genotype studies, allowing them to explore full genotypes more quickly and cheaply. In addition, the authors have developed a web-based browser of association based on the Dalliance platform, described in a companion paper in Bioinformatics. This genome browser allows the easy retrieval of association results for all disease risk traits analysed in the study. Scientists investigating these specific disease risk factors will be able to directly access the consequence of a person's DNA sequence to see how common any genetic variants they have are and what traits these variations are associated with. ""The UK10K project was an enormous undertaking and has laid the ground for future studies,"" says Klaudia Walter, a leading author from the Sanger Institute.

To date, data generated by the TCGA effort has helped identify nearly 10 million mutations in tumors.  Beyond cancer, the Broad Institute has served as a flagship center for the genetic and molecular analysis of numerous common diseases including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Along with its expertise in large-scale sequencing projects, the Broad Institute has helped pioneer new techniques to generate high-quality data on challenging sample types, such as those with limited material and with Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded, or FFPE specimens. The Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute will leverage these capabilities as part of the GCC effort, which requires a diverse sample set to enable the collection of large tumor cohorts. ""I am glad to have the Broad Institute as an integral partner of the NCI large-scale genomic programs,"" said Jean C. ZenKlusen, Ph.D., Director of NCI's Cancer Genome Atlas. ""They have demonstrated the ability to produce the highest-quality data in their participation on The Cancer Genome Atlas, and I know they will bring the same level of performance to these new initiatives.""","Published: September 15, 2015"

MP1 interacts with lipids that are abnormally distributed on the surface of cancer cells, creating gaping holes that allow molecules crucial for cell function to leak out. ""Cancer therapies that attack the lipid composition of the cell membrane would be an entirely new class of anticancer drugs,"" says co-senior study author Paul Beales, of the University of Leeds in the UK. ""This could be useful in developing new combination therapies, where multiple drugs are used simultaneously to treat a cancer by attacking different parts of the cancer cells at the same time."" MP1 acts against microbial pathogens by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. Serendipitously, the antimicrobial peptide shows promise for protecting humans from cancer; it can inhibit the growth of prostate and bladder cancer cells, as well as multi-drug resistant leukemic cells. However, until now, it was not clear how MP1 selectively destroys cancer cells without harming normal cells.Beales and co-senior study author Jo o Ruggiero Neto of S o Paulo State University in Brazil suspected that the reason might have something to do with the unique properties of cancer cell membranes. In healthy cell membranes, phospholipids called phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are located in the inner membrane leaflet facing the inside of the cell. But in cancer cells, PS and PE are embedded in the outer membrane leaflet facing the cell surroundings. The researchers tested their theory by creating model membranes, some of which contained PE and/or PS, and exposing them to MP1. They used a wide range of imaging and biophysical techniques to characterize MP1's destructive effects on the membranes. Strikingly, the presence of PS increased the binding of MP1 to the membrane by a factor of 7 to 8. On the other hand, the presence of PE enhanced MP1's ability to quickly disrupt the membrane, increasing the size of holes by a factor of 20 to 30. ""Formed in only seconds, these large pores are big enough to allow critical molecules such as RNA and proteins to easily escape cells,"" Neto says. ""The dramatic enhancement of the permeabilization induced by the peptide in the presence of PE and the dimensions of the pores in these membranes was surprising."" In future studies, the researchers plan to alter MP1's amino acid sequence to examine how the peptide's structure relates to its function and further improve the peptide's selectivity and potency for clinical purposes. ""Understanding the mechanism of action of this peptide will help in translational studies to further assess the potential for this peptide to be used in medicine,"" Beales says. ""As it has been shown to be selective to cancer cells and non-toxic to normal cells in the lab, this peptide has the potential to be safe, but further work would be required to prove that.""","Published: September 15, 2015"

This followed the ODD already received for the product in Europe. Autoimmune uveitis is a severe inflammatory condition of the eye, often resulting in permanent vision damage. Uveitis is one of the leading causes of blindness in the developed world. No treatment is currently approved for the patients that become refractory to corticosteroid compounds.  The Orphan Drug Designation in both the US and EU is the latest significant step for the development of Col-Treg, a novel and promising therapeutic approach for autoimmune uveitis, resulting from TxCell s ASTrIA platform. TxCell applied for and received Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU, which will allow us to expedite Col-Treg through development. This ultimately will benefit those suffering from autoimmune uveitis, a truly debilitating condition of the eye. TxCell plans to move Col-Treg into a first clinical study in 2016, with top line results expected end 2017,  said Stephane Boissel, CEO, TxCell. The FDA Orphan Drug Designation provides a special status to drugs and biologics intended to treat, diagnose or prevent rare diseases and disorders. Rare diseases and disorders are defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. In particular, this designation provides for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition as well as certain incentives, including federal grants and tax credits. This adds to the benefits of the EU ODD, which includes 10 years of market exclusivity from product launch as well as protocol assistance and possible exemptions or reductions in regulatory fees during development.","Published: September 15, 2015"

More than 1,000 children will die from cancer in 2015, making it the leading cause of death from disease among children. Cancer is caused by abnormal cells that grow out of control. It starts when a single cell has damage to its DNA that spurs it to divide without stopping, forming tumors that may spread to other tissues. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies are improving the ability to detect these genetic misspellings, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment. A team led by Dr. Arul Chinnaiyan at the University of Michigan started a program in 2012 to examine the feasibility of including clinical sequencing information in the care of young patients with cancer. Their goal is to tailor treatment based on the genetic features of a person s cancer. This is known as precision medicine an approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. The team enrolled 102 participants (average age 10.6 years; range, 0 to 22 years) who had cancer, including leukemia and sarcoma, that didn t respond to treatment (refractory), had returned (relapsed), or was rare. The researchers sequenced the tumor exome (the part of DNA that codes for proteins) and RNA as well as DNA from normal tissue in 91 participants who had enough tumor tissue for the analysis. The study was funded in part by NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and National Cancer Institute (NCI). Results were published on September 1, 2015, in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The findings were discussed by a group of experts who considered scientific, logistical, and ethical issues before making recommendations to families and their physicians. The group determined that 42 of the 91 patients (46%) had genomic sequence discoveries that were potentially  actionable they could lead to a change in cancer management. Tailored actions were carried out in 23 patients (25%). These included changes in treatment for 14 patients (15%) and genetic counseling for future risk in participants and their families for 9 (10%). The researchers note several limitations with the study. Since there wasn t a control group, they couldn t assess whether the approach resulted in improved outcomes. The sequencing cost which was covered under the research protocol was about $6,000 per patient. The time that it took to perform the sequencing, discuss the findings, and report back to the families was lengthy, averaging about 7 to 8 weeks.  We were excited to see an actionable finding in such a substantial percentage of patients, and we think it could potentially be higher over time. These are patients who had exhausted all proven therapeutic options or who had an extremely rare diagnosis. If we can find a clinically actionable event and have a chance to act upon it, we show in this study that it can have a big impact on that patient,  Chinnaiyan says.","Published: September 15, 2015"

The VIB/UGent scientists were able to identify this set of genes through advanced and highly detailed analyses. Expression analysis of specific genes will help breeders select the most useful crossing products at a very early stage. Smart breeding thanks to good understanding of genetic processes It takes a long time to develop new strains of plants with a greater yield or greater resistance to disease. Selecting the most useful crossing products, in particular, is a labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive process. At present, breeding products must be manually infected to determine whether they are disease-resistant, while corn plants must first produce ears before their yield can be determined. This selection process can be made much more efficient by choosing plants on the basis of genetic data rather than on the basis of external characteristics. After all, many external properties are contained in DNA. Thanks to an improved understanding of how plant growth and development are regulated at the molecular level, it is now known to a large extent which DNA sequences are responsible for which traits. By identifying the presence of such DNA sequences (also known as genetic markers) in seedlings, it is possible to  predict at a very early stage whether the fully grown plants will be disease-resistant, even without having to infect the plants. This type of breeding is called marker-assisted breeding. A team of scientists from VIB and UGent, led by Prof. Dirk Inz , developed a new method designed to predict the size of the leaves of a fully grown corn plant while the plant itself is still a seedling. This method is RNA-based rather than DNA-based. RNA rather than DNA Hereditary information is contained in DNA. However, not all information is needed in every plant cell. For instance,  the genetic sequence causing plants to flower should not be activated in the roots. Before hereditary information can be expressed, the information in DNA must be transcribed to an RNA molecule, which is then translated into a protein . In other words, the set of all RNA molecules (also known as the transcriptome) provides a much greater insight into which genes actively contribute to a growth process. Plant scientist Dr. Joke Baute, a member of Prof. Dirk Inz s VIB research group, and fellow scientists from the Italian Institute of Life Sciences in Pisa conducted a study into the transcriptome of the cell division zone in leaves of corn seedlings. The scientists were able to link a set of RNA molecules to external properties, which are not expressed until much later in the growth process, such as final leaf size and biomass production. This knowledge will allow breeders to make much more specific choices in the plant breeding process in the future.  More mouths to feed Agriculture is facing great challenges worldwide. Although the United Nations has predicted that food production will have to increase by 70% by 2050 to feed the world s population, production levels are under pressure due to climate change and the demand for more environmentally friendly agricultural methods. Innovative strategies for plant breeding, soil management and cultivation methods will be required to achieve the necessary level of agricultural productivity without further destruction to valuable natural ecosystems.  VIB/UGent scientist Dirk Inz :  We are world leaders in investigating the mechanisms which determine plant growth and plant size. These new insights will help us to accelerate the plant breeding process. In the long term, breeders will be able to select the most useful plants at a very early stage, which will considerably speed up breeding programs. ","Published: September 15, 2015"

PancSCs can make use of a more efficient form of metabolism, called oxidative phosphorylation or OXPHOS, which does use oxygen. OXPHOS uses a part of the cell called mitochondria and it is this which can be targeted with anti-diabetic drug, metformin. Some PancSCs are however able to escape this treatment by being much more flexible in their metabolism, leading to a recurrence of the cancer, but the investigators also found a way to prevent such resistance and force all PancSCs to keep using OXPHOS.The researchers think that the new discovery could be used to develop treatments that stop the stem cells using oxygen and prevent cancer returning after conventional treatment. A clinical trial is planned for later next year. Dr Patricia Sancho, first author of the research paper, said:  We might be able to exploit this reliance on oxygen by targeting the stem cells with drugs that are already available, killing the cancer by cutting off its energy supply.  In the long term, this could mean that pancreatic cancer patients have more treatment options available to them, including a reduced risk of recurrence following surgery and other treatments.  Pancreatic cancer is still one of the most difficult cancer types to treat, partly because of its tendency to cause symptoms and trigger diagnosis only at a late and advanced stage. Many patients do not live longer than a year post-diagnosis. These cancers are also becoming more common due to obesity, which causes pancreatic cancer risk factors including metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Limited treatment options and a failure to improve survival rates mean that finding new treatment strategies is a priority. PancSCs could be an important but as yet overlooked piece of this puzzle. While they make up only a small proportion of the tumour, they have the potential to make new tumours, even if all the other cells are killed, and are prone to spreading around the body (metastasis).","Published: September 15, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/an-antibody-that-can-attack-hiv-in-new-ways-186466,An Antibody That Can Attack HIV in New Ways Proteins called broadly neutralizing antibodies  bNAbs  are a promising key to the prevention of infection by HIV  the virus that causes AIDS   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. bNAbs have been found in blood samples from some HIV patients whose immune systems can naturally control the infection. These antibodies may protect a patient's healthy cells by recognizing a protein called the envelope spike, present on the surface of all HIV strains and inhibiting, or neutralizing, the effects of the virus. Now Caltech researchers have discovered that one particular bNAb may be able to recognize this signature protein, even as it takes on different conformations during infection making it easier to detect and neutralize the viruses in an infected patient. The process of HIV infection begins when the virus comes into contact with human immune cells called T cells that carry a particular protein, CD4, on their surface. Three-part (or ""trimer"") proteins called envelope spikes on the surface of the virus recognize and bind to the CD4 proteins. The spikes can be in either a closed or an open conformation, going from closed to open when the spike binds to CD4. The open conformation then triggers fusion of the virus with the target cell, allowing the HIV virus to deposit its genetic material inside the host cell, forcing it to become a factory for making new viruses that can go on to infect other cells.The bNAbs recognize the envelope spike on the surface of HIV, and most known bNAbs only recognize the spike in the closed conformation. Although the only target of neutralizing antibodies is the envelope spike, each bNAb actually functions by recognizing just one specific target, or epitope, on this protein. Some targets allow more effective neutralization of the virus, and, therefore, some bNAbs are more effective against HIV than others. In 2014, Bjorkman and her collaborators at Rockefeller University reported initial characterization of a potent bNAb called 8ANC195 in the blood of HIV patients whose immune systems could naturally control their infections. They also discovered that this antibody could neutralize the HIV virus by targeting a different epitope than any other previously identified bNAb. In the work described in the recent paper, they investigated how 8ANC195 functions and how its unique properties could be beneficial for HIV therapies. ""In Pamela's lab we use X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to study protein protein interactions on a molecular level,"" says Louise Scharf, a postdoctoral scholar in Bjorkman's laboratory and the first author on the paper. ""We previously were able to define the binding site of this antibody on a subunit of the HIV envelope spike, so in this study we solved the three-dimensional structure of this antibody in complex with the entire spike, and showed in detail exactly how the antibody recognizes the virus."" What they found was that although most bNAbs recognize the envelope spike in its closed conformation, 8ANC195 could recognize the viral protein in both the closed conformation and a partially open conformation. ""We think it's actually an advantage if the antibody can recognize these different forms,"" Scharf says. The most common form of HIV infection is when a virus in the bloodstream attaches to a T cell and infects the cell. In this instance, the spikes on the free-floating virus would be predominantly in the closed conformation until they made contact with the host cell. Most bNAbs could neutralize this virus. However, HIV also can spread directly from one cell to another. In this case, because the antibody already is attached to the host cell, the spike is in an open conformation. But 8ANC195 could still recognize and attach to it. A potential medical application of this antibody is in so-called combination therapies, in which a patient is given a cocktail of several antibodies that work in different ways to fight off the virus as it rapidly changes and evolves. ""Our collaborators at Rockefeller have studied this extensively in animal models, showing that if you administer a combination of these antibodies, you greatly reduce how much of the virus can escape and infect the host,"" Scharf says. ""So 8ANC195 is one more antibody that we can use therapeutically; it targets a different epitope than other potent antibodies, and it has the advantage of being able to recognize these multiple conformations."" The idea of bNAb therapeutics might not be far from a clinical reality. Scharf says that the same collaborators at Rockefeller University are already testing bNAbs in a human treatment in a clinical trial. Although the initial trial will not include 8ANC195, the antibody may be included in a combination therapy trial in the near future, Scharf says. Furthermore, the availability of complete information about how 8ANC195 binds to the viral spike will allow Scharf, Bjorkman, and their colleagues to begin engineering the antibody to be more potent and able to recognize more strains of HIV. ""In addition to supporting the use of 8ANC195 for therapeutic applications, our structural studies of 8ANC195 have revealed an unanticipated new conformation of the HIV envelope spike that is relevant to understanding the mechanism by which HIV enters host cells and bNAbs inhibit this process,"" Bjorkman says.","Published: September 15, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/improving-antibiotic-effectiveness-198045,Improving Antibiotic Effectiveness New drug approach could offer relief to patients  hospitals fighting antibiotic resistance   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Virginia Tech researchers have discovered a new group of antibiotics that may provide relief to some of the more than 2 million people in the United States affected by antibiotic resistance. The new antibiotics target the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, or staph, and the antibiotic resistant strains commonly known as MRSA, short for methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus. In 2013, invasive MRSA infections were responsible for an estimated 9,937 deaths in the U.S. Although current infection rates are declining, the majority of these deaths, about 8,150, were associated with inpatient stays in health care facilities, according to the Active Bacterial Core surveillance report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The discovery shows that the potential new antibiotics are unlike contemporary antibiotics because they contain iridium, a silvery-white transition metal. New transition metal complexes do not easily breakdown, which is important for delivery of antibiotics to where they are needed to fight infections in the body. Even though these compounds contain iridium, further testing by the researchers shows that they are nontoxic to animals and animal cells. Thus, they are likely safe for use in humans, according to the researchers. ""So far our findings show that these compounds are safer than other compounds made from transition metals,"" said Joseph Merola, a professor of chemistry in the College of Science, a Fralin Life Science Institute affiliate, and a corresponding author of the study. ""One of the reasons for this is that the compounds in this paper that target MRSA are very specific, meaning that a specific structure-function relationship must be met in order to kill the bacteria."" Researchers showed the antibiotics effectively kill the bacteria without inhibiting mammalian cells. A version of the antibiotic was tested for toxicity in mice with no ill effects. ""We are still at the beginning of developing and testing these antibiotics but, so far, our preliminary results show a new group of antibiotics that are effective and safe,"" said Joseph Falkinham, a professor of microbiology in the College of Science and an affiliate of the Virginia Tech Center for Drug Discovery. ""Within the next few years, we hope to identify various characteristics of these antibiotics, such as their stability, their distribution and concentration in animal tissue, their penetration into white blood cells, and their metabolism in animals."" The team is currently testing the compounds in human cell lines and, so far, the cells have remained normal and healthy. This discovery comes at a time when antibiotic resistance is a significant health concern all over the world, for people and for livestock. Last September, the U.S. federal government issued an executive order to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, stating that it ""represents a serious threat to public health and the economy."" In March, a National Action Plan outlined critical next steps for key federal agencies and departments. According to estimates cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, antibiotic resistance is a problem that adds around $20 billion annually to health care costs in the U.S. ""The biggest question scientists have to ask to tackle antibiotic resistance is, how can we stay on top of the bacteria? Fortunately, these new organometallic antibiotics are coming at a time when bacteria have not evolved to resist them,"" said Merola, who is also an affiliate of the Virginia Tech Center for Drug Discovery. In both the U.S. and Europe, the spread of MRSA is a major threat to people in hospitals and other health care facilities. When people contract the bacteria in a hospital setting, the infection can be life-threatening and cause pneumonia and infections in the bloodstream and in surgical wounds, according to the CDC. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and nose, which is how it spreads into hospitals and other medical facilities. ""Before you go into the hospital for surgery, many hospitals will do a nasal swab, and if you have staph, they will treat you before surgery because it could be transferred into your body and cause serious infection,"" Falkinham said.","Published: September 15, 2015"

Yet many studies and analytical techniques aimed at understanding how biological systems work at the cellular level treat all of the cells in a tissue sample as identical, averaging measurements over the entire cellular population. It is easy to see why this happens. With the cell's complex matrix of organelles, signalling chemicals, and genetic material not to mention its miniscule scale zooming in to differentiate what is happening within each individual cell is no trivial task. ""But being able to do single-cell analysis is crucial to understanding a lot of biological systems,"" says Long Cai, assistant professor of chemistry at Caltech. ""This is true in brains, in biofilms, in embryos . . . you name it."" Now Cai's lab has developed a method for simultaneously imaging and identifying dozens of molecules within individual cells. This technique could offer new insight into how cells are organized and interact with each other and could eventually improve our understanding of many diseases.The imaging technique that Cai and his colleagues have developed allows researchers not only to resolve a large number of molecules such as messenger RNA species (mRNAs) within a single cell, but also to systematically label each type of molecule with its own unique fluorescent ""bar code"" so it can be readily identified and measured without damaging the cell. ""Using this technique, there is essentially no limit on how many different types of molecules you can detect within a single cell,"" explains Cai. The new method uses an innovative sequential bar-coding scheme that takes fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a well-known procedure for detecting specific sequences of DNA or RNA in a sample, to the next level. Cai and his colleagues have dubbed their technique FISH Sequential Coding anALYSis (FISH SCALYS).  FISH makes use of molecular probes short fragments of DNA bound to fluorescent dyes, or fluorophores. These probes bind, or hybridize, to DNA or RNA with complementary sequences. When a hybridized sample is imaged with microscopy, the fluorophore lights up, pinpointing the target molecule's location. There are a handful of fluorophores that can be used in these probes, and researchers typically use them to identify only a few different genes. For example, they will use a red dye to label all of the probes that target a specific type of mRNA. And when they image the sample, they will see a bunch of red dots in the cell. Then they will take another set of probes that target a different type of mRNA, label them with a blue fluorophore, and see glowing blue spots. And so on. But what if a researcher wants to image more types of molecules than there are fluorophores? In the past, they have tried to mix the dyes together, making both red and blue probes for a particular gene, so that when both probes bind to the gene, the resulting dot would look purple. It was an imperfect solution and could still only label about 30 different types of molecules. Cai's team realized that the same handful of fluorophores could be used in sequential rounds of hybridization to create thousands of unique fluorescent bar codes that could clearly identify many types of molecules (see graphic at right). ""With our technique, each tagged molecule remains just one single color in each round but we build up a bar code through multiple rounds, so the colors remain distinguishable. Using additional colors and extra rounds of hybridization, you can scale up easily to identify tens of thousands of different molecules,"" says Cai. The number of bar codes available is potentially immense: FN, where F is the number of fluorophores and N is the number of rounds of hybridization. So with four dyes and eight rounds of hybridization, scientists would have more than enough bar codes (48=65,536) to cover all of the approximately 20,000 RNA molecules in a cell. Cai says FISH SCALYS could be used to determine molecular identities of various types of cells, including embryonic stem cells. ""One subset of genes will be turned on for one type of cell and off for another,"" he explains. It could also provide insight into the way that diseases alter cells, allowing researchers to compare the expression differences for a large number of genes in normal tissue versus diseased tissue. Cai has recently been funded by the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience to adapt the technique to identify different types of neurons in samples from the hippocampus, a part of the brain associated with memory and learning. Cai is also leading a program through Caltech's Beckman Institute that is helping other researchers on campus apply the imaging method to diverse biological questions. Cai and his team describe the technique in a paper titled ""Single-cell in situ RNA profiling by sequential hybridization."" Caltech graduate student Eric Lubeck and postdoctoral scholar Ahmet Coskun are lead authors on the paper.

In many cases, those plants are still the primary source of the drug. Now Elizabeth Sattely, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Stanford, and her graduate student Warren Lau have isolated the machinery for making a widely used cancer-fighting drug from an endangered plant. They then put that machinery into a common, easily grown laboratory plant, which was able to produce the chemical. The technique could potentially be applied to other plants and drugs, creating a less expensive and more stable source for those drugs. ""People have been grinding up plants to find new chemicals and testing their activity for a really long time,"" Sattely said. ""What was striking to us is that with a lot of the plant natural products currently used as drugs, we have to grow the plant, then isolate the compound, and that's what goes into humans."" In her work, Sattely and her team used a novel technique to identify proteins that work together in a molecular assembly line to produce the cancer drug. Her group then showed that the proteins could produce the compound outside the plant   in this case, they had put the machinery in a different plant, but they hope to eventually produce the drug in yeast. Either the plant or yeast would provide a controlled laboratory environment for producing the drug. This work could lead to new ways of modifying the natural pathways to produce derivative drugs that are safer or more effective than the natural source. ""A big promise of synthetic biology is to be able to engineer pathways that occur in nature, but if we don't know what the proteins are, then we can't even start on that endeavor,"" said Sattely, who is also a member of the interdisciplinary institutes Stanford Bio-X and Stanford ChEM-H. Finding the machinery The drug Sattely chose to focus on is produced by a leafy Himalayan plant called the mayapple. Within the plant, a series of proteins work in a step-by-step fashion to churn out a chemical defense against predators. That chemical defense, after a few modifications in the lab, becomes a widely used cancer drug called etoposide. The starting material for this chemical defense is a harmless molecule commonly present in the leaf. When the plant senses an attack, it begins producing proteins that make up the assembly line. One by one, those proteins add a little chemical something here, subtract something there, and after a final molecular nip and tuck, the harmless starting material is transformed into a chemical defense. The challenge was figuring out which of the many proteins found in the mayapple leaf were the ones involved in this pathway. Sattely started with the realization that the proteins she needed to find weren't always present in the leaf. ""It's only when the leaf is wounded that the molecule is made,"" she said. And if the molecule is only made after wounding, the proteins that make that molecule are probably also only around after a wound as well. The question then became, ""What are all the molecules that are there after wounding?"" Sattely said. It turns out that after damaging the plant leaf, 31 new proteins appeared. Sattely and her team put various combinations of those proteins together until they eventually found 10 that made up the full assembly line. They put genes that make those 10 proteins into a common laboratory plant, and that plant began producing the chemical they were seeking. Drugs from yeast The eventual goal is not simply moving molecular machinery from plant to plant. Now that she's proven the molecular machinery works outside the plant, Sattely wants to put the proteins in yeast, which can be grown in large vats in the lab to better provide a stable source of drugs. Producing a drug in yeast also provides some flexibility that isn't present when isolating a drug from plants. ""We can only use what the plant gives us,"" Sattely said. In yeast, scientists can modify the genes to produce proteins with slightly different functions. For example, they could nip a little more off the chemical or add a slightly bigger side chain, or subtly alter the function of the eventual drug. It may also be possible to feed the yeast a slightly different starting product, thereby changing the chemical that the molecular assembly line churns out. These approaches would provide a way of tweaking existing drugs in an effort to improve them. Sattely said the work is a good example of how chemistry can be applied to problems of human health, which is the goal of Stanford ChEM-H. She thinks the technique she developed to find the pathway in mayapple could be applied to a wide range of other plants and drugs. ""My interests are really identifying new molecules and pathways from plants that are important for human health,"" she said.","Published: September 15, 2015"

In June 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended granting a marketing authorization in Europe for Raxone  for the treatment of Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) and Santhera expects a final decision from the European Commission (EC) very soon. In parallel, the Company advances Raxone /Catena  with high priority towards approval in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in Europe and the USA. Thomas Meier, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Santhera, commented on the first six months of 2015: ""The recommendation for approval granted in June by the CHMP for Raxone as first treatment for LHON marks the biggest success in our Company's history. Raxone is to become the first treatment approved for any mitochondrial disease and will establish Santhera as leader in mitochondrial medicine. Subject to approval from the EC, we expect to roll out the commercial launch of Raxone in the first countries during the second half of the year, providing the first treatment opportunity to LHON patients who typically remain permanently blind if untreated. Based on the data from the successful Phase III trial in DMD, we continue to prepare for regulatory filings for Raxone/Catena in DMD in the fourth quarter of 2015, both in the United States of America and in Europe."" Christoph Rentsch, Chief Financial Officer of Santhera, added: ""We recently raised CHF 27.7 million by the sale of 300,000 registered shares. Combined with the increased income from product sales during the first half this transaction substantially increased the Company's cash position, which at the end of August amounted to CHF 37.0 million. Santhera now has the financial resources to expedite the commercial launch of Raxone for the treatment of LHON in the European Union."" Key Financials in the First Half Year:  Preparation for product launch increased cash burn during six-month periodAs of June 30, 2015, Santhera had cash and cash equivalents of CHF 10.5 million. Net change in cash and cash equivalents in the first half year of 2015 increased to CHF -7.0 million (1H 2014: CHF 0 million) as a result of the ongoing preparation to launch Raxone in Europe.   Increase in sales of RaxoneIn the first six months of 2015, Raxone generated net sales of CHF 1.5 million (1H 2014: CHF 0.8 million), driven by increased product sales for LHON patients under the temporary authorization cATU in France as well as sales under named patient and special access programs.   Higher operating expenses due to launch preparations and expanded operationsOperating expenses of CHF 7.4 million (1H 2014: CHF 3.9 million) were comprised of CHF 2.8 million in development, CHF 1.4 million in marketing and sales expenses, and CHF 3.1 million in general and administrative expenses (G&A). The increase reflects the hiring of a commercial team for the product launch, higher expenses in development due to preparation of regulatory filings and higher expenses in G&A resulting from the expansion of Santhera's operations. Consequently, the operating loss was CHF -6.0 million (1H 2014: CHF -3.1 million) leading to a net result of CHF -6.2 million (1H 2014: CHF -3.1 million). Product and Pipeline Highlights:  Received positive opinion from the CHMPIn June 2015, the CHMP recommended granting a marketing authorization for Raxone for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with LHON. The formal marketing authorization from the EC for the product is expected shortly.   Advanced preparation for product launchIn recent months, the Company prepared for a fast and efficient launch of Raxone which is planned for the first countries in coming weeks subject to EC approval.   Published outcome of Phase III study in The Lancet and prepares for regulatory filings for Raxone/Catena in DMD in Europe and the USA Earlier this year, the positive outcome of the Phase III study was published in The Lancet and presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. Based on available data from Santhera's development program with Raxone/Catena in DMD and supplemented by natural history data which we obtain from a collaboration with the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG), Santhera plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) in the USA and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) as a variation to the EC approval in LHON. In April 2015, the US FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for Raxone/Catena for the treatment of DMD.   Started dosing of first Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD) patient with omigapil and completed patient recruitment in collaborative study with US National Institutes of Health (NIH) The first patient in the CALLISTO Phase I trial was dosed with oral omigapil in a new formulation developed by Santhera for use in children. At the same time, all 20 participants required for the study have been selected, prescreened and randomly assigned to one of the three study cohorts. The study is being conducted at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda (Maryland, USA) and assesses the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of omigapil in ambulatory and non-ambulatory children affected by either Ullrich or MDC1A subtypes of CMD. Corporate Highlights:  Expanded Executive Management and started building a commercial teamIn the first half year of 2015, Santhera nominated three senior members of staff to its Executive Management and newly appointed a Chief Commercial Officer and a Chief Financial Officer in a step to prepare the Company for its growth strategy. Simultaneously, the Company started building a commercial team with experience in successfully managing the international commercialization of orphan and niche-market drug products. Outlook:In Europe, after approval from the EC, Raxone will be commercially launched in the first countries for the treatment of LHON starting in the second half of 2015. The Company continues its interactions with regulatory authorities and plans to submit NDA and MAA filings for DMD based on the positive Phase III DELOS trial, the natural history study from the CINRG, and other supportive evidence of efficacy. The Company believes that, with CHF 37.0 million as of end of August 2015, it has sufficient cash to support the commercial introduction of Raxone in Europe and the currently planned development and regulatory programs.","Published: September 15, 2015"

The aim of the study was to assess alterations in liver function capacity with the LiMAx test after bariatric surgery of obese patients. Study results demonstrated that fatty liver disease is reversible after weight reduction and that the LiMAx test is a reliable tool to measure functional liver recovery after obesity surgery. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dramatically in recent years. Approximately half or more than half of the Western world s population is overweight or obese. The hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is presently considered to be the most common liver disease in Western countries. NAFLD may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. Both, NAFLD and NASH are reversible when effective weight reduction can be achieved. However, current noninvasive approaches to diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD and NASH are deficient. Bariatric surgery provides long-term weight loss and improvement of obesity-associated liver diseases. In a prospective cohort study from October 2011 to May 2014, morbidly obese individuals receiving bariatric surgery were investigated for functional liver recovery. Liver function was determined by the LiMAx test preoperatively, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Investigator Prof. Ulf Neumann, Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, said:  We applied the LiMAx test to assess the liver function of morbidly obese patients and to monitor the functional liver recovery after bariatric surgery. The non-invasive LiMAx breath test validly determines liver function capacity. It may avoid the inaccuracy seen with blood parameters and the risks of invasive liver biopsies which, moreover, do not necessarily reflect the liver function. Our study results show that LiMAx values correlate to the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Thus, the LiMAx test is an interesting method to diagnose and monitor NAFLD and NASH.  Study results showed that the mean liver function capacity significantly increased from preoperatively severely impaired values to normal values within 6 months after surgery and further improved over the period of the survey with a final measurement after one year. Erwin de Buijzer, CEO of Humedics GmbH, stated:  The study at the Aachen University Hospital clearly demonstrated the usefulness of our LiMAx test in obesity-related liver diseases and represents the first study to noninvasively assess the impact of weight loss on changes in the liver function. The dramatic increase of obesity and obesity-associated diseases is a major problem in the Western world. We are very pleased to provide physicians with a novel diagnostic test to better assess obesity patients and to monitor disease course and therapy success.  The LiMAx test, together with the corresponding FLIP device and the diagnostic drug offers a clinically proven significant added value for patients with liver diseases and liver surgery.","Published: September 15, 2015"

Published in Nature Neuroscience, the work showcases the new technology and its practical importance in clinical science by showing how it has given new insights into Alzheimer s disease (AD) plaques.  The usefulness of optical clearing techniques can be measured by their ability to gather accurate 3D structural information that cannot be readily achieved through traditional 2D methods,  explains lead scientist Atsushi Miyawaki.  Here, we achieved this goal using a new procedure, and collected data that may resolve several current issues regarding the pathology of Alzheimer s disease. While Superman s x-ray vision is only the stuff of comics, our method, called ScaleS, is a real and practical way to see through brain and body tissue.  In recent years, generating see-through tissue a process called optical clearing has become a goal for many researchers in life sciences because of its potential to reveal complex structural details of our bodies, organs, and cells both healthy and diseased when combined with advanced microscopy imaging techniques. Previous methods were limited because the transparency process itself can damage the structures under study. The original recipe reported by the Miyawaki team in 2011 termed Scale was an aqueous solution based on urea that suffered from this same problem. The research team spent 5 years improving the effectiveness of the original recipe to overcome this critical challenge, and the result is ScaleS, a new technique with many practical applications.  The key ingredient of our new formula is sorbitol, a common sugar alcohol,  reveals Miyawaki.  By combining sorbitol in the right proportion with urea, we could create transparent brains with minimal tissue damage, that can handle both florescent and immunohistochemical labeling techniques, and is even effective in older animals.  The new technique creates transparent brain samples that can be stored in ScaleS solution for more than a year without damage. Internal structures maintain their original shape and brains are firm enough to permit the micron-thick slicing necessary for more detailed analyses.  The real challenge with optical clearing is at the microscopic level,  said Miyawaki,  In addition to allowing tissue to be viewable by light microscopy, a practical solution must also ensure accurate tissue preservation for effective electron microscopy.  On these tests, ScaleS passed with flying colors providing an optimal combination of cleared tissue and fluorescent signals, and Miyawaki believes that the quality and preservation of cellular structures viewed by electron microscopy is unparalleled. The team has devised several variations of the Scale technique that can be used together. By combining ScaleS with AbScale a variation for immunolabeling and ChemScale a variation for fluorescent chemical compounds they generated multi-color high-resolution 3D images of amyloid beta plaques in older mice from a genetic mouse model of Alzheimer s disease developed at the RIKEN BSI by Takaomi Saido team. After showing how ScaleS treatment can preserve tissue, the researchers put the technique to practical use by visualizing in 3D the mysterious  diffuse  plaques seen in the postmortem brains of Alzheimer s disease patients that are typically undetectable using 2D imaging. Contrary to current assumptions, the diffuse plaques proved not to be isolated, but showed extensive association with microglia  mobile cells that surround and protect neurons. Another example of ScaleS s practical application came from examining the 3D positions of active microglial cells and amyloid beta plaques. While some scientists suggest that active microglial cells are located near plaques, a detailed 3D reconstruction and analysis using ScaleS clearing showed that association with active microglial cells occurs early in plaque development, but not in later stages of the disease after the plaques have accumulated.RIKEN Miyawaki A et al.

With greatly expanded low-cost genetic tests   some as simple as a maternal blood test   prospective parents will soon be able to learn far more, far earlier, than ever before about their fetuses  medical conditions and risks, and some nonmedical traits. These tests raise significant questions for doctors, patients, and health policy. What should be tested for? Are there traits that the tests should not be used to investigate? What policy changes are needed to support ethical use of these tests? With a $1.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, The Hastings Center is leading a foundational ethical analysis of next-generation prenatal genetic tests that will inform clinical guidelines and create a research agenda aimed at improving policy and practice. The new three-year project will be led by Josephine Johnston, director of research at The Hastings Center, and Erik Parens, senior research scholar. Co-investigators on the project are Hastings Center scholar Sarah McGraw  and Hastings Center presidentMildred Solomon. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, medicine, and law, and Wendy Chung, a molecular and clinical geneticist, both of Columbia University, along with Vence Bonham, a health care services and policy researcher at NIH, will join Johnston and Parens to form the project's steering committee.    The next generation of prenatal tests are set to offer prospective parents an enormous amount of information about the genetic make-up of their fetuses,  Johnston explains.  It is our job, through this project, to identify policies and practices that can inform, support and empower patients to make testing decisions that are consistent with their goals and values.  To consider how best to deploy these new prenatal tests The Hastings Center has recruited an international working group of experts and representatives. They include leaders of major clinical societies, clinical researchers and social scientists investigating prenatal testing, philosophers, and patient representatives. Until recently, prenatal genetic tests could look for a relatively small number of disorders, including Down syndrome. Combined with older technologies for securing samples of fetal DNA, advances in sequencing technology have made it possible and increasingly affordable to analyze a fetus s entire genome. At the same time, new noninvasive prenatal tests involving a maternal blood test make it possible to gather information about the fetus s genome ever earlier in pregnancy.  Although currently recommended only for women over 35, the new noninvasive tests could one day be offered to all of the 4 million women who give birth in the United States each year. These technologies point to a future in which prospective parents are offered a large amount of information about their fetuses, including the presence of gene variants associated with disease susceptibility, adult-onset conditions, and nondisease traits.  Next-generation prenatal tests are different in ways that are psychologically, socially, and morally salient,  says Dr. Solomon.  Because the clinical and policy landscape into which these tests are entering is rapidly evolving, new research is needed to ensure their wise and effective use.  To that end, The Hastings Center s project will address these questions:   What should be tested for, and how ought testing be conducted?The research will identify principles and values that can guide the use of next-generation prenatal testing. This analysis will examine whether there are any traits that prenatal testing should not be used to investigate as well as the principles and values that are at stake when prenatal testing is offered. It will also identify information and support that should be available to patients.   Which policies should be altered to support ethical use of next-generation prenatal testing, and in what ways should these policies be changed?Prenatal testing does not take place in a vacuum clinicians and patients make decisions against the backdrop of a variety of policies, practices and societal norms that influence their decision-making. The project will identify changes to these policies and norms needed to support ethical use of next-generation prenatal testing.   What further empirical research is needed to examine how the principles, values, and recommended policy and practice changes play out in practice?The project will create a research agenda for empirical researchers to explore over time, not only to discern the impact of its analysis and recommendations, but to formulate new directions for research aimed at improving policy and practice.","Published: September 14, 2015"

Now, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania have shown that when the enzyme key to cutting and pasting segments of DNA hits so-called  off-target  spots on a chromosome, the development of immune cells can lead to cancer in animal models. Knowing the exact nature of these editing errors will be helpful in designing therapeutic enzymes based on these molecular scissors.  V(D)J recombinase, the editing enzyme that generates specific receptors on the surface of immune cells that match foreign invaders, collectively called antigens, can miss its target from time to time. The lab of senior author David Roth, MD, PhD, chair of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, has been working out the cancer-related intricacies of V(D)J recombinase for the last two decades.  Knowledge of the exact nature of these off-target errors could lead to the development of safer versions of tools for genetic engineering,  Roth said.V(D)J recombinase works only during the early stages of immune cell maturation. From this stage in the bone marrow, the diverse array of antibodies and cell-surface receptors found on immune B cells and T cells, respectively, are made to counteract all the foreign invaders the human body encounters. Breaks in DNA strands associated with V(D)J cutting are normally repaired with high fidelity by finely tuned molecular machinery. Previous studies from the Roth lab showed that V(D)J recombinase (consisting of the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins) normally sends a break in DNA down the correct repair path by preventing access to other, inappropriate repair mechanisms. This shepherding process can be disabled if the  C  terminus of the RAG2 protein subunit is removed. This causes genomic instability in developing immune cells and, in the absence of a working tumor suppressor protein such as p53, an aggressive form of lymphoma develops in mice. Genome wide analysis of lymphomas of the thymus in these mice with the truncated Rag2 protein revealed a surprise: numerous off-target DNA rearrangements, causing deletions, noted Roth. Previous work had suggested that a different mistake -- chromosome translocations, or swaps between two chromosomes -- might underlie  the development of lymphoma in these mice, but whole genome sequencing revealed deletions as the main drivers of these cancers. These rearrangements affected several known and suspected oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, including Notch1, Pten, Ikzf1, Jak1, Phlda1, Trat1, and Agpat9. Genomewide analysis of chromatin marks also suggested that normal interactions between the C-terminus of the Rag2 protein subunit and a specific chromatin modification helps maintain the fidelity of DNA target recognition by the enzyme. Gene expression is regulated by epigenetic chemical modifications (including methylation and acetylation) on chromatin   histone proteins tightly associated with DNA. Certain chemical groups on histones allow DNA to open up, and others to tighten the chromatin, and so creating availability to be read and expressed as proteins.  What s more, say the researchers, the cancer-causing effects of off-target deletions mistakenly created by the V(D)J enzyme need to be considered in designing site-specific enzymes for genome modification such as zinc-finger nucleases, TALENS, or CRISPRs.","Published: September 14, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/why-ms-symptoms-may-improve-as-days-get-shorter-214019,Why MS Symptoms May Improve As Days Get Shorter New research from Brigham and Women s Hospital offers an answer to  seasonal paradox    ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For patients and clinicians alike, it s long been a mystery: Why do symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) seem to get better in the winter and worse in the summer? A group led by Francisco Quintana at the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women s Hospital (BWH) and collaborators have found an explanation that could lead to a deeper understanding of the disease and more targeted treatment options for patients. By looking first broadly at possible environmental factors and then deeply at preclinical models of MS, the research team found that melatonin   a hormone involved in regulating a person s sleep-wake cycle   may influence MS disease activity.  The researchers caution that this work does not mean that MS patients should start taking supplements of melatonin, an imperfect drug. Instead, this new approach, which takes its lead from environmental observations, can be seen as a first step toward better and more targeted therapies.  We know that for multiple sclerosis and most autoimmune diseases, both genetic and environmental factors play an important role, but in the last decade or so, most research has focused only on the genetic side of the equation,  said co-corresponding author Quintana, associate professor in the Ann Romney Center and at Harvard Medical School.  But we wanted to see what environmental factors would reveal to us about this disease. We knew that MS disease activity changed with the seasons. What we ve uncovered offers an explanation for why that is the case.  Working closely with colleagues at the Center for Research on Neuroimmunological Diseases (CIEN) at the Raul Carrea Institute for Neurological Research (FLENI) in Argentina, Quintana and his colleagues began by studying patients. The team found that during the fall and winter, the group of 139 relapsing remitting MS patients they studied experienced a significant improvement in symptoms   a phenomenon that s been observed in previous studies. The team then explored a variety of environmental factors that have been proposed as possibly linked to MS symptoms, including vitamin D levels, UV incidence, and upper respiratory tract infections. But the factor that was consistently associated with severity of MS symptoms was melatonin. Melatonin levels are known to correlate with the durations of days   during the longer days of the spring and summer, levels are lower; during the shorter days of the fall and winter, levels are higher. Based on this observation, the team tested this lead in the lab, studying the role that melatonin may play on a cellular level. Using both a mouse model and human cells, they investigated the effects of melatonin on certain types of cells known to play a role in the immune response that leads to MS symptoms. The team found that melatonin affected the roles of two kinds of cells that are important in MS disease progression: pathogenic T cells, which directly attack and destroy tissue, and regulatory T cells, which are supposed to keep pathogenic T cells in check.  We found that melatonin has a protective effect,  said Quintana.  It dampens the immune response and helps keep the bad guys   or pathogenic T cells   at bay.  Although melatonin is available over the counter, it has significant drawbacks, including causing unwanted drowsiness. The team s goal is to tease apart the molecular mechanisms that underlie melatonin s role in order to develop targeted, non-toxic drugs that are safe and effective with minimal side effects.  In the future, melatonin or its derivatives may be used in MS patients after appropriate clinical trials are conducted and dosage is established,  said Quintana.  However, extreme caution should be exercised: Our data do not show that melatonin or its analogs are effective in treating MS.  The team is currently working to establish a pilot clinical trial to study the effects of targeting melatonin signaling in MS patients and identify additional mechanisms of action.","Published: September 14, 2015"

This suggests that it may be possible to modulate the activity of these neurons to prevent or delay this disabling side effect.  Parkinson s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, results from the death of cells in various parts of the brain, especially in a region called the substantia nigra. It is in the substantia nigra that a neurotransmitter called dopamine is formed, and when dopamine is lacking neurons fire abnormally, impairing one s ability to control movement.  While Parkinson s is not curable, it is treatable with L-DOPA, which is converted into dopamine in the brain,  said study leader David L. Sulzer, PhD, a professor of neurobiology in the Departments of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Pharmacology at CUMC and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.  However, while taking L-DOPA helps patients move normally, in many individuals it eventually triggers uncontrolled excessive movements.  Parkinson s is estimated to affect about one million people in the U.S. and up to 10 million worldwide. Most studies into the cause of dyskinesia in Parkinson s have focused on the dopamine receptors that remain in the brain, which over time become over-reactive to L-DOPA therapy. However, the CUMC team decided to look at how neurons of the basal ganglia regulates movement in the absence of dopamine.  Dopamine neurons modulate the basal ganglia,  explained lead author Anders Borgkvist, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Sulzer s laboratory.  And because that circuit is still running in patients with Parkinson s, it s long been suspected that other parts of the circuit behave abnormally in this disease.  However, scientists lacked a way to stimulate selective parts of the basal ganglia to evaluate what was happening when dopamine is no longer available. The CUMC team employed a novel form of optogenetics, a technique that uses light to control neurons that have been genetically sensitized to light, and found that after long-term dopamine loss, striatonigral neurons lose their ability to respond to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). This effect was not found with short-term dopamine loss.  When striatonigral neurons are working normally, they act as a brake on the basal ganglia, in effect shutting down unwanted movement,  said Dr. Sulzer.  But when there is dopamine loss, as in Parkinson s, striatonigral neurons try to compensate, and eventually lose their responsiveness to GABA. Our hypothesis is that when L-DOPA is added into the system, you lose the ability to filter, or turn off, unwanted movement.   Our findings suggest that GABA and GABA receptors are still present in the striatonigral neurons,  said Dr. Borgkvist.  So then the question becomes, why they aren t functional? I think that we, or another lab, will eventually find the answer. In any case, the implication is that this defect is correctable, and that would mean that we could prevent or at least delay dyskinesia, so that patients could continue to use L-DOPA.   Patients do not develop dyskinesias in the early stages of Parkinson s, but only after several years of the disease,  said Stanley Fahn, MD, the H. Houston Merritt Professor of Neurology and emeritus director of the Parkinson s Disease Foundation Research Center at CUMC.  A major reason why these patients want to delay the initiation of L-DOPA therapy is to avoid these dyskinesias for as long as possible. These new findings open up possible ways to treat or prevent the dyskinesias. If such treatments were found, patients would probably seek to be treated early and improve their quality of life sooner.  Dr. Sulzer believes it is likely that scientists will identify other mechanisms, in addition to striatonigral neurons, that contribute to Parkinson s-related dyskinesia.","Published: September 14, 2015"

New research led by UCLA life scientists may produce a new way to answer that question   and an approach that could help delay declines in health. The researchers discovered changes within intestinal microbes that precede and predict the death of fruit flies.   Age-onset decline is very tightly linked to changes within the community of gut microbes,  said David Walker, a UCLA professor of integrative biology and physiology, and senior author of the research.  With age, the number of bacterial cells increase substantially and the composition of bacterial groups changes.  The study used fruit flies in part because although their typical life span is just eight weeks, some live to the age equivalent of humans  80s and 90s, while others age and die much younger. In addition, scientists have identified all of the fruit fly s genes and know how to switch individual ones on and off. In a previous study, the UCLA researchers discovered that five or six days before flies died, their intestinal tracts became more permeable and started leaking. In the latest research, which analyzed more than 10,000 female flies, the scientists found that they were able to detect bacterial changes in the intestine before the leaking began. As part of the study, some fruit flies were given antibiotics that significantly reduce bacterial levels in the intestine; the study found that the antibiotics prevented the age-related increase in bacteria levels and improved intestinal function during aging. The biologists also showed that reducing bacterial levels in old flies can significantly prolong their life span.  When we prevented the changes in the intestinal microbiota that were linked to the flies  imminent death by feeding them antibiotics, we dramatically extended their lives and improved their health,  Walker said. (Microbiota are the bacteria and other microorganisms that are abundant in humans, other mammals, fruit flies and many other animals.) Flies with leaky intestines that were given antibiotics lived an average of 20 days after the leaking began   a substantial part of the animal s life span. On average, flies with leaky intestines that did not receive antibiotics died within a week. The intestine acts as a barrier to protect our organs and tissue from environmental damage.  The health of the intestine   in particular the maintenance of the barrier protecting the rest of the body from the contents of the gut   is very important and might break down with aging,  said Rebecca Clark, the study s lead author. Clark was a UCLA postdoctoral scholar when the research was conducted and is now a lecturer at England s Durham University. The biologists collaborated with William Ja, an assistant professor at Florida s Scripps Research Institute, and Ryuichi Yamada, a postdoctoral research associate in Ja s laboratory, to produce an additional group of flies that were completely germ-free, with no intestinal microbes. Those flies showed a very dramatic delay in intestinal damage, and they lived for about 80 days, approximately one-and-a-half times as long as the animal s typical life span. Scientists have recently begun to connect a wide variety of diseases, including diabetes and Parkinson s, among many others, to changes in the microbiota, but they do not yet know exactly what healthy microbiota look like.  One of the big questions in the biology of aging relates to the large variation in how we age and how long we live,  said Walker, who added that scientific interest in intestinal microbes has exploded in the last five years. When a fruit fly s intestine begins to leak, its immune response increases substantially and chronically throughout its body. Chronic immune activation is linked with age-related diseases in people as well, Walker said. Walker said that the study could lead to realistic ways for scientists to intervene in the aging process and delay the onset of Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease, cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other diseases of aging   although such progress could take many years, he said.","Published: September 14, 2015"

Such knowledge could pave the way for new drugs for a myriad of diseases, including cancer. The human body has a nifty way of turning its proteins on and off to alter their function and activity in cells: phosphorylation, the reversible attachment of phosphate groups to proteins. These  decorations  on proteins provide an enormous variety of function and are essential to all forms of life. Little is known, however, about how this dynamic process works in humans.  Using a special strain of E. coli bacteria, the researchers have built a cell-free protein synthesis platform technology that can manufacture large quantities of these human phosphoproteins for scientific study. This will enable scientists to learn more about the function and structure of phosphoproteins and identify which ones are involved in disease.  This innovation will help advance the understanding of human biochemistry and physiology,  said Michael C. Jewett, a biochemical engineer who led the Northwestern team. Trouble in the phosphorylation process can be a hallmark of disease, such as cancer, inflammation and Alzheimer s disease. The human proteome (the entire set of expressed proteins) is estimated to be phosphorylated at more than 100,000 unique sites, making study of phosphorylated proteins and their role in disease a daunting task.  Our technology begins to make this a tractable problem,  Jewett said.  We now can make these special proteins at unprecedented yields, with a freedom of design that is not possible in living organisms. The consequence of this innovative strategy is enormous.  Jewett, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern s McCormick School of Engineering, and his team worked with Yale colleagues led by Jesse Rinehart. Jewett and Rinehart are co-corresponding authors of the study. As a synthetic biologist, Jewett uses cell-free systems to create new therapies, chemicals and novel materials to impact public health and the environment.  This work addresses the broader question of how can we repurpose the protein synthesis machinery of the cell for synthetic biology,  Jewett said.  Here we are finding new ways to leverage this machinery to understand fundamental biological questions, specifically protein phosphorylation.  Jewett and his colleagues combined state-of-the-art genome engineering tools and engineered biological  parts  into a  plug-and-play  protein expression platform that is cell-free. Cell-free systems activate complex biological systems without using living intact cells. Crude cell lysates, or extracts, are employed instead. Specifically, the researchers prepared cell lysates of genomically recoded bacteria that incorporate amino acids not found in nature. This allowed them to harness the cell s engineered machinery and turn it into a factory, capable of on-demand biomanufacturing new classes of proteins.  This manufacturing technology will enable scientists to decrypt the phosphorylation  code  that exists in the human proteome,  said Javin P. Oza, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in Jewett s lab. To demonstrate their cell-free platform technology, the researchers produced a human kinase that is involved in tumor cell proliferation and showed that it was functional and active. Kinase is an enzyme (a protein acting as a catalyst) that transfers a phosphate group onto a protein. Through this process, kinases activate the function of proteins within the cell. Kinases are implicated in many diseases and, therefore, of particular interest.  The ability to produce kinases for study should be useful in learning how these proteins function and in developing new types of drugs,  Jewett said.","Published: September 14, 2015"

Now researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have begun to pinpoint how those structural differences could arise in two species with nearly identical genetic backgrounds. The key lies in how genes involved in facial development and human facial diversity are regulated   how much, when and where the genes are expressed  rather than dissimilarities among the genes themselves. In particular, the researchers found that chimps and humans express different levels of proteins known to control facial development, including some involved in jaw and nose length and skin pigmentation.  We are trying to understand the regulatory changes in our DNA that occurred during recent evolution and make us different from the great apes,  said Joanna Wysocka, PhD, associate professor of developmental biology and of chemical and systems biology.  In particular, we are interested in craniofacial structures, which have undergone a number of adaptations in head shape, eye placement and facial structure that allow us to house larger brains, walk upright and even use our larynx for complex speech.  The researchers coined the term  cellular anthropology  to explain how some steps of early primate development can be mimicked in a dish, and thus used to study gene-expression changes that can shed light on our recent evolutionary past. A study describing the research was published by graduate student Sara Prescott who is the lead author. Wysocka and senior research scientist Tomasz Swigut, PhD, share senior authorship of the study. The role of enhancer regions For their comparison, the researchers focused on areas of DNA known as enhancer regions in human and chimpanzee genomes. These regions contain chemical tags and proteins bound to the DNA that control when, where and how nearby genes are expressed. Prescott and her colleagues wondered whether differences in the way proteins bind to these enhancer regions during development could explain morphological differences between humans and chimpanzees.  We wanted to look at how the activity of these enhancer regions may have changed during recent evolution,  said Wysocka.  Many recent studies have shown that changes in the DNA sequences of enhancers may mediate morphological differences among species.  To conduct the study, however, Prescott and her colleagues had to obtain a specialized type of cell present only in very early primate development. The cells, called cranial neural crest cells, originate in humans within about five to six weeks after conception. Although they first appear along what eventually becomes the spinal cord, the neural crest cells then migrate over time to affect facial morphology and differentiate into bone, cartilage and connective tissue of the head, and face.  These cells are unique,  said Prescott.  If we want to understand what makes human and chimp faces different, we have to look to the source   to the cell types responsible for making these early patterning decisions. If we were to look later in development or in adult tissues, we would see differences between the species but they will tell us little about how those differences were created during embryogenesis. But accessing early cell types like neural crest cells can be quite difficult, especially when studying primates.  To obtain this elusive cell type, the researchers used induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, made from chimpanzees. IPS cells, which are made from easy-to-obtain skin or blood samples, can be coaxed to become other tissues. Although iPS cells from humans have been well-studied, they ve only recently been made from chimpanzees in the laboratory of Fred Gage, PhD, a professor of genetics at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a co-author of the study. Prescott and her colleagues coaxed human and chimpanzee iPS cells to become cranial neural crest cells by growing them in the laboratory under a specific set of conditions. They then examined enhancer regions throughout the genome, looking for those that were not just active and therefore likely to be involved in craniofacial development, but also those whose patterns or degrees of activity seemed to vary between human and chimpanzee cells.  Of course, humans and chimps are very closely related,  said Wysocka.  Most of the regulatory elements are the same between the two species. But we did find some differences. In particular, we found about 1,000 enhancer regions that are what we termed species-biased, meaning they are more active in one species or the other. Interestingly, many of the genes with species-biased enhancers and expression have been previously shown to be important in craniofacial development or associated with normal intrahuman facial variation.  Snout length, shape and pigmentation In particular, the researchers found that two genes, PAX3 and PAX7, known to affect snout length and shape in laboratory mice, as well as skin pigmentation, were expressed at higher levels in chimpanzees than in humans. Humans with less than the normal amount of PAX3 have a condition called Waardenburg syndrome, which includes craniofacial, auditory and pigmentation defects. Genomewide association studies in humans have identified PAX3 as a region involved in normal facial variation. In contrast, another gene known to be involved in determining the shape of the beaks of finches and the jaw of a fish called a cichlid was expressed at higher levels in humans than in chimpanzees. In mice, overexpression of this gene, BMP4, in cranial neural crest cells causes a marked change in face shape, including a rounding of the skull and eyes that are more near the front of the face.  We are now following up on some of these more interesting species-biased enhancers to better understand how they impact morphological differences,  said Wysocka.  It s becoming clear that these cellular pathways can be used in many ways to affect facial shape. ","Published: September 14, 2015"

Scientists say this example of simple neural circuitry could be ""fundamental"" for other types of information processing in much larger brains. Scientists have identified an ingeniously elegant brain circuit consisting of just five nerve cells that allows female crickets to automatically identify the chirps of males from the same species through the rhythmic pulses hidden within the mating call. The circuit uses a time delay mechanism to match the gaps between pulses in a species-specific chirp -- gaps of just few milliseconds. The circuit delays a pulse by the exact between-pulse gap, so that, if it coincides with the next pulse coming in, the same species signal is confirmed. It's one of the first times a brain circuit consisting of individual neurons that identifies an acoustic rhythm has been characterized. The results are reported in the journal Science Advances. Using tiny electrodes, scientists from Cambridge University's Department of Zoology explored the brain of female crickets for individual auditory neurons responding to digitally-manipulated cricket chirps (even a relatively simple organism such as a cricket still has a brain containing up to a million neurons). Once located, the nerve cells were stained with fluorescent dye. By monitoring how each neuron responded to the sound pulses of the cricket chirps, scientists were able to work out the sequence the neurons fired in, enabling them to unpick the time delay logic of the circuit. Sound processing starts in hearing organs, but the temporal, rhythmic features of sound signals -- vital to all acoustic communication from birdsong to spoken language -- are processed in the central auditory system of the brain. Scientists say that the simple, time-coded neural network discovered in the brain of crickets may be an example of fundamental neural circuitry that identifies sound rhythms and patterns, and could be the basis for ""complex and elaborate neuronal systems"" in vertebrates. ""Compared to our complex language, crickets only have a few songs which they have to recognize and process, so, by looking at their much simpler brain, we aim to understand how neurons process sound signals,"" said senior author Dr Berthold Hedwig. Like in Morse code, contained within each cricket chirp are several pulses, interspersed by gaps of a few milliseconds. It's the varying length of the gaps between pulses that is each species' unique rhythm. It is this 'Morse code' that gets read by the five-neuron circuit in the female brain. Crickets' ears are located on their front legs. On hearing a sound like a chirp, nerve cells respond and carry the information to the thoracic segment, and on to the brain. Once there, the auditory circuit splits and sends the information into two branches: One branch (consisting of two neurons) acts as a delay line, holding up the processing of the signal by the same amount of time as the interval between pulses -- a mechanism specific to a cricket species' chirp. The other branch sends the signal straight through to a 'coincidence detector' neuron. When a second pulse comes in, it too is split, and part of the signal goes straight through to the coincidence detector. If the second pulse and the delayed signal from the first pulse 'coincide' within the detector neuron, then the circuit has a match for the pulse time-code within the chirp of their species, and a final output neuron fires up, when the female listens to the correct sound pattern. ""Once the circuit has a second pulse, it can define the rhythm. The first pulse is initial excitation; the second pulse is then superimposed with the delayed part of the first. The output neuron only produces a strong response if the pulses collide at the coincidence detector, meaning the timing is locked in, and the mating call is a species match,"" said Hedwig. ""With hindsight, I would say it's impossible to make the circuitry any simpler -- it's the minimum number of elements that are required to do the processing. That's the beauty of nature, it comes up with the most simple and elegant ways of dealing with and processing information,"" he said. To find the most effective sound pattern, the scientists digitally manipulated the natural pulse patterns and played the various patterns to female crickets mounted atop a trackball inside an acoustic chamber containing precisely located speakers. If a particular rhythm of pulses triggered the female to set off in the direction of that speaker, the trackball recorded reaction times and direction. Once they had honed the pulse patterns, the team played them to female crickets in modified mini-chambers with opened-up heads and brains exposed for the experiments. Microelectrodes allowed them to record the key auditory neurons (""it takes a couple of hours to find the right neuron in a cricket brain""), tag and dye them, and piece together the neural circuitry that reads rhythmic pulses occurring at intervals of few milliseconds in male cricket chirps. Added Hedwig: ""Through this series of experiments we have identified a delay mechanism within a neuronal circuit for auditory processing -- something that was first hypothesised over 25 years ago. This time delay circuitry could be quite fundamental as an example for other types of neuronal processing in other, perhaps much larger, brains as well.""

These initial results were reported as part of a landmark clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health called the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). The intervention in this trial, which carefully adjusts the amount or type of blood pressure medication to achieve a target systolic pressure of 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), reduced rates of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and heart failure, as well as stroke, by almost a third and the risk of death by almost a quarter, as compared to the target systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  The systolic blood pressure intervention trial is the first ever to demonstrate that lowering systolic blood pressure to 120 as compared to 140 in people with hypertension over the age of 50 was associated with a 30 percent lower event rate, potentially saving lives and reducing cardiovascular events,  said Dr. Robert Toto, Associate Dean for Clinical and Translational Research, Professor of Internal Medicine and Clinical Sciences, and principal investigator for the trial at UT Southwestern Medical Center.  This is a stunning finding that led the data and safety monitoring board to recommend termination of the usual blood pressure control arm of 140 mm Hg. Because high blood pressure afflicts more than 50 million Americans, the results of this landmark study will have a profound effect on healthcare for years to come,  said Dr. Toto, who holds the Mary M. Conroy Professorship in Kidney Disease, and is Medical Director of the Multi-Specialty Clinic at UT Southwestern Medical Center. The study provides potentially lifesaving information that will be useful to health care providers as they consider the best treatment options for some of their patients, particularly those over the age of 50, said Dr. Gary H. Gibbons, Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the primary sponsor of SPRINT.  We are delighted to have achieved this important milestone in the study in advance of the expected closure date for the SPRINT trial and look forward to quickly communicating the results to help inform patient care and the future development of evidence-based clinical guidelines,  said Dr. Gibbons. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a leading risk factor for heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other health problems. An estimated 1 in 3 people in the United States has high blood pressure. The SPRINT study evaluates the benefits of maintaining a new target for systolic blood pressure, the top number in a blood pressure reading, among a group of patients 50 years and older at increased risk for heart disease or who have kidney disease. A systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg, maintained by this more intensive blood pressure intervention, could ultimately help save lives among adults age 50 and older who have a combination of high blood pressure and at least one additional risk factor for heart disease, the investigators say. The SPRINT study, which began in the fall of 2009, includes more than 9,300 Participants age 50 and older, recruited from about 100 medical centers and clinical practices throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. It is the largest study of its kind to date to examine how maintaining systolic blood pressure at a lower than currently recommended level will impact cardiovascular and kidney diseases. NIH stopped the blood pressure intervention earlier than originally planned in order to quickly disseminate the significant preliminary results. The study population was diverse and included women, racial/ethnic minorities, and the elderly. The investigators point out that the SPRINT study did not include patients with diabetes, prior stroke, or polycystic kidney disease, as other research included those populations. When SPRINT was designed, the well-established clinical guidelines recommended a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg for healthy adults and 130 mm Hg for adults with kidney disease or diabetes. Investigators designed SPRINT to determine the potential benefits of achieving systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg for hypertensive adults 50 years and older who are at risk for developing heart disease or kidney disease. Between 2010 and 2013, the SPRINT investigators randomly divided the study participants into two groups that differed according to targeted levels of blood pressure control. The standard group received blood pressure medications to achieve a target of less than 140 mm Hg. They received an average of two different blood pressure medications. The intensive treatment group received medications to achieve a target of less than 120 mm Hg and received an average of three medications.  Our results provide important evidence that treating blood pressure to a lower goal in older or high-risk patients can be beneficial and yield better health results overall,  said Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief, Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI.  But patients should talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care.  The study is also examining kidney disease, cognitive function, and dementia among the patients; however, those results are still under analysis and are not yet available as additional information will be collected over the next year. The primary results of the trial will be published within the next few months. In addition to primary sponsorship by the NHLBI, SPRINT is co-sponsored by the NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute on Aging.","Published: September 12, 2015"

The SPRINT study, which began in the fall of 2009, includes more than 9,300 participants age 50 and older, recruited from about 100 medical centers and clinical practices throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. It is the largest study of its kind to date to examine how maintaining systolic blood pressure at a lower than currently recommended level will impact cardiovascular and kidney diseases. NIH stopped the blood pressure intervention earlier than originally planned in order to quickly disseminate the significant preliminary results. The study population was diverse and included women, racial/ethnic minorities, and the elderly. The investigators point out that the SPRINT study did not include patients with diabetes, prior stroke, or polycystic kidney disease, as other research included those populations. When SPRINT was designed, the well-established clinical guidelines recommended a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg for healthy adults and 130 mm Hg for adults with kidney disease or diabetes. Investigators designed SPRINT to determine the potential benefits of achieving systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg for hypertensive adults 50 years and older who are at risk for developing heart disease or kidney disease. Between 2010 and 2013, the SPRINT investigators randomly divided the study participants into two groups that differed according to targeted levels of blood pressure control. The standard group received blood pressure medications to achieve a target of less than 140 mm Hg. They received an average of two different blood pressure medications. The intensive treatment group received medications to achieve a target of less than 120 mm Hg and received an average of three medications.  Our results provide important evidence that treating blood pressure to a lower goal in older or high-risk patients can be beneficial and yield better health results overall,  said Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief, Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI.  But patients should talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care.  The study is also examining kidney disease, cognitive function, and dementia among the patients; however, those results are still under analysis and are not yet available as additional information will be collected over the next year. The primary results of the trial will be published within the next few months. In addition to primary sponsorship by the NHLBI, SPRINT is co-sponsored by the NIH s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute on Aging.","Published: September 12, 2015"

Their findings have been published in the well-known international haematological journal, Blood. Patients with multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) have variable survival, and require reliable prognostic and predictive scoring systems. The SKY92-signature,discovered by the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands, consists of 92 genes that are directly or indirectly related to the disease, the combined expression level of these genes can be measured using the MMprofiler. Clinicians can use the result of the MMprofiler test to predict for their patients how multiple myeloma is likely to progress and to decide on the most optimal treatment for the individual patient. According to the article in Blood, the SKY92-signature in combination with the ISS (international staging system) classification, outperforms current markers and offers a robust clinically relevant 4-group model:  Ranking all novel as well as existing risk classifications showed that the EMC92(SKY92)-ISS combination is the strongest predictor for overall survival, resulting in a four group risk classification. The median survival was 24 months for the highest risk group, 47 and 61 months for the intermediate risk groups and the median was not reached after 96 months for the lowest risk group , the researchers from the Erasmus Medical Center noted. The SKY92-signature is used by SkylineDx in its leading diagnostic test, the MMprofiler. On July 3rd 2015 SkylineDx launched its MMprofiler as a Diagnostic Service in the Netherlands and the rest of Europe, making it possible for physicians to send their samples to the SkylineDx central laboratory in Rotterdam for analysis with the MMprofiler. SkylineDx expects to launch the MMprofiler as a CE IVD kit on the European market later this year. This will enable other molecular diagnostics laboratories throughout Europe to implement the MMprofiler for analysis at their own facility.","Published: September 12, 2015"

Special K  could offer new hope for treatment-resistant depression Over the past several decades, the pharmaceutical industry has been abandoning the research and development of treatments for psychiatric disorders, despite the ever-growing need for novel, more efficacious, and better targeted therapeutics. Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder and ranked among the top causes of disability and disease burden in the world1. While common treatments for depression are effective for most patients, there is subset who fail to respond to at least two trials of antidepressant treatments (~10-30%). Additionally, recent estimates indicate up to ~30% of those do not respond to any treatment at all2,3. For these patients with treatment-resistant depression, novel therapeutics are a necessity. With the advent of newer technologies and findings, psychiatry is vehemently trying to discover new treatments and better understand their therapeutic actions.   Men and women with autism have  extreme male  scores on the  Eyes test  of mindreading New results published by researchers at the Autism Research Centre show both men and women with autism show an extreme of the typical male pattern on the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test.   Brain damage during stroke may point to source of addiction A pair of studies suggests that a region of the brain, the insular cortex, may hold the key to treating addiction. Scientists have come to this conclusion after finding that smokers who suffered a stroke in the insular cortex were far more likely to quit smoking and experience fewer and less severe withdrawal symptoms than those with strokes in other parts of the brain.   IV administration of endothelin B receptor drug reduces memory loss, oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease An estimated 5.3 million people in the U.S. suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) -- the most common form of dementia -- and roughly 473,000 people will develop the disease in 2015. There are currently five medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat AD. However, these drugs only help mask the symptoms and do not stop the disease from progressing or treat the underlying disease. In a new study presented at the 14th International Conference on Endothelin: Physiology, Pathophysiology and Therapeutics that took place Sept 2-5 in Savannah, Georgia, USA, researchers used IRL-1620, a chemical that binds to endothelin B receptors, to treat AD in rats.

Using a new method for manipulating neurons in a mouse model of Parkinson's, a Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) research team found that dyskinesia arises when striatonigral neurons become less responsive to GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. This suggests that it may be possible to modulate the activity of these neurons to prevent or delay this disabling side effect. The paper was published recently in the online edition of Neuron. Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, results from the death of cells in various parts of the brain, especially in a region called the substantia nigra. It is in the substantia nigra that dopamine is formed, and when dopamine is lacking neurons fire abnormally, impairing one's ability to control movement. ""While Parkinson's is not curable, it is treatable with L-DOPA, which is converted into dopamine in the brain,"" said study leader David L. Sulzer, PhD, a professor of neurobiology in the Departments of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Pharmacology at CUMC and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ""However, while taking L-DOPA helps patients move normally, in many individuals it eventually triggers uncontrolled excessive movements."" Parkinson's is estimated to affect about one million people in the U.S. and up to 10 million worldwide. Most studies into the cause of dyskinesia in Parkinson's have focused on the dopamine receptors that remain in the brain, which over time become over-reactive to L-DOPA therapy. However, the CUMC team decided to look at how neurons of the basal ganglia regulates movement in the absence of dopamine. ""Dopamine neurons modulate the basal ganglia,"" explained lead author Anders Borgkvist, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Sulzer's laboratory. ""And because that circuit is still running in patients with Parkinson's, it's long been suspected that other parts of the circuit behave abnormally in this disease."" However, scientists lacked a way to stimulate selective parts of the basal ganglia to evaluate what was happening when dopamine is no longer available. The CUMC team employed a novel form of optogenetics and found that after long-term dopamine loss, striatonigral neurons lose their ability to respond to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). This effect was not found with short-term dopamine loss. ""When striatonigral neurons are working normally, they act as a brake on the basal ganglia, in effect shutting down unwanted movement,"" said Dr. Sulzer. ""But when there is dopamine loss, as in Parkinson's, striatonigral neurons try to compensate, and eventually lose their responsiveness to GABA. Our hypothesis is that when L-DOPA is added into the system, you lose the ability to filter, or turn off, unwanted movement."" ""Our findings suggest that GABA and GABA receptors are still present in the striatonigral neurons,"" said Dr. Borgkvist. ""So then the question becomes, why they aren't functional? I think that we, or another lab, will eventually find the answer. In any case, the implication is that this defect is correctable, and that would mean that we could prevent or at least delay dyskinesia, so that patients could continue to use L-DOPA."" ""Patients do not develop dyskinesias in the early stages of Parkinson's, but only after several years of the disease,"" said Stanley Fahn, MD, the H. Houston Merritt Professor of Neurology and emeritus director of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation Research Center at CUMC. ""A major reason why these patients want to delay the initiation of L-DOPA therapy is to avoid these dyskinesias for as long as possible. These new findings open up possible ways to treat or prevent the dyskinesias. If such treatments were found, patients would probably seek to be treated early and improve their quality of life sooner."" Dr. Sulzer believes it is likely that scientists will identify other mechanisms, in addition to striatonigral neurons, that contribute to Parkinson's-related dyskinesia.

New research led by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) life scientists may produce a new way to answer that question   and an approach that could help delay declines in health. Specifically, the study suggests that analyzing intestinal bacteria could be a promising way to predict health outcomes as we age. The researchers discovered changes within intestinal microbes that precede and predict the death of fruit flies. The findings were published in the open-source journal Cell Reports.  Age-onset decline is very tightly linked to changes within the community of gut microbes,  said David Walker, a UCLA professor of integrative biology and physiology, and senior author of the research.  With age, the number of bacterial cells increase substantially and the composition of bacterial groups changes.  The study used fruit flies in part because although their typical life span is just eight weeks, some live to the age equivalent of humans  80s and 90s, while others age and die much younger. In addition, scientists have identified all of the fruit fly s genes and know how to switch individual ones on and off. In a previous study, the UCLA researchers discovered that five or six days before flies died, their intestinal tracts became more permeable and started leaking. In the latest research, which analyzed more than 10,000 female flies, the scientists found that they were able to detect bacterial changes in the intestine before the leaking began. As part of the study, some fruit flies were given antibiotics that significantly reduce bacterial levels in the intestine; the study found that the antibiotics prevented the age-related increase in bacteria levels and improved intestinal function during aging. The biologists also showed that reducing bacterial levels in old flies can significantly prolong their life span.  When we prevented the changes in the intestinal microbiota that were linked to the flies  imminent death by feeding them antibiotics, we dramatically extended their lives and improved their health,  Walker said. Flies with leaky intestines that were given antibiotics lived an average of 20 days after the leaking began   a substantial part of the animal s life span. On average, flies with leaky intestines that did not receive antibiotics died within a week. The intestine acts as a barrier to protect our organs and tissue from environmental damage.  The health of the intestine   in particular the maintenance of the barrier protecting the rest of the body from the contents of the gut   is very important and might break down with aging,  said Rebecca Clark, the study s lead author. Clark was a UCLA postdoctoral scholar when the research was conducted and is now a lecturer at England s Durham University. The biologists collaborated with William Ja, an assistant professor at Florida s Scripps Research Institute, and Ryuichi Yamada, a postdoctoral research associate in Ja s laboratory, to produce an additional group of flies that were completely germ-free, with no intestinal microbes. Those flies showed a very dramatic delay in intestinal damage, and they lived for about 80 days, approximately one-and-a-half times as long as the animal s typical life span. Scientists have recently begun to connect a wide variety of diseases, including diabetes and Parkinson s, among many others, to changes in the microbiota, but they do not yet know exactly what healthy microbiota look like.  One of the big questions in the biology of aging relates to the large variation in how we age and how long we live,  said Walker, who added that scientific interest in intestinal microbes has exploded in the last five years. When a fruit fly s intestine begins to leak, its immune response increases substantially and chronically throughout its body. Chronic immune activation is linked with age-related diseases in people as well, Walker said. Walker said that the study could lead to realistic ways for scientists to intervene in the aging process and delay the onset of Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease, cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other diseases of aging   although such progress could take many years, he said.

Recently, Indiana University computational neuroscientist Franco Pestilli and an international research team published an article in the journal Cerebral Cortex that suggests this missing part of the brain may play an important role in how we understand the world -- despite getting ""lost"" for more than a century. A long flat bundle of nerves called the vertical occipital fasciculus, or VOF, the structure appeared in textbooks on the brain for about 30 years around the end of the 19th century, then mysteriously dropped out of sight completely. Pestilli was also part of the team that first traced this missing brain structure to an 1881 publication by Carl Wernicke, a German-Austrian neuroanatomist. ""Our new study shows that the VOF may provide the fundamental white matter connection between two parts of the visual system: that which identifies objects, words and faces and that which orients us in space,"" said Pestilli, senior author and assistant professor in the College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, whose work on the collaborative project began as a research associate at Stanford University. ""The structure forms a 'highway' between the lower, ventral part of the visual system, which processes the properties of faces, words and objects, and the upper, dorsal parietal regions, which orients attention to an object's spatial location,"" he added. The first researcher on the paper was Hiromasa Takemura of the Center for Information and Neural Networks in Japan. Based upon where the VOF terminates in the brain's cortex, Pestilli said the VOF might play a critical role in the brain's visual system, coordinating information transmission between brain areas important for ""where we see"" and ""what we see."" In a long-standing debate, neuroscientists have argued the degree to which these two parts of the visual system function separately. The new study suggests that the regions work ""hand-in-glove"" to coordinate the body's movement in relation to people and objects around it. There are ""countless examples"" that reflect how the two functions are intertwined, Pestilli said. Reaching for your keys, putting on your hat, driving to work each morning -- all require this what/where coordination. So does reading words on a page, which demands moving one's eyes with respect to the words and letters. What happens when this ""what/where"" coordination fails? Pestilli points to the title character in the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,"" who, when asked to get his hat and put it on, tries to pick up his wife's head to put it on his own. In this strange disconnect between an object and its location, Sacks recognized the effect of a tumor or degeneration afflicting the patient's visual system. The problem may have specifically affected the functioning of the VOF, Pestilli said, speculating on the symptoms of Sacks' patient. But how did an entire anatomical structure in the brain suddenly go missing in the first place? The answer may be scientific rivalry. In their earlier paper, Pestilli and collaborators attributed the VOF's disappearance to competing beliefs among 19th-century neuroanatomists. In contrast to Wernicke, Theodor Meynert, another prominent scientist in Germany, never accepted the new structure due to his belief that all white matter pathways ran horizontally. Over time, the VOF faded into obscurity. In addition to contributing to the rediscovery and function of the VOF, Pestilli's work is also helping map other parts of the human brain in unprecedented detail, using state-of-the-art neuroimaging and computational methods. This work will not only contribute to a deeper knowledge of the human brain -- such as how variations in brain structures relate to behavioral differences among individuals -- but will also strengthen the university's other investigations into complex networks, including brain connectivity, primarily within the recently established IU Network Science Institute. ""This new study really contributes to our understanding of how two important parts of the brain communicate,"" said Brian Wandell, a co-author at Stanford, ""painting a picture of the brain that is highly interconnected.""

The findings are reported in JAMA Psychiatry by researchers at the University of California (UC), San Diego School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. Even at rest, the normal rhythm of the heart fluctuates, reflecting influences and changes in other parts of the body. Generally speaking, the greater the heart rate variability or HRV, the better. Conversely, reduced HRV suggests poorer functioning of regulatory systems in the body and has been cited as an indicator or predictor for a number of conditions, such as fetal distress, heart disease, depression, asthma, diabetic neuropathy and disorders of the autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions not consciously directed, such as heartbeat, breathing and digestion. HRV has been associated with PTSD, a mental health condition linked to a number of maladies, including anger, insomnia, substance abuse and chronic depression. PTSD is particularly associated with persons deployed to war. For example, the lifetime prevalence in Vietnam-era combat veterans is 19 percent. For veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, it is 13 to 15 percent. In the general U.S. population, the PTSD prevalence rate is 8 percent. Researchers investigated whether reduced HRV before combat deployment conferred increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment. From July 2008 to October 2013, they assessed two large cohorts of active-duty Marines one to two months before combat deployment and again four to six months after their return. After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, the researchers found that U.S. Marines with reduced HRV prior to deployment displayed increased vulnerability to PTSD upon return. ""The evidence is initial and modest,"" said Arpi Minassian, PhD, clinical professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and first author of the study. ""It suggests that an altered state of the autonomic nervous system may contribute to vulnerability and resilience to PTSD, along with known risk factors, such as combat exposure and preexisting stress and trauma symptoms."" The researchers said that if the findings are buttressed by future studies, it may suggest new opportunities for preventing PTSD by addressing the biology of the autonomic nervous system.

The findings, published in Science, suggest that the 'hardware' in our brain is tuneable and could have implications that go far beyond basic neuroscience - from informing education policy to developing new therapies for neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Computers are often used as a metaphor for the brain, with logic boards and microprocessors representing neural circuits and neurons, respectively. While this analogy has served neuroscience well in the past, it is far from correct, according to the researchers from King's. They suggest that the brain is a highly dynamic, self-organizing system, in which internal and external influences continuously shape information processing 'hardware' by mechanisms not yet understood, and in a way not achieved by computers. Researchers from the MRC CDN, led by Professor Oscar Mar n, have shed light on this problem by discovering that some neurons in the cerebral cortex can adapt their properties in response to changes in network activity - such as those observed during learning of a motor task. The authors studied two apparently different classes of fast-spiking interneurons, only to discover that they were actually looking at the same piece of 'hardware' which had the ability to oscillate between two different ground states. The authors also identified the molecular factor responsible for tuning the properties of these cells, a transcription factor - a protein able to influence gene expression - known as Er81. Fast-spiking interneurons are part of a general class of neurons whose primary role is regulating the activity of the principal cells of the cerebral cortex, known as pyramidal cells. The cerebral cortex is outer layer of the brain and is associated with cognition, language and memory. 'Our findings explain the underlying mechanisms behind the dynamic regulation of the identity of interneurons', said Nathalie Dehorter of the MRC CDN and first author of the study. 'The results of this study support the notion that activity plays a prominent role in the specification of neuronal properties, which adapt in response to internal and external influences to encode information. In other words, that our 'hardware' is tuneable, at least to some extent.' Understanding the dynamic mechanisms that lead to the emergence of brain functions through the development and continuous remodeling of neural circuits, and the constraints that disease and ageing impose to this multi-modal plasticity has important implications that go beyond fundamental neuroscience, from education policies to brain repair. Professor Oscar Mar n, last author from the MRC CDN, said: 'Our study demonstrates the tremendous plasticity of the brain, and how this relates to fundamental processes such as learning. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate this plasticity, and why it tends to dissipate when we age, has enormous implications that go beyond fundamental neuroscience, from informing education policies to developing new therapies for neurological disorders such as epilepsy.'

The researchers, led by Elena Batrakova, an associate professor at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy s Center for Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery (CNDD), genetically modified white blood cells called macrophages to produce glial cell derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, and deliver it to the brain. Glial cells provide support and protection for nerve cells throughout the brain and body, and GDNF can heal and stimulate the growth of damaged neurons.  Currently, there are no treatments that can halt or reverse the course of Parkinson s disease. There are only therapies to address quality of life, such as dopamine replacement,  Batrakova said.  However, studies have shown that delivering neurotrophic factor to the brain not only promotes the survival of neurons but also reverses the progression of Parkinson s disease.  In addition to delivering GDNF, the engineered macrophages can  teach  neurons to make the protein for themselves by delivering both the tools and the instructions needed: DNA, messenger RNA and transcription factor. Successfully delivering the treatment to the brain is the key to the success of GDNF therapy, said Batrakova. Using immune cells avoids the body s natural defenses. The repurposed macrophages are also able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, something most medicines cannot do. The reprogrammed cells travel to the brain and produce tiny bubbles called exosomes that contain GDNF. The cells release the exosomes, which then are able to deliver the proteins to neurons in the brain. The work is described in an article published in PLOS One.

Many of these chronic pain sufferers fail to get relief from pills, shots and even surgery, while others temporarily trade the pain for side effects such as drowsiness or digestive problems. Unfortunately, too many become addicted to medications while trying to relieve their pain. As part of a comprehensive treatment plan, a variety of technologies offer new hope to people living with chronic pain. Used by physician anesthesiologists who specialize in pain management, these techniques ease pain in various ways -- using radio waves, electrical pulses, image-guided injections and special pumps to deliver pain medication. Pain medicine specialists have extensive training and expertise in finding the cause of pain and working in partnership with patients to create a plan for managing pain and improving function. ""Pain is one of the most challenging things to treat because its source can be elusive,"" said Richard Rosenquist, M.D., chair of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Committee on Pain Medicine and chairman of the department of pain management at the Anesthesiology Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. ""That's why it's vital to see a physician specializing in pain medicine who can help identify the source of the pain and suggest which pain method might work best, including the more recent technical advances."" Here are some of the latest high-tech methods for relieving chronic pain: Radio Waves - Radiofrequency (RF) ablation involves heating a tiny area of nerve tissue, which short circuits pain signals. Using CT imaging as a guide, the pain medicine specialist inserts a needle into the nerve responsible for the pain and zaps it using an electric current created by radio waves. The relief can last for up to a year. Blocking the Pain - Under X-ray guidance, pain medicine physicians can inject numbing medication that blocks or dampens pain, and might even stop chronic pain from developing. The location of the injection depends on the source and type of pain. For example, pain in the arm or face can be relieved by blocking nerves in the neck. Chronic abdominal pain or pain from cancers such as pancreatic cancer can be relieved by an injection into nerves supplying the abdomen. Relief may require a series of injections and may need to be repeated. Electric Signals -- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can provide short-term pain relief, especially for various types of muscle pain, by sending low voltage electric signals from a small device to the painful area through pads attached to the skin. The patient will feel little pulses when it's on. While researchers aren't sure why it works, they think it may either interrupt the nerve signals to the brain, or stimulate the production of ""feel good"" endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Spinal Cord Stimulation -- When other methods fail, a pain medicine specialist might recommend spinal cord stimulation (SCS), which uses a pacemaker-like device that replaces the pain with a more tolerable sensation, typically tingling or a massage-like feeling. The physician implants the device in the lower back, attaching it to tiny wires that are located in the spinal canal. When the patient feels pain, he or she can use a remote control device to send signals to the painful area. This technique can help with back pain as well as neuropathy -- nerve damage in the legs that causes numbness and pain. Neuropathy is common in people with diabetes. High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation -- A recent study published in Anesthesiology, the medical journal of the ASA, showed that a special high frequency form of SCS provided significantly greater long-term relief for both chronic back and leg pain, compared to traditional low frequency SCS. The high frequency SCS also relieved pain without introducing the tingling or other stimulation-induced sensation that some patients find distracting. Pumping the Pain Away -- Special pumps can be implanted that allow the patient to push a button and deliver local anesthetics, narcotics and other pain medications to the spinal cord. This can bring relief while avoiding the side effects that often come with taking these drugs by mouth. Patients also get a psychological boost by having direct control over their pain. These spinal drug pumps are most often used by people with cancer pain, but also by patients with other types of pain who had side effects when taking medication. On the Horizon: Using Our Cells to Fight Pain -- One of the most promising research areas involves harvesting stem cells from a patient's bone marrow and injecting them into an area, such as the lower back, that has become painful because tissue has deteriorated. The hope is that the stem cells will build new, healthy tissue and relieve pain for good. American Society of Anesthesiologists   press release","Published: September 11, 2015"

It is estimated that almost 27-30% of India's pharmaceutical market is catered to by multinationals operating in India and around 4,60,000 people are estimated to be employed in the pharmaceutical industry. Top 20 companies account for 64% of the market. 8 out of the top 20 are growing faster than the market, with Macleoids topping the list with 23.4% growth followed by Intas with 21.3%, Cipla 19.7% Glenmark over 19.4% growth and Mankind 19.3%. Besides, India s pharma exports stood at US$ 15.3 billion in 2014-15. There were M&A activities in the industry accounted for $ 5.78, billion an increase of around 44.5% in comparison to 2013. The Government's continuous and concerted efforts have resulted in the reach of modern medicine to almost all corners of the country, and its measures have resulted in the steady decline of communicable diseases. The successful eradication of Polio, Small Pox etc. can be attributed entirely to the tireless efforts of the Government. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for the implementation of national health and family welfare programmes such as the prevention and control of major communicable diseases, maternal and child health. Public-private partnerships, an increased penetration of healthcare facilities in non-metro cities, involvement of multinationals in setting up facilities in the country, and establishment of educational institutions, are just a few multiple prime reasons enabling India to experience a surge in the global market. Other key assets which have played a role in India becoming a leading pharma market are a thorough know-how in the manufacture of generics, rapidly developing research and development facilities with talented technical staffing, internationally recognised systems of pharmacy education, and a broad patient population pool enabling intense clinical trials. India accounts for 30.3% (2,911) of 9619 Drug Master Files (DMFs) filed with the USA, which is the highest outside of the USA. India has been accredited with approximately 1187 CEPs, more than 950TGA, and 584 sites approved by USFDA. Despite a challenging intellectual property regime, pharmaceutical R&D activities are increasing in India. An average of 8-10% of the total revenue of the India domestic pharma market, i.e. US$ 15 billon, is spent on R&D. ZydusCadilla has launched ""Lipaglyn"" (Chemical name is Sarogltazar), its original research being to treat Hypertrigycerdemia in Type-2 diabetes. Glenmark has several new chemical and biologics. Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS) in India is estimated to reach US$ 18 billion in 2018, up from US$ 7.6 7.8 billion in 2013. The biopharma market is valued at US$ 2.5 billion whereas India is expected to grab at least 20-25% of global market share in biosimilars in the next five years. India is also making inroads to new regulated markets like Japan. Several initiatives have been undertaken by industry for engaging with Japanese pharma companies, including contract manufacturing of advance intermediates for drugs under clinical development/about to be made commercial, marketing APIs to Japanese Generic and Innovation companies, providing quality intermediates to the Japanese innovator companies. In summary, the last few years have reshaped and repositioned India in the realm of healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and the results have started to show in its high ranking position in the global pharmaceutical market.

This can vary quite widely, which can also have consequences for the quality. It was concluded that all the marzipan examined during the study was made from pure almonds and did not contain any other nuts or beans   which was good news. The researchers bought various types of marzipan from a number of shops at prices that varied by as much as a factor of 10. RIKILT used the latest analytical techniques to examine seven marzipan samples to determine whether they were made from pure almonds or also contained other nuts or beans. The researchers used DNA analyses and advanced protein identification techniques that give a precise indication of the ingredients in a product. All the types of marzipan that were examined contained almonds. Although it is conceivable that other types of nut or ground haricot beans could be blended with the almonds used to make marzipan, this was not the case with any of the products examined during this study. In addition, the researchers carried out microscopic analyses and comprehensive fatty acid analyses to compare the various types of marzipan. These analyses also did not reveal any anomalies. RIKILT also examined the odour of 17 samples of marzipan. This did reveal differences, in particular between the marzipan from local confectioners and chain stores.","Published: September 11, 2015"

Although there is no evidence that human prion disease, AD or CAA is contagious (spread from person to person by direct contact), the study of eight patients suggests that amyloid beta (the peptides that form the main components of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with AD) may potentially be transmissible via certain medical procedures. Human transmission of prion disease has occurred as a result of various medical procedures (iatrogenic transmission), with incubation periods that can exceed five decades.  One such iatrogenic route of transmission was via the treatment in the UK of 1,848 persons of short stature with human growth hormone (HGH) extracted from cadaver-sourced pituitary glands, some of which were inadvertently prion-contaminated. The treatments began in 1958 and ceased in 1985 following reports of CJD among recipients. By the year 2000, 38 of the patients had developed CJD. As of 2012, 450 cases of iatrogenic CJD have been identified in countries worldwide after treatment with cadaver-derived HGH and, to a lesser extent, other medical procedures, including transplant and neurosurgery. John Collinge, Sebastian Brandner and colleagues at UCL conducted autopsy studies, including extensive brain tissue sampling, of eight UK patients aged 36 51 with iatrogenic CJD. The authors show that in addition to prion disease in all eight brains sampled, six exhibited some degree of amyloid beta pathology (four widespread) and four of these had some degree of CAA. Such pathology is rare in this age range and none of the patients were found to have mutations associated with early-onset AD.  There were no signs of the tau protein pathology characteristic of AD, but the full neuropathology of AD could potentially have developed had the patients lived longer. The authors examined a cohort of 116 patients with other prion diseases and found no evidence of amyloid beta pathology in the brains of patients of similar age range or a decade older who did not receive HGH treatment. The study suggests that healthy individuals exposed to cadaver-derived HGH may be at risk of iatrogenic AD and CAA, as well as iatrogenic CJD, as they age. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms involved, but it seems likely that, as well as prions, the pituitary glands used to make the HGH contained the amyloid beta seeds that caused the amyloid beta pathology observed. The results should prompt investigation of whether other known iatrogenic routes of prion transmission, including surgical instrument use and blood transfusion, could also be relevant to the transmission of AD, CAA and other neurodegenerative diseases. Professor Collinge, Director of the MRC Prion Unit at the UCL Institute of Neurology, said:  Our findings relate to the specific circumstance of cadaver-derived human growth hormone injections, a treatment that was discontinued many years ago. It is possible our findings might be relevant to some other medical or surgical procedures, but evaluating what risk, if any, there might be requires much further research. Our current data have no bearing on dental surgery and certainly do not argue that dentistry poses a risk of Alzheimer s disease."" Professor Mike Hanna, Director of the UCL Institute of Neurology, said: ""This is potentially very important research from the UCL Institute of Neurology Prion research Group lead by John Collinge and Sebastian Brandner. It could inform our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease and will enable new programmes of world leading research in Dementia at the Institute of Neurology, Queen Square.""","Published: September 11, 2015"

However, MAGR are chemically distinct and may function differently than steroids. The initial aim of the collaboration will be joint research and development leading to two preclinical drug candidates, one each in the areas of inflammation and oncology. Takeda will explore opportunities to conduct clinical trials for drug candidates identified by the partnership. Under the agreement, Gencia will receive upfront payments and preclinical milestones for the two compounds and aggregate clinical, commercialization and sales milestones with the potential for approximately $500 million in payments by Takeda. Gencia also will receive royalties on sales of any successfully commercialized products arising from the partnership. Further details of the agreement were not disclosed.  This collaboration and license agreement with Takeda marks an important milestone in the growth and development of our company,  said Allen Cunningham, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gencia.  Takeda s strength in drug discovery and development, and in particular their commitment to oncology and inflammation drug research, provides Gencia with the opportunity to advance our mitochondrial targeting platform and MAGR compounds into the clinic, and ultimately to patients in need of these therapies. We are very pleased to have Takeda as our partner in this endeavor.  Added Tetsuyuki Maruyama, Ph.D., General Manager, Head of Pharmaceutical Research Division at Takeda,  We are delighted to partner with Gencia to create new medicines designed to be chemically and functionally different from steroids, but that may still be effective in treating a broad spectrum of diseases for which chronic steroids are currently prescribed. We expect to change the paradigm for how patients are treated by potentially avoiding the issues that result from long-term steroid use.  Glucocorticoid drugs are used in front-line, combination, maintenance and relapse therapy in the treatment of many hematological and inflammatory diseases. However, side-effects, lack of response or induced resistance frequently limit glucocorticoid use. Gencia s MAGR agonists have shown activity in numerous steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant pharmacology models. Gencia and Takeda will explore potential therapeutic uses of MAGRs and the possibilities for their safe and effective chronic use.","Published: September 11, 2015"

The protein, called STAT3, interferes with chemotherapy by halting the death of cancerous cells and allowing them to proliferate. The molecule discovered at Rice locates and then attacks a previously unknown binding site on STAT3, disrupting its disease-promoting effects. The new work led by Rice chemist Zachary Ball, Baylor pediatrician Michele Redell and MD Anderson oncologist David Tweardy appears this week in the journal Angewandte Chemie. The discovery and exploitation of this new drug target was made possible by an earlier discovery by Ball s lab. That finding enabled researchers to identify, on a molecular level, the target of action for drug molecules by using rhodium-based inorganic complexes that recognize specific folds in a protein chain and catalyze minute changes in those sequences, creating a  tag  for later analysis. The STAT3 protein   it stands for  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3    is a suspected factor in the relapse of nearly 40 percent of children with AML. The new proximity-driven rhodium(II) catalyst known as MM-206 finds and modifies an inhibitor-binding site on the protein s coiled coil   literally protein coils coiled around each other   and delivers the inhibitor, naphthalene sulfonamide, to the modified site.  This is the confluence of two ideas we ve been working on around what you can do with conjugates linked to rhodium,  Ball said.  We know that increased activity of STAT3 in AML and other cancers helps the cancer cells survive chemotherapy, so any new strategy we can develop to stop that process could mean real benefit for our patients,  said Redell, who is also part of the leukemia and lymphoma teams at Texas Children s Hospital. Ball said STAT3 has been a target for scientists trying to shut down cancer cells.  STAT fits in the broad category of what are called  undruggable protein-protein interactions.  There s a large surface area with weak interactions for which we have typically failed to find good drugs,  he said. Previous research revolved around only one region of STAT3, its SH2 domain, with limited success.  There s no evidence people have tried to go after the coiled coil as a drug target,  Ball said, though he noted one paper suggested it might be worth a look.  But they didn t follow up on it.  Our main advance, from a medicinal perspective, is that this compound also works in a mouse model,  he said.  All the other compounds worked in cells, but in mice, they weren t potent enough or stable enough.  Follow-up studies should lead to improved versions of the complex, Ball said.  The discovery raises new questions about STAT3 biology and points the way to future anti-cancer approaches, including combination therapies of coiled-coil STAT3 inhibitors in tandem with other agents,  he said.","Published: September 11, 2015"

A wide range of active ingredients originating from pesticides, shampoos, lotions, cosmetics, disinfectants and drugs get washed into sewage systems or rivers and streams, ending up in our tap water. Scientists don t have a complete picture yet of what effects these substances have on wildlife and human health, but they are a major concern. Researchers have detected them in low levels in streams and rivers across the United States and in other countries. To address the specific problem of medications in the environment, Klaus K mmerer and colleagues made tweaks to pharmaceuticals so they degrade after they ve passed through both the body and sewage treatment systems, which aren t capable of scrubbing wastewater of all contaminants. The researchers chose to work with a commonly used drug called propranolol   a beta blocker prescribed to treat high blood pressure and to prevent heart problems. It is very stable and has been found in sewage. They made a small molecular change in its structure that didn t affect its beta blocking activity but allowed it to break down more easily than the original form. Further studies are needed, but initial testing showed that the altered drug and its byproducts are likely not toxic. The researchers suggest that a similar approach could be used to re-design other classes of drugs and chemicals to make them more environmentally friendly, too.","Published: September 11, 2015"

The trial is expected to commence shortly after receipt of regulatory approval, anticipated in the next few months. The open-label Phase 2 trial will be conducted in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and is expected to enroll up to 25 patients. The study will examine BL-8040 s ability to improve bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood counts in patients suffering from these bone marrow failure conditions. Both hMDS and AA are characterized by a T cell-driven autoimmune attack on the bone marrow that results in depletion of hematopoietic precursors, leading to anemia and low white blood cell counts. In this regard, high CXCR4 expression on pathogenic T cells has been suggested to facilitate infiltration of the bone marrow. BL-8040, a CXCR4 antagonist, is expected to inhibit migration of pathogenic T cells to the bone marrow, thereby mitigating the severe depletion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In addition, BL-8040 can directly affect the number of hematopoietic precursors. Preclinical studies in mice showed that multiple doses of BL-8040 led to a marked increase in the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells in both the bone marrow and peripheral blood. BL-8040 also promoted production of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, leading to a prolonged increased platelet production. These direct effects of BL-8040, along with the exclusion of the pathogenic T cells from the bone marrow, may improve bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood counts. Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx, stated,  We are very pleased to have filed the necessary regulatory submissions for an additional Phase 2 trial of BL-8040, our unique oncology platform, in these novel and non-malignant indications. We are honored to collaborate yet again with the prestigious MD Anderson Cancer Center, expanding upon our current collaboration on the Phase 2 trial for treating relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as our planned Phase 2 trial for treating AML patients with the FLT3-ITD mutation. The hMDS/AA trial will assess BL-8040 in combination with standard of care immunosuppressive therapy, with interim results expected by the end of 2016. Both hMDS and AA represent significant unmet medical needs and we are very hopeful that BL-8040, as part of a novel treatment regimen, will significantly improve bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood counts in patients suffering from these difficult bone marrow failure conditions.

Phosphonates are an abundant and diverse class of natural signalling molecules that have already proved useful to medicine and agriculture, said University of Illinois microbiology professor William Metcalf, who led the research with U. of I. chemistry professor Wilfred van der Donk.  We focused on phosphonates because we know they are strongly predisposed to have biological activity   antibiotic activity, antiviral activity, herbicidal activity,  Metcalf said. Bacteria use these compounds to signal their presence to their microbial neighbors, or, at higher concentrations, to kill them, he said.Naturally produced phosphonates have great pharmaceutical potential, the researchers said.  Of the 20 previously known natural-product phosphonates, two are used commercially   one as a clinical antibiotic and one as an herbicide   and another one is now in clinical trials to treat malaria,  van der Donk said.  This 15 percent drug-development success rate is much higher than the 0.1 percent average estimated for natural products as a whole.  Postdoctoral researcher Kou-San Ju used a technique called  genome mining  to search the genomes of 10,000 strains of actinomycete bacteria for pepM, a single gene that is required for most types of phosphonate biosynthesis. Postdoctoral researcher Jiangtao Gao then worked with Ju to purify and structurally characterize the phosphonates.  Genome mining has previously been used, but only with a few organisms at a time,  Ju said.  We wanted to know if this approach could actually be feasibly performed on a scale that is relevant to pharmaceutical discovery.  The team identified 278 bacterial strains that had the pepM gene.  If you have that gene, it means you re making a phosphonate natural product,  Metcalf said. The researchers then sequenced the full genomes of all 278 strains that had the gene. By examining the genes flanking pepM, the researchers could tell whether they were finding pathways to build new phosphonates or rediscovering old ones.  In the old days, pharmaceutical companies would have done bioassays on extracts from all 10,000 species,  Metcalf said. They would purify the compounds of interest, determine their structure and then try to figure out whether they had found something new, he said.  It was very, very tedious and very expensive,  he said.  That would have taken a large company with hundreds of people years, if not decades.  The new effort has yielded many novel compounds.  We have thus far isolated 19 new phosphonates, including those with antibiotic properties and others with previously unknown structures,  Ju said.  In other words, we have essentially doubled the inventory of phosphonate natural products identified to date.  The 19 new structures are among 78 newly discovered groups of phosphonates produced from the 278 actinomycetes with the pepM gene. One of the 19, which the team named argolaphos, was found to be most potent against three types of bacteria that cause illness: Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, the researchers report. The researchers describe the new findings as a proof of concept that genome mining can be used on a scale that will speed the process of drug discovery, focusing on naturally produced compounds, which are among the most promising new drug leads.  These biologically produced small molecules have been the source of, or inspiration for, nearly two-thirds of all human medicines, yet research in this area has dwindled in recent years due to, among other reasons, high costs and increasing rates of rediscovery,  the researchers wrote. Natural products also are a much-needed source of new antibiotics.  To this day, natural products make up 75 percent of all of our antibiotics   either the natural products themselves or derivatives thereof,  van der Donk said.  Our study shows that genome mining is not only a viable route to new natural products, but that there are a tremendous number of new compounds awaiting discovery from the genomes of microbial strains,  Ju said.","Published: September 11, 2015"

The patient, Wendy Peacock, 43, from San Antonio, TX, underwent the minimally invasive procedure on August 18, 2015, and is now producing her own insulin naturally for the first time since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 17. In this pilot study, DRI researchers are testing a new transplant technique for insulin-producing cells, building upon decades of progress in clinical islet transplantation. This trial is an important first step toward the development of the DRI BioHub, a bioengineered mini-organ that mimics the native pancreas to restore natural insulin production in people with type 1 diabetes.   The first subject in our Phase I/II pilot BioHub trial is now completely off insulin with an excellent glucose profile. These are the best post-transplant results we've seen in an islet recipient,"" said Camillo Ricordi, MD, director of the DRI and the Stacy Joy Goodman Professor of Surgery, Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Miami Miller School. Dr. Ricordi also serves as director of the DRI s Cell Transplant Center.  This was the first tissue engineered islet transplant using a  biodegradable scaffold  implanted on the surface of the omentum. The technique has been designed to minimize the inflammatory reaction that is normally observed when islets are implanted in the liver or in other sites with immediate contact to the blood. If these results can be confirmed, this can be the beginning of a new era in islet transplantation. Our ultimate goal is to include additional technologies to prevent the need for life-long anti-rejection therapy,"" Dr. Ricordi added. The omentum is a highly vascularized tissue covering abdominal organs. The donor islets were implanted within a biodegradable scaffold, one of the platforms for a DRI BioHub, made by combining the patient's own blood plasma with thrombin, a commonly used, clinical-grade enzyme. Together, these substances create a gel-like material that sticks to the omentum and holds the islets in place. The omentum is then folded over around the biodegradable scaffold mixture. Over time, the body will absorb the gel, leaving the islets intact, while new blood vessels are formed to provide critical oxygen and other nutrients that support the cells  survival.  This pilot trial will include the immunosuppressive regimen currently used for clinical islet transplantation studies and will be limited to a small group of participants.   ""As any type 1 knows, you live on a very structured schedule. I do a mental checklist every day in my head...glucose tabs, food, glucometer, etc., and then I stop and say, 'WOW! I don't have to plan that anymore.' Laying down at night and going to sleep and not having to worry about lows is something that is so foreign to me. It's surreal to me...I'm still processing the fact that I'm not taking insulin anymore,"" said Peacock, who was a candidate for the DRI's clinical trial because she suffered with severe hypoglycemia unawareness, a complication of diabetes in which patients are unable to sense that their blood glucose is dropping to dangerously low levels. People with hypoglycemia unawareness often become disoriented, lose consciousness or go into convulsions. It may even lead to death.   We're quite excited. This has been the best outcome we have seen at this stage. It's a unique site, the surgery is very simple and the patient recovers very quickly. We will continue until our final goal - islet transplantation without immunosuppression,"" adds Rodolfo Alejandro, MD, Professor of Medicine and director of the DRI Clinical Cell Transplant Program.  In type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing islets cells of the pancreas have been mistakenly destroyed by the immune system, requiring patients to manage their blood sugar levels through a daily regimen of insulin therapy. Islet transplantation has allowed some patients to live without the need for insulin injections after receiving a transplant of donor cells. Some patients who have received islet transplants at the DRI have been insulin independent for more than a decade, as DRI researchers have published.  Currently, islet cells are infused into the liver, but many of the cells do not survive in that environment.  The liver is a very simple site to access, but we have known for years that it s not the ideal site. And the liver will not accommodate a device for housing the islets,  explained Dr. Alejandro.","Published: September 11, 2015"

Their conclusions suggest that one day it could come in a new, therapeutic form.  About 10 years ago, researchers reported that capsaicin can kill prostate cancer cells in mice while leaving healthy cells unharmed. But translating that dose to humans would require them to eat a huge number of chili peppers per day. Figuring out how capsaicin works could help researchers transform it into an effective drug in the form of an injection or pill. Researchers have figured out that the molecule binds to a cell s surface and affects the membrane, which surrounds and protects the cell. That finding prompted Ashok Kumar Mishra and Jitendriya Swain to try to gain a deeper understanding of capsaicin s effects so it might be harnessed in the future for new medicines. The scientists were able to detect how the compound interacts with cell membranes by monitoring its natural fluorescence. The study showed that capsaicin lodges in the membranes near the surface. Add enough of it, and the capsaicin essentially causes the membranes to come apart. With additional research, this insight could help lead to novel tools against cancer or other conditions.","Published: September 11, 2015"

We think we have a way not only to more specifically target cancer cells, but a way that could become a frontline treatment for women who have cancers of many types and want to preserve fertility,  said reproduction researcher John Herr of U.Va. s Department of Cell Biology. An Unexpected Cancer Connection Herr and his research partner, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology biologist Eusebio Pires, both specialize in germ cells   the reproductive cells that make up sperm and eggs. While researching new methods of contraception, Pires and Herr discovered a surprising link between developing egg cells and tumors. That link may allow doctors to use antibodies to deliver medication directly to tumors while sparing healthy tissue. At the time, Herr and Pires were studying a protein called SAS1B that is typically only on the surface of developing and mature egg cells. Except for the small group of growing eggs in the ovary, the SAS1B protein is virtually absent in other tissues in the body,  Pires said.  So SAS1B has the promising features of a candidate contraceptive target.  The restriction of SAS1B to growing eggs suggests strategies for developing improved female contraceptives that selectively target only the pool of growing eggs, potentially reducing unwanted side effects of current steroidal contraceptives. Although the team originally focused on SAS1B because of its possible use in contraception, a single piece of data in the National Cancer Institutes  GenBank database, showing expression of SAS1B in a uterine cancer, led their team to begin a search for it on the surface of various cancer types. So far, they have found SAS1B expressed in breast, melanoma, uterine, renal, ovarian, head and neck, and pancreatic cancers. There is also evidence to suggest that it appears in bladder cancers.  The research opens a new field of enquiry, termed cancer-oocyte neoantigens, and reveals a previously little know fundamental aspect of cancer   that many types of cancer, when they dysregulate or go awry, revert back and take on features of the egg, the original cell from which all the tissues in the body derive,  Herr said. He and Pires have found a way to exploit this fundamental insight by developing a method for delivering medication using the SAS1B protein as a target. Tiny Cancer Trackers: Antibodies Armed with Drug Payloads Since the SAS1B protein appears only on egg cells and cancer cells, the molecule can serve as a target for tiny tracking probes created using monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are highly pure antibodies designed to bind to one single target protein with a uniform affinity. The monoclonal antibodies attach to any cell marked with SAS1B proteins. Then the monoclonal antibody-SAS1B complexes can function as tiny injectors for targeted medication.  You add a SAS1B-targeted antibody with a drug on it, and within 15 minutes of contacting the cancer cells, the antibody binds at the cell surface and the antibody-SAS1B complexes begin the internalization process,  Herr said. After about an hour, the antibody-SAS1B complexes reach compartments inside the cell and release their toxic drug payload, triggering changes leading to cell death within a few days.  This kind of targeted drug delivery could mean a dramatic reduction in the difficult side-effects of traditional cancer treatment such as hair loss, nausea, anemia and neuropathy. Both women and men can use the treatment, which is predicted to dramatically limit unwanted side effects on healthy normal cells. For female cancer patients especially, a drug that doesn t touch their body s reserve of quiescent eggs could be a huge breakthrough. Preserving Fertility While the monoclonal antibodies would have to attack the pool of growing egg cells in addition to the SAS1B positive cancer cells, the ovaries  supply of dormant eggs would remain healthy and untouched by the treatment. This means normal ovulation could begin again once treatment is complete and oocytes are again recruited to develop and ovulate; a process anticipated to take approximately 200 days. In addition to treating cancer, these selective antibodies could also lead to a new method for early cancer detection and prevention. Pires explained that the research team is developing a way to find tiny amounts of free-circulating SAS1B proteins in the body.  It could be a valuable discovery in terms of prerequisite testing to identify those patients who have tumors making SAS1B,  he said. Pires and Herr hope that doctors will one day be able to use the monoclonal antibodies to measure patients  SAS1B protein levels in blood. Those with elevated levels of the protein would be tested for the early stages of cancer and receive treatment sooner. As they fine-tune this early detection method, Herr and Pires plan to begin testing their qualified antibody treatment in model organisms that carry human tumors at U.Va. s labs this fall.  If everything goes well, less than a year from now we will know if we re ready to propose a study for testing within select human populations,  Pires said.","Published: September 11, 2015"

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/protein-aggregation-after-heat-shock-is-an-organized-reversible-response-206213,Protein Aggregation After Heat Shock Is An Organized  Reversible Response New study finds protein aggregation after heat exposure is a reversible cellular process  not unrecoverable damage from misfolding   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Protein aggregates that form after a cell is exposed to high, non-lethal temperatures appear to be part of an organized response to stress, and not the accumulation of damaged proteins en route to destruction. Scientists from the University of Chicago and Harvard University discovered that aggregates are fully reversible - after the cell returns to normal temperatures, aggregated proteins are disentangled and resume their normal cellular functions. Some proteins were found to remain intact and even functional while in an aggregated state. The findings shed new light on the biological nature of protein aggregates, which have been widely considered to be toxic dead-end products, but are increasingly being recognized as a new layer of cellular organization. ""We asked simple questions: what proteins aggregate in the cell during acute heat shock and what happens to them when the cell recovers?"" said senior study author D. Allan Drummond, PhD, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Chicago. ""Much to our surprise, we found that even the most severely aggregated proteins disassembled and went back into circulation during recovery. It raises the possibility that most of these aggregates, which before looked like damage, may actually be part of a coordinated, evolved process."" Despite decades of investigation, many questions remain about how cells respond to heat shock. When exposed to stressful, but nonlethal temperatures, some cellular proteins aggregate into large clumps known as stress granules. Mutant cell line studies have suggested that certain types of stress granules are destroyed by the cell and their protein components presumably remade. Artificially-introduced heat-sensitive proteins, as well as newly made proteins, have been shown to be aggregation-prone and destroyed by cells after heat shock. But whether similar fates befell the vast majority of proteins in normal cells remained unclear. To look at the effects of heat shock on native populations of proteins, Drummond and his colleagues utilized a novel set of techniques that allowed them to simultaneously track almost 1,000 different mature proteins in yeast cells. The team exposed cells to temperatures ranging from 30 C (normal) to 46 C (severe heat shock), for very short periods of time, from two to eight minutes. They then measured protein aggregation with tools that included mass spectrometry. The researchers identified more than 175 different proteins that aggregated in response to heat shock, representing around a sixth of the proteins measured and about ten times as many as were known before. Specific proteins formed granules at specific and separate cellular locations, indicating a level of organization. However, the team also found that aggregation happened under many conditions where stress granules did not form, indicating that aggregation and formation of granules are related but separate processes. The biggest surprise came when the team looked at the fates of aggregated proteins. Proteins were labeled with isotopes--a technique similar to carbon dating for archaeological finds--and followed as cells underwent heat shock and recovery. They found that aggregated proteins were disentangled and resumed their original functions without exception after cells returned to normal temperatures. Isotope labeling ruled out the possibility that aggregated proteins were being degraded and replaced by new proteins, which would be unlabeled. The team then performed a detailed analysis on three proteins of interest, which in normal conditions form a complex that links amino acids to transfer RNAs (tRNAs). When isolated and tested for their response to heat, these proteins readily aggregated. But even in an aggregated state after severe heat shock, they formed a functional complex that still actively and accurately processed tRNAs. ""In contrast to what's been observed in many studies on foreign proteins and mutant cells, disassembly of native aggregates after heat shock in normal cells is essentially complete under these conditions,"" Drummond said. ""Aggregation likely inactivates the vast majority of proteins, but it's remarkable that some can remain active when aggregated. All of this indicates the need to rethink the biological meaning of aggregation during heat shock."" Based on previous work and their own results, Drummond and his colleagues speculate that a central purpose of protein aggregation during heat shock is to reshape the cellular factory, focusing protein synthesis on proteins needed during stress. In some cases, the authors hypothesize, proteins act as autonomous thermometers and actuators, sensing heat and self-assembling to activate or deactivate certain cellular functions. ""Heat-induced aggregation has all the hallmarks of an adaptive response,"" said study author Edward Wallace, PhD, postdoctoral scholar in biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Chicago. ""Our findings suggest a layer of cellular machinery that senses and enacts these decisions by forming specific aggregates at specific places and times."" The findings also raise intriguing questions about the nature of protein aggregates, which are seen in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. The team are now working to better understand the biological functions of the aggregates, particularly in their roles as regulators of cell function. They have also started harnessing the temperature-sensing parts of proteins for biotechnological applications, like separating one type of molecule from another in response to a shift in temperature. ""By taking a careful, modern look at an old problem, we got surprising results that change the way we think not just about heat shock, but about how cells sense and respond to their environment at the molecular level,"" Drummond said. ""This is what's so rewarding about studying the biology of basic processes.""","Published: September 11, 2015"

Episodic migraine is defined as having less than 15 headaches per month. ""While more research is needed to confirm these initial findings, the possibility of discovering a new biomarker for migraine is exciting,"" said study author B. Lee Peterlin, DO, with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. For the study, 52 women with episodic migraine and 36 women who did not have any headaches underwent a neurologic exam, had their body mass index measured and gave blood samples. Women with migraine had an average of 5.6 headache days per month. The blood samples were tested for a group of lipids that participate in energy homeostasis and that help to regulate inflammation in the brain. The study found that the total levels of the lipids called ceramides were decreased in women with episodic migraine as compared to those women without any headache disorders. Women with migraine had approximately 6,000 nanograms per milliliter of total ceramides in their blood, compared to women without headache who had about 10,500 nanograms per milliliter. Every standard deviation increase in total ceramide levels was associated with over a 92-percent lower risk of having migraine. Additionally, and in contrast to the ceramides, two other types of lipids, called sphingomyelin, were associated with a 2.5 times greater risk of migraine with every standard deviation increase in their levels. The researchers also tested the blood of a random small sample of 14 of the participants for a panel of these lipids and were able to correctly identify those who had migraine or who were controls without headache based on these blood lipid levels. ""This study is a very important contribution to our understanding of the underpinnings of migraine and may have wide-ranging effects in diagnosing and treating migraine if the results are replicated in further studies,"" said Karl Ekbom, MD, PhD, with the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, who wrote an accompanying comment article. Ekbom noted there were limitations in the study. Only women were included, chronic migraine was not studied and an unusually high amount of participants had migraine with aura. He also noted that a comparison should be made in future studies with other types of headache, such as cluster headache. American Academy of Neurology Haughey NH et al.

Now, in proof-of-concept experiments with ""joysticks"" that measure force, a team of Johns Hopkins scientists report evidence that the slowdown likely arises from the brain's ""cost/benefit analysis,"" which gets skewed by the loss of dopamine in people with PD. In addition, their study with a small group of 20 patients with PD demonstrated that stimulation of the cortex of the brain using external electrodes corrected some of the distortion and temporarily improved some patients' motor symptoms. PD affects up to 1 million Americans. ""The loss of dopamine associated with Parkinson's disease makes the effort required to move the affected side of the body seem greater, so the brain is less willing to use that arm to complete tasks,"" says Reza Shadmehr, Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""Our study suggests that direct current stimulation can compensate somewhat for the loss of dopamine by decreasing the effort the brain has to put into getting its motor neurons to fire,"" adds Shadmehr, the senior author of a report on the research published online in The Journal of Neuroscience. According to the researchers, their experiments stemmed from the knowledge that dopamine, the chemical released throughout the cortex of the brain by specialized neurons, is known to make animals more likely to exert effort to achieve a reward. In Parkinson's, dopamine neurons generally die on one side of the brain, affecting the ability of the patient to exert effort with the opposite side of the body. In urgent situations as simple as preventing a ball from falling off a table, for example, people with PD can often still make rapid, intense movements with their affected arm, but it seems as though the brain's ""cost assessment"" for making everyday movements is abnormally high. To test this hypothesis, Shadmehr and his team first designed an experiment to measure how much force a patient's brain was willing to ""assign"" to each arm. In their first experiment, participants, all right-handed, included 15 healthy volunteers and 15 with PD, ages 50 to 75, who had had Parkinson's for two to 20 years and were receiving medication to control their symptoms, such as tremors, muscle rigidity and lack of balance. With their arms held in mobile supports above a table, participants were asked to grip the handles at the ends of the supports, which could measure the force applied to them. Participants then had to apply about 4 pounds of muscle force to the handles to move an electronic cursor on a computer screen to a target. They could use any combination of both arms to achieve the task. This was repeated 10 times in 16 different directions representing a full circle. When performing this task, healthy participants shared the effort between both arms: They split the 4 pounds of force between their two arms fairly equally and never applied more than 30 percent more force with one arm than with the other. By contrast, on average, patients with PD showed a twofold greater preference for their less affected arm, sometimes skewing their effort by as much as 70 percent toward the less affected arm. Shadmehr's team says the difference was not due to a lack of strength in the affected arm of the patients with PD, because the team also tested each arm's ability to apply force in every direction and found that the patients' strength was comparable to that of healthy individuals. What did stand out, the researchers say, was how direction-dependent the outcomes were. For example, when a patient was asked to move the cursor to the 3 o'clock position on the screen, she might entirely favor her left (unaffected) arm. However, when the patient was asked to move the cursor to the 12 o'clock position, she might share the effort equally between her two arms. In addition, the researchers noticed that patients avoided using their affected arm particularly in the directions in which they exhibited a greater amount of variability, or ""noise,"" when generating force. That is, the increased effort appeared associated with a poorer ability to control the generation of force. Guessing that the reduced ability to control force in patients with PD was related to decreased dopamine -- which makes it harder to ""recruit"" neurons for a particular task -- the researchers devised a brain stimulation experiment to further test their hypothesis. ""The greater the number of neurons firing together to complete a task, the less they each have to fire and the more controlled the resulting action is,"" says Shadmehr. ""In Parkinson's, the loss of dopamine might mean that neurons that control movement don't fire as easily, which means that a few neurons have to do the whole job and can't perform as well, generating noisier output. The brain seems to know this and avoids assigning effort in those directions where it has less control."" To overcome this problem, the team used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on a total of 25 patients, 10 for each of three tests, with some participating in more than one test. They reasoned that by increasing the electrical current within the neurons using mild stimulation through electrodes placed on the scalp, the cells would be closer to their firing threshold and would be easier for the brain to engage. In another experiment involving 10 patients, where neither the patients nor the clinicians evaluating them knew what kind of stimulation they received, the investigators found that one form of stimulation, known as cathodal tDCS, worked best and that the patients who got such stimulation were more willing to engage their affected arm than those who received no stimulation, or anodal stimulation. The researchers also saw a related decrease in the variability associated with these patients' movements. Importantly, they observed that the stimulation produced an average improvement of 25 percent in the motor symptoms of the patients, as quantified via the motor component of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), particularly improving rigidity on the affected side. Finally, the researchers tested the effectiveness of tDCS in 10 patients over a 10-day period. On the first three days, participants received no stimulation or fake stimulation; on days four through eight, they received cathodal stimulation; and on days nine and 10, no stimulation. Each day, they were given the arm movement test and the UPDRS. The results showed that improvement was real but temporary, in that it only occurred on those days on which cathodal tDCS was given. ""As far as we know so far,"" Shadmehr cautions, ""the effects of tDCS are very temporary, but that's not surprising since no new dopamine cells are being created, which is the root of the problem."" Nevertheless, he says, ""tDCS is a relatively simple, painless and inexpensive intervention that could be developed for home use, a device we are working on. It's possible,"" he adds, ""that the brain would get used to the stimulation -- just as it adjusts to medications -- and also become less responsive over time, but we are hopeful that continued stimulation might improve symptoms.""

The Canadian-developed rule is published in Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ). Head injury is a common reason for children to visit emergency departments, resulting in more than 20,000 visits in Canada and 470,000 in the United States each year. Although termed ""minor,"" these head injuries may have complications such as skull fractures and brain injury. Computed tomography (CT) scans, which are the most effective diagnostic tool, carry an increased risk of cancer, whereas skull radiography carries a very small risk of cancer, costs less and creates less discomfort for children. There is no consensus on how to treat children with head injury who do not meet the criteria for CT imaging but may still be at risk of complications. To fill this gap, researchers developed and tested a rule to help emergency department physicians identify children under age 2 who are at risk. This was a two-phase project. In the first phase, they included 811 patients, of whom 49 had skull fractures, to develop the decision tool. In the second phase, they confirmed the validity of the tool in a new group of 856 patients, of whom 44 had skull fractures. Using the decision tool, the researchers identified approximately 90% of skull fractures in children with minor head injuries. ""The 2 predictors identified through recursive partitioning for the development of the rule were parietal or occipital swelling or hematoma and age less than 2 months,"" writes Dr. Jocelyn Gravel, Department of Pediatrics, Centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine, Universit  de Montr al, Montr al, Quebec, with coauthors. ""Use of the rule would have decreased the overall number of skull radiographs by about 60% in our study population,"" they write. The authors contend that this clinical decision rule will have several outcomes, including better use of health care resources by avoiding unnecessary visits to emergency departments, improved care for children with head trauma, and improved ability of triage nurses to identify children at risk. However, further research is needed in a variety of settings to ensure consistency and proper use of the rule. ""The authors provide front-line clinicians with objective decision-making criteria, more helpful than 'observation versus CT,'"" write Dr. Peter Gill, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, and Dr. Terry Klassen, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, in a related commentary. ""But perhaps most important, the rule is simple: in children less than 2 years old with a minor head injury who do not meet the criteria for a CT scan, perform a skull radiograph if they are less than 2 months old or they have parietal or occipital swelling. If only all clinical decision rules could be this simple,"" they conclude. Canadian Medical Association Journal Masse B et al.

In a summary of the research, published online in the journal Psychopharmacology, the investigators say they have, for the first time, characterized the body s reaction to the first, tiniest  hits  of nicotine. The results, they say, should lay groundwork for future revelations about genetic or other biological factors that make people vulnerable to nicotine addiction.  From an addiction point of view, nicotine is a very unusual drug,  says addiction researcher Roland R. Griffiths, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  When you give people nicotine for the first time, most people don t like it. It s different from many other addictive drugs, for which most people say they enjoy the first experience and would try it again.   Our results suggest there are definitely some people who are nicotine avoiders and others who are nicotine choosers,  he says,  and there are probably genetic or metabolic vulnerabilities that make people fall into one group or the other.  Scientists, Griffiths notes, have struggled for decades to understand why, in the face of initial dislike, so many become addicted to cigarettes. Previous research, for example, has shown that a majority of never-smokers given a cigarette or dose of nicotine not only report disliking the effects, but later, when offered a nicotine -containing pill, gum or candy, or a placebo   a classic test of the  reinforcement  abilities of an addictive drug   they chose the placebo. Similarly, even in laboratory mice and rats, nicotine usually fails the reinforcement test, with animals choosing a placebo over nicotine. In a novel effort to get at the root of the puzzle, Griffiths and his team set out to explore the conditions under which nicotine s reinforcement properties first take hold in never-smokers. Rather than use a dose of nicotine similar to that in a cigarette or in a nicotine patch or gum   doses that can overwhelm first-time users   his team turned to doses around 10 times lower, barely above what is needed for someone to notice nicotine s effects, such as relaxation, jitters, better focus, energy or changes in mood. Then the researchers designed a double-blind study in which volunteers wouldn t know whether they were getting nicotine or a placebo.  We attempted to develop conditions in which people could learn to become familiar with the subtle mood-altering effects of very low doses of nicotine, with the goal of uncovering the reinforcing effects of nicotine,  he says. For the study, Griffiths and his team recruited 18 healthy men and women who had never smoked   or only ever smoked a handful of cigarettes   and gave each of them two identical-looking pills labeled A and B each day for several weeks. The volunteers were told the pills might contain any of a number of substances, ranging from caffeine or sugar, to ginseng, chamomile, theobromine, kava or nicotine.  In fact, each day, each volunteer was given one very-low-dose nicotine pill, starting at 1.5 milligrams of nicotine per 70 kilograms of body weight, and one placebo, with at least two hours between the pills. The order of the pills was mixed across days. Volunteers were asked to report their symptoms   relaxation, changes in energy levels, concentration, light-headedness, drowsiness and jitters   after each pill. Then, on at least 10 successive days, they were given the same pills again, this time unlabeled, and asked to identify which pill was A and which was B. If the volunteer was unable to reliably distinguish between mystery pill A and mystery pill B, the dose of nicotine was increased slightly. Once each volunteer could reliably distinguish between pill A and B, they were given a choice of taking either pill and asked to explain their decision. Some people thought the placebo contained a drug  one that made them drowsy, for instance   so they weren t necessarily choosing one they thought didn t cause symptoms. Nine of the 18 participants reliably chose the nicotine pill, citing improved concentration, alertness, stimulation, energy and better mood. The other half, however, chose the placebo, often explaining that the nicotine pill   although they didn t know it contained nicotine   made them feel light-headed, dizzy or sick. Griffiths believes this is the first study to conclusively show that nicotine can pass the reinforcement test in never-users, and he expects it will inform future studies of  avoiders  and  choosers.  Ultimately, he says,  I hope our findings will point the way toward future interventions that prevent or treat nicotine addiction, a topic of increasing importance in light of the expanding marketing of electronic nicotine delivery devices   e-cigarettes   to youthful nicotine nonusers.

Called nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), it is the only one of the 10 viral proteins secreted by infected cells to circulate freely in the bloodstream. In experiments conducted on human lung endothelial cells and in mice, the researchers showed that NS1 caused permeability of the endothelium, which lines the walls of blood and lymph vessels. They found that the protein itself, separate from the dengue virus, can cause blood vessels to leak fluid. Remarkably, the researchers also found that blocking this protein in mice protected them from the lethal effects of dengue virus infection, an important finding given that an effective vaccine against dengue has remained elusive, partly because there are four serotypes of the virus that cause disease.  This is a missing piece in the puzzle of the pathogenesis of dengue,  said Harris, senior author of the study.  The role of NS1 itself had been overlooked in severe forms of dengue disease, but we now know that it is an important player. Our findings show that NS1 could be a prime target for drugs, and that it should be considered in vaccine development.  No vaccine, no treatment Every year, about 390 million people are infected with dengue virus, which is primarily spread by Aedes mosquitoes, with tropical climates hit hardest. Because there is no treatment or vaccine for dengue, the main method of controlling the disease has focused on reducing mosquito breeding sites and supportive care, such as fluid replacement, for patients with severe dengue. About one in four people infected go on to develop symptoms ranging from fever and headaches to severe muscle and joint pain, earning dengue the nickname  breakbone fever.  Most worrisome are the cases that develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome caused by the loss of fluids from blood vessels. According to estimates from the World Health Organization, roughly a half-million cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occur annually, killing 22,000 people.  What is agonizing is that you don t know from the outset of an infection who will die,  said Harris.  Once the fluid loss begins, it can become fatal in just one to two days.  The people at greatest risk for dengue shock are those who have had a prior infection. An initial infection with one of the four serotypes of dengue virus can impart long-term immunity for that specific virus type, but only temporary immunity against the rest. Once the short-term immunity to the other three serotypes wears off, the survivor is at greater risk for more severe disease from a subsequent infection. New target for drugs and vaccines The dominant hypothesis to explain this has been that the antibodies from the first infection react with the new serotype in a way that worsens the damage. In this antibody-dependent enhancement, the antibodies inadvertently increase the virus s ability to infect immune cells, leading to more serious symptoms.  The interaction with the antibodies might be happening, but it never fully explained all cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever,  said study lead author P. Robert Beatty, an assistant research scientist at UC Berkeley s School of Public Health.  The toxicity of NS1 makes more sense than just having an over-reactive immune response. NS1 is a more direct pathway toward disease. It is a trigger that causes vessels to become permeable to fluid, causing the vessels to leak plasma.  NS1 is produced by all serotypes of dengue virus. The researchers homed in on this viral protein after they noticed that the pathogenic effects of dengue virus infection were blocked in mice that had generated antibodies to NS1. The team found that mice injected with NS1 alone, without the virus present, developed symptoms of dengue disease that included a cascade of inflammatory cytokines, vascular leakage and fluid loss. If the researchers added a sublethal dose of dengue virus type 2, the resulting infection was fatal. On the other hand, immunization of mice with recombinant NS1 from each of the four serotypes protected mice against vascular leak and the lethal effects of dengue virus type 2.  What s exciting to me is that if we can make antibodies against this toxin and include them in a vaccine, we could potentially prevent a dengue infection from progressing to the more severe symptoms,  said Beatty.  The findings open up new intervention strategies where few now exist. ","Published: September 10, 2015"

Now researchers at Imperial College London led by Dr Marina Kuimova and Professor Ramon Vilar are unravelling the mysteries of these four-stranded DNA structures. They have created a fluorescent molecule that can reveal the presence of these structures in living cells. This could be a game changer to accelerate research into these DNA structures.The team used the glowing molecule to target quadruplex DNA inside human bone cancer cells grown in the laboratory. Together with colleagues from Kings College London, they studied the interactions between the two in real time, using powerful microscopes.  Quadruplexes can form when a strand of DNA rich in guanines   one of the four building blocks in DNA - folds over onto itself. Several distinct quadruplex structures have been found in the human genome but their exact role remains unclear. Recent studies have shown they are particularly prevalent in regions nearby oncogenes   genes that have the potential to cause cancer. There is mounting evidence that quadruplexes are involved in switching genes on and off because of where they are usually positioned within the genome, says Professor Vilar, from Imperial's Department of Chemistry. If this can be proved, it would make quadruplexes an extremely important target for treating diseases such as cancer. But to understand what role they play, we need to be able to study them in living cells. Our new fluorescent molecule allows us to do this by directly monitoring the behaviour of quadruplexes inside living cells in real time. The team designed the fluorescent molecule to glow more intensely when attached to DNA. Using powerful microscopes they discovered that they could distinguish between the molecules binding to the more common double helical DNA and quadruplex DNA because it glowed for much longer when bound to quadruplexes. Hunt For New Compounds The researchers were also able to visualise the fluorescent molecule being displaced from quadruplex DNA by another molecule known to be a very good quadruplex binder. This suggests that the Imperial molecule could be used to hunt for new compounds that can bind to quadruplexes. Co-author Arun Shivalingam, who worked on the study during his PhD at Imperial, says:  Until now, to image quadruplexes in cells researchers have had to hold the cells in place using chemical fixation. However, this kills them and brings into question whether the molecule really interacts with quadruplexes in a dynamic environment.  Professor Vilar adds:  We ve shown that our molecule could be potentially used to verify in live cells and in real time whether potential quadruplex DNA binders are hitting their target. This could be a game changer to accelerate research into these DNA structures. ","Published: September 10, 2015"

Down. Less than normal. That s what the word depression means, and what people with depression often feel like. But sometimes, depression can mean too much of something   as new research shows. The discovery, about a protein called fibroblast growth factor 9 or FGF9, goes against previous findings that depressed brains often have less of key components than non-depressed brains. In this case, people with major depression had 32 percent more of FGF9 in a key part of their brain than people without the condition. In rats, raising FGF9 levels artificially led to depression-like behavior changes, and repeated social stress caused brain FGF9 levels to rise. Taken together, the findings provide more evidence that depression is a physical illness. If FGF9 or its effects prove to be a good target for drugs, the finding could eventually help lead to better medications for the mental health condition that affects millions of Americans. FGF9 s role was discovered by a team from the University of Michigan Medical School and the Pritzker Neuropsychiatric Disorders Research Consortium. They made the discoveries through years of detailed comparisons of brain tissue donated by people with and without depression, and multiple studies in rats. Because drugs that block excess production of something in the body generally cause fewer side effects than drugs aimed at increasing something, the team says their findings could hold promise for the development of a new class of antidepressants.  Fixing depression is not easy, because it s a disorder at the level of the circuits that connect brain cells, and many regions of the brain are involved,  says Elyse Aurbach, the neuroscience doctoral student who is the paper s co-first author.  Still, this is the first time FGF9 has been identified as related to depression, and found to be active in a critical area of the brain for the disorder. We and others need to study it further to determine what is going on. It s very exciting.  Human differences: A surprising finding Aurbach and her mentor Huda Akil, Ph.D., worked with colleagues at the U-M Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute and several other universities to make the discovery.  Key to their work was the highly regarded brain bank at the University of California, Irvine, supported by the Pritzker Consortium. They focus on fibroblast growth factors, molecules involved in cell growth and maintenance in the brain, and in other areas of the body. They ve studied another FGF molecule, called FGF2, in the brain for years, trying to figure out why it s lower in people and animals with depression and other mental health disorders. They ve even shown that giving FGF2 injections can calm anxious rats. The team was surprised when FGF9 levels were higher in the brains of people who had had depression compared to those who had not. The increased levels held up even after they accounted for differences in the ways the individuals lived, and died, before their brain tissue was preserved for research. They made the finding using post-mortem brain samples from the Pritzker collection -- 36 depressed and 56 non-depressed brains in all. Through three different kinds of microarray gene expression studies and a confirming test called quantitative PCR, they looked at all the genetic activity that was going on when these brain donors died, specifically in the area of the brain called the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a crucial area of the brain for memory, learning and stress control. It has been found to be smaller in people with depression, and this is thought to be the result of chronic stress that affects the health of brain cells in that region. Each experiment showed higher FGF9 levels in the depressed brains. What s more, the levels of several other fibroblast growth factors were down when FGF9 was up, suggesting that the entire system for regulating cell growth and development in the brains of depressed people was altered. Rodent studies reveal FGF9 function Intrigued by the human results, the team decided to explore FGF9 s role further through experiments with rats. This allowed them to do something they can t do in humans: try to determine if FGF9 rises in response to something, such as stress, or if levels are naturally higher and predispose someone to depression. First, they exposed rats to repeated social stress over a week and a half, and looked at the levels of FGF9 in various regions of the brain s hippocampus. Not only did the levels rise, but the rats got more socially withdrawn and less likely to maintain a healthy weight. Next, they looked at what happens if FGF9 is injected into the brain   specifically, the ventricle, or open space between the brain s two sides. Other rats received a placebo. The rats that got the FGF9 acted more anxious, and moved around less   and these depression-like changes persisted with repeated injections. Lastly, the group created a virus that interfered with FGF9 production through a process called RNA interference. They injected it, or a comparison virus that didn t block FGF9 production, into rats  brains   in a specific area of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus. The active virus caused levels of FGF9 to drop about 30 percent, while other FGF molecule levels stayed the same. And the rats showed less anxiety.  We call this approach  reverse translation ,  says Akil, who is the Gardner Quarton Professor of Neurosciences, a professor of psychiatry and co-director of MBNI.  We start by careful, broad scale analyses in the human brain to discover new molecular players that might play a role in triggering or maintaining the depression. We then follow them up in rodent studies to understand the role of these molecules and determine whether we can target them for new treatments . Next steps Aurbach, Akil and their colleagues are already performing more experiments to determine why FGF9 production rises, as well as to study it in other brain regions and to see how it affects communication among brain cells. A patent application has been filed and is being managed by the Pritzker Consortium. They hope their work will lead to a search for medications to affect FGF9 levels, but caution that the molecule is important in the lungs and blood vessels, too.","Published: September 10, 2015"

Her symptoms screamed that she was suffering from encephalitis, an infection of the brain, but a series of tests and drugs   for tuberculosis, bacterial and fungal infections, even Toxoplasmosis   could neither identify the cause of infection nor do anything to resuscitate her. She died 16 days later, her illness still a mystery to her clinicians. Sadly, this outcome is all too common in cases of brain infection, which go unsolved six times out of 10 in California, according to a 2006 UC San Francisco study. Biochemist Joe DeRisi, PhD and neurologist Michael Wilson, MD, of UCSF want to change that statistic, and they think they have the tools to do it. When the researchers learned of last summer s case of mystery encephalitis, they turned to cutting-edge genomic tools to track down the cause of the woman s disease. They used rapid next-generation genomic sequencing to search the patient s spinal fluid for non-human DNA, then compared what they found against databases of genes of every known invasive microorganism or virus. This  metagenomic  approach rapidly found a match: a common soil-dwelling amoeba called Balamuthia mandrillaris, as the researchers reported last month. The researchers and their colleagues have recently set up a new Center for Next-Gen Precision Medicine Diagnostics to help hospitals make genome-based screens for the root causes of encephalitis part of their standard of care. The technology could save money as well as lives. Over her two-week hospitalization, care for last summer s Balamuthia victim cost more than $100,000. The metagenomic screen, by comparison, costs a mere $2,000   and typically takes two days. One of the center s first priorities will be a study to determine when in the course of an encephalitis patient s care the technique would have the greatest clinical impact. Researchers will comb through databases of encephalitis cases to identify when cheap, existing treatments like a $100 blood draw are effective at diagnosing a patient s disease and when it s time for clinicians to turn to the center s big genomic guns.  We all agree these metagenomic screens are happening too late,  said UC Berkeley health economist Brent Fulton, PhD, MBA, part of the center s team who is leading the study.  When UCSF gets the call, doctors have already tried everything under the sun and it s a bad situation.  But how early should the test be done? It s still an open question, according to Fulton.  A $2,000 test is nothing to sneeze at if it turns out to not change the usual course of care,  he explained.  But balanced against a multi-week, half-million dollar hospitalization, it s nothing.  Through the new center, DeRisi hopes to make such screening a hospital s go-to test for mystery brain infections rather than a last resort. Currently, doctors need to track down DeRisi and his peers directly to request help, he said.  We need to make this into an actual clinical diagnostic so a doctor who doesn't know my phone number can just order up this test. ","Published: September 10, 2015"

These computational patterns are predictive, and researchers can test them with further experiments.""This new tool unlocks the insight contained in big data, the world's biomedical research output, to help understand immunological mechanisms and diseases,"" said Stuart Sealfon, MD, Chairman and Glickenhaus Professor, Department of Neurology, Mount Sinai Health System and co-senior author of the publication. ""The goal of 'ImmuNet' is to accelerate the understanding of immune pathways and genes, ultimately leading to the development of improved treatment for diseases with an immunological component."" ImmuNet enables immunology researchers without special computational training to use the statistical techniques of Bayesian data integration and machine learning algorithms to ""interrogate"" this huge compendium of public data. Bayesian analysis is able to detect relevant information in a sea of often conflicting data obtained from diverse experiments. This form of analysis selects only the datasets that provide new insight about a pathway of interest while excluding datasets that are not relevant to the targeted pathway. A goal of the online tool is to advance the understanding of the immune system, the network of cells and organs that protects the body against infections and cancer. While the immunity protects against infection, immune cells may also target the body's own cells to cause inflammation as part of many diseases where the mechanisms are not yet known. ""We expect the applicability of ImmuNet to wide ranging areas of immunology will grow with the incorporation of continually increasing public big data,"" said Olga Troyanskaya, PhD, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Lewis-Sigler Institute of Integrative Genomics, Princeton University and Deputy Director of Genomics, Simons Center for Data Analysis, co-senior author of the publication.

The plan also paves the way for new diseases to be taken up in DNDi's portfolio. As part of its updated Business Plan for the period 2015-2023, DNDi remains committed to developing treatments for African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease as well as filarial diseases and paediatric HIV. Having recently transferred its malaria activities to the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), DNDi will soon be launching new research and development (R&D) projects for hepatitis C and mycetoma, two very different diseases that share, with other important global health issues such as anti-microbial resistance, one key challenge: the existing system of biomedical innovation has failed to deliver safe, effective, quality products that are affordable to poor populations. ""New threats are emerging at breakneck speed in today's rapidly changing global health R&D landscape"", said Dr Bernard P coul, Executive Director of DNDi. ""DNDi will remain focused on reaching our treatment targets for the most neglected diseases, but we are now in a position to apply new R&D models, where patient needs drive drug development over profits, and where prices of drugs are delinked from the cost of their development,"" he added. The Business Plan 2015-2023 was elaborated through a 24-month process and in-depth consultation with DNDi's founding partners, governments, key stakeholders, and experts in global health research. It was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2015. The new plan emphasizes DNDi's commitment to addressing the needs of neglected patients, while allowing for more flexibility to extend the scope of diseases to address current and future unmet and/or urgent patient needs as they arise. A range of operating and support models has been designed to ensure DNDi's engagement is tailored and appropriate to the need. For example, the high-cost of a new generation of drugs for hepatitis C has become one of the world's most pressing and high-profile public health challenges, leaving millions of patients behind. To develop an affordable public health tool for hepatitis C, DNDi will conduct clinical trials for combinations consisting of recently approved drugs and clinical-stage compounds in middle-income countries. For mycetoma, DNDi will test a promising drug candidate for this devastating illness for which there has been virtually no R&D - leaving patients to suffer with toxic and ineffective drugs. To help address the global threat posed by anti-microbial resistance, DNDi will create an internal task force, in collaboration with WHO, to assess the potential of an incubator to house a new initiative focused on developing antibiotics. DNDi will continue developing its pipeline of over 30 projects for the most neglected diseases. By its 20th anniversary in 2023, DNDi aims to deliver 16 to 18 new treatments with an estimated total budget of EUR 650 million. Importantly, DNDi will use its own experience to forcefully advocate for a global R&D framework that guarantees both innovation and equitable patient access to health technologies. ""The Ebola crisis showed the world the need for highly effective collaborations and timely response,"" said Professor Marcel Tanner, Chair of the Board of Directors, DNDi. ""As the organization matures, DNDi will continue to learn, innovate, and adapt its operational models to guarantee that R&D capacity is built where needed while continuously identifying and addressing neglected patients' needs through the best science.""","Published: September 10, 2015"

3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-achilles-heel-of-hiv-211471,The Achilles  Heel of HIV Researchers at the University of Bonn show how our body detects viruses and how HIV tries to mask itself  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at the University of Bonn have discovered how cells in the body can detect the genetic material of so-called retroviruses. The pathogen of the immunodeficiency disease AIDS, the HI-1 virus, also belongs to this group. At the same time, the HI virus appears to circumvent this important defense mechanism.  The first line of defense of the immune system against pathogens is innate immunity. It is based on specialized sensor proteins, the receptors. These receptors detect foreign structures, for example, cell wall components of bacteria or also the genetic material of viruses. A cellular molecule known as cGAS acts as a genetic material sensor. When cGAS detects viral DNA, the sensor immediately sounds the alarm. A cascade begins during which the immune system is activated and the cell and its neighbors arm themselves against the viral infection. Scientists at the University of Bonn Hospital have played major roles in earlier works on the exact description of this cascade. The DNA of many viruses is double-stranded: It consists of two threads wound around each other like two cables twisted together. To date, it has been thought that cGAS can only identify such double-stranded DNA. By contrast, the genetic material of retroviruses such as HIV-1 consists of RNA. RNA is closely related to DNA, however it is always single-stranded in retroviruses. If retroviruses multiply in human cells, the RNA is ""transcribed"" into DNA. But this is then also single-stranded. It was an equally large surprise to discover that cGAS is also activated by the HI virus 1. Twisted DNA Various working groups have recently provided the first step towards an explanation: They were able to show that single-stranded DNA can form what are known as ""hairpin"" structures   similar to how a single cable can twist around itself so that it resembles two cables twisted around each other. DNA structures of this type thus form short double strands and these are detected by the cGAS sensor. ""The hairpin structures which can form in the case of HIV-1 are actually too short to be detected by cGAS,"" says Dr. Martin Schlee. The researcher from the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Bonn Hospital is the senior author of the study. Together with cooperative partners from Bonn, Munich and Erlangen, his working group was now able to show why it nonetheless worked: in addition to the short, double-stranded piece, cGAS also detects special building blocks in the non-twisted, single-stranded piece, known as guanosines. As a result, the cellular response is significantly increased. ""If we remove the guanosines from these structures, the cell can no longer react to the single-stranded DNA,"" explains lead author Anna-Maria Herzner. ""By contrast, if we add in additional guanosines, cells react more strongly."" How HIV-1 viruses circumvent the immune system Interestingly, the DNA which develops during the HIV-1 infection is particularly lacking guanosines. ""HIV-1 viruses appear to have been selected by the immune system to eliminate guanosines from their DNA,"" says Prof. Dr. Gunther Hartmann, Director of the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology as well as spokesperson of the ImmunoSensation excellence cluster. ""They may thus be able to partially avoid discovery by the cell."" A new work from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston shows that this DNA detection is actually of major clinical significance. There are people infected with HIV-1 who suppress the virus so well that it can no longer be detected. Certain immune cells of these so-called ""elite controllers"" accumulate so much HI virus DNA that they can nonetheless be detected   possibly via the guanosines that still remain. They trigger such a strong immune response that the virus is permanently suppressed. Thus the HIV-1 genetic material appears to also be detected in these immune cells via the mechanism discovered by Dr. Martin Schlee and colleagues.","Published: September 10, 2015"

The results are being published in Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science (IOVS), a prominent journal in the field of ophthalmic and vision research. The publication is entitled  Inhibition of non-infectious uveitis using intravenous administration of collagen-II specific Type 1 regulatory (Col-Treg) T cells.  The published study evaluated the therapeutic potential of Col-Treg immunotherapy for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis using in vitro and in vivo assays. Specifically, in vivo administration of Col-Treg in the model of autoimmune uveitis significantly inhibited clinical symptoms, retinal tissue lesions as well as ocular proinflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, authors dissected the mechanism of action of Col-Treg and showed that cells are using several distinct immune-regulatory pathways to dampen inflammation. The publication will be available in October. Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science (IOVS) is an official journal of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), an international organization dedicated to encouraging and assisting research, training, publication, and the dissemination of knowledge in the areas of vision and ophthalmology. Activity and tolerance data for Col-Treg were presented at the 2015 ARVO Annual Meeting, May 3-7, 2015, in Denver, Colorado, US. Col-Treg is a personalized T cell immunotherapy product, based on the properties of autologous collagen II-specific regulatory T lymphocytes. In addition, Col-Treg has shown very promising preclinical efficacy and tolerability data in models of inflammatory arthritis (Arthritis Res Ther. 2014 May 22;16(3):R115, Asgnali et all., Type 1 regulatory T cells specific for collagen type II as an efficient cell-based therapy in arthritis).  Following the previous demonstration of Col-Treg preclinical efficacy in models of inflammatory arthritis, these results published in IOVS demonstrate the therapeutic potential of Col-Treg in non-infectious uveitis and will support its ongoing clinical development,  said Arnaud Foussat, Chief Scientific Officer of TxCell.  The support TxCell has seen from the ophthalmologic community provides additional confirmation of the potential of, and requirement for, Col-Treg as a much needed new potential treatment for autoimmune uveitis, a rare and debilitating eye disease with very limited therapeutic options. There are approximately 30,000 autoimmune uveitis patients per year that are refractory to approved steroids treatments in the US and EU alone and this is a clear unmet medical need.  Col-Treg has been classified as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product by the European Medicine Agency (EMA). Col-Treg has also received an Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of non-infectious (autoimmune) uveitis from the EMA in December 2014. A first-in-man clinical study with Col-Treg for severe autoimmune uveitis patients that become refractory to steroid compounds, is scheduled to start in 2016.","Published: September 10, 2015"

From now on, the blood samples can also be used to predict the criminal s age. This is also the case for deceased individuals: when traditional methods do not lead to identification, the forensic examiners can use blood or teeth samples for age estimation.  Human tissues and organs change as we grow older. This aging process is regulated by our DNA. The KU Leuven researchers are the first to have successfully used this aging process, embedded in our DNA, to predict individuals  age.  Professor Bram Bekaert from the KU Leuven Forensic Biomedical Sciences Unit explains:  The behaviour of our organs and tissues depends on which of our genes are activated. As we grow older, some genes are switched on, while others are switched off. This process is partly regulated by methylation, whereby methyl groups are added to our DNA. In specific locations, genes with high methylation levels are deactivated.  Bekaert and his colleagues were able to predict individuals  age on the basis of a set of four age-associated DNA methylation markers. The methylation levels of these markers can be used for highly accurate age predictions. The researchers were able to determine individuals  age with a margin of error of 3.75 years for blood samples and 4.86 years for teeth. The new technique is potentially useful in the context of police investigations because it can help determine the age of criminals or unidentified bodies, which in turn can lead to identification.","Published: September 10, 2015"

According to the 2009 website of the now defunct government Forensic Science Service textile fibre examination is the  second most utilised evidence type after body fluids and DNA, often providing compelling evidence in a variety of cases .  It is one of the most researched and respected of all evidence types amongst the global forensic science community. So why is it that the use of fibres as tool in forensic investigations has declined so much that I have had to close our specialist forensic fibre laboratory, Contact Traces?   A fibre examination can provide information to an investigation at any stage. In the investigative stage fibres can provide valuable information such as the type of clothing likely to be worn by a suspect, whether a victim has been smothered, whether a weapon is the murder weapon, the type of vehicle used to transport a body or the textile environment where bombs are being manufactured. The investigative leads provided have the potential to steer an investigation into lines of enquiry that would not otherwise have been discovered by DNA, fingerprints of footwear marks. In the evidential stage, fibre evidence provides links between surfaces. The value of these links largely depends on the context of the case. In a rape case where the issue is one of consent, the suspect s and victim s accounts may differ   for example, one party may state that sexual activity occurred in the bedroom and was consensual, the other party may say the activity occurred in an alleyway and was rape. DNA won t help in these situations, whereas the presence or absence of fibres from the bedclothes on the victim s clothing could be used to support the account of one party over another. There is clearly more to securing convictions than DNA, fingerprints or footwear marks. In cases where there is no clothing available, fibre populations can be used to link vehicles, bombs and suspects to the scene or each other. IEDs were linked to the same bomb-maker through fibres found on the tape used to bind each device, the laboratory s view was that it was likely that the fibres arose from the same prayer mat used by the bomb maker as he moved from one location to another.","Published: September 10, 2015"

Over the last several years, MorphoSys has built one of the broadest and most differentiated biopharmaceutical pipelines in the biotechnology sector. With the first partnered programs approaching the market and the Company's proprietary portfolio gaining momentum, MorphoSys intends to commit additional resources to advance its programs through approval-enabling studies and become a commercial organization. Dr. Simon Moroney, Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys AG commented: ""MorphoSys has successfully transitioned from a technology provider to a drug development organization. With a robust set of proprietary drug candidates, now is the time to scale our investment to ensure that we capture the full value of our portfolio. We aspire to become a fully-integrated and commercial biopharmaceutical organization with our own products on the market. Our lead cancer compound MOR208, for which we have a comprehensive development plan, will be at the forefront of this process."" MorphoSys's proprietary activities are currently focused on three clinical candidates: the hemato-oncology programs MOR208 and MOR202, for which MorphoSys holds worldwide commercial rights, and the prostate cancer program MOR209/ES414, which is being co-developed with Emergent BioSolutions. MorphoSys is also planning to commence clinical studies of MOR106 and MOR107 in inflammatory and fibrotic indications respectively in 2016. MOR208 - addressing current treatment challenges in leukemia and lymphomaMOR208 is an Fc-enhanced antibody targeting CD19, a more widely and earlier expressed target across multiple lymphomas and leukemias than CD20, the therapeutic target of the most commonly used lymphoma and leukemia treatments. By targeting CD19 and being Fc-enhanced, MOR208 could become an important and attractive alternative to multiple current treatment options for some of the sickest cancer patients. Based on promising results presented at the 2015 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2015), MorphoSys will commence two phase 2 trials of MOR208 in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the near future. In addition, MorphoSys aims to start a pivotal study of MOR208 in DLBCL in 2017. In DLBCL, MOR208 will be tested in combination with lenalidomide in up to 80 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. The trial will be designed as an open label, single arm study with the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) and multiple secondary endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP). The CLL study will combine MOR208 with idelalisib and shall include 120 patients previously treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy. This study will also be designed as an open label, single arm trial with the primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) and multiple secondary endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP). In addition, MorphoSys aims to start a pivotal phase 3 trial in DLBCL in 2017, which will test MOR208 plus bendamustine in a head-to-head setting against the combination of rituximab and bendamustine in approximately 320 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, who are ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). MOR208 is also being studied in two investigator-initiated trials (IIT). The first is an ongoing phase 2 trial in CLL, which is being conducted by MorphoSys's academic partner Dr. John Byrd, Director, Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine at Ohio State University and Dr. Jennifer Woyach as co-investigator. This study is exploring a combination of MOR208 and lenalidomide in treatment-na ve, older CLL patients, and relapsed/refractory CLL patients. The second IIT is a pediatric study in ALL to be conducted in collaboration with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, USA. This IIT will test MOR208 in combination with NK-cell transplantation. Patient recruitment for this study is anticipated to start in the first half of 2016. Based on the positive clinical results of MOR208 in NHL which were presented at ASCO 2015, the Company is also evaluating the possibility of commencing other studies in B cell malignancies. ""MOR208 is an innovative, Fc-enhanced antibody which has shown great promise in the clinic. It is one of a number of important assets for MorphoSys which we believe can bring significant benefit to patients in need,"" commented Dr. Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys AG. ""Our goal is to establish MOR208 as a new backbone therapy and as an ideal combination agent for several other drugs used in a broad range of lymphomas and leukemias. Encouraged by the promising clinical data generated so far with MOR208 and other drug candidates, we plan to broaden our development activities."" The significantly expanded breadth of the planned and ongoing studies of MOR208 including the anticipated pivotal study in DLBCL is likely to result in significantly higher proprietary R&D expenditure in 2016 and thereafter as compared to previous years. MorphoSys will provide its financial guidance for next year in early 2016. MOR202 - generating promising data in multiple myelomaMOR202 targets CD38, which is one of the most strongly and uniformly expressed antigens on the surface of malignant plasma cells. Because of this expression pattern, anti-CD38 antibodies are expected to have clinical utility as a new therapeutic approach to multiple myeloma treatment. Initial promising efficacy data for MOR202 was presented at ASCO 2015. A phase 1/2a study of MOR202 in combination with dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients is nearing completion. Additional cohorts in which patients receive MOR202 up to 16 mg/kg weekly in combination with pomalidomide or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone have also commenced. Clinical data from those cohorts will be presented at an upcoming medical conference. MOR209/ES414 - co-development program with Emergent BiosolutionsMOR209/ES414 is a bi-specific anti-PSMA/anti-CD3 antibody being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer. This immunotherapeutic protein activates the patients' T-cell immunity specifically against prostate cancer cells expressing Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), an antigen commonly over-expressed in this tumor. A phase 1 study of MOR209/ES414 is ongoing, and will be conducted in two stages. The primary objective of stage 1 of the study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MOR209/ES414 administered to patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The primary objective of stage 2 of the study is to evaluate the clinical activity of MOR209/ES414 in patients who have received prior chemotherapy as well as those who are chemotherapy-na ve. The study will enroll up to 130 patients and run through 2018. First clinical data are expected in 2016. Continued investment in technology leadership aimed at producing additional clinical development programsIn addition to MorphoSys's ongoing clinical studies, the Company is continuing to progress its earlier programs including: i) the immuno-oncology focused collaborations with Merck Serono and Immatics, ii) alliances with Heptares and G7 Therapeutics to support development of a portfolio of therapeutic programs targeting unique G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other transmembrane proteins, iii) a co-development alliance with Galapagos, which, in MOR106, has produced a first pre-clinical candidate in inflammatory diseases, iv) further development of the lanthipeptide portfolio including MOR107 in fibrotic diseases, and v) a growing target sourcing network with leading academic organizations such as Temple University in Philadelphia, USA. As a result of these efforts, MorphoSys expects to further expand its portfolio of discovery programs and to proceed with at least two of these, namely MOR106 in inflammation and MOR107 in fibrosis, into clinical development in 2016. Dr. Marlies Sproll, Chief Scientific Officer of MorphoSys AG added: ""MorphoSys has established a broad network of relationships with big pharma, biopharma companies of various sizes and academia that could generate a stream of attractive product opportunities. We intend to expand this network even further. The Company's technology platforms continue to play an important role in developing the pipeline and hence we are committed to investing in technology development both through internal efforts and by seeking access to technology innovations from the outside. The impact of Ylanthia, the latest antibody library of MorphoSys, keeps increasing with 17 programs in MorphoSys's pipeline now based on this platform. In addition, MorphoSys has established and continues to refine platforms to generate alternative biomolecular formats including bi-specific antibodies and constrained therapeutic peptides.""","Published: September 10, 2015"

Low concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) activate certain proteins that, rather than acting as a toxin, may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. As a result there is a lot of interest in developing molecules capable of controlled release of CO to study its effects in the body and exploit potential therapeutic applications. A team of researchers at Tokyo Institute of Technology has now controlled the release of CO from a composite of biocompatible ferritin cage and manganese carbonyl complexes (MnCO) inside cells using visible light, reporting,  This represents the first example of a photoactive CO-releasing molecule conjugated to a protein.  In 2002 Motterlini and colleagues demonstrated that light could trigger carbon monoxide release from manganese carbonyl molecules - Mn2(CO)10. However, despite active research on the carbon-monoxide-releasing attributes of MnCO, there have been few reports of light-regulated CO release inside cells. Kenta Fujita, Yuya Tanaka, Satoshi Abe, and Takafumi Ueno based their studies on ferritin - an iron storage protein that is found in almost all living organisms. By modifying the peptide structure of the ferritin they could encourage the retention of over 40 MnCO moieties. They demonstrate the release of CO in response to visible light in cellular assays, as well as an activation of a nuclear factor  B, which is associated with the therapeutic effects of CO, under a presence of tumour necrosis factor  . In addition they identify the duration of irradiation that optimizes activation of the nuclear factor  B. They conclude in their report that protein cages have great potential for use as photoactive CO-releasing molecule carriers, adding,  Moreover, the strategy used here can be extended to other protein assemblies with various structures and sizes.  Background CO, CORMs and CORM carriersWhile in excess CO shows toxicity, regulated quantities have beneficial effects as an anti-inflammatory, vascular dilation, and redox control in living organisms. CO is generated naturally in living organisms during the degradation of heme, which is an iron-containing compound found in a range of proteins including haemoglobin, the red pigment that gives blood its colour. Since Motterlini s work on Mn2(CO)10, there has been a lot of work on developing light-triggered CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) based on manganese, iron, ruthenium, and rhenium-carbonyl complexes. Researchers have also investigated carrier systems to make these CORMs more stable in an aqueous solution. However the work by Ueno and colleagues reported here is the first demonstration of regulated CO release with visible light irradiation from a biocompatible protein inside living cells. FerritinFerritin is a cage-like protein consisting of 24 self-assembled polypeptide units. It is found in living organisms and stores iron. Cellular uptake of ferritin has already been demonstrated. The researchers introduced a binding site of MnCO into the ferritin by replacing Arg with Cys at position of 52 in the polypeptide sequences of ferritin. This resulted in high retention of MnCO. In contrast unmodified ferritin does not retain MnCO. Using confocal microscopy, the researchers demonstrated that CO was released from the composite of ferritin and MnCO by visible light irradiation in living cells. Therapeutic activityNuclear factor  B (NF- B) regulates a variety of genes associated with inflammation. It has been suggested that CO is related to an activation of NF- B to induce anti-inflammatory response. However, investigating these effects requires a means of controlled CO release inside cells, which has so far been a challenge. The researchers monitored the activation of NF- B in HEK293/kB-Fluc cells using a luciferase reporter assay system. They observed NF- B activation in living cells that had been treated with the composite of ferritin and MnCO, while the NF- B was not activated in Mn2(CO)10-treated cells. It is demonstrated that the MnCO is retained in the ferritin for functionalizing in living cells. The presence of tumor necrosis factor   is also necessary for NF- B activation and ongoing work will look into the relationship between CO release properties of photoactive CO-releasing ferritin and tumor necrosis factor.","Published: September 10, 2015"

Or do they? A new Duke study finds that adolescents ages 10 to 16 can be more analytical in their economic choices than many slightly older young adults. Published in the October-December issue of Cognitive Development, the study suggests not only that society should give adolescents more credit for rationality but also that parents should help children hone their cost-benefit analysis skills in making real-life decisions.  The new results point to the idea that we should not think of adolescents as being irrational,  said corresponding author Scott Huettel, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke.  What s different about them is they don t use simple rules as effectively.  Such simple rules are the mental shortcuts people take in decision-making -- often to their benefit -- as they age and gain more experience. Most adults apply the  don t drink and drive  rule, for example, to avoid getting in a car with someone who s been drinking. In contrast, teens may more carefully weigh this decision.  Adolescents are going to be more likely to use cost-benefit analysis than the (simple rules) that adults use. That can get these kids into a lot of trouble,  Huettel said. In the new study, participants were presented with three scenarios (A, B, and C) and asked to pick the best one. Each scenario contained a set of outcomes that could lead to winning or losing different sums of money. For example if the subjects picked scenario A, they had a one-third chance of winning, say $6, one-third chance of winning $4, and a one-third chance of losing $4. Scenarios B and C each came with their own chances to win or lose three different dollar amounts. Young adults -- who were 22 years old, on average -- used simple rules. As they completed more trials, they counted the number of wins and losses in each scenario and picked the one with the most wins, ignoring the dollar amount of each potential gain or loss. Adolescents, on the other hand, accounted for the magnitude of the potential win or loss and chose scenarios to minimize loss.  I was surprised by how consistent the effects were,  Huettel said.  Pretty much everywhere we looked, adolescents were the ones who looked more economically rational.  Tracking the participants  eyes as they completed the task gave clues about how they were processing the information. Adolescents consistently viewed almost all the possible outcomes of their choices throughout the experiment. In contrast, young adults looked at almost everything initially, but as the experiment progressed they started to ignore information that wasn t useful to them. They also spent less time than adolescents viewing each outcome, the study found. Other research has shown that adolescents aren t necessarily more risk-seeking but that they are more sensitive to good outcomes compared with adults. Teens also place more value in social interactions and approval. Huettel s group is studying the role of peers in adolescent decision-making, while tracking eye movements and brain activity. This research, and the new study, may inform new ways of coaching adolescents to make smarter decisions, Huettel said. Duke University   press release Huetel SA et al.

One of the fundamental challenges facing neuroscientists who want to understand how the brain works is actually figuring out how the brain is wired together and how neurons interact. Norwegian Nobel laureates and neuroscientists May-Britt and Edvard Moser of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) solved this problem by learning how to record from individual neurons in the rat brain while the rats move freely in space. They used the recordings to make the discovery that won them the Nobel Prize: They were able to see that certain neurons in the entorhinal cortex fired in such a way to create a grid pattern that could be use to navigate, like an internal GPS. The newest group leader of the Mosers' Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Emre Yaksi, has taken a very different approach to the problem of seeing what's going on inside the brain. Instead of studying rats or mice, Yaksi has roughly 90 different kinds of genetically modified zebrafish that he can breed to create different fish with desired characteristics. Young, larval zebrafish are completely transparent, so Yaksi needs only a regular optical microscope to see what's happening inside their little fishy heads. Some of Yaksi's fish have a genetic modification that makes their neurons light up as they send a signal to another neuron. This is what makes circuits and connections visible to researchers, he says. ""We are interested in understanding the universal circuit architectures (in the brain) that can do interesting computations,"" Yaksi says. Even though fish are quite different from humans, their brains have many similar structures, and ""in the end fish also have to find food, they also have to find a mate, they have to avoid dangers, and they build brain circuits that can generate all these behaviors, quite like humans do."" Yaksi came to the Kavli Institute in early 2015 from an Assistant Professor position at Neuroelectronics Research Flanders in Belgium, where he had been a group leader and interim director since 2010. Along with Yaksi's team of researchers came a 900 kg anti-vibration table the size of a billiards table. The table was so big and heavy the only way to get it into the laboratory was to remove windows from the third floor lab and hoist it in with a crane. Yaksi's group needs the table to reduce vibrations so they can use the highly sensitive optical microscopes to peer into zebrafish brains. The larval fish are so small that even slight vibrations from cars or trucks driving by on the streets below are enough to make the microscopes bounce away from their tiny brain targets. Zebrafish brains are small, with just 10,000 to 20,000 neurons, a number that is dwarfed by the human brain, which has an estimated 80 billion neurons. Nevertheless, the measurements Yaksi and his colleagues make, results in huge reams of data. One 30 minute recording can generate so much data that it takes easily a week to process it, he said. For this reason, Yaksi's research group is composed of a multidisciplinary team of engineers, physicists and life scientists who are trained to develop and use computational tools to analyze these big datasets. And because some of the zebrafish have been genetically modified so that their neurons light up with a fluorescent protein when the neurons are active, Yaksi and his colleagues often work in low light or darkness. It's especially noticeable when he takes visitors into the muted darkness of the laboratory, where many of the fanciest microscopes are contained in boxes open on the front, designed to limit the amount of external light. Other zebrafish have been genetically modified so that shining a blue light into their brains activates certain neurons -- which allows researchers to map connections between neurons, Yaksi said. Most of the research being done by Yaksi's group is basic research, with findings that advance our understanding of the brain computations but don't specifically have any immediate clinical implications. But Yaksi's wife and colleague, Nathalie Jurisch-Yaksi, is working with medical doctors to develop genetically modified zebrafish that will help shed light on brain diseases such as epilepsy. ""Most of the people in my lab are doing very basic research, trying to ask how does the brain work, how is it connected, how is it built,"" Yaksi said. ""But Nathalie is working with medical doctors here at NTNU, we are really trying to reach out to clinicians."" For example, he said, if a brain disorder such as epilepsy has a genetic component, that same genetic mutation can be created in the group's transgenic zebrafish facility so that the team can study what causes the seizures in a diseased brain and how the seizures can be prevented.

Psychedelic drugs are substances that have a strong effect on one's ""conscious experience,"" such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, found in ""magic mushrooms,"" dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). ""The re-emerging paradigm of psychedelic medicine may open clinical doors and therapeutic doors long closed,"" writes Dr. Evan Wood, Professor of Medicine and Canada Research Chair, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, and coauthors. One small randomized controlled trial indicates that LSD-assisted psychotherapy might help reduce anxiety from terminal illness. Another small study, in which the active molecule in ""magic mushrooms"" was used as part of therapy for alcohol addiction, shows a significant reduction in the number of days alcohol was used as well as in the amount. A small US study of the drug MDMA shows a reduction in PTSD symptoms in people with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. ""Continued medical research and scientific inquiry into psychedelic drugs may offer new ways to treat mental illness and addiction in patients who do not benefit from currently available treatments,"" write the authors. Learnings from research conducted in the 1950s and 1960s, in which there were challenges to conducting studies and ethical breaches, is helping inform current research in the field. ""Although methodological and political challenges remain to some degree, recent clinical studies have shown that studies on psychedelics as therapeutic agents can conform to the rigorous scientific, ethical and safety standards expected of contemporary medical research,"" the authors write. Canadian researchers are leading studies that are looking at psychedelic drugs as treatment for addiction and PTSD. The authors emphasize that the studies included in their analysis are small and the results preliminary; further research is needed to determine if there is widespread clinical application.

Their findings are published in the online issue of Molecular Psychiatry. The neurological disorder is called MECP2 duplication syndrome. First described in 2005, it is caused by duplication of genetic material in a specific region of the X chromosome that encompasses MECP2 and adjacent genes. The disorder displays a wide variety of symptoms, among them low muscle tone, developmental delays, recurrent respiratory infections, speech abnormalities, seizures, autistic behaviors and potentially severe intellectual disability. It is heritable, but can also occur randomly. MECP2 duplication syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males. A similar disorder known as Rett (RTT) Syndrome, which involves MECP2 gene deletions, primarily affects females. Current treatment is largely symptomatic, involving therapies, drugs and surgeries that address specific issues. As in previous, ground-breaking research with Rett Syndrome patients, senior author Alysson Muotri, PhD, associate professor in the UC San Diego departments of Pediatrics and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, and colleagues took skin cells from MECP2 duplication patients, converted them into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), then programmed the stem cells to become neurons that recapitulate the disorder more robustly than existing mouse models. Muotri said analyses of the iPSC-derived neurons revealed novel molecular and cellular phenotypes, including an over-synchronization of the neuronal networks. Interestingly, these phenotypes go in a direction opposite of what scientists had previously reported for Rett syndrome, suggesting that the correct gene dosage is important for homeostasis in human neurons. More importantly, said Muotri, the finding with human neurons helped direct the next stage, a drug screening, which uncovered a drug candidate -- a histone deacetylase inhibitor that reversed all the MECP2 alterations in the mutant neurons, with no harm to control neurons. ""This work is encouraging for several reasons,"" said Muotri. ""First, this compound had never before been considered a therapeutic alternative for neurological disorders. Second, the speed in which we were able to do this. With mouse models, this work would likely have taken years and results would not necessarily be useful for humans."" Muotri said the findings further underscore the potential of stem cell-based models as an efficient method for screening potential drug libraries for the ability to rescue human neuronal phenotypes in a dish. He said his research team would be concluding its preclinical studies in preparation for moving into clinical trials as soon as possible.

Down. Less than normal. That's what the word depression means, and what people with depression often feel like. But sometimes, depression can mean too much of something -- as new research shows. The discovery, about a protein called fibroblast growth factor 9 or FGF9, goes against previous findings that depressed brains often have less of key components than non-depressed brains. In this case, people with major depression had 32 percent more of FGF9 in a key part of their brain than people without the condition. In rats, raising FGF9 levels artificially led to depression-like behavior changes, and repeated social stress caused brain FGF9 levels to rise. Taken together, the findings provide more evidence that depression is a physical illness. If FGF9 or its effects prove to be a good target for drugs, the finding could eventually help lead to better medications for the mental health condition that affects millions of Americans. FGF9's role was discovered by a team from the University of Michigan Medical School and the Pritzker Neuropsychiatric Disorders Research Consortium, who report their results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They made the discoveries through years of detailed comparisons of brain tissue donated by people with and without depression, and multiple studies in rats. Because drugs that block excess production of something in the body generally cause fewer side effects than drugs aimed at increasing something, the team says their findings could hold promise for the development of a new class of antidepressants. ""Fixing depression is not easy, because it's a disorder at the level of the circuits that connect brain cells, and many regions of the brain are involved,"" says Elyse Aurbach, the neuroscience doctoral student who is the paper's co-first author. ""Still, this is the first time FGF9 has been identified as related to depression, and found to be active in a critical area of the brain for the disorder. We and others need to study it further to determine what is going on. It's very exciting."" Aurbach and her mentor Huda Akil, Ph.D., worked with colleagues at the U-M Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute and several other universities to make the discovery. Key to their work was the highly regarded brain bank at the University of California, Irvine, supported by the Pritzker Consortium. They focus on fibroblast growth factors, molecules involved in cell growth and maintenance in the brain, and in other areas of the body. They've studied another FGF molecule, called FGF2, in the brain for years, trying to figure out why it's lower in people and animals with depression and other mental health disorders. They've even shown that giving FGF2 injections can calm anxious rats. The team was surprised when FGF9 levels were higher in the brains of people who had had depression compared to those who had not. The increased levels held up even after they accounted for differences in the ways the individuals lived, and died, before their brain tissue was preserved for research. They made the finding using post-mortem brain samples from the Pritzker collection -- 36 depressed and 56 non-depressed brains in all. Through three different kinds of microarray gene expression studies and a confirming test called quantitative PCR, they looked at all the genetic activity that was going on when these brain donors died, specifically in the area of the brain called the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a crucial area of the brain for memory, learning and stress control. It has been found to be smaller in people with depression, and this is thought to be the result of chronic stress that affects the health of brain cells in that region. Each experiment showed higher FGF9 levels in the depressed brains. What's more, the levels of several other fibroblast growth factors were down when FGF9 was up, suggesting that the entire system for regulating cell growth and development in the brains of depressed people was altered. Intrigued by the human results, the team decided to explore FGF9's role further through experiments with rats. This allowed them to do something they can't do in humans: try to determine if FGF9 rises in response to something, such as stress, or if levels are naturally higher and predispose someone to depression. First, they exposed rats to repeated social stress over a week and a half, and looked at the levels of FGF9 in various regions of the brain's hippocampus. Not only did the levels rise, but the rats got more socially withdrawn and less likely to maintain a healthy weight. Next, they looked at what happens if FGF9 is injected into the brain -- specifically, the ventricle, or open space between the brain's two sides. Other rats received a placebo. The rats that got the FGF9 acted more anxious, and moved around less -- and these depression-like changes persisted with repeated injections. Lastly, the group created a virus that interfered with FGF9 production through a process called RNA interference. They injected it, or a comparison virus that didn't block FGF9 production, into rats' brains -- in a specific area of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus. The active virus caused levels of FGF9 to drop about 30 percent, while other FGF molecule levels stayed the same. And the rats showed less anxiety. ""We call this approach 'reverse translation',"" says Akil, who is the Gardner Quarton Professor of Neurosciences, a professor of psychiatry and co-director of MBNI. ""We start by careful, broad scale analyses in the human brain to discover new molecular players that might play a role in triggering or maintaining the depression. We then follow them up in rodent studies to understand the role of these molecules and determine whether we can target them for new treatments."" Aurbach, Akil and their colleagues are already performing more experiments to determine why FGF9 production rises, as well as to study it in other brain regions and to see how it affects communication among brain cells. A patent application has been filed and is being managed by the Pritzker Consortium. They hope their work will lead to a search for medications to affect FGF9 levels, but caution that the molecule is important in the lungs and blood vessels, too.

""Bill Petri and I had been social friends for years - Christmas parties, that kind of thing. When I was at Virginia it happened that we were on a recruitment committee together and the candidate was late, so we started talking."" His conversation with William A. Petri, Jr., MD, PhD, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases & International Health at the University of Virginia led to the idea of applying an innovative cancer science technique to the study of infectious disease. With first author Chelsea Marie, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in the Petri Laboratory at Virginia, the group decided to silence genes in human cells to discover if the loss of any single gene would confer immunity to the parasite E. histolytica, which infects 50 million people and causes 40,000-110,000 deaths via severe diarrhea worldwide. ""Chelsea is a fearless experimenter. She took a library of cells that Dan had developed in his work with bladder cancer and then sequentially killed them with E. histolytica parasites,"" Petri says. Specifically, the group used the technique called RNAi to create a library of bladder cancer cells with thousands of independent, silenced genes. Then they challenged these cultures with the parasite E. histolytica. ""We do this all the time in cancer research,"" Theodorescu says. ""Commonly, we're looking for genes that, when silenced, will make cells more susceptible to chemotherapy."" In this case the analogue of chemotherapy was the infectious, dangerous pathogen. ""This amoeba is a cluster bomb - a voracious killer. In the back of my mind I was thinking the parasite was going to decimate the host cells no matter what we did with their genetics,"" Marie says. For the vast majority of cells in this genome-wide screen, Chelsea Marie was correct; E. histolytica decimated many thousands of these independent cell cultures. However, a small number of cells seemed to resist the parasite. Was this the random chance of lucky survival or had silenced genes somehow offered immunity to these cells? To find out, Marie discarded the killed cells and retested the cells that had survived; again she infected these survivor cells with E. histolytica. ""It wasn't a fluke,"" says Marie. ""We did this over nine generations of cells, each time selecting the cells that survived and then re-applying the parasite. Over these generations of selection, we saw the cultures becoming more and more enriched for cells lacking specific genes."" Using next generation sequencing, Marie identified the genes that conferred resistance and found that many were involved in managing the flow of potassium into and out of human cells. Specifically, the identified genes KCNA3, KCNB2, KCNIP4, KCNJ3, and SLC24A3 are involved in what is called potassium transport. A follow-up experiment showed that new intestinal cells treated with E. histolytica showed potassium efflux - the flow of potassium from inside a cell out through the cell wall - directly before cell death. ""We started to see a pretty clear line of reasoning,"" says Theodorescu. ""The parasite was causing potassium efflux right before cell death and cells that happened to be unable to transport potassium didn't die."" To ensure that lack of potassium transport was, in fact, causing resistance to the parasite, the group reversed the direction of their experiments. Marie started with new cells and used drugs to block their ability to transport potassium. Blocking potassium efflux created cells that were resistant to E. histolytica. ""There is a clear need for new drugs targeting E. histolytica,"" Petri says. ""Right now there is a single antibiotic that works against this parasite. We know that eventually the parasite will develop resistance to the antibiotic and at that point there's no plan B. This could be the plan B - targeting the human genes that enable the parasite to cause disease."" Marie is pushing forward. She recently learned from a mentor at John's Hopkins how to isolate stem cells from human tissue to grow what she calls ""mini guts"" to test therapeutics that may be useful in human patients. And technological advances make this study's general technique more efficient, allowing the use of what are called CRISPR libraries instead of RNAi screens. ""This is a major finding with translational implications for this infection that causes so many deaths worldwide, but also proof that this cancer-science approach can be used to explore genetic mechanisms of resistance in the field of infectious disease,"" Theodorescu says. The field of infectious disease has been focused on the infection, targeting pathogens and their transmission. This study shows that in addition to characteristics of the parasite, mortality due to disease can be prevented by manipulating characteristics of the host.","Published: September 9, 2015"

Doctors' ability to act quickly and correctly not only makes a difference to the patient's outcome, it determines whether the infection spreads to other patients in the clinic, and can even contribute to the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Luckily for patients and doctors alike, a new diagnostic device created by collaborative team of UA engineers and scientists may significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to diagnose tissue infections. The device's novel approach to molecular diagnostics, called DOTS qPCR, is faster, more efficient and less expensive than alternatives currently being used in clinics.  ""We have developed a completely different type of system than what exists out on the market,"" said Dustin Harshman, a former graduate student in the Biomedical Engineering Graduate Interdisciplinary Program, currently a scientist at Ventana Medical Systems. ""We want to see physicians get diagnostic information more rapidly and prescribe better initial therapies.""Pathogens and infectious diseases are typically detected using a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. The method involves rapidly heating and cooling DNA molecules from a biological sample in a process called thermal cycling. This results in the amplification of the target DNA into millions, and even billions of copies. Scientists and physicians can then use the copies to identify the type of pathogen causing the infection. The problem is that most PCR tests can take up to an hour or more, and a physician's decision-making window is typically less than ten minutes. ""With DOTS qPCR we are able to detect amplification and identify the infection after as few as 4 thermal cycles, while other methods are working with between 18 and 30,"" said Jeong-Yeol Yoon, a professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering and a joint appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. ""We can get from sample to answer in as little as 3 minutes and 30 seconds."" DOTS qPCR, invented by Yoon and his research group, stands for droplet-on-thermocouple silhouette real-time PCR. The technology relies on the measurement of subtle surface tension changes at the interface of a water droplet suspended in an oil medium. The water droplet, which contains the target DNA to be amplified, is moved along a heat gradient in the oil to begin the chain reaction. As more copies of the target DNA are produced, they move towards the oil-water interface, resulting in measurable changes in surface tension. Remarkably, the size of the droplet can be measured using a smartphone camera, providing a method to observe the course of the reaction in real time. ""What's interesting about the way we approached this is that we've developed a deep understanding of what's happening at a molecular level in our system,"" said Harshman, who initially struggled to determine how to monitor the course of the reaction. ""That kind of understanding gave us the ability to figure out why it was failing, and then leverage that failure as an advantage to create a completely new method."" In addition to much faster diagnosis times, the system does not require samples to be completely free of other contaminants. This can save valuable time otherwise spent preparing samples for testing. ""The system still works with relatively dirty samples,"" said Yoon. ""We can use very minimal processing and still make the detection in a short time."" Yoon emphasized that DOTS qPCR is inexpensive compared to its counterparts, which employ costly and time-intensive testing methods involving fluorescence detection, lasers and dark chambers. ""It's easy to use, smartphone-integrated and saves money and labor using expensive equipment,"" explained Yoon. ""This technology has a lot of commercial potential, and we'd be happy to work with industry to bring it to market."" DOTS qPCR also has major applications in biological research, where PCR is an indispensable tool used in studying everything from hereditary disease to the evolutionary tree. Ultimately, Harshman and Yoon hope the technology will transform the operations of hospital emergency rooms, where saving time to diagnosis translates into saving lives. ""We're envisioning a device that will provide physicians with answers as soon as they perform a biopsy, while they're still sitting with the patient,"" said Harshman. ""By saving diagnosis time, we can decrease complications for patients, isolate infections to prevent spreading, and avoid creating selective pressure for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is a huge burden on the medical system.""","Published: September 9, 2015"

Cas9, a naturally occurring protein in the immune system of certain bacteria, acts like a pair of molecular scissors to precisely cut or edit specific sections of DNA. More recently, however, scientists have also begun to use CRISPR-Cas9 variants as gene regulation tools to reversibly turn genes on or off at whim. Both of these tasks, genome engineering and gene regulation, are initiated with a common step: the Cas9 protein is recruited to targeted genes by the so-called matching sequences of ""guide RNA"" that help Cas9 latch on to specific sequences of DNA in a given genome. But until now, genome engineering and gene regulation required different variants of the Cas9 protein; while the former task hinges on Cas9 s innate DNA-cleaving activity, the latter has been achieved by engineered Cas9 variants that have had their DNA-cleaving ""fangs"" removed, but still retain their ability to latch onto a specific genomic target. These latter Cas9 variants are commonly fused with proteins that regulate gene expression.Now, using a new approach developed by researchers led by George Church, Ph.D., of Harvard and Ron Weiss, Ph.D., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both tasks can be achieved using one type of Cas9, allowing scientists to increase the complexity of gene editing functions and their overall control of genes. The method opens up unexpected possibilities for understanding diseases and drug mechanisms.  Church is Core Faculty member at Harvard s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT, and Weiss is Professor of Biological Engineering and also Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Their multi-institutional team has introduced the clever new kit that allows the innate Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes to cleave certain genes while simultaneously regulating the expression of others through engineering the guide RNA. James Collins, Ph.D., Wyss Institute Core Faculty member and the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, is also a co-investigator and a co-author on the study.Key to their strategy, the team discovered that the length of the guide RNA sequence plays a critical role in determining whether or not Cas9 will solely bind to DNA or if it will excise it as well. ""We decided to systematically test why it was that truncating guides too much caused Cas9 to no longer cut the intended genomic site,"" said Alejandro Chavez, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute. Chavez, who is advised by both Church and Collins at the Wyss, is a co-first author on the study together with Samira Kiani, Postdoctoral Associate in Weiss  MIT lab. The Wyss and MIT team confirmed in human cells that shorter guide RNAs indeed no longer allowed Cas9 to cut a targeted gene. To their surprise, however, the shorter guide RNAs did not prevent Cas9 from efficiently binding to that target, opening up the possibility for scientists to attach gene regulation proteins to Cas9 for delivery to specific genes. ""By using our uncovered guide RNA principles, we can now for the first time toggle a single protein to gain direct control over both, gene sequences and gene expression, and turn almost any DNA sequence into a regulatory sequence to further bend the cell to our will. We envision future uses for the technology that can help decipher the tangled web of interactions underlying for example cancer drug resistance and stem cell differentiation, or design advanced synthetic gene circuitries,"" said Church. ""This new functionality will improve our ability to decipher the complex relationships between interdependent genes responsible for many diseases,"" said Marcelle Tuttle, a Research Fellow at the Wyss Institute and co-author on the study. The findings could also be used in large scale metabolic production of chemicals and fuels using genetically engineered bacteria   such as common E. coli   while safeguarding the ""microbial workers"" from infection by other microbes and pathogens. ""Cas9 has emerged as a revolutionary tool allowing us to conquer new biomedical and industrial territory. This team s findings harness yet another level of control and versatility in gene editing and demonstrate the Wyss Institute s continued efforts in advancing the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system towards key applications,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.","Published: September 9, 2015"

When even a single one of these interactions is lost it can lead to disease, and the map is already helping scientists spot individual proteins that could be at the root of complex human disorders. The data will be available to researchers across the world through open access databases.  While the sequencing of the human genome more than a decade ago was undoubtedly one of the greatest discoveries in biology, it was only the beginning of our in-depth understanding of how cells work. Genes are just blueprints and it is the genes  products, the proteins, that do much of the work in a cell. Proteins work in teams by sticking to each other to carry out their jobs. Many proteins come together to form so called molecular machines that play key roles, such a building new proteins or recycling those no longer needed by literally grinding them into reusable parts. But for the vast majority of proteins, and there are tens of thousands of them in human cells, we still don t know what they do. This is where Emili and Marcotte s map comes in. Using a state-of-the-art method developed by the groups, the researchers were able to fish thousands of protein machineries out of cells and count individual proteins they are made of. They then built a network that, similar to social networks, offers clues into protein function based on which other proteins they hang out with. For example, a new and unstudied protein, whose role we don t yet know, is likely to be involved in fixing damage in a cell if it sticks to cell s known  handymen  proteins.  The landmark study gathered information on protein machineries from nine species that represent the tree of life: baker s yeast, amoeba, sea anemones, flies, worms, sea urchins, frogs, mice and humans. The new map expands the number of known protein associations more than tenfold and gives insights into how they evolved over time.   For me the highlight of the study is its sheer scale. We have tripled the number of protein interactions for every species. So across all the animals, we can now predict, with high confidence, more than one million protein interactions   a fundamentally  big step  moving the goal posts forward in terms of protein interactions networks,  said Emili, who is also Ontario Research Chair in Biomarkers in Disease Management and a professor in U of T's department of molecular genetics. The researchers discovered that tens of thousands of protein associations remained unchanged since the first ancestral cell appeared one billion years ago, preceding all of animal life on Earth.   Protein assemblies in humans were often identical to those in other species. This not only reinforces what we already know about our common evolutionary ancestry, it also has practical implications, providing the ability to study the genetic basis for a wide variety of diseases and how they present in different species,  said Marcotte. The map is already proving useful in pinpointing possible causes of human disease. One example is a newly discovered molecular machine, dubbed Commander, which consists of about a dozen individual proteins. Genes that encode some of Commander s components had previously been found to be mutated in people with intellectual disabilities but it was not clear how these proteins worked.  Because Commander is present in all animal cells, graduate student Fan Tu went on to disrupt its components in tadpoles, revealing abnormalities in the way brain cells are positioned during embryo development and providing a possible origin for a complex human condition.   With tens of thousands of other new protein interactions, our map promises to open many more lines of research into links between proteins and disease, which we are keen to explore in depth over the coming years,  concluded Emili.","Published: September 9, 2015"

Malignancies caused by radiation therapy are a major cause of mortality in childhood cancer patients and affect approximately 10 percent of long-term survivors, depending on diagnosis and prognosis. These secondary malignancies arise from DNA injury following radiation therapy and can be aggressive and challenging to treat. While they can also occur in adults, experts are recognizing that they are more common in children.In the study a team of international scientists, headed by senior author Jean Nakamura, MD, of UCSF, conducted an analysis of tumors in mice that were caused by both exposure to radiation and genetic mutations. The researchers compared the prevalence of cancer in normal mice to those with a mutation in the Nf1 gene, which encodes a tumor-suppressing protein called neurofibromin. Children born with mutations in this gene have neurofibromatosis 1, a condition that predisposes them to tumors. In order to parallel the effects of radiation therapy on pediatric patients, young mice underwent focused radiation targeted to the abdominal wall. The dosing was similar to that received by patients. After radiation the Nf1 mice harbored more tumors and had shorter lifespans than the normal mice.  Comparing malignancies from two different genetic backgrounds helps us understand which genetic alterations are attributable to radiation and which genetic alterations are attributable to the germline mutations, those mutations present at birth,  said Nakamura, associate professor of radiation oncology in the UCSF School of Medicine and a physician at UCSF Benioff Children s Hospital San Francisco. The scientists sequenced malignancies from 19 mice, of which 15 tumors occurred in Nf1 mice and seven in normal mice, and identified common mutational signatures, irrespective of tumor type and genetic background. The researchers looked at sarcomas, tumors usually arising from muscle or bone that are common secondary malignancies, and found that those of the Nf1 mice had fewer changes in DNA sequence than the normal mice. They also found that the cancers of the Nf1 mice were significantly more likely to have lost large segments of individual chromosomes compared to the normal mice. These findings indicate that germline mutations in Nf1 influence the numbers and types of genetic alterations found in tumors. Nakamura and her colleagues now are analyzing radiation-induced malignancies from pediatric patients for the mutation patterns they discovered in the mice.  If we can identify whether germline mutations are contributing to cancer development in pediatric patients, we have the potential to personalize cancer therapy and health management approaches to help these patients enjoy long-term health,  said Nakamura.  Since individual patients have individual genetic profiles and different radiation exposure, we might be able to tailor medical care to integrate this information, rather than offering the same treatment to all children with the same diagnosis.  Nakamura hopes that the results of the study may enable scientists to understand the precise molecular steps and sources that contribute to cancer formation and block the process at the point at which it is easiest to manipulate.  In the future, we may find that some of the mutational signatures that we identified reflect molecular deficiencies that we can prevent or correct,  she said.  One possibility is developing drugs to protect or reinforce genetic integrity during radiation exposure, as well as afterwards. ","Published: September 9, 2015"

This method enables sensitive detection of DNA in complex biological samples, such as serum from whole blood.  Nanoporous gold can be imagined as a porous metal sponge with pore sizes that are a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair,  said Erkin  eker, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Davis and the senior author on the papers.  What happens is the debris in biological samples, such as proteins, is too large to go through those pores, but the fiber-like nucleic acids that we want to detect can actually fit through them. It s almost like a natural sieve. Rapid and sensitive detection of nucleic acids plays a crucial role in early identification of pathogenic microbes and disease biomarkers. Current sensor approaches usually require nucleic acid purification that relies on multiple steps and specialized laboratory equipment, which limit the sensors  use in the field. The researchers  method reduces the need for purification.  So now we hope to have largely eliminated the need for extensive sample clean-up, which makes the process conducive to use in the field,   eker said. The result is a faster and more efficient process that can be applied in many settings. The researchers hope the technology can be translated into the development of miniature point-of-care diagnostic platforms for agricultural and clinical applications.  The applications of the sensor are quite broad ranging from detection of plant pathogens to disease biomarkers,  said  eker. For example, in agriculture, scientists could detect whether a certain pathogen exists on a plant without seeing any symptoms. And in sepsis cases in humans, doctors might determine bacterial contamination much more quickly than at present, preventing any unnecessary treatments.","Published: September 9, 2015"

Now they are being eyed as a gateway through which the immune system could be coaxed to mount a defense to clear the body of the virus.  What we see is that DVGs are key in signaling the immune response to turn on,  said Carolina L pez, senior author on the study and an assistant professor in the Department of Pathobiology in Penn s School of Veterinary Medicine.  This is the first study that shows that DVGs can critically impact the outcome of an RSV infection and that they are present in infected humans.  Viruses present something of a paradox: they must suppress the immune system in order to infect their host, but, if they kill the host, they, too, will die. RSV is no different; it potently suppresses the immune system yet most people are able to clear the infection. So how does the immune system eventually overcome infection?L pez and colleagues suspected DVGs may offer an answer. DVGs were discovered in the 1940s and for a time were investigated for their potential use in vaccination. They eventually were dismissed, however, thought to be an artifact of in vitro study. More recently, scientists have realized they are  real  and present naturally but have only used them as tools to conduct research or to help diagnose infections with HIV and hepatitis C. When the RSV infects a host and begins to rapidly replicate itself, it produces defective versions of its genome that contain large deletions. DVGs by themselves cannot replicate and, in previous studies by the L pez lab, had been found in culture to trigger the expression of genes responsible for an anti-viral immune response. Yet no one had showed that they had a biological function in humans. In this new work, the researchers found that mice infected with a modified RSV that lacked DVGs experienced worse disease symptoms, including weight loss and lung tissue inflammation, and had higher levels of virus in their lungs than mice infected with RSV that had high levels of DVGs. Mice infected with the modified RSV also had lower expression levels of anti-viral genes, such as interferon, than mice infected with the DVG-containing RSV. Next the researchers looked at a human cell line, finding that, as in the mice, RSV with higher levels of DVGs potently triggered the expression of interferon genes. To see if DVGs were present in humans with RSV infections, the scientists analyzed the respiratory secretions collected from 41 children who had confirmed diagnoses of RSV at CHOP. They detected DVGs in nearly half of the patients and found that these same samples also contained higher levels of anti-viral genes than those without detectable levels of DVGs. As a final experiment, the team obtained lung tissue from seven deceased donors and exposed slices of the lung to RSV to see how they responded. As seen in the mice, lungs exposed to RSV with high levels of DVGs had lower levels of viral replication and higher levels of antiviral gene expression one day after infection, though the researchers observed some variations from sample to sample, suggesting that there may be individual differences in how people accumulate DVGs and thus how they defend against the virus.  If you put virus containing a lot of these defective genomes into human lung samples, they all respond,  L pez said,  but the difference was some patients  tissue could accumulate the DVGs faster than others and that correlated with outcome. That tells you that there are host factors that modulate this response to DVGs and that that could predict outcomes. So now we want to find out what those host factors are.  The researchers would also like to investigate ways of manipulating either the DVGs themselves or host factors to improve patients  response to the virus.  We have very few tools to manage RSV infection, so we d obviously like to see if we can figure out a way to trigger an immune response and clear infection before any damage is done. That is the future. ","Published: September 9, 2015"

RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a polymer composed of repeating monomers of nucleotides, which are themselves composed of the sugar ribose, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen heterocycles. RNA thought to be a primordial molecule, and many researchers feel that understanding its origin is of key importance to understanding the origins of life. However, despite its central role, surprisingly little is understood about where RNA actually came from. No studies to date have succeeded in generating RNA in a one-pot reaction from simpler starting materials, although this does not mean that simpler nucleic acids did not exist before RNA. Henderson James Cleaves II at the Earth-Life Science Institute (ELSI) of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, together with scientists in Germany and the US, generated and examined all the possible isomers of RNA nucleosides. They wanted to determine where RNA might sit in terms of its  structure space  - the number of possible molecular structures that could exist given certain defining parameters. Their findings suggest RNA may have competed with multiple other structures before becoming the central molecule in biology it is today. Using structure-generation software, Cleaves and his team uncovered 227 different isomeric structures, as well as scores of simpler analogues, which could potentially serve as building blocks for RNA-like molecules. They selected the structures following a careful screening of the total number of possibilities which could be derived from the ribosides  formula. They chose structures that were likely to remain stable in certain conditions (moderate pH and temperature for example), and those with at least two functional groups which would allow the monomers to become part of more complex, linear polymers. Their results raise many questions, and suggest RNA may not have been alone in its ability to carry genetic information in the distant past. Hardly any of the 227 structures in this set have been previously investigated, and so their ability to carry out genetic inheritance functions is unknown. Cleaves  team call for further research into this huge RNA  structure space  to explore these findings further. Background RNA and its disputed origins Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a central role in conveying genetic information in cells. It is likely that both RNA, and its partner DNA, evolved as the optimal approach for this task, given certain defining parameters such as the ability to function and remain stable in small cells. Nature s solutions were RNA and DNA, in this instance, but the outcome could have been different had other versions of these molecules dominated during the early days of life on Earth. So far, no one-pot reaction has been able to recreate RNA monomers in the laboratory using simple prebiotic materials. This scenario has led to dispute within the field as to whether or not RNA is a  unique  molecule, all alone in its own  structure space . This is the first study to examine all of the possible isomers that can be created from RNA s basic chemical formula: BC5H9O4, where B is the nucleobase). A molecule s  structure space  With a given set of ingredients, it is possible to create many different combinations. In the case of RNA, the constituent components of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, together with the base-sugar complex, can create many different molecular forms. Isomers are molecules which have the same chemical formula (or the same ingredients), but the individual atoms are arranged in different ways within the molecule. The total number of possible forms a molecule with the same chemical formula can take, within certain defining parameters, is known as the molecule s  structure space . This research is the first to attempt to define RNA s  structure space    to elucidate the total possible isomers of ribosides that could form the basis of RNA-type molecules. Cleaves and his team uncovered 227 structures likely to survive in moderate environments, which may have similar functions to RNA. Most of these structures have never been scientifically described or studied. Implications of current research The findings of this study imply that RNA may have competed with a large number of alternative nucleic acids during biological evolution to become the key nucleic acid it is today, and alternate evolutionary outcomes could occur on other planets. The authors urge further work in this area, and suggest caution should be taken in assuming that RNA was unique in its  structure space  in the early stages of life on Earth.","Published: September 9, 2015"

The study, conducted by Sara Bitam and her colleagues at INSERM in France, has just passed peer review on open science publishing platform F1000Research (http://f1000research.com/articles/4-218/v2). Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting autosomal recessive monogenic disorder that affects 1 in every 2000 - 3500 newborns in the EU and US per year. It is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the CFTR protein, an epithelial ion channel involved in salt and fluid transport in multiple organs including those in the respiratory system. F508del, the most common mutation, produces a faulty CFTR protein that degrades shortly after creation. The lack of a functional CFTR protein makes individuals more prone to respiratory infections with excessive inflammation, which in turn leads to deterioration of lung function, the main cause of death in patients. In their article, titled  An unexpected effect of TNF-  on F508del-CFTR maturation and function , the authors report that a 10 minute exposure of cells expressing the faulty CFTR channel to TNF- , an inflammatory cytokine produced by white blood cells, can  fix  these cells, at least temporarily. They first found a transient form of this effect in HeLa cells (derived from a cervical cancer cell line). This was surprising, and when they repeated the experiments in human bronchial epithelial cells, which have more clinical relevance to the condition, they found an even better effect with the cells working as they should for at least 24 hours. Further experiments elucidated that TNF-  achieves this by preventing the faulty CFTR protein from being degraded before it is successfully transported to the cell membrane. Aleksander Edelman, the Principal Investigator of the study, outlined his group s next steps:  We hope to investigate whether TNF-  is linked to the severity of cystic fibrosis; if so then TNF-alpha levels might be one of a panel of molecules that could be used as a prognostic marker in the disease.  Rebecca Lawrence, Managing Director of F1000Research, said:  These findings are an exciting development in the bid to find a cure for cystic fibrosis - a devastating disease that affects many thousands of people worldwide.  It is really important that results of this nature are published in the public domain as quickly as possible for peer review and we are pleased to be able to facilitate this through our open science publishing platform.

Scientists have come to this conclusion after finding that smokers who suffered a stroke in the insular cortex were far more likely to quit smoking and experience fewer and less severe withdrawal symptoms than those with strokes in other parts of the brain. ""These findings indicate that the insular cortex may play a central role in addiction,"" said Amir Abdolahi Ph.D., M.P.H., lead author of the studies. ""When this part of the brain is damaged during stroke, smokers are about twice as likely to stop smoking and their craving and withdrawal symptoms are far less severe."" Abdolahi is a clinical research scientist at Philips Research North America and conducted the research while an epidemiology doctoral student in Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. While smoking rates have remained flat for the last decade, smoking is still responsible for nearly one of every five deaths in the U.S. and smoking places individuals at a significantly higher risk for heart disease, cancer, and stroke. The frontline prescription drugs currently used to treat tobacco dependence -- which include bupropion and varenicline -- primarily target the brain's ""reward"" pathways by interfering with the release and binding of dopamine in the brain in response to nicotine. While these drugs are generally well-tolerated, they have relatively high rates of relapse. Most have a reported success rate of up to 30 percent after six months, meaning that 70 percent of the people who use these treatments eventually start smoking again. Nicotine replacement therapies, such as patches and lozenges, have a similar success rate. Recent studies have hinted that a specific part of the brain -- a central region called the insular cortex -- may also play an important role in the cognitive and emotional processes that facilitate drug and tobacco use. The authors of the current set of studies -- which appear in the journals Addiction and Addictive Behaviors -- tested this theory in a somewhat unique fashion: by determining whether smokers whose insular cortex had been damaged during a stroke are more likely to quit smoking. The researchers examined two different sets of indicators -- whether patients have resumed smoking after a stroke and the severity of their craving for a cigarette during their hospitalization. The studies involved 156 stroke patients who were admitted to three hospitals in Rochester, NY, all of whom were identified as active smokers. The location of the stroke for each patient was determined by MRI and CT scans and the study participants were divided into two groups -- those with a stroke occurring in the insular cortex and those with a stroke in another part of the brain. While recovering in the hospital the researchers measured the participant's level of smoking withdrawal. Because hospitalization essentially constitutes a period of forced abstinence from smoking, this was an ideal environment to measure the severity of withdrawal symptoms. The researchers used two separate survey tools to measure aspects of withdrawal, such as anger, anxiety, cravings, concentration, hunger, sadness, and sleep. They found that patients with strokes occurring in the insular cortex had fewer and far less severe withdrawal symptoms than those with strokes in other parts of the brain. The researchers also followed the study participants for three months to determine whether or not they had resumed smoking. It is reasonable to assume that the ""wake up call"" of having a stroke is a powerful motivator for smokers to quit, both because the smoking may have been one of the factors that caused the stroke in the first place and during recovery they would have been strongly urged to quit by their health care providers. Regardless, the researchers found a significant disparity in the smoking cessation rates between the two study groups. Almost twice as many patients with strokes in the insular cortex quit smoking compared to those with strokes in other parts of the brain -- 70 percent vs. 37 percent. These findings open the door for researchers to potentially explore therapies that could target this area of the brain and disrupt its role in addiction, potentially with new drugs or other techniques such as deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation. They also speculate that, in addition to smoking, the role of the insular cortex could apply to other forms of addiction. ""Much more research is needed in order for us to more fully understand the underlying mechanism and specific role of the insular cortex, but is clear that something is going on in this part of the brain that is influencing addiction,"" said Abdolahi.

Researchers at Link ping University have synthesized and tested 71 substances known as resin acids, of which twelve are prime candidates for new medicines. ""Our goal is to develop some of the most potent substances into medicines,"" says Fredrik Elinder, professor of molecular neurobiology and head of the study, which was newly published in the open-access periodical Scientific Reports. Professor Elinder is an expert on the function of ion channels -- the pores in the cell membrane that allow the vital transport of charged ions between the cell's interior and its surroundings, making nerve and cardiac cells electrically excitable. Illnesses such as epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia and chronic pain are caused by the excitability of nerve or cardiac cells being far too high. Back in the 1940s, Swedish researchers discovered a local anaesthetic, lidocaine, that targeted ion channels. Like many of today's medicines against epilepsy, it worked by blocking channels selective for sodium ions. The problem is that many patients do not respond properly to the treatment, and that it has side effects. ""Our substances act instead on potassium channels, where they keep the door open via an electrostatic mechanism, thereby curbing the harmful nerve activity,"" Professor Elinder says. The research group had previously discovered that polyunsaturated fatty acids acted via this mechanism, but were looking for more specific and more powerful substances. Resin acids -- found naturally in resin -- are fat-soluble and electrically charged, properties that are necessary to be able to bind to and pull the ion channels' ""doorknobs."" A collaboration with LiU chemists Professor Peter Konradsson and principal research engineer Xiongyu Wu was the key to success in the project. Based on the original molecule, dehydroabietic acid, 71 new molecules were created with small variations in the structure. These were tested on a hypersensitive potassium channel that was expressed in frog eggs. ""Twelve of the molecules were more potent than anything we'd looked at earlier,"" says doctoral student Nina Ottosson, who designed the test channel and measured the electrical currents that open and close the door to the ion channel. Her results were later verified in nerve cells from mice. The researchers have now submitted patent applications prior to continued developmental work. ""It's reasonable for us to be the ones developing the concept further, refining our ideas. But further on, others will have to take over,"" Professor Elinder says.

The research, published in PLOS Biology, provides a new approach for studying the neural circuits that govern behavior. It also has important implications for how scientists think about the neural roadmap. New technologies have fueled the quest to map all the neural connections in the brain to understand how these networks process information and control behavior. The human brain consists of 100 billion neurons that make a quadrillion connections. The total length of neuronal processes in the human brain is approximately 4 million miles long, similar in length to the total number of roads in the U.S. Along these networks, neurons communicate with each other through excitatory and inhibitory synapses that turn neurons on or off, respectively. The neuronal roadmap, or connectome, however, doesn t include information about the activity of neurons or the signals they transmit. The complexity of the human brain makes it almost impossible to address questions such as how stable are neural circuits in the brain and does their wiring constrain the flow of information or the behaviors they control. Mark Alkema, PhD, associate professor of neurobiology, turned to the nematode C. elegans to find answers. A tiny worm with only 302 neurons, it is the only animal whose neural roadmap has been completely defined. In this study, Dr. Alkema and colleagues sought to determine if flipping the sign of a synapse from inhibitory to excitatory in the worm s brain was enough to reverse a behavior. To do this, they analyzed nematode touch response that C. elegans employ to escape from carnivorous fungi that use threadlike nooses to catch nematodes. During this escape response, neurotransmitters in C. elegans are released that activate an inhibitory ion channel. This causes the worm to relax its head and quickly reverse direction away from the predator. Jenn Pirri, a doctoral student in the Alkema lab, and Diego Rayes, PhD, a former post-doctoral fellow now at the Instituto de Investigaciones Bioqu micas de Bah a Blanca in Argentina, replaced the inhibitory ion channel with an excitatory version of the channel in a live nematode.  Surprisingly, the engineered channel does not affect development of and is properly incorporated into the neural circuits of the worm brain,  said Alkema.  Cells that are normally inhibited in the brain now get activated.   What was most striking is that we were able to completely reverse behavior by simply switching the sign of a synapse in the neural network,  explained Alkema.  Now the animal contracts its head and tends to move forward in response to touch. This suggests that the neural wiring diagram is remarkably stable and allows these types of changes.   Our studies indicate that switching the sign of a synapse not only provides a novel synthetic mechanism to flip behavioral output but could even be an evolutionary mechanism to change behavior,  said Alkema.  As we start to unravel the complexity and design of the neural network, it holds great promise as a novel mechanism to test circuit function or even design new neural circuits in vivo.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have published new results in the journal PLoS ONE from the largest ever study of people with autism taking the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test. While typical adults showed the predicted and now well-established sex difference on this test, with women on average scoring higher than men, in adults with autism this typical sex difference was conspicuously absent. Instead, both men and women with autism showed an extreme of the typical male pattern on the test, providing strong support for the 'extreme male brain' theory of autism. The study was led by Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre (ARC) in Cambridge University. Almost 400 men and women with autism or Asperger Syndrome took the test online, which entails looking at a series of photographs of just the eye region of the face, and picking which of 4 words best describe what the person in the photo is thinking or feeling. The 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test is known as an advanced 'theory of mind' or empathy test, designed to reveal subtle individual differences in social sensitivity. It particularly measures the 'cognitive' component of empathy, that is, the ability to recognize or infer someone else's state of mind. The test has been used in hundreds of studies worldwide, showing reliable sex differences in typical individuals, with women on average scoring higher than men, and showing that people with autism score lower on average than people without autism. The team investigated whether men and women with autism perform differently on this test, and used it to evaluate the 'extreme male brain' theory of autism, in the largest study to date. This theory predicts that on tests of empathy, typical females will score higher than typical males, who in turn will score higher than people with autism. The results confirmed this pattern. Professor Baron-Cohen commented: ""We are seeing this pattern not just on the Eyes test but on a number of measures. Last year we saw it on the Empathy Quotient, a self-report measure of social sensitivity, and on the Systemizing Quotient, a self-report measure of one's interest and aptitude in understanding systems. This year we saw it in prenatal testosterone levels, where boys with autism had elevated levels of this hormone compared to typically developing boys, who in turn have higher levels than typically developing girls. And a decade ago we found how much prenatal testosterone you have influences your scores on the Eyes test. Future research needs to delve into what is giving rise to this pattern."" Dr Carrie Allison, Research Manager at the ARC and another member of the team, said: ""Imagine looking at people's eyes and not being able to 'read' them effortlessly and intuitively for what the other person may be thinking or feeling. This research has the potential to explain why children with autism, from the earliest point in development, avoid looking at people's eyes, and become confused in rapidly changing social situations, where people are exchanging glances without words all the time. This disability may be both a marker of the early-onset empathy difficulties in autism, and contribute to exacerbating them. Teaching children with autism how to read emotional expressions non-verbally should become an important clinical focus for future research and practice."" Dr Meng-Chuan Lai, the William Binks Autism Neuroscience Fellow at the ARC and senior author of the study, added: ""There are substantial individual differences in terms of how well a person with autism performs on the Eyes test, but the social difficulties of both men and women are reflected on their test scores. In addition, women with autism differ more from typical women than men with autism differ from typical men. The relationship between autism and sex and gender is becoming an important topic for autism research."" University of Cambridge   press release Lai M-C et al.

The company is focused on the development of SNF472, an experimental drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases linked to calcification in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) undergoing haemodialysis. The investment was led by Ysios Capital and supported by a substantial syndicate of new investors including Lundbeckfond Ventures, Forbion Capital Partners, Gilde Healthcare, Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partners, 'la Caixa' and Baxter Ventures. Existing shareholders also supported the series C round. Sanifit also announces the appointment of Dr. Russell Greig as chairman of the board of directors. Dr. Greig worked at GSK for nearly three decades, most recently as president of SR One, GSK's Corporate Venture Group. Prior to joining SR One, he served as president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals International and was on the corporate executive team from 2003 to 2008. This round of fundraising will enable Sanifit to advance its lead drug candidate, SNF472, through phase IIb proof of concept for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases linked to calcification in ESRD and to complete phase II/III for calciphylaxis. ESRD patients treated with dialysis experience higher rates of serious cardiovascular adverse events and mortality as a consequence of accelerated progression of cardiovascular calcification. Half of the mortality in dialysis patients is from cardiovascular complications. Calciphylaxis is the most severe form of cardiovascular calcification. It is a devastating rare disease that affects up to 4% of dialysis patients and has an overall mortality rate of about 80%. There are approximately 2.5 million dialysis patients worldwide with no effective treatment for this medical condition. ESRD represents a market opportunity of over  2Bn ($2.25Bn). SNF472 has shown significant efficacy data in more than 20 preclinical studies. It has also shown excellent safety and tolerability in a phase Ia clinical trial in healthy volunteers. SNF472 is currently concluding a phase Ib/IIa pharmacology study in haemodialysis patients.  We are delighted to have attracted such high profile investors to our company,  said Joan Perell , CEO of Sanifit.  This funding will help SNF472 to address clear unmet medical needs and will help to change the lives of patients with cardiovascular complications in the field of dialysis.   We were excited to have the opportunity to participate in this financing,  said Jo l Jean-Mairet, managing partner of Ysios Capital.  Sanifit is developing a first-in-class drug with a unique mechanism of action that can improve patient outcomes and positively impact patient lives. This is a pivotal moment to be investing in a company focused on a condition with such an attractive market opportunity.   This is an exciting and attractive opportunity to develop a new drug, SNF472, for two underserved and life threatening conditions, ESRD and calciphylaxis,  said Russell Greig, newly appointed chairman of Sanifit,  The company has already made significant progress and with the support of some of Europe s top VC Funds, it is well positioned to make substantial and rapid progress in both these areas of pronounced unmet medical need.

Celastrol is a natural compound extracted from the root of the thunder god vine. The findings suggest that celastrol kept the mice lean by transforming their white fat, which stores energy, into brown-like fat, which burns calories, and increasing mitochondrial capacity and muscle endurance.  Excess white fat tissue is associated with type 2 diabetes and other serious metabolic consequences of overweight and obesity. On the other hand, brown fat consumes and dissipates calories to generate heat,  said Mueller.  Our results suggest that by  browning  white fat, celastrol is critical in preventing obesity in mice. Further study is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the compound in people.  Previous research had found that celastrol decreased weight in mice with obesity by enhancing the action of the appetite-controlling hormone leptin. The results from Mueller and her team show that lower doses of celastrol can prevent obesity without affecting hunger, suggesting different capabilities of the herbal extract depending on initial weight of the mice.

Although many biofuels have been created from plant and animal fats, scientists are increasingly interested in the potential for large-scale oil synthesis from microalgae. Now, Hiroyuki Ohta at Tokyo Institute of Technology, together with scientists based at institutions across Tokyo, Japan, have uncovered a way of enhancing the production of fat-based molecules called triacylglycerols in the Nannochloropsis algal strain NIES-2145, thereby increasing oil synthesis from the microalgae. Triacylglycerols, or TAGs, are a class of lipids which form the backbone to biofuels. The molecules are comprised of glycerol attached to three fatty acid chains, and microalgae is known to produce more TAGs under nutrient stress conditions. When the algal strain Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is starved of phosphorus, TAGs accumulate rapidly following the overexpression of an enzyme known as CrDGTT4, which in turn is triggered by gene promoter SQD2. Ohta and his team conducted genetic analysis of NIES-2145 and uncovered a homolog of the SQD2 gene. This implied a common expression control system between algal species in response to nutrient stress. The researchers decided to place both CrDGTT4 from C. reinhardtii and its SQD2 promoter into NIES-2145 to find out if this combination could control levels of TAGs production. Their attempt was successful - the SQD2 promoter was able to drive CrDGTT4 expression in NIES-2145 under phosphorus starvation, crucially without disturbing the membrane structure of the microalgae, and the production of TAGs in NIES-2145 increased as a result. Notably, incorporation of oleic acid (a preferentially utilized substrate by CrDGTT4) into TAG molecules was enhanced. The findings point to the possibility of manipulating the production of TAGs, and therefore biofuel oil production, in multiple microalgal strains. Background Biofuels and how algae could contributeThere are many potential advantages of enhanced biofuel use. The emissions from such fuels are far lower than those of fossil fuels, and crucially biofuels biodegrade much faster   there would be fewer effects on the environment following a biofuel spill, for example. Biofuel is also non-toxic, although one drawback which needs work in fossil fuels is that burning it releases nitrogen oxide into the air, the compound responsible for smog. The ability to harness the estimated 40-50 thousand litres of oil per hectare per year generated by algae is a prime motivation behind Ohta s team s research. Following extensive studies into the model organism for studying algal biofuel production, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the team began to find genetic correlations between it and other algal strains. Exploiting these common molecular mechanisms could prove the key to manipulating future biofuel production from algae. Implications of current researchA key finding of this research is that the SQD2 gene appears common to many types of algae, including primary and secondary endosymbiotic algae. The results of this study indicate that the SQD2 promoter from one type of algae can be used to trigger overexpression of the enzyme CrDGTT4, and thus increase yields of TAGs, in another algal strain. This suggests that genetic manipulation using the SQD2 promoter could increase oil yields from various algae. Future workFurther investigations are needed in order to fully understand the processes behind lipid remodeling during phosphorus starvation in algae before these methods are trialled on a larger scale.","Published: September 8, 2015"

But before the contactless fingerprint technology can be used broadly, the products must be evaluated and proven to work with millions of existing contact-based fingerprint records. Enter NIST. When it comes to biometrics including fingerprints the U.S. government relies on NIST to develop data format standards, best practices and methods for certification testing and to demonstrate a new product s ability to work with existing technology. NIST conducts its research on contactless fingerprinting devices with the Federal Bureau of Investigation Biometric Center of Excellence. The partnership s goal is to develop common requirements, metrics and open testing methods for this new fingerprint technology that will support future certification for purchase on the Government Certified Products lists. Researchers at NIST are working with contactless fingerprint devices from MorphoTrak, LLC, and 3M Company through Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). NIST continues to seek new CRADA partners.  The largest challenge we are facing is that this new technology produces images that are fundamentally different than existing images,  says Michael Garris, NIST biometrics senior scientist. Because skin is elastic, traditional fingerprints contain natural distortion from the pressure of placing the finger on the fingerprinting surface, Garris explains. Contactless fingerprints are pressure free and will look different. There are also many types of sensors being used for contactless fingerprint capture. They are significantly different from the sensors used to obtain contact-based fingerprints, so the touchless scans have different image properties.  It is very difficult for NIST or technology developers to address these issues independently,  explains Garris.  The CRADA provides a trustworthy environment for industry to come together and openly work with NIST.  NIST is developing methods, metrics and targets to test these devices to determine if they are reliable, accurate and can work with legacy systems. The first step is to develop models to measure image fidelity on the new systems, including developing calibration patterns that can be used as optical targets to determine resolution, focus, contrast, spatial consistency and other properties of fingerprints. The researchers also are investigating materials for use as synthetic targets for testing, such as aluminum, polycarbonate and NIST-developed materials that can mimic the pigmentation and light-diffusion properties of human tissue.","Published: September 8, 2015"

The drug was given only to patients at high risk of requiring a blood transfusion. The TXA shortage ended in early 2013 and, in October 2013, St. Michael's anesthesiologists started giving TXA to every eligible patient undergoing hip or knee replacement. A total of 402 patients received the drug.""We wanted to optimize TXA's use in patients undergoing hip or knee replacements because these procedures often result in high blood loss and frequently require transfusions,"" said Dr. Greg Hare, an anesthesiologist at St. Michael's. ""The drug costs about $10 per patient, while the average cost of transfusing one unit of blood is $1,200."" Making TXA use mandatory for eligible patients undergoing hip or knee replacement reduced the hospital's transfusion rate for those surgeries from 8.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent (more than a 40 per cent reduction). Canadian data suggests the 2014 hip and knee arthroplasty was about nine per cent. Patients who received TXA did not experience any increase in adverse events, such heart attack, stroke or blood clots. There was no difference in mortality rates or length of hospital stay.

Parkinson s disease is characterised by four major motor symptoms: resting tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement), postural instability and rigidity. In addition to the motor impairments seen in Parkinson s disease, many patients also suffer from some degree of cognitive impairment, which can range from mild impairment to dementia,  says Dr Collins-Praino.   Within 20 years of diagnosis of Parkinson s disease over 80% of patients develop dementia. Parkinson s disease dementia, which includes a variety of behavioural and cognitive impairments, dramatically decreases the quality of a patient s life.   Current pharmacological therapies for Parkinson s disease dementia have varying efficacy and may actually worsen some of the motor symptoms,  she says.  Despite the growing recognition of cognitive impairment in Parkinson s disease, the brain mechanisms that underlie the development of these cognitive deficits are unknown.  Dr Collins-Praino is leading a team of researchers who are looking at an association between brain inflammation and Parkinson s disease dementia.   There is now a growing body of evidence that suggests inflammation in the brain may influence the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson s disease,  says Dr Collins-Praino.  While increases in inflammatory markers are usually thought to be associated with negative consequences for cognition, it is also possible that certain aspects of the inflammatory response may protect the brain from damage.   To address whether particular inflammation may actually protect the brain against cognitive impairment in Parkinson s disease, our lab has been comparing levels of inflammation in the brain in Parkinson s patients with and without dementia.   We ve made some exciting findings and once we have a sound understanding of what is going on in the brain of Parkinson s sufferers, we re hoping to target those pathways to develop an effective treatment for Parkinson s disease dementia,  she says.

FOP is caused by mutations in ACVR1, a gene that encodes for the ACVR1 receptor protein. When a set of ligands (proteins that help regulate cell behavior) known as Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) bind to the ACVR1 receptor, a cascade of intracellular events (referred to as ""signaling"") is induced. This signaling is critical in controlling the formation of the skeleton and ensuring normal bone growth.  Regeneron scientists found that another ligand, Activin-A, in combination with the ACVR1 protein, normally ""turns off"" signaling by the BMPs, and is thus believed to play a role in regulating the volume of bone growth. However, they also discovered that in the presence of the ACVR1 mutation, Activin-A instead ""turns on"" BMP signaling, driving the abnormal bone growth that is characteristic of FOP.  People diagnosed with FOP are gradually debilitated and immobilized as the soft tissue throughout their body transforms into bone. Attempts to remove this extra bone through surgery only result in additional episodes of abnormal bone growth. There are approximately 800 confirmed cases of FOP in the world, including around 200 in the United States, and the current lack of effective treatments underscores the need for scientific exploration that may aid in the development of new therapies.  ""We are excited and grateful to have this new fundamental insight into FOP,"" said Betsy Bogard, Global Research Development Director of the International FOP Association (IFOPA). ""Regeneron's extraordinary research findings bring new hope to the families who struggle with this devastating disease on a daily basis.""  To extend their findings in vivo, Regeneron scientists used the Company's proprietary VelociGene  technology to develop a genetically humanized and novel mouse model of FOP in which the hypothesized molecular pathophysiology of disease was confirmed. The team also used Regeneron's VelocImmune , a platform that enables the rapid generation of fully human monoclonal antibodies, to generate and validate a potential therapeutic antibody chosen for its ability to potently and selectively block Activin-A. Regeneron continues active preclinical testing on this antibody.  ""We have been touched and motivated by the stories of people with FOP, and are grateful to contribute to the understanding of this disease in a way that may lead to new therapeutic options,"" said Aris N. Economides, Executive Director of Skeletal Diseases Therapeutic Focus Area and Genome Engineering Technologies at Regeneron, and co-founder of the Regeneron Genetics Center. ""Gaining insight into the Activin A-related mechanism is a tremendous step forward for researchers, and the knowledge gained about receptor-ligand interactions and signaling in this system may prove relevant in other diseases, as well.""

Dasgupta will do that by extending a platform that he developed to detect and separate ions called an open-tubular capillary chromatography platform. The method uses very small volumes of samples that are injected into tubes extremely small in diameter, between 10 to 25 microns.   To give you some perspective, the finest human hair is about 100 microns. This is about one-tenth of that. You can t see the holes in those tubes,  Dasgupta said.  We have to be much more specific with amino acids than when looking for inorganic ions. But you want the scale to be as small as possible, requiring as little power as possible, and consuming as little material as possible. All of those things have to be carried out to space, and every little bit of weight, volume and power, is expensive.  Dasgupta concedes that his is an ambitious goal and that researchers will have to be much more specific than when looking for ions.  If we find amino acids, that doesn t necessarily prove it s related to life,  he said.  One thing that it fairly unambiguously proves is that it was associated with some life process if the amino acids are dominantly of one chiral form.  Amino acid molecules are chiral, that is, they have a rotational orientation. The rotational orientation of the molecules can be either right-handed or left-handed. All humans are composed of amino acids, but made of only one rotational orientation. Dasgupta said amino acids synthesized in a flask will be composed of equal amounts of both orientation, whereas something coming from a living system wholly or dominantly contains only one orientation (one chiral form).   This double helix of DNA, for example, makes other DNA molecules by complementing each other,  Dasgupta said.  So, it s like a mold. That handedness is preserved. Life is centered on one type of chirality. Our objective, if we can detect amino acids, is to separate the amino acids into chiral forms.   That means we ll be able to tell whether we have an excess of one chiral form over another, or dominantly just one chiral form. In that case, it would definitely be related to life.  Morteza Khaledi, dean of the UT Arlington College of Science, said Dasgupta s research extends the boundaries of analytical chemistry to outer space.  He will tackle the challenging problems of designing a portable system for liquid-based separation and detection of chiral amino acids in remote and rather hostile environments, Dean Khaledi said.    This is quite an exciting and important research from both fundamental analytical chemistry as well as potential for important discoveries in our search for evidence of life, as we know it, outside of our planet,  he said.  The grant is the latest in a series of recent national and international awards and honors that Dasgupta has earned for his work in chromatography.   UT Arlington has a distinguished history of working with NASA on various space missions,  said Duane Dimos, UT Arlington vice president for research.  This recent grant is a great example of taking advantage of Dr. Dasgupta s capabilities to contribute once more to the NASA mission.   ","Published: September 8, 2015"

The discovery confirms a long-standing hypothesis that interactions between mantle rocks and seawater can create potential for life even in hard rocks deep below the ocean floor. The fossilized microbes are likely the same as those found at the active Lost City hydrothermal field, providing potentially important clues about the conditions that support 'intraterrestrial' life in rocks below the seafloor.  We were initially looking at how seawater interacts with mantle rocks, and how that process generates hydrogen,  said Frieder Klein, an associate scientist at WHOI and lead author of the study.  But during our analysis of the rock samples, we discovered organic-rich inclusions that contained lipids, proteins and amino acids   the building blocks of life   mummified in the surrounding minerals.  This study, which was a collaborative effort between Klein, WHOI scientists Susan Humphris, Weifu Guo and William Orsi, Esther Schwarzenbach from Virginia Tech and Florence Schubotz from the University of Bremen, focused on mantle rocks that were originally exposed to seawater approximately 125 million years ago when a large rift split the massive supercontinent known as Pangaea. The rift, which eventually evolved into the Atlantic Ocean, pulled mantle rocks from Earth s interior to the seafloor, where they underwent chemical reactions with seawater, transforming the seawater into a hydrothermal fluid.  The hydrothermal fluid likely had a high pH and was depleted in carbon and electron acceptors,  Klein said.  These extreme chemical conditions can be challenging for microbes. However, the hydrothermal fluid contained hydrogen and methane and seawater contains dissolved carbon and electron acceptors. So when you mix the two in just the right proportions, you can have the ingredients to support life.  According to Dr. Everett Shock, a professor at Arizona State University s School of Earth and Science Exploration, the study underscores the influence major geologic processes can have on the prospect for life.  This research makes the connection all the way from convection of the mantle to the break-up of the continents to ultimately providing geochemical options for microbiology,  Shock said.  It s just such a nice demonstration of real-world geobiology with a lot of  geo  in it.  Drilling Deep The rock samples analyzed in the study were originally drilled from the Iberian continental margin off the coast of Spain and Portugal in 1993. During the expedition aboard the research vessel JOIDES Resolution operated by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP)   researchers drilled through 690 meters of mud and sediment deposited onto to the ocean floor to reach the ancient seafloor created during the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The drill samples had been stored in core repositories at room temperature for more than two decades, before Klein and his colleagues began their investigation and discovered the fossilized microbial remains.    Colonies of bacteria and archaea were feeding off the seawater-hydrothermal fluid mix and became engulfed in the minerals growing in the fractured rock,  Klein said.  This kept them completely isolated from the environment. The minerals proved to be the ultimate storage containers for these organisms, preserving their lipids and proteins for over 100 million years.   It s exciting that the research team was able to go back and examine samples that had been collected years ago for other reasons and find new discoveries,  Shock said.  There will always be active new drilling, but this study raises the possibility of there being a lot more out there in the way of existing samples that could be analyzed.  In the lab, samples from the rock interior had to be extracted since the outside of the drill core was stored under non-sterile conditions. So Klein and his colleagues took a number of careful steps to ensure the integrity of the sample interior wasn t compromised, and then analyzed the rocks with high-resolution microscopes, a confocal Raman spectrometer and a range of isotope techniques. A Link to the Lost City While Raman spectroscopy enabled Klein to verify the presence of amino acids, proteins and lipids in the samples, it did not provide enough detailed information to correlate them with other hydrothermal systems. The lipids were of particular interest to Klein since they tend to be better preserved over long timescales, and have been studied in a wide range of seafloor environments. This prompted Klein to ask Schubotz, an expert in lipid biomarker analysis at MARUM   Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen, if she could tease out further information about the lipids from these ancient rocks. Schubotz ran the lipids through an advanced liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometer system to separate out and identify their biochemical components. The analysis led to a remarkable discovery: the lipids from the Iberian margin match up with those from the Lost City hydrothermal field, which was discovered in 2000 in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during an expedition on board the WHOI-operated research vessel Atlantis. This is significant because researchers believe the Lost City is a present-day analog to ancient hydrothermal systems on early Earth where life may have emerged.  I was stoked when I saw Dr. Schubotz s email detailing the analytical results,  Klein said.  It was fascinating to find these particular biological substances   which had previously been found only at the Lost City hydrothermal field and in cold seeps   in rocks below the seafloor where life is extremely challenging. At that point we knew we were onto something really cool!  A Deeper Understanding According to Klein, confirmation that life is possible in mantle rocks deep below the seafloor may have important implications for understanding subseafloor life across a wide range of geologic environments.  All the ingredients necessary to drive these ecosystems were made entirely from scratch,  he said.  Similar systems have likely existed throughout most of Earth's history to the present day and possibly exist(ed) on other water-bearing rocky planetary bodies, such as Jupiter's moon Europa.  The study reinforces the idea that life springs up anywhere there is water, even in seemingly hostile geological environments   a tantalizing prospect as scientists find more and more water elsewhere in the solar system. But Klein contends that, while scientists have long understood many of the forces driving microbial life above the seafloor, there is still a great deal of uncertainty when it comes to understanding biogeochemical processes occurring in the oceanic basement.    In the future, we ll be trying to learn more about these particular microorganisms and what the environmental conditions were in the mixing zone in that location. We also plan to go to different places where we think similar processes may have taken place, such as along the Newfoundland margin, and analyze samples to see if we find similar signatures. Broadening this research could provide additional insights about Earth s history and the search for life in the solar system. ","Published: September 8, 2015"

The approval of Farydak marks the first time a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with epigenetic activity is available in the European Union (EU), providing a new treatment option for patients living with multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after standard-of-care therapy. ""Farydak is a welcome advance for people living with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma in Europe,"" said Philippe Moreau, MD, Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France. ""Patients with multiple myeloma often relapse or stop responding to treatments; Farydak offers a new mechanism of action, which may improve the effectiveness of response to standard-of-care treatment in patients."" Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, a type of white blood cell present in the bone marrow, and affects approximately 84,000 people in Europe. Farydak is the first HDAC inhibitor to show efficacy in multiple myeloma. As an HDAC inhibitor, its epigenetic activity may help restore cell function in patients with multiple myeloma. The EU approval of Farydak is based on efficacy and safety data in a subgroup analysis of 147 patients who had received at least two prior regimens, including bortezomib and an IMiD, during the Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter global registration trial, called PANORAMA-1 (PANobinostat ORAl in Multiple MyelomA), evaluating Farydak in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone against bortezomib and dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed and/or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The trial found that the median progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in this subgroup increased by 7.8 months in Farydak patients who had received prior treatment with both bortezomib and an IMiD (12.5 months; n=73), as compared to the placebo arm (4.7 months; n=74) (hazard ratio=0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.72]). The most common non-hematological adverse reactions included diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Treatment-emergent hematological toxicities included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia and lymphopenia. QTc prolongation of >480 and <500 msec was recorded in 1.3% of patients and change from baseline of >60 msec was observed in 0.8% of patients. No patients had an absolute QTc prolongation of >500 msec. Cardiac events (most frequently atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, palpitation and sinus tachycardia) were reported in 17.6% of the Farydak-treated patients versus 9.8% of placebo-treated patients and syncope events were reported in 6.0% versus 2.4%. Discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), regardless of causality, was observed in 36.2% of patients. The most common AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were diarrhea (4.5%), asthenia and fatigue (2.9% each) and pneumonia (1.3%). On treatment deaths not due to the study indication (multiple myeloma) were reported in 6.8% of Farydak-treated patients versus 3.2% of placebo-treated patients. ""With the approval of Farydak in the European Union, we hope to address critically important treatment needs faced by the multiple myeloma community-disease progression and treatment resistance,"" said Bruno Strigini, President, Novartis Oncology. ""This milestone, the approval of a first in its class treatment option for patients in need of new therapies, is the result of more than 13 years of dedicated research, which has helped us better understand the development of multiple myeloma."" Farydak in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone is also approved in the US, Chile and Japan for certain patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. The exact indication for Farydak varies by country. In the US, Farydak is approved in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior regimens, including bortezomib and an IMiD. Continued approval in the US may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.","Published: September 8, 2015"

Haemophilia A, a rare genetic disorder, occurs when an essential blood clotting protein called factor VIII is either not present in sufficient amounts or is defective. People with severe haemophilia A can be susceptible to uncontrolled or difficult to control bleeding including internal bleeding, especially into the joints, which can lead to the need for joint replacements. Therapy designation is designed to accelerate the development and review of medicines that demonstrate early clinical evidence of a substantial improvement over current treatment options for serious diseases. In a Phase I study, ACE910 showed promising results as a prophylactic treatment administered as a weekly subcutaneous injection in people with severe haemophilia A with and without inhibitors to factor VIII. The development of inhibitors is a serious complication of haemophilia A treatment regardless of disease severity, making it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding with traditional replacement therapies. Management of bleeding in people with haemophilia A who have inhibitors to factor VIII is a major challenge, and there remains a need for additional treatment options for these patients.  People with haemophilia A may require regular and frequent infusions of replacement clotting factor to reduce the risk of dangerous bleeding, and they can develop inhibitors that make replacement ineffective,  said Sandra Horning, M.D., Roche s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development.  We are pleased that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation for ACE910, recognizing an unmet need for patients with inhibitors and the promise of these early data. Roche has been developing antibody treatments for people with blood disorders for over 20 years, and we are excited to expedite the development of a potential new treatment for haemophilia A.  Roche is preparing to initiate a Phase III trial of ACE910 in patients with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors by the end of 2015 and a Phase III trial in patients without inhibitors in 2016. Additionally, a trial in paediatric patients with haemophilia A is planned to commence in 2016. The therapy designation for ACE910 was granted based on results of a Phase I study of ACE910 in people with severe haemophilia A presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in 2014, and the Phase I/II extension study of the same patients presented at the annual meeting of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) in 2015.","Published: September 8, 2015"

The study aimed to define a set of genes associated with 'healthy aging' in 65 year olds. Such a molecular profile could be useful for distinguishing people at earlier risk of age-related diseases. This could improve upon the use of chronological age and complement traditional indicators of disease, such as blood pressure. Lead author James Timmons, from King's College London, UK, said: ""We use birth year, or chronological age, to judge everything from insurance premiums to whether you get a medical procedure or not. Most people accept that all 60 year olds are not the same, but there has been no reliable test for underlying 'biological age'. ""Our discovery provides the first robust molecular 'signature' of biological age in humans and should be able to transform the way that 'age' is used to make medical decisions. This includes identifying those more likely to be at risk of Alzheimer's, as catching those at 'early' risk is key to evaluating potential treatments."" The researchers analyzed the RNA of healthy 65 year old subjects, and used the information to develop a signature of 150 RNA genes that indicated 'healthy aging'. The signature was found to be a reliable predictor for risk of age-related disease when studying RNA from tissues including human muscle, brain and skin. With this RNA signature, they developed a 'healthy age gene score' which they used to test and compare the RNA profiles of different individuals, and demonstrated that a greater score was associated with better health in men and women. The researchers studied RNA from healthy 70 year old subjects and analyzed follow-up health data over two decades. Despite all subjects being born within a year of each other, their RNA at around 70 years of age demonstrated a very wide distribution in 'healthy age gene score', varying over a four-fold range. This variation was shown to link to long term health. A greater gene score was also associated with better cognitive health and renal function across a 12 year span - both important determinants of mortality. In particular, they demonstrated that patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease had an altered 'healthy aging' RNA signature in their blood, and therefore a lower healthy age gene score, suggesting significant association with the disease. Timmons added: ""This is the first blood test of its kind that has shown that the same set of molecules are regulated in both the blood and the brain regions associated with dementia, and it can help contribute to a dementia diagnosis. This also provides strong evidence that dementia in humans could be called a type of 'accelerated aging' or 'failure to activate the healthy aging program'."" Given that early intervention is important in Alzheimer's and there is a need to identify those at greatest risk, the authors say that their 'healthy age gene score' could be integrated to help decide which middle-aged subjects could be offered entry into a preventative clinical trial many years before the clinical expression of Alzheimer's.

There are currently five medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat AD. However, these drugs only help mask the symptoms and do not stop the disease from progressing or treat the underlying disease. In a new study presented at the 14th International Conference on Endothelin: Physiology, Pathophysiology and Therapeutics that took place Sept 2-5 in Savannah, Georgia, USA, researchers used IRL-1620, a chemical that binds to endothelin B receptors, to treat AD in rats.

""We used the novel approach of stimulating the endothelin B receptors by intravenous injection of IRL-1620 to prevent and repair the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease,"" said study co-author Seema Briyal, PhD. Rats with AD showed impaired learning and memory and increased oxidative stress. ""We found that treatment with IRL-1620 reversed these effects. Intravenous injection with the drug improved memory deficit by 50 to 60 percent and reduced oxidative stress by 45 to 50 percent,"" Briyal explained.

The cause of motion sickness is still a mystery but a popular theory among scientists says it is to do with confusing messages received by our brains from both our ears and eyes, when we are moving. It is a very common complaint and has the potential to affect all of us, meaning we get a bit queasy on boats or rollercoasters. However, around three in ten people experience hard-to-bear motion sickness symptoms, such as dizziness, severe nausea, cold sweats, and more. Research from Imperial College London, published in the journal Neurology, shows that a mild electrical current applied to the scalp can dampen responses in an area of the brain that is responsible for processing motion signals. Doing this helps the brain reduce the impact of the confusing inputs it is receiving and so prevents the problem that causes the symptoms of motion sickness. This technique offers a safe and effective intervention that is likely to be available for anyone to buy, in the future. Dr Qadeer Arshad from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London led the research. He said: ""We are confident that within five to ten years people will be able to walk into the chemist and buy an anti-seasickness device. It may be something like a tens machine that is used for back pain. We hope it might even integrate with a mobile phone, which would be able to deliver the small amount of electricity required via the headphone jack. In either case, you would temporarily attach small electrodes to your scalp before traveling -- on a cross channel ferry, for example.""

It is a very common complaint and has to potential to affect all of us, meaning we get a bit queasy on boats or rollercoasters. However, around three in ten people experience hard-to-bear motion sickness symptoms, such as dizziness, severe nausea, cold sweats, and more. Research from Imperial College London shows that a mild electrical current applied to the scalp can dampen responses in an area of the brain that is responsible for processing motion signals. Doing this helps the brain reduce the impact of the confusing inputs it is receiving and so prevents the problem that causes the symptoms of motion sickness.This technique offers a safe and effective intervention that is likely to be available for anyone to buy, in the future. Dr Qadeer Arshad from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London led the research. He said:  We are confident that within five to ten years people will be able to walk into the chemist and buy an anti-seasickness device. It may be something like a tens machine that is used for back pain. We hope it might even integrate with a mobile phone, which would be able to deliver the small amount of electricity required via the headphone jack. In either case, you would temporarily attach small electrodes to your scalp before travelling   on a cross channel ferry, for example.  In the study, volunteers wore electrodes on their heads for about 10 minutes. They were then asked to sit in a motorised rotating chair that also tilts to simulate the motions that tend to make people sick on boats or rollercoasters.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genomeediting-position-statement-195975,Genome Editing Position Statement A group of leading UK research organisations has today issued an initial joint statement in support of the continued use of CRISPR Cas  and other genome editing techniques in preclinical research  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. This includes the use of the technology for research purposes in human reproductive cells and early embryos, where this is fully justified, scientifically and ethically, and within the confines of the law. The coalition of research funders and learned societies will continue to fund and support research of this kind, as well as studies that further progress and refine these technologies. The group has also called for widespread discussion among scientists, ethicists and the wider public about how these emerging techniques may in future be applied clinically, in human reproductive cells and early embryos, to treat or prevent serious genetic disease. Genome editing is a powerful research tool that allows sections of DNA in the genome to be precisely removed or replaced using  molecular scissors . The concept of genome editing is not new, but rapid developments in the technology   namely the emergence of the CRISPR-Cas9 system   mean that targeted, highly efficient editing of DNA in cells has become relatively simple. Our understanding of CRISPR-Cas9 is still at an early stage, and any potential treatments based on this technique are many years away. The first clinical applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are likely to involve editing the DNA in somatic (non-reproductive) cells   for example, by removing them from a patient and editing them in a lab to correct a harmful mutation before putting them back into the body. There is already some work in progress to do just this in diseases including HIV, sickle-cell disease and haemophilia, and emerging potential for cancer therapy. There has also been some suggestion that genome editing could be used clinically in the future to edit the DNA of human eggs and sperm, or early embryos (known as germline editing). The difference here is that any changes made would be passed on to future generations. This is prohibited under UK law and is unlikely to be allowed in any European jurisdiction at present. The UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act does permit the use of new technologies such as gene editing for non-clinical research purposes in germ cells, including human embryos up to 14 days old, where this is appropriately justified and supported by rigorous scientific and ethical review. Today s statement   signed by the Academy of Medical Science (AMS), the Association of Medical Research Charities (AMRC), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Wellcome Trust   says that this type of research to be allowed to continue and calls for a broad and inclusive discussion about genome editing and its future implications. Professor Sir John Tooke PMedSci, President of the AMS, said:  Genome editing is an evolving technology that has been used in the lab for many years to increase our understanding of disease mechanisms, and may provide the potential means to develop new medical treatments in the future. We believe such therapeutic use should be explored, but several scientific and ethical questions remain to be answered and much more evidence will be needed before an informed decision can be made about a particular application.  Aisling Burnand, Chief Executive of the AMRC, said:  Although currently at an early stage, this technology has the potential, in future decades, to help people with devastating diseases. Patients and their families will clearly want to be involved in discussions to consider the feasibility, safety and desirability of clinical applications as the research matures.  Professor Melanie Welham, BBSRC s Science Director, said:  Genome editing in a preclinical research setting can widen our understanding of basic biology, which is vital to underpin advances in prolonging healthy life and disease management.  Dr Rob Buckle, Director of Science Programmes at the MRC, said:  The UK s place as a global leader for research is underpinned by a strong regulatory framework. As genome editing technologies evolve it s vital that the regulatory framework remains robust and adapts so that the full potential of genome editing can be realised in a scientifically, ethical and legally rigorous way.  Katherine Littler, Senior Policy Advisor at the Wellcome Trust, said:  As with any emerging technology, the potential for genome editing to be applied as a therapeutic tool in future deserves careful consideration. It s essential that we start these discussions early, by engaging in an open and inclusive debate involving scientists, ethicists, doctors, regulators, patients and their families, and the wider public.

The findings suggest new approaches to developing treatments for MSA, which currently has no cure, but also raise a potential concern for clinicians or scientists who come in contact with MSA tissue. The new findings mark the first discovery of a human disease caused by a new prion in 50 years, since work at the National Institutes of Health in the 1960s showed that human brain tissue infected with CJD could transmit neurodegeneration to chimpanzees.It wasn t until 1982 that UCSF s Stanley Prusiner, MD, isolated the causative agent for a related disease called scrapie, found in sheep, and characterized it as a prion, for  infectious protein.  He then determined that the same prion protein caused bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or  mad cow  disease, in cattle, and so-called  variant  CJD in humans who subsequently consumed BSE-contaminated beef or other tissues. At first, the idea that a simple protein could replicate and spread disease was dismissed by the scientific community, as a tenet of modern biology held that only viruses and living microbes such as bacteria could transmit disease. But subsequent work by Prusiner and others led to an understanding of how prions function at a molecular level. Prusiner, a professor of neurology and director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases (IND) at UCSF, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in 1997. Prion researchers have since suggested that similar misfolded proteins may contribute to more common forms of neurodegeneration, such as Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease.  Now we ve conclusively shown that a new type of prion causes MSA,  said UCSF s Kurt Giles, DPhil, associate professor of neurology, IND researcher and senior author on the second of the two new studies.  This is our mark in the sand.  Sometimes compared to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the original prion protein identified by Prusiner as being responsible for CJD, known as PrP, can exist in two forms: one harmless and the other fatal. PrP prions in the dangerous, misfolded form latch on to other nearby PrP molecules, causing them to lose their normal shape and initiating a chain reaction that results in sticky, insoluble plaques throughout the brain that kill off cells and result in the typical  spongy  appearance of CJD-affected brains. In the new research Prusiner, Giles, post-doctoral researcher Amanda Woerman, PhD, and an international team of colleagues report that a misfolded version of a protein called alpha-synuclein seems to act in a similar way to transmit MSA from diseased human brain tissue to mice and to human cell cultures. First described in 1960, MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is rare but more common than CJD: it annually affects 3 out of 100,000 people over the age of 50. Its early symptoms can be mistaken for those of Parkinson s disease, and include movement and balance problems, as well as loss of bladder control, blood-pressure regulation and other functions governed by the autonomic nervous system. Unlike Parkinson s patients, who often live 10 to 20 years after their diagnosis, MSA patients typically die within five to 10 years and do not respond to the drugs or deep brain stimulation used for Parkinson s symptoms. As in Parkinson s disease, neurodegeneration in MSA is accompanied by a buildup of clumps of alpha-synuclein protein within brain cells. Both MSA and PD can arise sporadically in families with no history of the disease, but some inherited forms are associated with mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene. While the mechanisms aren't fully understood, researchers believe these mutations predispose the normal proteins to misfold into infectious prions. Other factors, such as cellular stress and the aging process also are thought to make misfoldings more likely. The new work has its origins in experiments conducted in Prusiner s lab in 2013, showing that samples of brain tissue from two human MSA patients were able to transmit the disease to a mouse model for Parkinson s disease, expressing a mutant human alpha-synuclein gene. To confirm this finding, Prusiner and colleagues expanded this experiment to include tissue samples from a dozen more MSA victims from tissue banks on three continents: the Massachusetts Alzheimer s Disease Research Center in Boston, the Parkinson s UK Brain Bank at Imperial College London, and the Sydney Brain Bank in Australia. The results were the same: When exposed to human MSA tissue, the mice developed neurodegeneration. In addition, the team found that the brains of infected mice contained abnormally high levels of insoluble human alpha-synuclein, and that infected mouse brain tissue could itself spread the disease to other mice. The discovery that alpha-synuclein prions can transmit MSA raises a public health concern about treatments and research that involve contact with brain tissue from neurodegeneration patients, because standard disinfection techniques that kill microbes do not eliminate the PrP prions that cause CJD. Whether the same challenges hold for alpha-synuclein prions in MSA remains to be determined. The authors write that clinicians and researchers should adopt much more stringent safety protocols when dealing with tissue from patients with MSA and other neurodegenerative diseases, many of which they believe may also be caused by prions. For instance, MSA is frequently initially diagnosed as Parkinson s disease, which is often treated with deep-brain stimulation. The disease could potentially be transmitted to other patients if deep-brain stimulation equipment is reused.  You can t kill a protein,  Giles said.  And it can stick tightly to stainless steel, even when the surgical instrument is cleaned.  As a result, he said,  We re advocating a precautionary approach. People are living longer and likely getting more brain surgeries. There could be undiagnosed neurodegenerative diseases that   if they re caused by prions   mean infection could be a real worry.  Unlike the danger of BSE from contaminated beef, the researchers stress that there is no apparent risk of infection by MSA prions outside of specialized medical or research settings. In the earlier of the group s two  papers published this month, Woerman led a research team in the development of a rapid new method to test prion transmission using human cell cultures. The team demonstrated that it only takes four days for human MSA tissue to infect cultured cells with alpha-synuclein mutations, in contrast to the 120 days it takes for the disease to spread to mouse models.  The challenge of studying neurodegeneration is that it s a disease of aging,  Woerman said.  You have to let the mouse models develop for such a long time that research on cures is really slow to progress. Now, with these cell models, we can test how to inactivate alpha-synuclein aggregates at a speed that just wouldn t be feasible in animals.  The UCSF researchers are working with Japanese pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo, as part of a collaboration established in 2014 to develop potential treatments for prion diseases.","Published: September 7, 2015"

It does this by creating small strands of RNA called CRISPR RNAs, which match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas9 proteins that cut the DNA. In recent years, the CRISPR-Cas system has garnered a great deal of attention in the research community for its potential use as a gene editing tool   with the CRISPR RNA identifying the targeted portion of the relevant DNA, and the Cas protein cleaving it. But for Cas9 to do its work, it must first find its way into the cell. This work focused on demonstrating the potential of a new vehicle for directly introducing the CRISPR-Cas9 complex   the entire gene-editing tool   into a cell. Traditionally, researchers deliver DNA into a targeted cell to make the CRISPR RNA and Cas9 inside the cell itself   but that limits control over its dosage,  says Chase Beisel, co-senior author of the paper and an assistant professor in the department of chemical and biomolecular engineering at NC State.  By directly delivering the Cas9 protein itself, instead of turning the cell into a Cas9 factory, we can ensure that the cell receives the active editing system and can reduce problems with unintended editing.   Our delivery mechanism resembles a ball of yarn, or clew, so we call it a nanoclew,  says Zhen Gu, co-senior author of the paper and an assistant professor in the joint biomedical engineering program at NC State and UNC-CH.  Because the nanoclew is made of a DNA-based material, it is highly biocompatible. It also self-assembles, which makes it easy to customize.  The nanoclews are made of a single, tightly-wound strand of DNA. The DNA is engineered to partially complement the relevant CRISPR RNA it will carry, allowing the CRISPR-Cas9 complex   a CRISPR RNA bound to a Cas9 protein   to loosely attach itself to the nanoclew.  Multiple CRISPR-Cas complexes can be attached to a single nanoclew,  says Wujin Sun, lead author of the study and Ph.D. student in Gu s lab. When the nanoclew comes into contact with a cell, the cell absorbs the nanoclew completely   swallowing it and wrapping it in a protective sheath called an endosome. But the nanoclews are coated with a positively-charged polymer that breaks down the endosome, setting the nanoclew free inside the cell. The CRISPR-Cas9 complexes can then free themselves from the nanoclew to make their way to the nucleus. And once a CRISPR-Cas9 complex reaches the nucleus, gene editing begins. To test the nanoclew CRISPR-Cas delivery system, the researchers treated cancer cell cultures and tumors in mice. The relevant cancer cells had been modified to express a fluorescent protein. In short, they glowed. The CRISPR RNAs on the nanoclews were designed to target the DNA in the cancer cell that was responsible for making the fluorescent proteins. If the glowing stopped, the nanoclews worked.  And they did work. More than a third of cancer cells stopped expressing the fluorescent protein,  Beisel says.  This study is a proof of concept, and additional work needs to be done   but it s very promising,  Gu says.","Published: September 7, 2015"

They did so by shutting down a liver protein involved in making glucose, an approach that may work in patients with type 2 diabetes. ""We think this strategy could lead to more effective drugs for type 2 diabetes,"" said principal investigator Brian N. Finck, PhD, associate professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatrics and Nutritional Science. ""A drug that shuts down glucose production has the potential to help millions of people affected by the most common form of diabetes."" Finck worked with researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the biopharmaceutical company Metabolic Solutions Development Co. The company is involved in clinical trials that are evaluating the drug compound MSDC-0602 as a treatment for diabetes. The new study demonstrates that the compound works, at least in part, by inhibiting a protein that's key to glucose production in the liver. The research team, led by first author Kyle S. McCommis, PhD, a postdoctoral research scholar, cut sugar production in liver cells by inhibiting a key protein involved in transporting pyruvate, a building block of glucose, from the bloodstream into the energy factories of liver cells, called mitochondria. Previous research had suggested interfering with pyruvate may limit glucose production in the liver, but this study is the first to demonstrate the critical role played by the pyruvate transport protein. In addition to diabetes, the researchers also think that interfering with pyruvate transport may help patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition common in people with obesity.","Published: September 7, 2015"

The finding emphasizes the value of such research, says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, the professor of pathobiological sciences whose group performed the work. Currently, most flu vaccines are manufactured using fertilized chicken eggs as crucibles to grow vaccine viruses   viruses that are a good match for anticipated seasonal or pandemic flu strains. Flu viruses are grown in the eggs, deactivated with chemicals, and purified to create the raw material for a vaccine.However, because avian influenza can strike the flocks used to produce the millions of eggs required worldwide to make vaccines, serious outbreaks of avian flu could impede vaccine production. New seasonal flu vaccines must be produced each year. Vaccines to protect against more worrisome potential pandemic strains of avian influenza are mass produced and stockpiled every few years based on surveillance of the ever-evolving strains of avian flu circulating in fowl worldwide. Another key drawback to the use of chicken eggs is that the antigenic qualities of the vaccine virus, chosen to be as close a match as possible for an anticipated strain of flu, can change during incubation. The result is a less effective vaccine, such as the one widely used for the 2014-15 flu season, which was less effective due to changes in the circulating virus itself as well as antigenic changes to the vaccine virus propagated in eggs. Moreover, the new technology promises vaccines that do not pose a problem for those who are allergic to eggs. Technology to produce flu vaccines using mammalian cell cultures already exists, but in its current form is less efficient than making vaccines in eggs. The new high-yield method was devised by Kawaoka's group before the federal government imposed a moratorium on such work in October 2014. Contributing significantly to the work was Jihui Ping, a research scientist in the UW-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine. ""Depending on the strain, we can get between a twofold and tenfold increase in production using mammalian cells,"" Kawaoka says. ""Even a twofold increase is substantial for vaccine production."" In addition to sidestepping the limitations of egg-based vaccine production, the technology is potentially more nimble as vaccine production can be altered or ramped up more easily. ""You can scale up cell-based vaccine production very quickly,"" explains Kawaoka, one of the world's foremost experts on influenza. The new technology hinges on viruses engineered to replicate more efficiently in mammalian cells. By looking for genetic mutations that foster more efficient growth in cells and building those systematically into a backbone vaccine virus, the Wisconsin group was able to produce the high-yield vaccine viruses. ""We simply looked for strains that grow well in mammalian cells and picked those mutations that contribute to high yield,"" Kawaoka explains. A patent for the new high-yield vaccine technology is being sought by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation(WARF). Commercialization of the new method for making flu vaccines could help fuel a switch from egg-based vaccine production, according to Kawaoka. ""Existing strains of flu vaccine virus don't grow well in cells and there is only one company in the United States currently using cell-based production methods,"" notes Kawaoka. ""But there is a trend toward cell-based production and we think this work can contribute to that.""","Published: September 7, 2015"

""Materials can be formed using just a trial-and-error method of combining things to see what results, but it's better and more efficient if you can first predict what the structure is like and then design a protein to form that kind of material,"" he says. The researchers entered the properties of the protein DNA nanowire they wanted into a computer program developed in the lab; the program then generated a sequence of amino acids (protein building blocks) and nitrogenous bases (DNA building blocks) that would produce the desired material. However, successfully making a hybrid material is not as simple as just plugging some properties into a computer program, Mou says. Although the computer model provides a sequence, the researcher must thoroughly check the model to be sure that the sequence produced makes sense; if not, the researcher must provide the computer with information that can be used to correct the model. ""So in the end, you choose the sequence that you and the computer both agree on. Then, you can physically mix the prescribed amino acids and DNA bases to form the nanowire."" The resulting sequence was an artificial version of a protein DNA coupling that occurs in nature. In the initial stage of gene expression, called transcription, a sequence of DNA is first converted into RNA. To pull in the enzyme that actually transcribes the DNA into RNA, proteins called transcription factors must first bind certain regions of the DNA sequence called protein-binding domains. Using the computer program, the researchers engineered a sequence of DNA that contained many of these protein-binding domains at regular intervals. They then selected the transcription factor that naturally binds to this particular protein-binding site the transcription factor called Engrailed from the fruit fly Drosophila. However, in nature, Engrailed only attaches itself to the protein-binding site on the DNA. To create a long nanowire made of a continuous strand of protein attached to a continuous strand of DNA, the researchers had to modify the transcription factor to include a site that would allow Engrailed also to bind to the next protein in line. ""Essentially, it's like giving this protein two hands instead of just one,"" Mou explains. ""The hand that holds the DNA is easy because it is provided by nature, but the other hand needs to be added there to hold onto another protein."" Another unique attribute of this new protein DNA nanowire is that it employs coassembly meaning that the material will not form until both the protein components and the DNA components have been added to the solution. Although materials previously could be made out of DNA with protein added later, the use of coassembly to make the hybrid material was a first. This attribute is important for the material's future use in medicine or industry, Mou says, as the two sets of components can be provided separately and then combined to make the nanowire whenever and wherever it is needed. This finding builds on earlier work in the Mayo lab, which, in 1997, created one of the first artificial proteins, thus launching the field of computational protein design. The ability to create synthetic proteins allows researchers to develop proteins with new capabilities and functions, such as therapeutic proteins that target cancer. The creation of a coassembled protein DNA nanowire is another milestone in this field. ""Our earlier work focused primarily on designing soluble, protein-only systems. The work reported here represents a significant expansion of our activities into the realm of nanoscale mixed biomaterials,"" Mayo says. Although the development of this new biomaterial is in the very early stages, the method, Mou says, has many promising applications that could change research and clinical practices in the future. ""Our next step will be to explore the many potential applications of our new biomaterial,"" Mou says. ""It could be incorporated into methods to deliver drugs into cells to create targeted therapies that only bind to a certain biomarker on a certain cell type, such as cancer cells. We could also expand the idea of protein DNA nanowires to protein RNA nanowires that could be used for gene therapy applications. And because this material is brand-new, there are probably many more applications that we haven't even considered yet.""  ","Published: September 7, 2015"

Through large-scale genetic analyses of a family with two affected children at SciLifeLab in Stockholm, mutations were identified in the gene encoding the transport protein KCC2. In a collaboration with scientists at the University College London, another family with children carrying mutations in the same gene was further identified. Two of the children in each family demonstrated similar symptoms that can be connected to a severe variant of infant epilepsy with MPSI (Migrating Partial Seizures of Infancy).  Epilepsy occurs in many different forms. Earlier associations with KCC2 have been observed, such as a downregulation of the protein after brain damage that increases the tendency for seizures, but firm evidence for this disease mechanism has been lacking so far , says Anna Wedell, senior physician at Karolinska University Hospital and professor at the Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery at Karolinska Institutet.  Through our discovery we have been able to prove that a defective function of the KCC2 protein causes epilepsy and hence that an imbalance in the brain s chloride ion regulation system can be the reason behind the disease. The next step is to investigate to which extent this imbalance occurs in more common variants of epilepsy.  KCC2 constitutes a chloride channel specifically localized in the brain and have earlier been shown to play a major role in synaptic inhibition by maintaining a low concentration of chloride ions inside the neurons. Normally the amount of KCC2 increases shortly after birth, causing the signal substance GABA to switch from being stimulating to being inhibitory. GABA remain stimulatory  Mutations in the gene encoding KCC2 prevent this switch which makes GABA remain stimulatory, incapable of inhibiting the signals of the brain , says Dr. Wedell.  The neurons then discharge at times, when they normally should not, giving rise to epilepsy.  By conducting detailed investigations of cells expressing both the normal and the mutated forms of KCC2, the scientists demonstrated that the identified mutations led to disrupted chloride ion regulation and that an imbalance in this system thus brings about severe infant epilepsy, a potentially treatable disease.  Clinical trials are ongoing with a drug that, if successful, will compensate for the disrupted regulation and ameliorate the disease in small children with epilepsy, says Dr. Wedell.

This molecule dampens down the immune system s normal response to attack faulty cells, which helps cancer to hide. It is a trick that allows the tumour to thrive and may explain why some immunotherapy treatments have not been as effective as hoped. Aspirin is part of a group of molecules called COX inhibitors, which stop the production of PGE2 and help reawaken the immune system. Combining immunotherapy with aspirin or other COX inhibitors substantially slowed bowel and melanoma skin cancer growth in mice, compared to immunotherapy alone*. Study author Professor Caetano Reis e Sousa, senior group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, said:  We ve added to the growing evidence that some cancers produce PGE2 as a way of escaping the immune system. If you can take away cancer cells  ability to make PGE2 you effectively lift this protective barrier and unleash the full power of the immune system.  Giving patients COX inhibitors like aspirin at the same time as immunotherapy could potentially make a huge difference to the benefit they get from treatment. It s still early work but this could help make cancer immunotherapy even more effective, delivering life-changing results for patients.  Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK s chief clinician, said:  PGE2 acts on many different cells in our body, and this study suggests that one of these actions is to tell our immune system to ignore cancer cells. Once you stop the cancer cells from producing it, the immune system switches back to  kill mode  and attacks the tumour.  This research was carried out in mice so there is still some way to go before we will see patients being given COX inhibitors as part of their treatment. But it s an exciting finding that could offer a simple way to dramatically improve the response to treatment in a range of cancers. ","Published: September 7, 2015"

The novel anti-inflammatory drug, SAN101, is being developed by a team of scientists and clinicians at the School of Pharmacy and the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Queen s, alongside colleagues at Trinity College Dublin (TCD). It is the result of an initial discovery made over 6 years ago at Queen s. The research was funded by a major grant from the Medical Research Council awarded in 2012, following initial support from the Public Health Agency (PHA) HSC R&D Division. Sepsis is one of the most frequent cause of death in hospitalised patients, with an estimated 19 million cases worldwide every year and around 8 million deaths. The condition claims 37,000 lives in the UK every year and costs the NHS around  2.5 billion annually. There may be up to 45,000 cases of ARDS each year in the UK and Ireland and up to 22,000 deaths. The team at Queen s have developed a nanoparticle that binds to immune cells in the body and inhibits the excessive cycle of inflammation which drives the development of sepsis and ARDS. This new approach has the potential to reduce the impact of sepsis and ARDS in acutely ill patients. Professor Chris Scott from Queen s School of Pharmacy said:  Through this research we are well on the road to developing a medical treatment for sepsis and ARDS.  Sepsis arises when the body s immune system goes into overdrive, setting off a series of reactions including widespread inflammation. This inflammation can lead to a significant decrease in blood pressure, which inhibits blood supply to vital organs and can lead to multiple organ failure.  A frequent complication of sepsis is ARDS   where the lungs can't provide enough oxygen for the rest of the body. Up to 25 per cent of patients with severe sepsis will develop ARDS and up to half of these patients will die.  What we have developed is an anti-inflammatory nanoparticle   a microscopic particle that binds itself to cells called  macrophages , which are often found at the site of an infection. We have found that this nanoparticle essentially blocks inflammation and interrupts the chain of reactions that lead to severe sepsis and ARDS.  Dr Adrien Kissenpfennig from the Centre for infection and Immunity said  This is an exciting study demonstrating the effectiveness of a novel nanoparticle formulation in mouse pre-clinical models of sepsis and a new ex-vivo human lung model of ARDS. This necessary research represents an essential milestone in the development of SAN101, paving the way for continued development towards eventual evaluation in patients.  Professor Danny McAuley from the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Queen s is the lead clinician on the study. He said:  At present, there is no effective treatment for either sepsis or ARDS. There is a huge clinical need for a drug to fight the inflammation caused by sepsis and ARDS that causes so much damage to the body. Through this research, we are well on our way to developing that drug and, with the right funding and strategic partnerships, we could see it being trialled in patients in as little as two or three years. This is an exciting development and an excellent example of the potentially life-changing and life-saving impact of Queen s research.  Professor Scott will be presenting the development of SAN101 at the Applied Pharmaceutical Sciences of Great Britain Conference in Nottingham on the 9th September 2015. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, HSC R&D Division, Public Health Agency said:  This exciting development in critical care research clearly demonstrates the value of investment in early stage translational research projects - such as those supported through the HSC R&D Division Translational Research Groups.  I am delighted that the funding provided by HSC R&D Division has helped the team to achieve these promising results which have the potential to significantly improve the outcomes for patients with sepsis and ARDS.

But a new study by UCLA faculty questions the value of screening for the genetic mutations in the general population   including those who do not have cancer or have no family history of the disease   because of the high cost. The UCLA researchers found that compared with universal screening, other diagnostic tools remain more efficient and might be more cost-effective.  The paper was authored by Dr. Patricia Ganz, director of the division of cancer prevention and control research at UCLA s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Elisa Long, assistant professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. The researchers concluded the BRCA genetic test that is most widely used today   marketed by Myriad Genetics, it sells for about $4,000   is too expensive to warrant universal screening, given how rare BRCA mutations are.  The cost of BRCA testing would need to drop by 90 percent for testing to be cost-effective for the whole population,  Ganz said. Long and Ganz calculated that for every 10,000 women screened, BRCA screening could avert  four cases of breast cancer and two cases of ovarian cancer more than family history-based testing would. But the BRCA screening would only extend patients  life by an average of two days. For 99.75 percent of women screened, a negative genetic test offers no increase in life expectancy, nor would it eliminate the need for regular mammograms, and it could provide false reassurance that a woman is not at risk for breast cancer. The study builds upon previous work by other researchers that analyzed genetic screening of women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, a population in which one out of every 50 women carries a harmful mutation. Because a larger percentage of this group were identified as BRCA mutation carriers, Long and Ganz  found that the approach would yield an estimated 62 breast and 34 ovarian cancers averted per 10,000 women tested, and gains in life expectancy that were 16 times higher than with universal screening.   Of the 233,000 breast cancers diagnosed annually in the United States, only 5 to 10 percent are attributable to mutations in the BRCA genes. Women with breast cancer who carry these mutated genes usually develop the disease at a younger age, often in both breasts, and the cancer is often a more aggressive sub-type such as triple-negative breast cancer. Harmful BRCA gene mutations are more likely to be found in families affected by breast and ovarian cancers, and carriers can pass the mutated genes to both daughters and sons. Those who carry a BRCA mutation are thought to have a 45 to 80 percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Women carrying the BRCA-1 mutation have up to a 39 percent lifetime risk; women with BRCA-2 have a 10 to 17 percent lifetime risk for ovarian cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises BRCA genetic testing only for women with a known family history of breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer. Long said that although the Myriad test remains the most commonly used test for BRCA mutations, a new $249 test recently announced by Color Genomics could encourage other companies to introduce lower-cost genetic tests   which could make universal screening more practical and more affordable. She noted, however, that questions would remain about the feasibility of providing personalized genetic counseling services on such a large scale.  It s like looking for a needle in a haystack,  Long said.  If only 1 in 400 women across the country have one or both of the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutations, universal screening would cost $1 million to $2 million to detect a single BRCA mutation, or nearly $400 billion to screen all women in the U.S. Perhaps this money could be better spent on other diagnostic tools for young women, such as MRIs, to have the greatest impact.  Long has a personal connection to the BRCA-1 mutation. She herself is a carrier, and last year, at just 33 years of age, she was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, the most aggressive form of the disease. She had no family history of breast cancer. Her treatment consisted of six rounds of chemotherapy, a bilateral mastectomy and reconstructive breast surgery. Fortunately, the chemotherapy killed the cancer before her first surgery, increasing her five-year survival probability from 60 to 95 percent. In July, Long also had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, which reduced her risk of ovarian cancer to less than 5 percent.  On a personal level, I would have benefitted tremendously from universal BRCA testing, because I had no family history of breast cancer,  Long said.  But as a health services researcher I must also consider the relative value of different medical interventions. Many patients wish to know more about their genetic risk factors, and as more firms begin to offer genetic testing, we should expect the price to decrease, eventually making this an affordable policy.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/phosphorous-fertilizer-205358,Phosphorous Fertilizer UD researchers identify behaviors of nanoparticle that shows promise as nanofertilizer   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at the University of Delaware have discovered unique behaviors of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) that show promise as a phosphorus nanofertilizer and could be used to help slow the release of phosphorous in soils. This would both increase phosphorous uptake efficiencies in the growing of plants and also in protecting environmentally sensitive sites, including bodies of water, by reducing nutrient loading, which is important because phosphorous is a nonrenewable resource and an essential nutrient for agricultural production.  Funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the research was conducted by Dengjun Wang, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences in UD s College of Agriculture and Natural Resources; Yan Jin, professor of plant and soil sciences with a joint appointment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; and Deb Jaisi, assistant professor of plant and soil sciences with a joint appointment in the Department of Geological Sciences. The HANPs are known as a strong sorbent for contaminants such as heavy metals and radionuclides and are already being used to remediate soils, sediments and ground waters. However, its potential as a better phosphorous fertilizer in agriculture has just started to be fully explored, the researchers said. The nanoparticle-based fertilizer has three major advantages over conventional phosphorous fertilizers in that it does not release phosphorous as quickly as the conventional fertilizers, it does not change soil pH upon phosphorous release and the loss of phosphorous from soil is low. The slow and steady release of phosphorous allows plants to continuously take up the nutrient as they grow.  Jaisi said that the way phosphorous is currently applied to soils in fertilizer is like someone taking a glucose tablet as opposed to receiving it through an IV drip. While a commercial phosphorous fertilizer hits the soil all at once and does not allow sufficient time for plant uptake, resulting in phosphorous loss in runoff or by leaching, the HANPs provide a slow release of phosphorous for an extended period of time.    When phosphorous is released from HANPs, it does not increase soil acidity,  said Jaisi.  There was an issue of global soil acidification after the Green (agriculture) Revolution, a direct consequence from the application of chemical fertilizers. The cost of reversing soil pH to optimal for crop production is extremely high.  As the demand to provide food for a growing population has increased, so has the application of phosphorous fertilizers, which has led to phosphorous loss from agricultural soils to open waters and has caused eutrophication in environmentally sensitive areas like the Chesapeake Bay. With the ability of HANPs to release phosphorous slowly, the nanoparticles could prove to be environmentally beneficial by reducing phosphorous loss to open waters.  You can minimize that risk and at the same time, increase the availability of phosphorous for a longer period of time during plant growth,  said Jin.  I think the goal would be to explore whether this is a feasible form of phosphorous fertilizer to be used at large scales,  she added.  We ve been applying a lot of phosphorous to soil for many years, and the available source is diminishing. We need to find new products and new ways of supplying the nutrient, while at the same time minimizing environmental impacts.   A major objective of this work,  Jaisi said,  was to look at the fate of these nanoparticles -- if the nanoparticles themselves move away from the soil to open waters or if they remain in the soil, and how they interact with other nanoparticles in the soil. This is important because for the best utilization of phosphorous, HANPs have to remain in soil for an extended time and not be lost via runoff or by leaching.  Wang said the HANPs have low mobility, and the presence of other nanoparticles in the soil, such as positively charged iron oxides that are ubiquitous in soil and other subsurface environments, would fix themselves to the negatively charged HANP particles and slow down their movement.  Jin explained that in order for plants to take up the phosphorous from HANPs, it needs to be released from the nanoparticles.  When plants grow, they continuously release different types of low molecular weight organic acids such as oxalic acid and citric acid. The acids that get into the soil will interact with those particles so that phosphorous can be released and be taken up by plants,  said Jin.  Wang said the process is very dynamic.  The plant continuously releases organic acids and these organic acids will dissolve the HANPs making phosphorous available for the plant. The release rate in the presence of these organic acids and the possibility of HANPs being a phosphorous fertilizer are currently being investigated by the research team.  In reaching their conclusions, the team examined how HANPs interact with a naturally occurring goethite nanoparticles (GNPs), a common iron oxide in soils, to investigate the co-transport and retention of HANPs and GNPs in water-saturated sand columns under environmentally relevant transport conditions.  Wang said that the nanoparticle with which the group works is very small, ranging from one nanometer to 100 nanometers, with one nanometer being about 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.    These very tiny particles have large specific surface areas and high reactivity; they are quite fantastic to a variety of applications in various fields, including agriculture,  he said.

Now, researchers at the University of Missouri have found an effective way to edit the genes of mosquitoes.  Shengzhang Dong, postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology of the MU College of Veterinary Medicine, says this new technique opens the door for future research into genetically modifying mosquitoes so they cannot carry and transmit viruses and parasites that are harmful to humans.  By successfully editing specific genes in the Aedes aegytpi, the mosquito species which transmits the dengue virus, we have established techniques which can be used in future research to target the virus-carrying capabilities of this mosquito,  said Dong, who is the first author of the study.For their study, Dong and his colleagues used the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, and adapted it for use in mosquitoes to disrupt the blue fluorescent eye color gene in a previously generated genetically-modified mosquito line, which originally expressed both fluorescent blue and red color genes in their eyes.  As a consequence, future generations of these mosquitoes no longer showed the blue color, but still showed the red color expression in their eyes. This new trait was stably inherited over several mosquito generations.  While, for this study, we simply disrupted a fluorescent marker in the eyes of mosquitoes using CRISPR/Cas9, we were able to prove that this system can be used to perform more impactful gene edits in the future,  Dong said. Alexander Franz, an assistant professor of veterinary pathobiology at MU and senior author of the study, says future research using this established technique could search for ways to genetically edit mosquitoes so they cannot harbor diseases like dengue.  Infection of a mosquito with a human pathogen, such as dengue virus, alters the gene expression profile of the mosquito due to innate immune responses produced by the insect,  Franz said.  These complex genetic interactions are not well understood. However, being able to knock out an individual mosquito gene that responds to the presence of a virus will allow researchers to understand the gene s underlying molecular mechanism in order to find ways to genetically block virus infection in the mosquito.  Franz says in the case of viruses such as dengue, blocking the ability for the virus to reproduce in the mosquito will interrupt the viral disease cycle with the consequence that humans no longer become infected when bitten by the mosquito.","Published: September 7, 2015"

The study -- conducted in nonhuman primates with brain structures and functions similar to those of humans -- found that the antidepressant sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) marketed as Zoloft, significantly increased the volume of one brain region in depressed subjects but decreased the volume of two brain areas in non-depressed subjects. ""These observations are important for human health because Zoloft is widely prescribed for a number of disorders other than depression,"" said Carol A. Shively, Ph.D., professor of pathology-comparative medicine at Wake Forest Baptist and lead author of the study, published in the current online issue of the journal Neuropharmacology. In the study, 41 middle-aged female monkeys were fed a diet formulated to replicate that consumed by many Americans for 18 months, during which time depressive behavior in the animals was recorded. Female monkeys were chosen for this study because depression is nearly twice as common in women as men and the use of antidepressants is most common in women ages 40 to 59. After the 18-month pre-study phase, the monkeys were divided into two groups balanced for body weight, body mass index and depressive behavior. For the next 18 months, 21 monkeys received sertraline in daily doses comparable to those taken by humans while a group of 20 received a placebo. This treatment regimen is analogous to a human taking an antidepressant for approximately five years. MRI images taken at the end of the treatment phase revealed that in depressed subjects the drug significantly increased the volume of one region of the brain, the anterior cingulate cortex, while decreasing the volume of this same region and the hippocampus in non-depressed subjects. Both of these areas are highly interconnected with other areas of the brain; are critical in a wide array of functions including memory, learning, spatial navigation, will, motivation and emotion; and are implicated in major depressive disorder. In humans, Shively said, volume differences in neural structures have been noted in depressed and non-depressed individuals, with the most commonly reported differences being smaller volumes of the cingulate cortex and hippocampus in depressed people. One potential mechanism through which drugs such as Zoloft can be effective as antidepressants is by promoting neuron growth and connectivity in these brain regions. But SSRIs, including Zoloft, are prescribed for a variety of disorders besides depression, including bulimia, hot flashes, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, stroke recovery and sexual dysfunction, and there are no studies of the effects of these drugs on brain volumes in individuals not diagnosed with depression. ""The study's findings regarding the different effects of sertraline on brain-region volumes in depressed versus non-depressed subjects are compelling,"" Shively said. ""But given the number of different disorders for which SSRIs are prescribed, the findings need to be investigated further in patient populations to see if these drugs produce similar effects in humans.""

When a jogger sets out on his evening run, the active movements of his arms and legs are accompanied by involuntary changes in the position of the head relative to the rest of the body. Yet the jogger does not experience feelings of dizziness like those induced in the passive riders of a rollercoaster, who have no control over the abrupt dips and swoops to which they are exposed. The reason for the difference lies in the vestibular organ (VO) located in the inner ear, which controls balance and posture. The VO senses ongoing self-motion and ensures that, while running, the jogger unconsciously compensates for the accompanying changes in the orientation of the head. The capacity to adapt and respond appropriately to both slight and substantial displacements of the head in turn implies that the sensory hair cells in the inner ear can react to widely varying stimulus intensities. In collaboration with Dr. John Simmers at the Centre national de la recherche scientifiqu (CNRS) at the University of Bordeaux, neurobiologists Dr. Boris Chagnaud, Roberto Banchi and Professor Hans Straka at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit t M nchen's (LMU) Department of Biology II, have now shown, for the first time, how this feat is achieved. Their findings reveal that cells in the spinal cord which generate the rhythmic patterns of neural and muscle activity required for locomotion also adaptively alter the sensitivity of the hair cells in the VO, enabling them to respond appropriately to the broad range of incoming signal amplitudes. The results are reported in the online journal  Nature Communications . As Boris Chagnaud points out,  we are not really aware of what movement actually involves because our balance organs react immediately to alterations in posture and head position. The hair cells, which detect the resulting changes in fluid flow in the semicircular canals in the inner ear, enable us to keep our balance without any conscious effort.  Using tadpoles as an experimental model system, the researchers investigated how the hair cells manage to sense both low- and high-amplitude movements and produce the signals that control the appropriate compensatory response. The tadpole s balance organs operate on the same principle as the bilateral VOs in humans, and the nerve circuits responsible for communication between the hair cells and the motor neurons in the spinal cord are organized in essentially identical ways. When a tadpole initiates a voluntary movement, e.g., begins to swim by moving its tail from side to side, nerve cells in the spinal cord send copies of the motor commands to so-called efferent neurons in the brainstem that project to the hair cells in the inner ear.  The effect of this signal is to reduce the sensitivity of the hair cells,  says Chagnaud. By dampening the intrinsic sensitivity of the hair cells, the input from the spinal cord effectively adapts the VO s dynamic range. This process enables the balance organ to maintain responsiveness to high-amplitude  afferent  stimuli from the periphery, and thus to modulate the head movements that accompany propulsive swimming. Hence the whole adaptation process is controlled by neurons in the spinal cord, which transmit signals to the VO via nerve cells located in the brainstem just before the muscles carry out the next locomotory behavior. These signals thus notify the VO in advance about the temporal form of the impending movement.  This feedforward principle is crucial, because it prepares the hair cells to react appropriately to the next movement,  Chagnaud explains.  The direct impact of input from the spinal cord on the sensitivity of sensory nerve cells in the balance organ demonstrates the importance of interactions between sensory and motor systems, and it underlines the significance of the interplay between different components of the central nervous system   in this case, the spinal cord and the brainstem. Here, evolution has not only come up with an elegant means of anticipating the effects of locomotion on the body but also of compensating for them in an adaptive fashion.  The LMU group now intends to study whether all the hair cells in the inner ear also respond to efferent information emanating from the spinal cord or whether the VO possess subpopulations of hair cells that are specialized for reception of impulses that signal either fast or slow movements.

Science on stem cells thus far, has suggested that, as one side of the existential debate holds: their fate is not predestined. But new research from the Neural Stem Cell Institute and Drexel University's College of Engineering suggests that the cells  tabula might not be as rasa as we have been led to believe. In a paper published in the latest edition of Stem Cell Reports, researchers present voluminous video evidence to support their discovery of distinct, intrinsic differences among stem cells found in the brains of mice. Through time-lapse imaging of cells cultured in identical in vitro environments, researchers were able to identify differences in growth, movement and differentiation that exist between stem cells found in two different areas of the brain. The cerebral cortex is the control center of the brain, concerned with thought, memory, and controlling our behavior. It is divided into areas with dedicated functions. The posterior or back of the cortex integrates visual stimuli from the eye and determines our responses by sending signals to the anterior the front part that controls our movements. The visual cortex and the motor cortex are both layered structures, each containing millions of neurons networked into intricate circuits. During development as embryos, each of these parts of the cortex is created from neural stem and progenitor cells. A key unanswered question in the study of neuroscience is whether the visual and motor cortex areas are produced by neural stem cells that are themselves unique and patterned to produce each area by cell-intrinsic programs, or whether the progenitor cells are essentially the same, but rely on environmental signals to carve out the unique cells and connections in each final cortex area. Understanding the mechanisms controlling stem cell production is not just important for understanding human development, but also for learning how to use stem cells for regenerative medicine and for formulating new cancer therapies. To answer that question, Sally Temple, PhD, and her research group at the Neural Stem Cell Institute studied single neural stem cells from the anterior and posterior embryonic mouse cerebral cortex. They provided the cells with an identical environment in tissue culture, then made time-lapse movies of how they divided and differentiated into cortical cells.  If the answer to the age-old question was, in fact,  nurture  then these cells would behave the same, given the identical environments,  Temple said.  But if the answer was  nature  then they would behave differently. And this is actually what we found anterior and posterior stem cells are intrinsically quite different from each other.  The anterior stem cells, which form the motor cortex, were observed to divide more slowly, and produce smaller clones in comparison to the stem cells derived from the posterior which grow to form the visual cortex. This means that these cortical progenitor cells are different even at early stage of development and these differences could help explain how areas of the cortex develop into specialized structures. This discovery was made possible by a powerful set of biological tracking programs, developed in the Computational Image Sequence Analysis Lab led by Andrew Cohen, PhD, an associate professor in Drexel s College of Engineering, that automated the process of analyzing tens of thousands of time-lapse images. The programs, called LEVER and CloneView, can track the growth, movement and proliferation of cells and use this information to visually enhance the time-lapse movies and produce an entire family tree a lineage tree, in cell biology parlance for each cell.  The task was huge,  Temple said.  We needed to follow literally hundreds of neural stem cells by time-lapse microscopy, and identify every division and outcome of each of the progeny as they multiplied.  LEVER, shortened from Lineage Editing and Validation, processes the raw images and, armed with basic knowledge about their size and shape, attempts to locate and tag the cells in each frame.  Basically the algorithms look for groups of pixels that have the right appearance and that are in the right place to be the cells we re tracking,  Cohen said.  From there we use other algorithms to cross-check the results multiple times, until we re almost 99 percent sure that the things LEVER has identified in all these pictures are, in fact cells.  With the cells and their corresponding appearance in each frame uniquely tagged, the CloneView program can tell researchers how fast the cells are moving and when they divide noted by LEVER when there is an appearance of a previously untagged cell. This information is used to automatically generate a lineage tree for the cells, which in turn gives the program, and the researchers, another way to check for errors. Displayed in CloneView, a time-lapse movie of a single stem cell is overlaid by a uniquely colored outline of its inner boundary. As it grows and eventually divides, new cells are delineated with a different color. Each of these colors corresponds to the cell s node on the lineage tree, which is displayed in a separate frame next to the movie. This gives Cohen s research assistants a quick way to check the video to make sure LEVER correctly identified the cells and their progeny. Once checked by human eyes, the images are run through the program again for more precise delineation of the cells this process is especially arduous when tracking stem cells because they often have long arm-like appendages called processes that can look like a separate cell.  Human validation is a very important part of our process. We are still the most accurate judge of when cells have divided,  Cohen said.  By running the time-lapse images through the program we get an output video that s easy to visually verify. As these corrections are made, the program can spot related errors and automatically fix those. The key is to minimize the amount of effort required from the humans.  The team is already reporting error rates below two percent for most of the videos.  Dealing with this much visual data means we can make some really accurate statements about the nature of these cells, but it also means that we need to be tremendously efficient about the way we handle the data to squeeze out that information,  said 10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.08.002, a doctoral candidate in Cohen s lab and a co-author of the paper. The end result of the algorithmic tagging, tracking and sorting is 160 individual time-lapse videos chronicling five days in the lives of neural stem cells. A mountain of data is distilled to a format from which researchers can more easily make observations and immediately test their theories against a formidable dataset.  That s 160 videos displaying augmented visual data from images taken of each cell every five minutes for five days,  Cohen said.  That s how you end up with a massive amount of data like the 350 gigabytes we were working with. And that s why programs like this are really a powerful tools for microbiologists.  So powerful, in fact, that according to Temple, discoveries of this magnitude are simply not possible without this sort of automated analysis of time-phase contrast images.  When you re working with imaging data on this scale there is a considerable bottleneck when it comes to analysis,  Temple said.  It might have been feasible to compare clone sizes manually, but to analyze their movement, life-cycle and track their lineage trees is so daunting, we wouldn t have even considered undertaking this analysis without advanced processing programs like LEVER and CloneView. Not only can they handle massive volumes of data in a short period of time, they produce information that we can validate and trust. Discoveries like this must be built on a foundation of meticulously validated research.  As part of the paper, Cohen and Temple are publishing all of their stem cell data in files that can be viewed online via CloneView. In addition, all of Cohen s source code for LEVER and CloneView are free and available for download. This sort of open-access science is important to the researchers because they believe it will help to advance both the field of stem cell research, and the technology used to do it.  The amazing thing about this is the sheer volume of data we re making publicly available,  Cohen said.  It s conceivable that many more interesting discoveries could come from our dataset thanks to CloneView or maybe a better program that someone comes up with using our source code as a start. Great things are possible through open-source collaboration.  For example, Cohen solicited his colleague Uri Hershberg, PhD, an assistant professor and Herschberg s doctoral student Justin Melunis, from Drexel s School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, to be the first bioinformatics researchers to work with the stem cell data in CloneView. Their detailed characterization of motion, growth and size of clones as it varies across generations which is also published in the paper helped to pinpoint the differences between anterior and posterior cells.  Since CloneView is online, the New York and Philadelphia teams could work on this unique dataset together, which helped accelerate the research,  Temple said.  The way these programs incorporate both automation and human validation gives us the best and most accurate information on which to base our conclusions.  Cohen asserts that the strength of the programs is their use of automation and machine learning as a way to maximize the user s interaction and enable thoughtful collaboration throughout the research process. CloneView is an open-source, web-based program so it s now feasible for researchers around the world to have access to this dataset. The next applications Cohen is planning for LEVER and CloneView include studying cancer cells and immune system cells. With new visual data, including additional imaging channels and layers of complexity, these programs will guide researchers toward new discoveries about the behaviors of healthy and diseased cells.

More commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, ALS has no cure, and the only approved therapy slows the progression by only a few months. In a new study presented at the 14th International Conference on Endothelin: Physiology, Pathophysiology and Therapeutics taking place September 2-5, 2015 in Savannah, Georgia, researchers from Johns Hopkins University have identified an unexplored avenue of treatment for ALS. Endothelin (ET)-1, a small protein produced by blood vessel cells and a powerful vessel constrictor, is also produced by astrocytes, cells in the brain that studies are revealing play many roles in health and disease. ALS progression is associated with the dysfunction of astrocytes, and earlier studies have shown that ET-1 influences a number of cellular pathways implicated in ALS progression. Gene expression studies also suggest that levels of ET-1 and the receptor it binds to, ET-B, are elevated in patients with ALS. This new study investigated whether levels of ET and its receptor, ET-B, were altered in the regions where nerve cells die in ALS. The researchers examined ALS patient-derived tissue samples and cells and a mouse model of ALS using a range of gene expression and protein measurement techniques. They found a higher level of ET-1 in astrocytes and a higher level of the ET-B receptor in nerve cells in regions affected in ALS. They also found variations in the gene sequences for ET-1 in patients with an inherited form of ALS. ""These experiments demonstrate striking abnormalities in the central nervous system endothelin system, [suggesting that] the endothelin system may represent a largely unexplored and potentially significant target for therapeutic intervention in ALS,"" according to the researchers.

In other words, it's one's ability to disengage from a previous task and respond effectively to a new one. It's a faculty that most of us take for granted, yet an essential skill to navigate life. In a new paper published in the journal Trends in Neurosciences, University of Miami (UM) College of Arts & Sciences researchers clarify many of the concepts surrounding cognitive flexibility and propose a model of its underlying neural mechanisms. The new model may be instrumental in understanding behavioral and neurological disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. ""By understanding how the brain attempts to implement cognitive flexibility in a neurodevelopmental disorder like autism, we can better understand the nature of the disorder,"" said Dina R. Dajani, Ph.D. student of psychology in the UM College of Arts & Sciences and first author of the study. ""The model will inform whether we should try to teach individuals with autism the strategies utilized by typically developing individuals, or instead improve upon already existing strategies of individuals with the disorder."" For instance, knowing if there is a simple increase or decrease in connectivity between brain regions compared to healthy individuals, or whether those with autism use entirely different brain regions to implement cognitive flexibility will enable researchers to better design interventions to improve cognitive flexibility skills. The more cognitive flexibility an individual has, the greater his or her chances of doing well in life. Previous studies have shown that greater cognitive flexibility relates to better reading abilities as a child, resilience as an adult, and quality of life in the advanced years. ""Our goal was to summarize and provide directions for future research on a topic that is relevant for understanding several prevalent developmental disorders,"" said Lucina Q. Uddin, assistant professor of psychology in the UM College of Arts & Sciences, principal investigator of this study and co-author of the paper. ""We believe that a better understanding of the neural systems mediating this critical ability will help clinicians design more effect treatments to help individuals who have difficulty with flexible behaviors in daily life, particularly those with autism."" In the paper, the researchers analyzed the existing literature and neuroimaging studies on cognitive flexibility and put forth a hypothesis regarding the fundamental neural mechanisms of this important faculty. The researchers suggest four components that work together to implement cognitive flexibility: salience detection/attention (both achieve similar goals to direct attention to behaviorally relevant events), working memory, inhibition and switching. If their model is validated, it will provide a strong foundation for researchers to use as a basis in determining what may be wrong in individuals with impaired cognitive flexibility. ""Our concept is quite different from other conceptualizations of cognitive flexibility because we describe it as arising from four separate cognitive operations, whereas other researchers have described it as a manifestation of a single cognitive operation,"" Dajani said. ""This novel hypothesis may help our understanding of this complex ability.""

In vertebrates, axons extending from nerve cells are covered by insulating sheets called the myelin sheath, made with the cell membranes of oligodendrocytes, enabling fast electrical signaling through saltatory conduction. Normally, myelin is repaired, even if damaged, but the mechanism that controls remyelination was not well understood. In addition, in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, the myelin sheath does not recover from damage and gets worse, finally leading to symptoms such as vision loss, limb numbness, and movement disorders. The research group of Professor Masaharu Noda and colleagues of the National Institute for Basic Biology, a member institute of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences, performed a detailed examination of the remyelinating process of damaged myelin using disease model mice. Their results show that a growth factor called pleiotrophin is secreted from nerve axons injured by demyelination, and this pleiotrophin inhibits the function of the receptor molecule PTPRZ of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, stimulating cellular differentiation into oligodendrocytes which form the myelin sheath, thereby promoting remyelination.  This achievement shows that it is possible to encourage the regeneration of the myelin sheath by inhibiting the action of PTPRZ in endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells, indicating a new potential treatment for demyelinating diseases.  The results of this research are published in The Journal of Neuroscience.  Professor Noda said ""This achievement was made possible by establishing oligodendrocyte precursor cell lines. Pleiotrophin is an endogenous PTPRZ inhibitor, but if synthetic PTPRZ inhibitors were obtained, then effective treatments for multiple sclerosis should become possible. We are currently directing our research in that direction."" National Institutes of Natural Sciences/National Institute for Basic Biology   press release Noda M et al.

""Revolade helps address an unmet need in this community and underscores our commitment to patients affected by rare diseases.""  SAA is a blood disorder where the bone marrow does not make enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets[1]. Two out of every one million people in Europe are diagnosed with aplastic anemia per year, a portion of which are severe cases[3],[4]. The exact cause of the disease is still unknown, but most cases of SAA are believed to be triggered by an autoimmune reaction where the body attacks blood-forming stem cells located in the bone marrow[1],[2]. As a result, patients with SAA are at risk for life-threatening infections or bleeding[2].   Treatment of SAA is focused on increasing the number of healthy cells in the blood (blood cell count). The current standard of care includes IST or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation[2]. Of patients treated with IST, one-quarter to one-third will not respond and 30-40% of responders will relapse, causing symptoms to return[2]. Approximately 40% of SAA patients who don't respond to initial IST die from infection or bleeding within five years of their diagnosis[5]. The approval is based on the results of a pivotal open-label Phase II study (ELT112523) and two supporting Phase II studies (ELT116826 and ELT116643) conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The pivotal study demonstrated a hematologic response (40%) in SAA patients treated with Revolade who had an insufficient response to IST. The most common adverse reactions (>=20%) in the pivotal single-arm study of 43 patients were nausea, fatigue, cough, transaminase increased, diarrhea, and headache[6].

These early data provide confidence to expand the trial in these patients who currently lack proven, effective treatment options.  Synovial sarcoma is a cancer of the connective tissue and a type of solid tumor primarily affecting adolescents and young adults. Most metastatic soft tissue sarcomas are currently incurable - 75 to 80 percent of patients do not survive past two to three years - and there are limited treatment options for unresectable and recurrent synovial sarcoma, which is nearly always fatal.  Adaptimmune s clinical study includes synovial sarcoma patients who have received standard first line therapy containing ifosfamide and/or doxorubicin and who are intolerant or no longer responding to the regimen, and whose tumor expresses a tumor antigen known as NY-ESO-1. The NY-ESO-1 antigen is believed to be present in 60 to 70 percent of synovial sarcoma patients.  The primary objectives of the study are to determine the safety of adoptively transferred autologous T cells expressing an affinity enhanced T cell receptor that recognizes the NY-ESO-1 antigen in HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0205, and/or HLA-A*0206 positive patients with unresectable, metastatic or recurrent synovial sarcoma. Secondary objectives include the determination of efficacy through response rate and duration of response.  All eligible patients will be treated with lymphodepletive chemotherapy followed by administration of Adaptimmune s NY-ESO TCR therapeutic.  In the first cohort, patients whose tumor expressed NY-ESO-1 at high levels received a single course of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for lymphodepletion prior to administration of Adaptimmune s NY-ESO TCR therapeutic. Cohort 2 will enroll patients whose tumor expresses lower levels of the NY-ESO-1 antigen and who will receive the same treatment as patients in the first cohort. Cohort 3 will enroll patients whose tumor expresses high levels of the NY-ESO-1 antigen and will study the removal of fludarabine as part of the lymphodepletion regimen. Both cohorts are expected to open concurrently.  ","Published: September 4, 2015"

The companies will partner in the development and commercialization of a BACE inhibitor program in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Novartis' oral therapy CNP520 will be the lead molecule and further compounds from both company's pre-clinical BACE inhibitor programs may be considered as follow-on molecules. The collaboration will also focus on new Amgen drugs in the migraine field, including phase III AMG 334 and phase I AMG 301. For the migraine program, Novartis will have global co-development rights and commercial rights outside the U.S., Canada, and Japan. ""This Novartis collaboration with Amgen highlights our clear commitment to neuroscience and to bring multiple, new targeted therapies to patients living with Alzheimer's disease and migraine, where the unmet medical need remains high."" said David Epstein, Head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Alzheimer's Disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive abilities. Amyloid build-up is considered a key driver of the progressive damage of the nervous system in AD. CNP520 is an oral drug designed to prevent the production of different forms of amyloid and has the potential to prevent, slow or delay the symptoms associated with AD. It is currently in phase I/IIa trials. CNP520 is planned to be included in a pioneering prevention study in people with a genetic risk of developing AD, in collaboration with the Banner Alzheimer's Institute.  Migraine is a severe headache condition affecting more than 10% of the population worldwide and a leading cause of disability. AMG 334 is a fully human monoclonal antibody under investigation for the prevention of migraine. AMG 334 inhibits the activity of Calcitonin-Gene-Related-Peptide (CGRP) by targeting its receptor. CGRP is believed to play a key role in the development of migraine. AMG 334 is currently under evaluation in several large global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials to assess its safety and efficacy in migraine prevention. In addition to AMG 334, the migraine portfolio will include the development of AMG 301 and potentially another investigational compound of Amgen. AMG 301 is a monoclonal antibody being investigated in phase I trials for the prevention of migraine. The partnership with Amgen follows two recent developments in the Novartis neuroscience portfolio aimed at complementing Novartis' neuroscience presence and pipeline in, among others, multiple sclerosis, AD and neuromuscular diseases. In July 2015 Novartis acquired Spinifex Pharmaceuticals adding phase II compound EMA401 for the treatment of neuropathic pain to the portfolio. In August 2015 Novartis announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire all remaining rights to Ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and certain other autoimmune indications; closing of this transaction is subject to expiry of any waiting period under the US Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions.  Under the terms of the arrangement, Novartis and Amgen will share responsibilities for development and commercialization of the BACE inhibitor program. Amgen will pay an upfront payment and milestone payments as well as disproportional research and development costs for an agreed upon period followed by a 50/50 cost and profit share arrangement. For the compounds in the migraine field, Novartis receives global co-development rights and commercial rights outside the U.S., Canada and Japan to the investigative molecules in Amgen's migraine portfolio. This includes AMG 334 in phase III and AMG 301 in phase I as well as an option to commercialize an additional early-stage Amgen molecule in these territories. Novartis will fund disproportional global R&D expenses for an agreed period on the migraine programs and will pay Amgen double-digit royalties on sales.","Published: September 4, 2015"

""We look forward to making the Tafinlar and Mekinist targeted combination treatment, which demonstrated a significant overall survival benefit in two robust clinical trials, available across Europe as soon as possible,"" said Bruno Strigini, President, Novartis Oncology. ""Today's EU approval further demonstrates our ongoing commitment to deliver medicines that can further enhance outcomes for patients with metastatic melanoma.""  Metastatic melanoma is the most serious and life-threatening type of skin cancer and is associated with low survival rates; approximately one out of every five people will survive for five years following a diagnosis with late-stage disease. There are about 200,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed worldwide each year, approximately half of which have BRAF mutations. Gene tests can determine whether a tumor has a BRAF mutation, and results can play a key role in prognosis and determining appropriate treatment.  Marketing authorization is based on results from the Phase III COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies, in which the Tafinlar/Mekinist combination demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit compared to Tafinlar and Zelboraf monotherapies respectively in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  The COMBI-d study showed that the combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist achieved a statistically significant OS benefit compared to Tafinlar monotherapy (median of 25.1 months vs 18.7 months; Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.71 [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.55-0.92], p=0.011). In those who received Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist, OS was 74% at 1 year and 51% at 2 years versus 68% and 42% for those who received Tafinlar only, respectively. Safety results from the COMBI-d study were consistent with the profile observed to date for the combination; no new safety concerns were observed. The most common adverse events (>=20%) in the combination arm were pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, diarrhea, rash, joint pain (arthralgia), hypertension, vomiting, cough, and peripheral edema. Adverse events or toxicities were generally manageable with appropriate intervention, as described in the product labelling submitted with the application. Updated results from COMBI-v will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. The European Commission approval applies to all 28 EU member states, plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review in July 2015 for regular approval of the Tafinlar and Mekinist combination in BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. Since January 2014, the combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist has been approved for use in the US in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma as detected by an FDA-approved test. The combination was approved through the FDA's Accelerated Approval program and reviewed under a priority review designation. The approval was contingent on the results of the COMBI-d study, which was designed to evaluate the clinical benefit of the combination in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.

The goal of research conducted by the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network is to better understand the genomic basis of disease and to tailor medical care to individual patients based on their genomic differences. The grants, administered by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), represent the third phase of the eMERGE program, and focus on moving genomics research closer to clinical application by identifying the potential medical effects of rare genomic variants (inherited differences in the DNA code) in about 100 clinically relevant genes. The activity of such genes can affect a person s health, and might affect treatment choices.   The newly funded projects are focused on discovering genes and gene variants with clinical implications by using the latest sequencing technologies to examine rare and common variants suspected to relate to disease risk and treatment effects,  said Rongling Li, M.D., Ph.D., program director for eMERGE in the Division of Genomic Medicine at NHGRI, a part of NIH.  The other important component of these grants is implementing what researchers learn about these gene variants into medical settings to improve patient care.  Researchers will look at the best ways to provide DNA test results to physicians and patients, she said, and ways in which doctors might use this information to improve clinical treatment and practice. These funded researchers will also examine the psychological and economic effects on patients and families, and the effects on healthcare systems, in using this information.","Published: September 4, 2015"

Received wisdom on the health risks of eating saturated fat has been called into question recently. This new research supports the view that excessive consumption of saturated fat can be bad for us. Scientists from Imperial College London studied mice that have an unusually high level of saturated fat circulating in their blood. The research, published in Cell Reports shows that the presence of saturated fats resulted in monocytes - a type of white blood cell - migrating into the tissues of vital organs. The researchers believe that the newly arrived monocytes could worsen tissue damage because they may exacerbate ongoing or underlying inflammation, but this aspect is still under study. Lead researcher Dr Kevin Woollard said: ""The mice we studied were treated with a drug that caused them to accumulate extremely high levels of fat in their blood. Although it is unusual, humans do sometimes have measurements approaching those levels, either from an inherited condition, or through eating fatty foods. ""Modern lifestyles seem to go hand-in-hand with high levels of fat in the blood. This fat comes from the food and drink that we consume; for example, you'd be surprised how much saturated fat a latte contains, and some people drink several through the course of the day. ""We think that maintaining a relatively high concentration of saturated fats for example by constantly snacking on cakes, biscuits, and pastries could be causing monocytes to migrate out of the blood and into surrounding tissues."" Blood is very finely balanced, and the exchange of cells and other substances with the surrounding tissue is part of maintaining that balance. The team, led by Dr Woollard and Professor Marina Botto from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, has observed that as the organs take in fats, most of the migrated monocytes are turned into another type of immune cell called a macrophage and some of the cells located within the tissues take in fat and are turned into 'foam cells'. These foam cells and macrophages then stimulate production of a signalling molecule called CCL4, which attracts more monocytes into the tissue. This spiral continues as long as the level of saturated fat is elevated. These mechanisms may have evolved to remove fats from the blood in order to maintain a healthy balance; further research is required to confirm this. A critical discovery, however, is that the monocytes that are involved in this balancing act are of just one very specific type. Dr Woollard said: ""It's really exciting to see that the monocytes that migrate into tissues are all of one type and that means we actually may be able to develop drugs that change this behaviour."" In the future, people who are at risk of cardiovascular disease or who are obese could be treated with a therapeutic drug that targets these particular monocytes and prevents the possible future damage caused by fatty build up in their blood vessels and organs. ""Interestingly, people with certain immune disorders affecting monocytes, including some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like lupus, can have unexpectedly high levels of saturated fats in their blood and also are more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes at a younger age."" The next stages of this research will be to study groups of patients with inflammatory diseases, and to look at the direct effects of saturated foods on monocyte function.","Published: September 4, 2015"

Each year, approximately one million children under the age of four undergo surgery with general anesthesia, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Retrospective birth-cohort studies of children have found an association between learning problems and multiple exposures to anesthesia early in life, and research in animal models, mainly rodents, has shown that early anesthesia exposure causes cell death in the brain and cognitive impairments later in life. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains about the extent to which anesthesia specifically may be a risk factor in humans, when compared to other factors and co-morbidities associated with anesthesia and surgery.  Additionally, the applicability of rodent studies to humans has been questioned on a number of grounds, including a lack of correspondence of developmental stages between the species.   The Mount Sinai/Yerkes study is the first to address the question of whether repeated postnatal anesthesia exposure, in and of itself, caused long-term behavioral changes in a highly translationally relevant rhesus monkey model.  The stage of neurodevelopment of rhesus monkeys at birth is more similar to that of human infants compared to neonatal rodents; with respect to brain growth, a six-week-old rhesus monkey corresponds to a human in the second half of his or her first year of life.  Because these kinds of controlled studies cannot be carried out in humans, it is essential to use a comparable animal model to discover if anesthesia may be affecting the brain. Unlike previous research, the study was conducted in the absence of a surgical procedure, co-morbidities that may necessitate surgical intervention or the psychological stress associated with illness.    The major strength of this study is its ability to separate anesthesia exposure from surgical procedures, which is a potential complication in the studies conducted in children,  says Mark Baxter, PhD, professor in the Departments of Neuroscience and Anesthesiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.  Our results confirm that multiple anesthesia exposures alone result in emotional behavior changes in a highly translational animal model.  This raises concerns about whether similar phenomena are occurring during clinical anesthesia exposure in children.  Specifically, the study team exposed 10 nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) to a common pediatric anesthetic called sevoflurane for a comparable length of time required for a significant surgical procedure in humans (four hours).  They were exposed to the anesthetic at postnatal day seven and then again two and four weeks later, because human data indicate that repeated anesthesia results in a greater risk of learning disabilities relative to a single anesthetic exposure.   Researchers evaluated the socioemotional behavior of exposed subjects compared with that of healthy controls at six months of age using a mild social stressor (an unfamiliar human). They found the anesthesia-exposed infants expressed significantly more anxious behaviors overall compared with controls. ""The task we used is designed to be similar to the task used for assessing dispositional anxiety and behavioral inhibition in children, thus increasing the study's applicability to humans,"" says first author Jessica Raper, PhD, research associate in the Division of Developmental and Cognitive Neuroscience at Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University, where the testing was conducted. The study results also demonstrate that alterations in emotional behavior persist at least five months after anesthesia exposure, suggesting long-term effects. Co-investigator Maria Alvarado, PhD, also of the Yerkes Research Center adds,  Events that impact the developing brain have the potential to affect a wide range of later-developing behaviors."" These findings are part of a larger longitudinal study, and researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center will continue to follow these study subjects behaviorally to fully characterize the length of time that these emotional changes persist and whether they resolve over time.   Considering that most pediatric surgeries are non-elective, future studies can use this primate model to develop a new anesthetic agent or prophylactic treatment to counteract the impact of anesthesia on behavior in children.  The findings also suggest that additional work is required to identify the mechanisms by which anesthetics may cause long-term changes in central nervous system function that impact behavior. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Health Office of the Director, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs, supported this research.

Researchers at the University of Basel now identified a specific group of genes that plays a central role in both processes. This group of molecules controls the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell. Their results appear in the current issue of the journal JAMA Psychiatry. Intact memory capacity is crucial for everyday life. This fact becomes apparent once a memory disorder has developed. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of age-associated memory disorders. Due to increasing life expectancy, the disease is on the rise in Switzerland and worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment to cure or even slow down Alzheimer's yet. Thus, understanding the origins of this neurodegenerative disorder is key to the development of much needed treatments. Scientists have known for some years now, that genes do not only play a crucial role in normal memory performance, but also in the development of Alzheimer's. However, it was so far unclear if specific genes are involved in both these processes. Researchers at the transfaculty research platform at the Psychiatric University Clinics Basel and the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Basel were now able to show in a large scale study that a specific group of genes controls several processes that are central for regular brain functions as well as for the development of Alzheimer. First author Dr. Angela Heck collected and analyzed data of over 57,000 participants for this study. The study identified genes responsible for the concentration of calcium ions in the cell as central players of physiological and disease processes in the brain. Calcium genes stand in mutual relationship with memory performance of young and older healthy adults as well as with the function of the hippocampus, a brain region that is central to intact memory. Furthermore, calcium genes correlate with the risk for Alzheimer disease. The results contribute to the understanding of the complex processes that lead to memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's.

The conditions are linked to reward and aversion responses in the brain. Working in mice, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have discovered brain pathways linked to reward and aversion behaviors are in such close proximity that they unintentionally could be activated at the same time. The findings suggest that drug treatments for addiction and depression simultaneously may stimulate reward and aversion responses, resulting in a net effect of zero in some patients. The research is published in the journal Neuron. ""We studied the neurons that cause activation of kappa opioid receptors, which are involved in every kind of addiction -- alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine,"" said principal investigator Michael R. Bruchas, PhD, associate professor of anesthesiology and neurobiology. ""We produced opposite reward and aversion behaviors by activating neuronal populations located very near one another. This might help explain why drug treatments for addiction don't always work -- they could be working in these two regions at the same time and canceling out any effects."" Addiction can result when a drug temporarily produces a reward response in the brain that, once it wears off, prompts an aversion response that creates an urge for more drugs. The researchers studied mice genetically engineered so that some of their brain cells could be activated with light. Using tiny, implantable LED devices to shine a light on the neurons, they stimulated cells in a region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, producing a reward response. Cells in that part of the bran are dotted with kappa opioid receptors, which are involved in addiction and depression. The mice returned over and over again to the same part of a maze when the researchers stimulated the brain cells to produce a reward response. But activating cells a millimeter away resulted in robust aversion behavior, causing the mice to avoid these areas. ""We were surprised to see that activation of the same types of receptors on the same types of cells in the same region of the brain could cause different responses,"" said first author Ream Al-Hasani, PhD, an instructor in anesthesiology.

That s thanks to a set of cells in your spinal cord that help translate messages between your brain and your motor neurons, which control muscles. Now, for the first time, researchers have created a method to watch in real time the activity of those motor neurons. The new technology, developed by scientists from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and published in Neuron, is helping researchers understand how spinal cord cells make connections with motor neurons, and how clinicians might be able to repair those connections in patients with spinal cord injuries or neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Using optical methods to be able to watch neuron activity has been a dream over the past decade,  says Samuel Pfaff, a professor in Salk s Gene Expression Laboratory.  Now, it s one of those rare times when the technology is actually coming together to show you things you hadn t been able to see before.  In the past, to measure the activity of neurons whether in the brain or extending throughout the body scientists relied on electrodes that could detect the change in electrical voltage inside a cell when it s activated. But it is tricky to use electrodes to simultaneously record the activity of many different neuron types at once to study how their activity is synchronized. To get around this shortcoming of electrode readings, Pfaff s team used a fluorescent sensor protein called GCaMP6f that lights up whenever a neuron is activated. Unlike the electrodes, the protein could easily be added to many different cells at once. When Pfaff and his colleagues added GCaMP6f to motor neurons, they could watch with a microscope which cells were activated in a mouse spinal cord when chemicals that turn on walking circuits were added.  You don t need to do any kind of post-image processing to interpret this,  says Pfaff.  These are just raw signals you can see through the eyepiece of a microscope. It s really a jaw-dropping kind of visualization for a neuroscientist.  Pfaff s group used the new method to answer a long-standing question about how a collection of cells in the spinal cord, called the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG), connects to the right motor neurons to allow movements like walking. The CPG, Pfaff says, is where relatively simple signals from the brain to walk forward, or move your hand off a hot stove are translated into more complex instructions for motor neurons to control muscles.  Our nervous system has to make decisions and computations to tell different muscles to contract, or when not to contract, or the amount of force and speed to use when contracting,  Pfaff explains. It s the CPG that helps make many of these computations, scientists believe. So normal movement requires that CPG neurons in the spinal cord connect to and control when motor neurons fire. But, until now, researchers didn t know exactly how the CPG cells forged these connections. By tweaking the locations and identities of motor neurons, and then watching the resulting patterns of activation using their new fluorescent technique, Chris Hinckley in the Pfaff laboratory found that the CPG didn t rely solely on the cells  locations to connect to them. Instead, the genetic identity of each subtype of cells what makes those that control the quadriceps muscle different from those that control the calf muscle for instance is also important. That s a key finding, Pfaff says, for research on how to treat spinal cord injuries and ALS. Currently, many scientists are attempting to turn stem cells into motor neurons, which they then implant into the spinal cord to regenerate damaged connections. Pfaff s new results, though, suggest that general motor neurons might not do the trick the best treatment may require the right subtypes of motor neurons. More work, however, is needed to understand the implications of this and exactly how it might translate to disease treatment. Salk Institute for Biological Studies   press release Pfaff SL et al.

Receptos stockholders received $232.00 per share in cash, for a total of approximately $7.2 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result of the completion of the merger, the common stock of Receptos is no longer listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market or any other exchange and trading ceased at the close of the markets on Thursday, August 27, 2015. Receptos stockholders who hold shares through a bank or broker will not have to take any action to have their shares converted into cash, since these conversions will be handled by the bank or broker. Stockholders who hold stock certificates can surrender their certificates for $232.00 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, through the paying agent for the merger, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. The acquisition of Receptos significantly enhances Celgene's Inflammation & Immunology (I&I) portfolio, further diversifies the Company's expected revenue beginning in 2019, and builds upon Celgene's growing expertise in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The transaction adds Ozanimod, a novel, potential best-in-class, oral, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 and 5 receptor modulator (S1P) to Celgene's deep and diverse pipeline of potential disease-altering medicines and investigational compounds. Based on clinical studies, Ozanimod demonstrated several areas of potential advantage over existing oral therapies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), including its cardiac, hepatotoxicity and lymphocyte recovery profile. The phase III TRUE NORTH trial in UC is currently underway with data expected in 2018. The phase III RADIANCE and SUNBEAM RMS trials are ongoing and data are expected in the first half of 2017 to support a RMS approval in 2018. Additionally, we believe Ozanimod is positioned to potentially become the first S1P receptor modulator to be approved for IBD.

Under the terms of the agreement, Eisai Inc. and Purdue Pharma will share the costs of lemborexant global clinical studies. While the potential indication for the product candidate is for the treatment of insomnia, the companies may also seek to develop other indications in the future. The two companies will form a joint steering committee to manage development and pursue marketing authorizations for lemborexant worldwide. Once approved, Eisai and Purdue Pharma will co-promote the product and share co-promotion costs and profits in the United States and other territories (to be agreed by the parties), which may include the European Union, China, Japan and Canada. Eisai will book sales in all co-promotion territories. In certain other countries, either Eisai or Purdue Pharma may solely commercialize lemborexant and pay the other party a royalty. Eisai Inc. will receive an upfront payment from Purdue Pharma, and is also eligible to receive certain other milestone payments that are contingent upon achieving regulatory approval and certain commercial milestones. Insomnia is common worldwide; approximately 30% of adults report one or more symptoms of insomnia including difficulty initiating and or maintaining sleep. Insomnia is associated with impairments in daytime functioning, including difficulty with thinking and concentration, as well as altered mood. Discovered by Eisai, lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist which competitively binds to the two subtypes of orexin receptors. It is believed that the orexin system promotes wakefulness, and therefore, orexin receptor antagonists such as lemborexant have the potential to promote sleep. With the signing of this agreement, the Phase III clinical development program will commence immediately. The global trial program is designed to evaluate the efficacy of lemborexant on both objective and subjective measures of sleep. In addition, the development program will evaluate the impact of treatment of insomnia on daytime function. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated during the clinical program.  Eisai is excited about the significant and far-reaching potential of this compound as we commence Phase III clinical trials,  said Lynn Kramer, MD, FAAN, President of the Neuroscience and General Medicine Product Creation Unit at Eisai.  We are looking forward to collaborating with Purdue Pharma, which brings deep expertise and proven successes in drug development and commercialization.   This agreement reflects our strategy to diversify and grow our business through partnerships and business development,  said Mark Timney, President and CEO, Purdue Pharma L.P.

This project will allow the analysis of detailed patient characteristics alongside large volumes of genetic data, enabling more effective research into the causes and personalized treatment of cancer. Dr Ian Walker, Director of Clinical Research and Strategic Partnerships at Cancer Research UK, said:  Pathology reports tell us a range of important information about a patient s cancer, but the way this data is recorded can vary widely, which makes it harder to spot trends or other significant information that could have a bearing on treatment decisions or prognosis. This collaboration should help translate these reports into more meaningful data, which should help our researchers better understand the disease and accelerate advances in personalized medicine.  SMP was initiated to look at the use of genetic profiles in making cancer treatment decisions with a view to how personalized medicine would be implemented in the NHS and is a forerunner of the Genomics England 100,000 genomes project. The first project (SMP1) looked at breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, melanoma and ovarian cancers across eight hospital groups and 9000 patients. The second project (SMP2) is focussed on lung cancer. Due to the complexity and variability of pathology reports, capturing key cancer characteristics (clinical attributes) as discrete data is currently a challenging and time-consuming manual task. The collaboration will involve using NLP to automatically extract key clinical attributes such as tumour size, TNM stage (Classification of Malignant Tumours), topography, histology grade and category, excision margin and use of biomarkers from pathology reports.  As the healthcare industry moves towards precision medicine, rapid transformation of unstructured patient data, such as pathology reports, into structured insights is vital.  said Simon Beaulah, Director, Healthcare Strategy, Linguamatics.  This project will also demonstrate how to address the challenges from variable report structure and use of language across hospitals. We are delighted to be working with Cancer Research UK on such an innovative project as the Stratified Medicine Programme. Using NLP in this way will yield huge benefits to the cancer community by improving understanding of patient populations and ultimately cancer care. ","Published: September 3, 2015"

That condition left untreated can lead to serious medical problems, such as cardiovascular disease, as organs are under supplied with oxygen. About 2 percent of women reportedly experience OSA, but it may be under diagnosed among older women, said Dr. Patrick Koo, lead author of the new study in the journal Menopause. Past research suggests that women may understate some symptoms when reporting poor sleep, leading to misdiagnoses of depression or insomnia. Koo, a clinical assistant professor of medicine in the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and a physician at Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, therefore set out to determine whether nocturnal enuresis, which has been associated with OSA in children, might be an additional risk factor worth considering. To do that he and his co-authors analyzed the vast trove of health data compiled by the Women's Health Initiative, a massive research program that enrolled and followed more than 161,000 post-menopausal women between 1993 and 2005. Koo and his colleagues were able to review the prevalence of traditional OSA risk factors among the women -- obesity, snoring, poor sleep, interrupted sleep, hypertension, daytime sleepiness -- and their individual and collective association with nocturnal enuresis. In the analysis they accounted for a wide range of possible confounding factors, including the number of term pregnancies, alcohol consumption, and many other demographic and medical characteristics. What they found is that the more traditional OSA risk factors a woman experienced, the greater the odds that she also experienced nocturnal enuresis. A woman with any two OSA risk factors, for example, was on average twice as likely as a woman with none to urinate in her sleep. A woman with four OSA risk factors was nearly four times as likely. ""We demonstrate that OSA risk factors are associated with nocturnal enuresis in postmenopausal women,"" Koo and colleagues conclude in the paper.

Is this implicit knowledge already present early in infants?  The word ""apple,"" as we pronounce it, is a sequence of sounds (phonemes) that we use whenever we want to refer to the object it indicates. If we did not know that a referential relationship exists between the sound and the object it would be impossible for us to use, and learn, a language. Where does this implicit knowledge come from, and how early in human development does it manifest? This is the question Hanna Marno and her International School of Advanced Studies (SISSA) colleagues Marina Nespor and Jacques Mehler in a collaboration with Teresa Farroni, from the University of Padova, attempted to answer in a study published in Scientific Reports. ""A sensitivity to speech sounds is already present in newborns. These types of sounds are in fact perceived as special starting from the first days of life, and they are processed differently from other types of auditory stimuli. What makes this type of stimulus so special for the newborn?"" asks Marno. ""There's definitely a 'social' saliency: speech sounds signal interaction between conspecifics, which is important for the survival of the infant. But there is also another important aspect, i.e., referentiality: words are symbols that carry meanings and convey messages. If infants didn't know this, albeit implicitly, they wouldn't be able to acquire language."" ""Try to imagine an infant who, on several occasions, sees his mother holding up a cup while uttering the word 'cup',"" explains the researcher. ""He could just think that this is something his mum would do whenever holding the cup, a strange habit of hers. But instead in a short while he will learn that the word refers to that object, as if he were 'programmed' to do so."" To test this hypothesis, Marno conducted experiments with infants (4 months old). The babies watched a series of videos where a person might (or might not) utter an (invented) name of an object, while directing (or not directing) their gaze towards the position on the screen where a picture of the object would appear. By monitoring the infants' gaze, Marno and colleagues observed that, in response to speech cues, the infant's gaze would look faster for the visual object, indicating that she is ready to find a potential referent of the speech. However, this effect did not occur if the person in the video remained silent or if the sound was a non-speech sound. ""The mere fact of hearing verbal stimuli placed the infants in a condition to expect the appearance, somewhere, of an object to be associated with the word, whereas this didn't happen when there was no speech, even when the person in the video directed the infant's gaze to where the object would appear, concludes Marno. ""This suggests that infants at this early age already have some knowledge that language implies a relation between words and the surrounding physical world. Moreover, they are also ready to find out these relations, even if they don't know anything about the meanings of the words yet. Thus, a good advice to mothers is to speak to their infants, because infants might understand much more than they would show, and in this way their attention can be efficiently guided by their caregivers. This doesn't only facilitate the task of acquiring a language, but also helps to learn about their surrounding world.""

Looking for the mechanisms behind cognitive flexibility, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Germany's Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim and Charit  University Medicine Berlin have used brain scans to shed new light on this question. By studying networks of activity in the brain's frontal cortex, a region associated with control over thoughts and actions, the researchers have shown that the degree to which these networks reconfigure themselves while switching from task to task predicts people's cognitive flexibility. Experiment participants who performed best while alternating between a memory test and a control test showed the most rearrangement of connections within their frontal cortices as well as the most new connections with other areas of their brains. A more fundamental understanding of how the brain manages multitasking could lead to better interventions for medical conditions associated with reduced executive function, such as autism, schizophrenia or dementia. Danielle Bassett, the Skirkanich Assistant Professor of Innovation in Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science, is senior author on the study. Manheim's Urs Braun and Axel Sch fer were the lead authors. The research also featured work from Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg and Heike Tost of Mannheim, Henrik Walter of Charit , and others. It is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Rather than looking at the role a single region in the brain plays, Bassett and colleagues study the interconnections between the regions as indicated by synchronized activity. Using fMRI, they can measure which parts of the brain are ""talking"" to one another as study participants perform various tasks. Mapping the way this activity network reconfigures itself provides a more holistic view of how the brain operates. ""We try to understand how dynamic flexibility of brain networks can predict cognitive flexibility, or the ability to switch from task to task,"" Bassett said. ""Rather than being driven by the activity of single brain areas, we believe executive function is a network-level process."" A previous study that Bassett led showed that people who could more quickly ""disconnect"" their frontal cortices did better on a task that involved pressing keys that corresponded to color-coded notes on a screen. The high level decision-making associated with the frontal cortex's cognitive control wasn't as critical to playing the short sequences of notes, so those who still engaged this part of the brain were essentially overthinking a simple problem. In the new experiment, lead by Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg of Mannheim, 344 participants alternated between a working memory task designed to engage the frontal cortex and a control task. The easy task involved pressing the corresponding button as a sequence of numbers appeared on a screen one by one. The hard task also involved a sequence of numbers on a screen, but participants had to press the button that corresponded to the number that appeared two places back in the series each time they saw a new one. Urs Braun and Axel Sch fer, the lead authors on the paper, collaborated with Bassett, who has developed novel tools from network science to distill evolving brain connections. They used these tools to map how participants' brain activities rearranged during each block of the working memory task, each block of the control task and blocks in between where participants switched gears. ""The nodes in the network that are most involved in reconfigurations are cognitive control areas in the frontal cortex,"" Bassett said. ""More flexibility within the frontal cortex meant more accuracy on the memory task, and more consistent connectivity between the frontal cortex and other regions was even more predictive."" While the predictive strength of this reconfiguration suggests that it is only one of several processes involved in successful task switching, it plays a core role. ""It doesn't account for a huge amount variance,"" Bassett said, ""but it suggests that this kind of reconfiguration is a fundamental aspect of cognitive flexibility.""

That sense of well-being, freedom and extra energy that runners often experience is not just a matter of endorphins. A study at the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre (CRCHUM) shows that the ""runner's high"" phenomenon is also caused by dopamine, an important neurotransmitter for motivation. ""We discovered that the rewarding effects of endurance activity are modulated by leptin, a key hormone in metabolism. Leptin inhibits physical activity through dopamine neurons in the brain,"" said Stephanie Fulton, a researcher at the CRCHUM and lead author of an article published in the journal Cell Metabolism. Secreted by adipose tissue, leptin helps control the feeling of satiety. This hormone also influences physical activity. ""The more fat there is, the more leptin there is and and the less we feel like eating. Our findings now show that this hormone also plays a vital role in motivation to run, which may be related to searching for food,"" explained Stephanie Fulton, who is also a professor at Universit  de Montr al's Department of Nutrition. Hormone signals that modulate feeding and exercise are in fact believed to be closely linked. Endurance running capacity in mammals, particularly humans, is thought to have evolved to maximize the chances of finding food. This study suggests that leptin plays a critical role both in regulating energy balance and encouraging behaviors that are ""rewarding"" for the person's metabolism, i.e., engaging in physical activity to find food. The researchers studied voluntary wheel running in mice in cages. These mice can run up to seven kilometres a day. In a laboratory, the physical activity of normal mice was compared with that of mice who underwent a genetic modification to suppress a molecule activated by leptin, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3). The STAT3 molecule is found in the neurons that synthesize dopamine in the midbrain. This ""mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway"" is a like a motivational highway in the brain. ""Mice that do not have the STAT3 molecule in the dopaminergic neurons run substantially more. Conversely, normal mice are less active because leptin then activates STAT3 in the dopamine neurons, signaling that energy reserves in the body are sufficient and that there is no need to get active and go looking for food,"" explained Maria Fernanda Fernandes, first author of the study. And is leptin as important for motivation to be active in humans? Yes. ""Previous studies have clearly shown a correlation between leptin and marathon run times. The lower leptin levels are, the better the performance. Our study on mice suggests that this molecule is also involved in the rewarding effects experienced when we do physical exercise. We speculate that for humans, low leptin levels increase motivation to exercise and make it easier to get a runner's high,"" summed up Stephanie Fulton. Mice, humans and mammals in general are thought to have evolved to increase the return on effective food acquisition behaviors. Ultimately, hormones are sending the brain a clear message: when food is scarce, it's fun to run to chase some down. University of Montreal   press release Fulton S et al.

Results from a two-year clinical trial show calorie restriction in normal-weight and moderately overweight people failed to have some metabolic effects found in laboratory animal studies. However, researchers found calorie restriction modified risk factors for age-related diseases and influenced indicators associated with longer life span, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and insulin resistance. The study was reported in the September, 2015 issue of the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences. Calorie restriction is a reduction in calorie intake without deprivation of essential nutrients. It has been shown to increase longevity and delay the progression of a number of age-related diseases in multiple animal studies. Called Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE), the randomized trial was funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, both part of NIH. It was conducted at Washington University in St. Louis, Louisiana State University s Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, and Tufts University in Boston. The study coordinating center was at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.  The study found that this calorie restriction intervention did not produce significant effects on the pre-specified primary metabolic endpoints, but it did modify several risk factors for age-related diseases. It is encouraging to find positive effects when we test interventions that might affect diseases and declines associated with advancing age,  notes NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D.  However, we need to learn much more about the health consequences of this type of intervention in healthy people before considering dietary recommendations. In the meantime, we do know that exercise and maintaining a healthy weight and diet can contribute to healthy aging.  In laboratory animals, calorie restriction s favorable effects on life span have generally been found when it is begun in youth or early middle age. An equivalent trial in people would take decades. However, shorter trials can determine feasibility, safety and effects on quality of life, disease risk factors, predictors of life span and effects on mechanisms influenced by calorie restriction in laboratory animal studies. CALERIE was a two-year randomized controlled trial in 218 young and middle-aged healthy normal-weight and moderately overweight men and women to measure these outcomes in a CR group, compared with a control group who maintained their regular diets. The calorie restriction participants were given weight targets of 15.5 percent weight loss in the first year, followed by weight stability over the second year. This target was the weight loss expected to be achieved by reducing calorie intake by 25 percent below one s regular intake at the start of the study. The calorie restriction group lost an average of 10 percent of their body weight in the first year, and maintained this weight over the second year. Though weight loss fell short of the target, it is the largest sustained weight loss reported in any dietary trial in non-obese people. The participants achieved substantially less calorie restriction (12 percent) than the trial s 25-percent goal, but maintained calorie restriction over the entire two-year period. The control group s weight and calorie intake were stable over the period. The study was designed to test the effects of calorie restriction on resting metabolic rate (after adjusting for weight loss) and body temperature, which are diminished in many laboratory animal studies and have been proposed to contribute to its effects on longevity. The study found a temporary effect on resting metabolic rate, which was not significant at the end of the study, and no effect on body temperature. Although the expected metabolic effects were not found, calorie restriction significantly lowered several predictors of cardiovascular disease compared to the control group, decreasing average blood pressure by 4 percent and total cholesterol by 6 percent. Levels of HDL ( good ) cholesterol were increased. Calorie restriction caused a 47-percent reduction in levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory factor linked to cardiovascular disease. It also markedly decreased insulin resistance, which is an indicator of diabetes risk. T3, a marker of thyroid hormone activity, decreased in the calorie restriction group by more than 20 percent, while remaining within the normal range. This is of interest since some studies suggest that lower thyroid activity may be associated with longer life span. The study also assessed calorie restriction s effects on mood (particularly hunger-related symptoms) and found no adverse effects. No increased risk of serious adverse clinical events was reported. However, a few participants developed transient anemia and greater-than-expected decreases in bone density given their degree of weight loss, reinforcing the importance of clinical monitoring during calorie restriction.  The CALERIE results are quite intriguing. They show that this degree of sustained calorie restriction can influence disease risk factors and possible predictors of longevity in healthy, non-obese people. It will be important to learn how calorie restriction at this level affects these factors despite the lack of the predicted metabolic effects,  said Evan Hadley, M.D, director of NIA s Division of Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology and an author of the paper.  Since this group already had low risk factor levels at the start of the study, it s important to find out whether these further reductions would yield additional long-term benefits. It also would be useful to discover if calorie restriction over longer periods has additional effects on predictors of health in old age, and compare its effects with exercise-induced weight loss.

The findings suggest new approaches to developing treatments for MSA, which currently has no cure, but also raise a potential concern for clinicians or scientists who come in contact with MSA tissue. The new findings mark the first discovery of a human disease caused by a new prion in 50 years, since work at the National Institutes of Health in the 1960s showed that human brain tissue infected with CJD could transmit neurodegeneration to chimpanzees. It wasn't until 1982 that UCSF's Stanley Prusiner, MD isolated the causative agent for a related disease called scrapie, found in sheep, and characterized it as a prion, for ""infectious protein."" He then determined that the same prion protein caused bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or ""mad cow"" disease, in cattle, and so-called ""variant"" CJD in humans who subsequently consumed BSE-contaminated beef or other tissues. At first, the idea that a simple protein could replicate and spread disease was dismissed by the scientific community, as a tenet of modern biology held that only viruses and living microbes such as bacteria could transmit disease. But subsequent work by Prusiner and others led to an understanding of how prions function at a molecular level. Prusiner, a professor of neurology and director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases (IND) at UCSF, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in 1997. Prion researchers have since suggested that similar misfolded proteins may contribute to more common forms of neurodegeneration, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. ""Now we've conclusively shown that a new type of prion causes MSA,"" said UCSF's Kurt Giles, DPhil, associate professor of neurology, IND researcher and senior author on the second of the two new studies. ""This is our mark in the sand."" Sometimes compared to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the original prion protein identified by Prusiner as being responsible for CJD, known as PrP, can exist in two forms: one harmless and the other fatal. PrP prions in the dangerous, misfolded form latch on to other nearby PrP molecules, causing them to lose their normal shape and initiating a chain reaction that results in sticky, insoluble plaques throughout the brain that kill off cells and result in the typical ""spongy"" appearance of CJD-affected brains. In the new research papers, published the weeks of August 17 and August 31, 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Prusiner, Giles, post-doctoral researcher Amanda Woerman, PhD, and an international team of colleagues report that a misfolded version of a protein called alpha-synuclein seems to act in a similar way to transmit MSA from diseased human brain tissue to mice and to human cell cultures. First described in 1960, MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is rare but more common than CJD: it annually affects 3 out of 100,000 people over the age of 50. Its early symptoms can be mistaken for those of Parkinson's disease, and include movement and balance problems, as well as loss of bladder control, blood-pressure regulation and other functions governed by the autonomic nervous system. Unlike Parkinson's patients, who often live 10 to 20 years after their diagnosis, MSA patients typically die within five to 10 years and do not respond to the drugs or deep brain stimulation used for Parkinson's symptoms. As in Parkinson's disease, neurodegeneration in MSA is accompanied by a buildup of clumps of alpha-synuclein protein within brain cells. Both MSA and PD can arise sporadically in families with no history of the disease, but some inherited forms are associated with mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene. While the mechanisms aren't fully understood, researchers believe these mutations predispose the normal proteins to misfold into infectious prions. Other factors, such as cellular stress and the aging process also are thought to make misfoldings more likely. The new work has its origins in experiments conducted in Prusiner's lab in 2013, showing that samples of brain tissue from two human MSA patients were able to transmit the disease to a mouse model for Parkinson's disease, expressing a mutant human alpha-synuclein gene. To confirm this finding, Prusiner and colleagues expanded this experiment to include tissue samples from a dozen more MSA victims from tissue banks on three continents: the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in Boston, the Parkinson's UK Brain Bank at Imperial College London, and the Sydney Brain Bank in Australia. The results were the same: When exposed to human MSA tissue, the mice developed neurodegeneration. In addition, the team found that the brains of infected mice contained abnormally high levels of insoluble human alpha-synuclein, and that infected mouse brain tissue could itself spread the disease to other mice. The discovery that alpha-synuclein prions can transmit MSA raises a public health concern about treatments and research that involve contact with brain tissue from neurodegeneration patients, because standard disinfection techniques that kill microbes do not eliminate the PrP prions that cause CJD. Whether the same challenges hold for alpha-synuclein prions in MSA remains to be determined. The authors write that clinicians and researchers should adopt much more stringent safety protocols when dealing with tissue from patients with MSA and other neurodegenerative diseases, many of which they believe may also be caused by prions. For instance, MSA is frequently initially diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, which is often treated with deep-brain stimulation. The disease could potentially be transmitted to other patients if deep-brain stimulation equipment is reused. ""You can't kill a protein,"" Giles said. ""And it can stick tightly to stainless steel, even when the surgical instrument is cleaned."" As a result, he said, ""We're advocating a precautionary approach. People are living longer and likely getting more brain surgeries. There could be undiagnosed neurodegenerative diseases that -- if they're caused by prions -- mean infection could be a real worry."" Unlike the danger of BSE from contaminated beef, the researchers stress that there is no apparent risk of infection by MSA prions outside of specialized medical or research settings. In the earlier of the group's two PNAS papers published this month, Woerman led a research team in the development of a rapid new method to test prion transmission using human cell cultures. The team demonstrated that it only takes 4 days for human MSA tissue to infect cultured cells with alpha-synuclein mutations, in contrast to the 120 days it takes for the disease to spread to mouse models. ""The challenge of studying neurodegeneration is that it's a disease of aging,"" Woerman said. ""You have to let the mouse models develop for such a long time that research on cures is really slow to progress. Now, with these cell models, we can test how to inactivate alpha-synuclein aggregates at a speed that just wouldn't be feasible in animals.""

Specifically, the researchers say, their experiments suggest the drug, often sold under the trade name Prozac, prolongs the time after a stroke during which physical therapy remains effective for recovering lost motor function. The study, which may help explain the benefit of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors already seen in stroke patients, holds potentially great value for those too ill immediately after an ischemic stroke to start the intensive rehabilitation therapy needed to recover lost motor functions. Ischemic strokes are marked by the sudden loss of blood circulation to the brain caused by a clot. ""For rehabilitation to be effective, it needs to start as soon after a stroke as possible,"" says Steven Zeiler, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead author of the study reported in the October issue of the journal Stroke. ""But with this study, we've shown that in mice, we can extend the time period during which rehabilitative intervention has an effect on meaningful recovery."" An estimated 65 percent of stroke survivors experience some weakness or paralysis of their limbs, and difficulty in walking and moving due to the death of brain cells from lack of blood flow. Rehabilitation involves retraining other parts of the brain to take over and restore lost functions. Zeiler worked with John Krakauer, M.D., who directs the Brain, Learning, Animation and Movement Lab, to show that in mice, such behavioral efforts work best when they begin early and at high dosages. Numerous research studies have reached similar conclusions, Zeiler says. For the current study, his team tested whether mice with induced strokes given fluoxetine would get the same recovery results even when rehab was delayed. A 2011 study of patients who took fluoxetine after an ischemic stroke -- called ""Fluoxetine for motor recovery after acute ischemic stroke,"" or FLAME -- suggested that the strategy could work. ""We took the results of the success found in the FLAME study and reverse-engineered it to look at what fluoxetine may be doing,"" says Zeiler. ""Nobody knows how fluoxetine worked in those patients' stroke recovery -- only that it did and it does."" The mouse model the researchers used involved training mice to do a task they don't normally do: reach through a slit to grab a food pellet. ""As primates, we make this motion all the time,"" says Zeiler, ""but quadrupeds, like cats, dogs and mice, aren't so good at it."" Once the trained mice became good at it, the researchers induced a stroke in the motor area that affected the mice's ability to do that task. To test whether the mice properly modeled human stroke patients, Zeiler started rehab with some of the mice immediately after the induced stroke. As with human stroke patients, early intervention made a difference: Those mice soon recovered the lost motor function. Mice for which rehab was delayed by a week showed incomplete recovery, gaining back a little less than one-half of their former ability. ""For patients,"" says Zeiler, ""incomplete recovery means weakness or a loss of control in the affected body part or region."" For the mice, it meant that they knocked the food pellet from the holder, dropped it or otherwise lost control of it. When the researchers administered fluoxetine daily to the mice beginning 24 hours after inducing stroke, however, the mice recovered the ability to do the learned task even if they started rehab after a week's delay. Zeiler emphasizes that the precise cause of fluoxetine's effect on stroke recovery is not yet known, but he says that after looking at brain tissue from his study's mice, he thinks the drug changed the way their brains responded to retraining. ""We believe the drug is changing plasticity,"" says Zeiler, ""changing the way individual neurons are responding to sensory input after the stroke."" ""There are some who believe fluoxetine can reduce the amount of brain tissue that dies after a stroke,"" says Zeiler, but his team's findings do not bear that out. ""In fact,"" Zeiler says, ""there was more -- not less -- brain tissue death in the animals that got fluoxetine than in those that did not. We didn't predict that, but the fact that the animals actually got better -- despite increased cell death -- tells us that fluoxetine is having some pretty amazing effects."" ""Time still matters; it's key,"" cautions Zeiler. The mice that fully recovered motor function were started on fluoxetine immediately after the induced stroke; if fluoxetine administration was delayed by one week after stroke, instead of 24 hours, the mice did not fully recover. Like all drugs, Zeiler notes, fluoxetine can have negative side effects. Still, Zeiler says, stroke doctors at Johns Hopkins recommend it for stroke patients, especially those who suffer motor loss. ""But it's not something that a patient would be prescribed forever,"" he adds. Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release Zeiler SR et al.

Eastward winds sweep these particles as far as the Pacific, where dust ultimately settles in the open ocean. This desert dust contains, among other minerals, iron   an essential nutrient for hundreds of species of phytoplankton that make up the ocean s food base. Now scientists at MIT, Columbia University, and Florida State University have determined that once iron is deposited in the ocean, it has a very short residence time, spending only six months in surface waters before sinking into the deep ocean. This high turnover of iron signals that large seasonal changes in desert dust may have dramatic effects on surface phytoplankton that depend on iron.  If there are changes to the sizes of deserts in Asia, or changes in the way people are using land, there could be a larger source of dust to the ocean,  says Chris Hayes, a postdoc in MIT s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).  It s difficult to predict how the whole ecosystem will change, but because the residence time [of iron] is very short, year-to-year changes in dust will definitely have an impact on phytoplankton.  Dust to dust Certain species of phytoplankton, such as cyanobacteria, require iron as a main nutrient to fuel nitrogen fixation and other growth-related processes. Hayes estimates that up to 40 percent of the ocean contains phytoplankton species whose growth is limited by the amount of iron available. As desert dust is one of the only sources of oceanic iron, Hayes wanted to see to what extent changing levels of dust would have an effect on iron concentrations in seawater: Does iron stick around in surface waters for long periods, thereby making phytoplankton less sensitive to changes in incoming dust? Or does the mineral make a short appearance before sinking to inaccessible depths, making phytoplankton depend much more on seasonal dust? To get answers, Hayes and his colleagues traveled to Hawaii to collect ocean samples at a station called ALOHA, the site of a long-term oceanography program conducted by the University of Hawaii. In September 2013, the team took a half-day cruise into open ocean, and then spent two weeks collecting samples of ocean water at varying depths. The researchers acidified the samples and transported them back to the lab at MIT, where they analyzed the water for both iron and thorium   a chemical element that is found in dust alongside iron. As it s difficult to determine the rate at which iron sinks from the ocean s surface to deep waters, Hayes reasoned that thorium might be a reasonable proxy. Thorium has a number of isotopes: Thorium-232 is typically found in dust, and thorium-230 is produced from the decay of uranium, which decays to thorium at the same rate throughout the ocean. By comparing the amount of thorium-230 detected in ocean samples to the amount produced by uranium decay, Hayes was able to calculate thorium s removal rate, or the time it takes for the chemical to sink after settling on the ocean s surface. This removal rate, he reasoned, is equivalent to the input rate of dust, or the rate at which dust is supplied to an ocean region. As the composition of an average desert dust particle is known, Hayes then extrapolated the input rate to estimate iron s residence time in surface waters. A small piece of a big question The team found that on average, iron tends to stay within 150 meters of the ocean s surface   the layer in which phytoplankton resides   for about six months before accumulating on larger particles and sinking to the deep ocean. This residence time leaves a relatively short period for phytoplankton to absorb iron, making the organisms rather sensitive to any changes in incoming desert dust.  Dust can change a lot from season to season   by an order of magnitude,  Hayes says.  From satellite images, you can see big pulses of dust coming from these deserts. That could change with climate change, and different precipitation patterns. So we re trying to keep track: If it does change, will it have an impact?  As phytoplankton play a natural role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, better estimates of iron residence times, and desert dust inputs to the ocean, may help scientists gauge phytoplankton s role in combating climate change.  It s a very small part that we re getting more quantitative about,  Hayes says.  It s one piece that adds to trying to make the prediction: If there s more dust, will the ocean take up more carbon? That s a big-picture question that we can t totally answer with this, but we have one piece on the way to answering that.  Seth John, an associate research professor at the University of Southern California, says that unlike major nutrients like nitrate and phosphate, which phytoplankton can access via upwelling of seawater from the deep ocean, supplies of iron come mostly from the surface ocean.  The short residence time of iron in the surface ocean means that there must continually be a fresh supply of iron from dust every few months or the entire ecosystem would grind to a halt,  says John, who was not involved in the research.  This also means that changes in the supply of iron to the oceans with dust   for example, from industrial pollution or changes in land use   will quickly impact life in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

Research led by Berkeley Lab s Rebecca Abergel, working with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, has found that plutonium, americium, and other actinides can be transported into cells by an antibacterial protein called siderocalin, which is normally involved in sequestering iron. Their results were published online recently in a paper titled,  Siderocalin-mediated recognition, sensitization, and cellular uptake of actinides.  The paper contains several other findings and achievements, including characterization of the first ever protein structures containing transuranic elements and how use of the protein can sensitize the metal s luminescence, which could lead to potential medical and industrial applications.Abergel s group has already developed a compound to sequester actinides and expel them from the body. They have put it in a pill form that can be taken orally, a necessity in the event of radiation exposure amongst a large population. Last year the FDA approved a clinical trial to test the safety of the drug, and they are seeking funding for the tests. However, a basic understanding of how actinides act in the body was still not well known.  Although [actinides] are known to rapidly circulate and deposit into major organs such as bone, liver, or kidney after contamination, the specific molecular mechanisms associated with mammalian uptake of these toxic heavy elements remain largely unexplored,  Abergel and her co-authors wrote. The current research described in PNAS identifies a new pathway for the intracellular delivery of the radioactive toxic metal ions, and thus a possible new target for treatment strategies. The scientists used cultured kidney cells to demonstrate the role of siderocalin in facilitating the uptake of the metal ions in cells.  We showed that this protein is capable of transporting plutonium inside cells,  she said.  So this could help us develop other strategies to counteract actinide exposure. Instead of binding and expelling radionuclides from the body, we could maybe block the uptake.  The team used crystallography to characterize siderocalin-transuranic actinide complexes, gaining unprecedented insights into the biological coordination of heavy radioelements. The work was performed at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), a Department of Energy synchrotron located at Berkeley Lab.  These are the first protein structures containing thorium or the transuranic elements plutonium, americium, or curium,  Abergel said.  Until this work there was no structure in the Protein Data Bank that had those elements. That s an exciting thing for us.  The researchers also made the unexpected finding that siderocalin can act as a  synergistic antenna  that sensitizes the luminescence of actinides and lanthanides.  We showed that by adding the protein we enhance the sensitization pathways, making it much brighter,  Abergel said.  That is a new mechanism that hasn t been explored yet and could be very useful; it could have applications down the line for diagnostics and bioimaging.  Abergel notes that a study like this would have been possible in very few other places.  Very few people have the capabilities to combine the different approaches and techniques the spectroscopy techniques at the ALS, handling of heavy elements that are radioactive, plus the chemical and biological tools we have onsite,  she said.  The combination of all those techniques here is very unique. ","Published: September 1, 2015"

Researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust were able to track key mutations that cancer accumulates as it develops and spreads, without the need for invasive biopsy procedures. They hope that by deciphering the DNA code found in blood samples, it should be possible to identify the particularly mutations likely to prove lethal to that patient   and tailor treatment accordingly. The study is an important step towards use of  liquid biopsies  to revolutionise breast cancer care   by changing the way cancer is monitored in the clinic and informing treatment decisions. The research received funding from a number of organisations including the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at The Royal Marsden and the ICR, Breast Cancer Now and Cancer Research UK. Researchers took tumour and blood samples from 55 breast cancer patients with early-stage disease who had received chemotherapy followed by surgery, and who had potentially been cured of their disease. By monitoring patients with blood tests taken after surgery and then every six months in follow-up, the researchers were able to predict very accurately who would suffer a relapse. Women who tested positive for circulating tumour DNA were at 12 times the risk of relapse of those who tested negative, and the return of their cancer was detected an average of 7.9 months before any visible signs emerged. The researchers used a technique called  mutation tracking    developing a digital PCR test that was personalised to the mutations found in an individual patient s cancer   to identify tumour DNA in the bloodstream. Because the researchers at the ICR and The Royal Marsden were looking for mutations common to many types of breast cancers, they found the test could be applied to all breast cancer subtypes. The research also showed how genetic mutations build up in the cancer as it develops over time, as the leftover cancer cells grow and spread. This reinforces the importance of detecting recurrence early so patients can have treatment before the extra mutations emerge and make the disease harder to treat. Study leader Dr Nicholas Turner, Team Leader in Molecular Oncology at the ICR and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden, said:  We have shown how a simple blood test has the potential to accurately predict which patients will relapse from breast cancer, much earlier than we can currently. We also used blood tests to build a picture of how the cancer was evolving over time, and this information could be invaluable to help doctors select the correct drugs to treat the cancer.   Ours is the first study to show that these blood tests could be used to predict relapse. It will be some years before the test could potentially be available in hospitals, but we hope to bring this date closer by conducting much larger clinical trials starting next year. There are still challenges in implementing this technology, but digital PCR is relatively cost-effective and the information that it provides could make a real difference to breast cancer patients.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of the ICR, said:  We are moving into an era of personalised medicine for cancer patients. This test could help us stay a step ahead of cancer by monitoring the way it is changing and picking treatments that exploit the weakness of the particular tumour. It is really fantastic that we can get such a comprehensive insight about what is going on in the cancer all over the body, without the need for invasive biopsies.  Studies like this also give us a better understanding of how cancer changes to evade treatments   knowledge we can use when we are designing the new cancer drugs of the future.

Leveraging a biologically inspired sponge-like gel called ""cryogel"" as an injectable biomaterial, the vaccine delivers patient-specific tumor cells together with immune-stimulating biomolecules to enhance the body s attack against cancer. The approach, a so-called ""injectable cryogel whole-cell cancer vaccine,"" is reported online. Mooney, who leads a Wyss Institute team developing a broad suite of novel cancer vaccines and immunotherapies, is also the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.His team s latest approach differs from other cancer cell transplantation therapies which harvest tumor cells and then genetically engineer them to trigger immune responses once they are transplanted back into the patient s body in that the new cryogel vaccine s properties are used to evoke the immune response in a far simpler and more economical way. Cryogels are a type of hydrogel made up of cross-linked hydrophilic polymer chains that can hold up to 99 percent water. They are created by freezing a solution of the polymer that is in the process of gelling. When thawed back again to room temperature, the substance turns into a highly interconnected pore-containing hydrogel, which is similar in composition to bodily soft tissues in terms of their water content, structure, and mechanics. By adjusting their shape, physical properties, and chemical composition, Mooney s team generated sponge-like, porous cryogels that can be infused with living cells, biological molecules or drugs for a variety of potential therapeutic applications including cancer immunotherapy. ""Instead of genetically engineering the cancer cells to influence the behavior of immune cells, we use immune-stimulating chemicals or biological molecules inserted alongside harvested cancer cells in the porous, sponge-like spaces of the cryogel vaccine,"" said Mooney. The cryogels can be delivered in a minimally invasive manner due to their extreme flexibility and resilience, enabling them to be compressed to a fraction of their size and injected underneath the skin via a surgical needle. Once injected, they quickly bounce back to their original dimensions to do their job. ""After injection into the body, the cryogels can release their immune-enhancing factors in a highly controlled fashion to recruit specialized immune cells which then make contact and read unique signatures off the patient s tumor cells, also contained in the cryogels. This has two consequences: immune cells become primed to mount a robust and destructive response against patient-specific tumor tissue and the immune tolerance developing within the tumor microenvironment is broken,"" said Sidi Bencherif, the study s co-first author and a Research Associate in Mooney s research group. In experimental animal models on melanoma tumors, results show that utilizing the cryogel to deliver whole cells and drugs triggers a dramatic immune response that can shrink tumors and even prophylactically protect animals from tumor growth. With the pre-clinical success of the new cancer cell vaccination technology, Mooney and his team are going to explore how this cryogel-based method could be more broadly useful to treat a number of different cancer types. ""This promising new approach is a great example of the power of collaboration across disciplines, bringing together expertise from the Wyss Institute and Dana-Farber spanning bioengineering, cancer biology and immunology,"" said Mooney. ""This new injectable form of this biomaterials-based cancer vaccine will help to expand the cancer immunotherapy arsenal, and it's a great example of how engineering and materials science can be used to mimic the body s own natural responses in a truly powerful way,"" said Don Ingber, the Wyss Institute s Founding Director, who also is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at SEAS.","Published: September 1, 2015"

The finding is significant because the exposure level of 10 parts per billion used in the study is the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard, or maximum allowable amount, for arsenic in drinking water. The study, which appeared online August 21 in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, serves as a good starting point for examining whether low-dose arsenic exposure could have similar health outcomes in humans. Scientists from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, divided pregnant mice into three groups. The control group received no arsenic in its drinking water, while the two experimental groups received either the EPA standard of 10 parts per billion of arsenic or 42.5 parts per million of arsenic, a level known to have detrimental effects in mice. One part per billion is a thousand times smaller than one part per million. The mice were exposed during gestation, between 10 days after fertilization and birth, which corresponds to the middle of the first trimester and birth in humans. ""We unexpectedly found that exposure to arsenic before birth had a profound effect on onset of puberty and incidence of obesity later in life,"" said NIEHS reproductive biologist and co-author Humphrey Yao, Ph.D. ""Although these mice were exposed to arsenic only during fetal life, the impacts lingered through adulthood."" The impacts Yao is referring to are obesity and early onset puberty, particularly in female mice. The researchers did not examine in this study whether males also experienced early onset puberty, but they did confirm that male mice exposed to arsenic in utero also displayed weight gain as they aged. Both the low and high doses of arsenic resulted in weight gain. According to lead author NIEHS biologist Karina Rodriguez, Ph.D., the research team performed the experiment in three separate batches of mice, each containing a control and two experimental groups, and achieved similar results. She said although the biological process responsible for these effects remains unknown, the study highlights the need to continue researching long-term impacts of what mothers eat, drink, and breathe during pregnancy on the welfare of the offspring. ""It's very important to study both high doses and low doses,"" said Linda Birnbaum, Ph.D., director of NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program.

Taconic is donating the work as a Corporate Sponsor and Ultimate Technology Sponsor of the 2015 Rare Disease Science Challenge: Be HEARD. The winning project was submitted by Michael and Rachel Harris, whose 9-year-old son David was diagnosed with Vici Syndrome in early 2015. Hosted by the Rare Genomics Institute, the Rare Disease Science Challenge is an annual event in which industry sponsors donate services to accelerate rare disease research. From a field of 60 applicants, the winning project was selected for the Taconic-sponsored award valued at $50,000.  Development of a relevant mouse model is a critical first step in understanding the mechanisms of rare diseases like Vici Syndrome and ultimately developing effective therapies,  said Bob Rosenthal, CEO, Taconic Biosciences.  Taconic will make the first step possible by delivering an integrated solution which leverages our comprehensive portfolio of model generation, breeding and cryopreservation capabilities in support of this vital work.  Vici Syndrome is a rare, severe congenital multisystem disorder characterized by a failure to develop the corpus callosum region of the brain, along with cardiomyopathy, cataracts, hypopigmentation of the skin, eyes and hair, and combined immunodeficiency. Taconic will employ technologies such as CRISPR gene editing to develop a model with the specific EPG5 gene mutation demonstrated to recur in patients in multiple families. Taconic will also breed a cohort of mice for the participating researchers  use and cryopreserve the line to safeguard against genetic drift or natural disasters. The two investigators on the project see the Taconic model as essential to elucidating how the disease progresses and the therapies it may respond to.  Apart from its recognized role in the autophagy pathway, a fundamental intracellular quality control mechanism, the EPG5 gene offers no clues to its more precise function(s); we don t know how it operates and the impact of the mutation is unpredictable,  said Mathias Gautel, BHF Chair of Molecular Cardiology at King s College London BHF Research Excellence Centre.  We hope this model will help us unravel the basic biology of Vici syndrome and eventually identify therapies and screen compounds.  He added,  Working with Taconic, the speed at which we can get to a usable colony is much faster, and speed is a major factor.  Heinz Jungbluth, Reader and Consultant in Paediatric Neurology at the Children s Neuroscience Centre at St. Thomas  Hospital in London, noted that  Vici Syndrome is one of the most extensive conditions I ve encountered in my clinical practice over the years, and there s been a lack of suitable models that accurately replicate the phenotype seen in humans. The Taconic model will help us conduct research with the potential to lead to therapeutic approaches that can ameliorate some of the disease symptoms.  Michael and Rachel Harris view the availability of a mouse model specific to the disease as critical to the future of their son and other patients.  Through the model we hope researchers will find therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for David and others with Vici Syndrome,  Rachel said.  Because the model will have the exact gene mutation that is seen in multiple families with the condition, we expect it will help researchers understand how the disease progresses and then test new therapeutic approaches,  said Michael, a researcher at Georgetown University.","Published: September 1, 2015"

The presentation summarizes studies designed to further understand the reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) observed in patients with atherosclerotic disease given RVX-208 from the phase 2b trials called SUSTAIN and ASSURE. In order to identify the potential biologic processes underlying the benefit of RVX-208 in the study patients, primary human hepatocytes were exposed to RVX-208 and then changes in gene expression were surveyed using micro-array technology. This treatment caused decreases in the expression of many genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, innate immunity and glucose processing. Amongst the changes observed, RVX-208 decreased expression in 19 out of 26 genes that encoded components in the complement pathway. Similarly, RVX-208 decreased expression in 20 out of 33 gene that encoded components within the coagulation cascade. Further support of the micro-array data that identified changes in gene expression by probing the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels was pursued by measuring specific proteins within the complement and coagulation cascade using plasma from SUSTAIN and ASSURE trials. Results showed significant decreases ranging from 7-12% vs. baseline in complement (i.e. complement factor 3) and coagulation components. In additional studies, donor whole blood was exposed ex-vivo to RVX-208 followed by micro-array analysis enabling the identification of several pathways with known roles in atherogenesis including; pro-inflammatory signaling, cell-cell interactions and extracellular matrix organization. The actions of RVX-208 lowered atherogenesis by downregulating (8 of 11) pro-atherogenic genes but in contrast, upregulated (5 of 7) anti-atherogenic genes that control monocyte recruitment, migration and activation, macrophage function, inflammatory signaling and plaque stability. Together, the new data from both primary human hepatocytes and whole blood suggest an overall anti-atherosclerotic benefit of RVX-208 that extends beyond its ApoA-I/HDL enhancing effects. ""Data summarized in the ESC presentation provide novel insights into the actions of RVX-208 also known as apabetalone. This molecule acts on epigenetics via bromodomain extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibition and it is the first member in the class of such compounds. Apabetalone affects multiple pathways including; anti-thrombotic, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-inflammatory that may act in concert to reduce MACE in patients with CVD risk,"" stated Dr. Norman Wong. ""Our findings described here provide valuable insights into the benefits of BET inhibition and are most timely as we embark on our Phase 3 clinical trial BETonMACE.""","Published: September 1, 2015"

The drug, daratumumab, proved generally safe in patients, even at the highest doses tested in the study. The results of the trial - a combined phase 1 and 2 study - strongly support testing of the drug in a larger group of patients in both phase 2 and 3 trials, the authors say.  The treatment of multiple myeloma has improved significantly in recent years with the introduction of therapies such as proteasome inhibitors [which interfere with tumor cells  protein-disposal system] and potent immuno-modulatory agents,  said the paper s senior author and lead investigator, Paul Richardson, MD, clinical program leader and director of clinical research at Dana-Farber s Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, and the R.J. Corman professor at Harvard Medical School.  Unfortunately, while these agents generally work for a considerable period of time, resistance inevitably emerges, and far fewer treatment options are available in this setting. Therefore there is a great need to develop new treatments for this patient population in particular,  said Richardson. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody preparation that targets CD38, a protein strewn over the surface of myeloma cells but less abundant on normal cells, which can act as a receptor and transmit signals to the cell interior. In laboratory studies, daratumumab caused the targeted killing of CD38-carrying tumor cells by several distinct and potent mechanisms, including some that involve the immune system. The new study involved 72 patients, all of whom had received at least two prior lines of therapy and whose disease had relapsed and no longer responded to treatment. Following an initial phase in which the dose of the drug was gradually increased in patients, 72 patients enrolled in the second phase, in which two doses were tested at different administration schedules - weekly, twice monthly, and monthly - for up to two years. Of the 42 patients receiving the higher dosage, 36 percent experienced durable responses, including two who had complete remissions and two more whose remissions also were high quality (known as very good partial responses). In this group, the median period in which the disease was held in check was 5.6 months. In addition, two-thirds of patients who benefited from the drug had no advance of the disease for at least 12 months. Most side effects of the drug were relatively mild, the most common being fatigue, nasal congestion, and fever. More severe side effects were less frequent and included pneumonia, low blood platelets, low white blood cell counts, anemia, and excess blood sugar, but these were not thought to be a direct effect of the antibody itself.  As a single-agent therapy, daratumumab showed significant promise against difficult-to-treat disease in our patients with advanced myeloma and who have few other therapeutic options,  Richardson remarked.  Because it targets a key receptor and works through different mechanisms than other available agents, it clearly has merited comprehensive testing in larger clinical trials. Preliminary results from these studies have been very encouraging. ","Published: September 1, 2015"

A tiny camera that could produce 3-D images from inside the brain would help surgeons see more intricacies of the tissue they are handling and lead to faster, safer procedures. An endoscope with such a camera is being developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. MARVEL, which stands for Multi Angle Rear Viewing Endoscopic tooL, was honored in August 2015 with the Outstanding Technology Development award from the Federal Laboratory Consortium. ""With one of the world's smallest 3-D cameras, MARVEL is designed for minimally invasive brain surgery,"" said Harish Manohara, principal investigator of the project at JPL. Manohara is working in collaboration with surgeon Dr. Hrayr Shahinian at the Skull Base Institute in Los Angeles, who approached JPL to create this technology. MARVEL's camera is a mere 0.2 inch (4 millimeters) in diameter and about 0.6 inch (15 millimeters) long. It is attached to a bendable ""neck"" that can sweep left or right, looking around corners with up to a 120-degree arc. This allows for a highly maneuverable endoscope. Operations with the small camera would not require traditional open craniotomies which result in higher costs and longer stays in hospitals than surgery using an endoscope. Stereo imaging endoscopes that employ traditional dual-camera systems are already in use for minimally invasive surgeries elsewhere in the body. But surgery on the brain requires even more miniaturization. That's why, instead of two, MARVEL has only one camera lens. To generate 3-D images, MARVEL's camera has two apertures -- akin to the pupil of the eye -- each with its own color filter. Each filter transmits distinct wavelengths of red, green and blue light, while blocking the bands to which the other filter is sensitive. The system includes a light source that produces all six colors of light to which the filters are attuned. Images from each of the two sets are then merged to create the 3-D effect. Now that researchers have demonstrated a laboratory prototype, the next step is a clinical prototype that meets the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The researchers will refine the engineering of the tool to make it suitable for use in real-world medical settings. In the future, the MARVEL camera technology could also have applications for space exploration. A miniature camera such as this could be put on small robots that explore other worlds, delivering intricate 3-D views of geological features of interest. ""You can implement a zoom function and get close-up images showing the surface roughness of rock and other microscopic details,"" Manohara said. ""As a skull base surgeon with a specific vision of endoscopic brain surgery, it has been a privilege and a great personal honor working with the JPL team over the past eight years to realize this project,"" Shahinian said. MARVEL is being developed at JPL for the Skull Base Institute, which has licensed the technology from the California Institute of Technology. JPL is managed for NASA by Caltech.

This indicates that the tendency to want food may be 'hard-wired' into the brain of overweight patients, becoming a functional brain biomarker. The work is being presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) conference in Amsterdam, August 29 to September 1. Obesity is one of the most difficult problems facing modern society. Treating obesity is a health priority, but most efforts (aside from bariatric surgery) have met with little success. In part, this is because the mechanisms associated with the desire to eat are poorly understood. Recently, studies are beginning to suggest that the brain mechanisms underlying obesity may be similar to those in substance addiction, and that treatment methodologies may be approached in the same way as other substance addictions, such as alcohol or drug addiction. To test this, a group of researchers in the University of Granada, Spain, and Monash University in Australia, have looked for the functional connectivity differences in brain reward systems of normal-weight and obese individuals. The researchers gave buffet-style food to 39 obese and 42 normal-weight individuals. Later, they were put into functional MRI brain scanners and shown photographs of the food to stimulate food craving. The functional MRI scans showed that food craving was associated with different brain connectivity, depending on whether the subject was normal-weight or overweight. They found that in obese individuals, the stimulus from food craving was associated with a greater connectivity between the dorsal caudate and the somatosensory cortex, implicated in reward-based habits and the coding of the energetic value of foods, respectively. However, with normal weight individuals, food craving was associated with a greater connectivity between different parts of the brain -- e.g. between the ventral putamen and the orbitofrontal cortex. The researchers then measured Body Mass Index (BMI) three months afterwards and found that 11% of the weight gain in the obese individuals could be predicted by the presence of the increased connectivity between the dorsal caudate and the somatosensory cortex areas of the brain. According to lead researcher, Oren Contreras-Rodr guez: ""There is an ongoing controversy over whether obesity can be called a ""food addiction,"" but in fact there is very little research which shows whether or not this might be true. The findings in our study support the idea that the reward processing following food stimuli in obesity is associated with neural changes similar to those found in substance addiction. This still needs to be viewed as an association between food craving behavior and brain changes, rather than one necessarily causing the other. However, these findings provide potential brain biomarkers which we can use to help manage obesity, for example through pharmacotherapies and brain stimulation techniques that might help control food intake in clinical situations.""

Whether originating in the nose of a mammal or the antennas of an insect, perception results from the combined activation of multiple receptors located in these organs. Identifying the full repertoire of receptors stimulated by a given odorant would represent a key step in deciphering the code that mediates these behaviors. To this end, a tool that provides a complete olfactory receptor signature corresponding to any specific smell was developed in the Faculties of Science and Medicine of the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland. Published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, this approach allows us to identify thousands of chemosensory receptors, among which, potentially, those able to trigger predetermined behaviors in mammals or in insects, such as pests, disease vectors or parasites. If we know that mosquitoes track us down thanks to the carbon dioxide we reject, or that salmons find their native river by recognizing its olfactory signature, many of the receptors activated by these stimuli remain unidentified. This extends to the majority of odorants perceived by mammals, as well as pheromones, which trigger or inhibit a specific behavior. From human beings to flies, animals create an odorant representation of the world which surrounds them thanks to the selective and combined activation of receptors present in the sensory organs. The genes coding for these chemosensors, amounting to about 400 in humans and 1'100 in mice, constitute the largest and most diversified group of genes in mammals. ""The olfactory receptors' superfamily has been known for more than twenty years, but the identification of its members which are stimulated by a given odorant has been hampered by technical difficulties. Yet, this represents a key step in deciphering the rules governing chemoperception in animals, including those in human beings,"" says Ivan Rodriguez, professor at the Department of Genetics and Evolution of UNIGE. In collaboration with Alan Carleton, professor at the Faculty of Medicine, the team of the biologist took advantage of one of its discoveries to try to develop a tool which may serve this purpose. ""We observed in mice, after an olfactory stimulation, a decrease in the transcription of genes encoding the receptors activated by the smell perceived,"" details Ivan Rodriguez. The approach devised by the researchers actually provides a snapshot of the number and the identity of the receptors stimulated at a specific time in the olfactory neurons of the nose in response to an odorant. ""This olfactory signature can also be established in Drosophila, from its antennas. This demonstrates the versatility of our approach and suggests that it could be used to identify populations of neurons active elsewhere than in the olfactory system, in other regions of the brain for instance,"" notes Daniel Rossier, co-first author of the study. This method allows to identify, in a few days only, thousands of receptors and, consequently, molecules which can activate or inhibit them. It represents an essential tool to unravel the logic of the chemosensory code across animal species. Its applications, countless, extend for example to the domain of chemicals able to trigger predetermined behaviors in mammals or in insects, such as pests, disease vectors or parasites. ""Besides, it is not necessary to know the genome of the species studied, because only the gene transcripts, that is the RNA messengers, which are the gene 'prints', are analysed,"" explains Ivan Rodriguez.

To ensure both groups experienced the same brain stimuli, the measurements were taken while the subjects watched a movie, Tim Burton s Alice in Wonderland. The work is being presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) conference in Amsterdam, August 29 to September 1. High-precision fMRI is often used in neuroscience to locate brain activity in response to stimuli. With psychotic patients, these experiments often look at chronically ill patients, and so the differences in brain activity shown in the scans would be more obvious than in most of real life. However, early psychosis is more difficult to detect: the patterns in the brain are not as  hard wired  so the differences are more subtle when compared to control groups. Given the subtle differences, researchers are also faced with the problem of trying to ensure that the patients and controls receive the same stimuli while undergoing measurement, so that the brains of the patients and the controls are concentrating on the same things while being scanned. Ideally, these stimuli should be involving and information-rich, like in a real-life situation Now a group of Finnish researchers have come up with a creative solution:  patients and controls were scanned while watching the movie Alice in Wonderland, which guaranteed that they were receiving the same information-rich stimulus. Using a 3-Tesla MRI device, they scanned the brains of 46 first-episode psychotic patients (meaning that they had only had one psychotic event) and 32 healthy controls, while watching the movie. The researchers found that significant differences could be seen in the precuneus region of the brain, which is an area associated with memory, visuospatial awareness, self-awareness, and aspects of consciousness. Asked by the ECNP, lead researcher, Eva Rikandi (Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland) said, ""in this work, we attempted to determine whether a person is a first-episode psychosis patient or a healthy control subject just by looking at their brain activity recorded during movie viewing. We found, that by monitoring activity in a region known as the precuneus we were able to distinguish patients from control subjects especially well. This would mean that the precuneus, a central hub for the integration of self- and episodic-memory-related information, plays an important role in this kind of information processing of psychotic patients."" She continued, ""we were able to achieve almost 80% classification accuracy using these methods. This is the first study which directly associates the beginnings of psychosis with the precuneus, so it is now important that much more research is done in this area."" The researchers hope that this approach can feed into earlier screening and better diagnosisof at-risk populations. ECNP President-Elect, Professor Celso Arango (Madrid) said, ""the interesting question here is how patients with psychosis, even in their first episode, process information in a different way. Specifically how a movie such as Alice in Wonderland elicits the participation of different brain areas, and how that relate to the history of the person watching. What we would like to know is if patients with psychosis might see this as more or less relevant to their own life than would healthy controls.

Now, researchers at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan have discovered a factor helps shape dendritic arbors. Published in Nature Neuroscience, the work reveals how the protein centrosomin prevents dendrites from branching out. Dendrites grow and branch as structural elements called microtubules push the ends out in specific directions. Microtubules are often likened to cellular scaffolding, and are built on site by growing out from one end. To determine how microtubule growth and dendritic branching is regulated, the researchers examined sensory neurons from Drosophila fruit flies. The scientists focused on a type of Drosophila sensory neuron that has very limited dendritic branching and expresses the transcription factor called Abrupt. Researchers began by determining that expression of Abrupt leads to reduced arbors, while its absence leads to more complex arbors. Next, they tested a group of candidate proteins from the pathway of molecular events initiated by Abrupt, looking for one that regulates microtubules. They found that loss of centrosomin -- a protein that makes microtubule-based structures necessary for cell division -- resulted in more extensive dendritic branching, and its addition could block the increase in branching caused by lack of Abrupt. The team then discovered that by working with another protein called pericentrin, centrosomin could control where new microtubules form within the dendrites. When one end of a microtubule is attached to something, it does not push out new dendritic branches as it grows. However, when microtubules form at no particular site, the opposite is true, and new branches are more likely to form as it grows. Further testing revealed that centrosomin acts as a glue that fixes microtubules, particularly to Golgi bodies, which is why its presence promotes less complex branching. ""The shape and complexity of neuronal dendrite arbors are often disrupted in neurological diseases,"" notes team leader Adrian Moore. ""It turns out the two microtubule regulators we found in this study of Drosophila neurons -- centrosomin and pericentrin -- are encoded by genes mutated in some human brain disorders. As we learn more about how neurons control the growth of dendrites it will help us understand these diseases more completely, and we may learn how to initiate and direct neuron growth as therapy for diseases and after neuronal injury.""

This result supports research that women in general may deal with speech and interaction differently than men. The sex hormone testosterone exerts a substantial influence on human behavior and cognition. Previous studies have shown that testosterone has a particular influence on verbal fluency. But these investigations (which due to ethical reasons are mostly observational studies or one-off hormone administrations) have been limited in what they can show, as it has been impossible to follow the direct effect of the hormone on the brain structure. Now a unique study has revealed the changes over time (longitudinal changes) in the brain of female-to-male transsexuals receiving continuous, high-dose hormone therapy as part of their sexual reassignment.  The work is being presented at European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) 28th Congress in Amsterdam August 29 to September 1. The results show that this therapy induces structural changes in areas of the brain involved in verbal fluency in female-to-male transsexuals. This may have wider implications, for example in the way that men and women handle speech and interaction. The researchers, from Vienna and Amsterdam, worked with 18 female-to-male subjects (27.6  6.4 years), before and during testosterone treatment. The subjects underwent MRI brain scans before and after 4 weeks of the testosterone administration. The results showed that with testosterone treatment the volume of gray matter decreased in two specific regions of the brain, the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are mainly responsible for language processing. At the same time, the neuronal pathway (white matter) connecting these two regions via the extreme capsule got stronger. According to researcher Dr Andreas Hahn (Vienna), ""it has been known for some time that higher testosterone is linked to smaller vocabulary in children and that verbal fluency skills decrease in female-to-male transsexuals after testosterone treatment. This fits in well with our finding of decreased grey matter volume. However, the strengthening of the white matter in these areas was a surprise. We think that when it comes to certain language skills, the loss of grey matter outweighs the strengthened white matter connection."" Researcher Prof. Rupert Lanzenberger (Vienna, Austria) continued, ""what we see is a real quantitative difference in brain structure after prolonged exposure to testosterone. This would have been impossible to understand without looking at a transsexual population. In more general terms, these findings may suggest that the genuine difference between the brains of women and men is substantially attributable to the effects of circulating sex hormones. Moreover, the hormonal influence on human brain structure goes beyond early developmental phases and is still present in adulthood."" Commenting for the ECNP Communications Committee, Dr Kamilla Miskowiak, said ""it is well-known that language development differs between girls and boys and that this is related to gender-related differences in brain maturation. However, this intriguing neuroimaging study of transsexuals before and after their female-to-male gender reassignment suggests that even adult men and women differ in brain structure within regions involved in language and speech. In particular, female-to-male gender reassignment resulted in local brain matter decrease within language processing regions, which may explain why verbal abilities are often stronger in women.""

This work is being presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) conference in Amsterdam, August 29 to September 1. Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions, with around 1 in 100 people experiencing schizophrenia in their lifetime. The main symptoms fall into 3 categories: positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations; negative symptoms, such as lack of drive and social withdrawal; and cognitive symptoms, such as problems with attention and memory. The negative symptoms tend to persist, and don t respond well to current treatment. Effective medicines (antipsychotics) exist for positive symptoms, but negative symptoms and cognitive impairment do not respond well to the available treatments. Now the results of a new Phase III clinical trial indicate that the negative symptoms may be treatable with a new investigational drug, cariprazine, which binds to the D2 and D3 dopamine receptor with D3 preference. The researchers, all from the Gedeon Richter pharmaceutical company which developed the drug, enrolled 461 men and women in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, to compare cariprazine against risperidone (which is commonly used to treat schizophrenia). Patients were treated for 26 weeks, with 77.4% of enrolled patients completing the trial. Full details of the trial are given in the abstract. The outcomes were measured using a special subscale of the PANSS scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) which is a standard method used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. After 26 weeks of treatment, it was found that cariprazine treatment group showed a statistically significant improvement in the PANSS-NFS scale relative to risperidone (-1.47; p=0.002). In addition to the effect on predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia, patients who took cariprazine also performed significantly better on personal and social functioning than those who took risperidone. Full details of the trial are given in the abstract. According to lead researcher Dr Gy rgy N meth (Chief Medical Officer, Gedeon Richter),  the positive symptoms of schizophrenia can be controlled by drugs, but this is the first study ever to show a significant effect of a compound on negative symptom compared to another antipsychotic. It seems that with cariprazine, we may be able to treat both the positive and negative symptoms with a single medication.  Commenting, ECNP Executive Committee Member Professor Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg said  treatments for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are still urgently needed as these are critical predictors for patient s recovery and reintegration. The current results suggest that D3-dopaminergic mechanisms may play a role in both causing and treating emotional flatness, which deserve further confirmation.  The trial was organized and supported by the Gedeon Richter pharmaceutical company, which developed cariprazine.  The researchers report that the most frequent adverse events (incidence  5%) across both treatments groups were insomnia, headache, akathisia, worsening of schizophrenia symptoms, anxiety and somnolence. As this drug has not yet completed the approval process, no indication of the costs of the treatment is available.

The findings are published online in the latest issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry. Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and behavior. They are estimated to occur in up to three percent of the population and are a leading cause for disability worldwide. Psychotic episodes are currently treated with antipsychotic drugs, but this treatment is given without guidance from lab tests or brain scans, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI). Doctors often use ""trial-and-error"" when choosing treatment for psychotic disorders, without knowing if patients will respond well. This lack of knowledge places a large burden on not only patients and their families, but also healthcare professionals and healthcare systems. Led by Anil Malhotra, MD, director of psychiatry research at Zucker Hillside Hospital and an investigator at the Feinstein Institute, and Todd Lencz, PhD, associate investigator at the Zucker Hillside Hospital and the Feinstein Institute, researchers used fMRI scans obtained before treatment to predict ultimate response to medications in patients suffering from their first episode of schizophrenia. Connectivity patterns of a region of the brain called the striatum, which tends to be atypical in patients suffering from psychotic disorders, were used to create an index. This index significantly predicted if psychotic symptoms were decreased in the studies' patients. What's even more significant is that the researchers applied this index to confirm their results in a separate group of patients with more chronic illness -- those who were hospitalized for psychotic symptoms. They found that treatment outcome could be predicted in the replication group as well. ""This study is the first to report a predictive fMRI-derived measure validated in an independent study group of patients treated with antipsychotics,"" said Deepak Sarpal, MD, a lead author of the study.

The favor, however, may not always be returned. Dramatic research has shown that during pregnancy, cells of the fetus often migrate through the placenta, taking up residence in many areas of the mother's body, where their influence may benefit or undermine maternal health. The presence of fetal cells in maternal tissue is known as fetal microchimerism. The term alludes to the chimeras of ancient Greek myth--composite creatures built from different animal parts, like the goat-lion-serpent depicted in an Etruscan bronze sculpture. According to Amy Boddy, a researcher in the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University (ASU) and lead author of a new study, chimeras exist. Indeed, many humans bear chimerical traits in the form of foreign cells from parents, siblings or offspring, acquired during pregnancy. ""Fetal cells can act as stem cells and develop into epithelial cells, specialized heart cells, liver cells and so forth. This shows that they are very dynamic and play a huge role in the maternal body. They can even migrate to the brain and differentiate into neurons,"" Boddy says ""We are all chimeras."" Fellow ASU researchers Angelo Fortunato, Melissa Wilson Sayres and Athena Aktipis joined Boddy for the new study. Fortunato is with the Biodesign's Institute's Human and Comparative Genomics Lab. Wilson Sayres and Aktipis--both with Biodesign's Center for Evolution and Medicine-- are also researchers with ASU's School of Life Sciences and Department of Psychology, respectively. While fetal microchimerism is a common occurrence across placental mammals, (including humans), the effects of such cells on maternal health remain a topic of fierce debate in the biological community. In research appearing in the advanced online edition of the journal Bioessays, Boddy and her colleagues review the available literature on fetal microchimerism and human health, applying an evolutionary framework to predict when fetal cells are inclined to act cooperatively to enhance maternal health and when their behavior is likely to be competitive, occasionally leading to adverse effects on the mother. Fetal cells may do more than simply migrate to maternal tissues. The authors suggest they can act as a sort of placenta outside the womb, redirecting essential assets from the maternal body to the developing fetus. Cells derived from the fetus--which can persist in maternal tissues for decades after a child is born--have been associated with both protection and increased susceptibility to a range of afflictions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. But, as co-author Wilson Sayres, cautions, ""it's not only a tug of war between maternal and fetal interests. There is also a mutual desire for the maternal system to survive and provide nutrients and for the fetal system to survive and pass on DNA."" If some degree of fetal microchimerism exerts a beneficial effect on maternal and offspring survival, it will likely be selected for by evolution as an adaptive strategy. A review of existing data on fetal microchimerism and health suggests that fetal cells enter a cooperative relationship in some maternal tissues, compete for resources in other tissues and may exist as neutral entities--hitchhikers simply along for the ride. It is likely that fetal cells play each of these roles at various times. For example, fetal cells may contribute to inflammatory responses and autoimmunity in the mother, when they are recognized as foreign entities by the maternal immune system. This may account in part for higher rates of autoimmunity in women. (For example, women have three times higher rates of rheumatoid arthritis, compared with men). Fetal cells can also provide benefits to mothers, migrating to damaged tissue and repairing it. Their presence in wounds--including caesarian incisions--points to their active participation in healing. In other cases, fetal cells from the placenta are swept through the bloodstream into areas including the lung, where they may persist merely as bystanders. Applying a cooperation and conflict approach, the authors make testable predictions about the circumstances favoring fetal cell cooperation or competition and attendant positive or negative effects on maternal health. ""Cooperation theory and evolutionary analyses are powerful tools for helping us to unravel the complex effects of fetal cells on the maternal body. They can help us to predict when fetal cells are likely to contribute to maternal health and when they may be manipulating maternal tissues for the benefit of the offspring and potentially contributing to maternal disease in the process,"" says Aktipis. Evolutionary theory suggests that fetal cells will act cooperatively to enhance maternal health where the economic cost of doing so is low, for example, in tissue maintenance. Where the cost to fetal cells is high, including the division of limited resources between fetus and mother, competition is the more likely outcome, with escalating conflict leading to harmful effects for mother, developing fetus or both. Fetal cells appear to play a complex role in the female breast and have been detected in over half of all women sampled. Given the co-evolution of maternal and fetal cells over the 160 million year course of placental mammalian evolution, it appears likely that fetal cells are active participants in breast development and lactation. Milk production is a vital but energy-intensive activity for the mother, requiring subtle regulation. Poor lactation--a common affliction--may be linked with low fetal cell count in breast tissue. (The hypothesis suggests that a simple, non-invasive test for fetal cell abundance in breast milk could provide the first conclusive evidence of fetal cell influence on maternal health). With respect to breast cancer, existing data paints a complex picture. Fetal cells are generally found in lower abundance in women with breast cancer, compared with healthy women, suggesting they may play a protective role. On the other hand, some data indicates that fetal cells may be linked with a transient increase in the risk of breast cancer in the years immediately following pregnancy. The thyroid gland performs a broad range of regulatory functions and during pregnancy, is involved in the efficient transfer of heat from the mother to the offspring. Again, fetal cells found in the thyroid are implicated and may be manipulating thyroid activity to enhance heat transfer to the fetus, potentially at the energetic expense of the mother. Fetal cells occur more frequently in both the blood and thyroid tissue of women with thyroid diseases including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease and thyroid cancer, compared with healthy women. (Intriguingly, cancer of the thyroid is the only non-sex-specific form of cancer found more frequently in women than men.) The authors suggest that the maternal system, in attempting to wrest control from fetal cell influence, may induce hazardous levels of autoimmunity and inflammation. The current overview represents a tentative step toward untangling the myriad influences of fetal microchimerism on human health. One of the more tantalizing possibilities raised in the new study is that fetal cells may be commandeering neural pathways overseeing emotion and behavior. They may, for example, hijack mechanisms triggering the release of oxytocin, a hormone long associated with the emotional bonding of mother and infant. Indeed, fetal cells could be suspects in a broad range of physical and emotional manifestations in the mother, including pregnancy-related afflictions like morning sickness or postpartum depression. Even early onset menopause could be the result of fetal cell efforts to remove the mother from further child-bearing, in order to secure maximum resources for the fetus and eventually, the growing child. Finally, the authors note, fetal microchimerism may be one piece of a subtle and dizzyingly complex puzzle. Cell traffic is actually bi-directional, with the fetus receiving cells from the mother. Fetal cells from maternal tissue may cross the placental barrier during subsequent pregnancies, potentially influencing the health of later offspring. To further complicate matters, cells from later fetuses can also cross the placenta to enter the microchimeric arena, perhaps introducing sibling rivalries for the mother's limited resources. Fetal cells may eventually provide a novel and powerful means of diagnosing existing conditions and predicting long-term maternal health. As the authors note, they could also be applied therapeutically in the future, potentially for the treatment of poor lactation, for wound healing, tumor reduction and perhaps even pregnancy-linked psychological disorders. Identification of fetal cells in maternal gut, liver or brain tissues is only a first step. To tease out the true function of these cells, researchers need to examine their gene expression and interaction with maternal tissues. Inspection of maternal cells in surrounding tissue will help determine if they are immune cells targeting fetal cell interlopers or normal epithelial cells, existing in harmony. ""If future research bears out the predictions of this framework, it could transform the way we approach, treat and prevent a variety of diseases that affect women, especially new mothers,"" says Aktipis. Improved methods of screening will help scientists listen in on the intricate dialog between fetal and maternal cells, deepening our understanding of maternal health and disease.

Published in Science, the study shows how a phospholipid released by glial cells--the cells in the nervous system that support neurons--controls the positioning of sensory neurons within the spinal cord. Axons--the long extensions of neurons--are the roads that allow neural information to travel from place to place, and their pathways are typically specific for each of our senses, eventually reaching different places in our brains and spinal cords. During development, the growth of axons is guided by a patterned distribution of molecules that either attract or repel them, forcing them to go in the proper direction. ""While many proteins are known to direct axon growth and network formation,"" says Senior Team Leader Hiroyuki Kamiguchi, ""we discovered that glial cells have the ability to release membrane structural lipids in specific patterns that can then control axon migration and neuron organization. In this case, we found that a lipid called LysoPtdGlc has a major role in separating axons of pain- and position-sensing neurons from each other."" Before reaching our brains, the first stop for sensory information from our skin and muscles is the spinal cord. Axons carrying this information enter the spinal cord together, but soon separate. Those responsible for feelings of pain--nociception--travel along the side of the spinal cord, while those that let us know where our muscles are--proprioception--travel in a neighboring region closer to the midline. When researchers labeled spinal cord sections from chicks with markers for LysoPtdGlc and the two different types of sensory neurons, they found that LysoPtdGlc was located only near the midline region where position-sensing axons are located. This led the team to hypothesize that when axons of pain-sensing neurons encounter LysoPtdGlc, they are repulsed away from this midline area, and forced to travel in the more lateral region of the spinal cord. To test this theory, they looked at how cultured pain-sensing neurons responded to LysoPtdGlc, finding that gradients of LysoPtdGlc repelled axons from the pain-sensing neurons. This function of LysoPtdGlc was confirmed when blocking access to the lipid with an experimental antibody prevented pain-sensing neurons from being repelled. The researchers then moved their experiments out of the petri dish and injected the antibody into the spinal cord of chick embryos. Their hypothesis that LysoPtdGlc was responsible for directing axon growth proved correct; the axons of pain-sensing neurons were no longer repelled, and instead migrated into the region on the spinal cord reserved for position-sensitive neurons. Kamiguchi notes, ""lipid research is technically difficult but has the potential to uncover important biological processes that are not governed by protein-based mechanisms."" Living up to this prediction, the team was able to uncover how LysoPtdGlc repels pain-sensing neuron fibers. After determining that LysoPtdGlc's ability to repel pain-sensing axons was controlled through a particular type of protein receptor on axons, the team tested over 100 receptors and found one--GPR55--that responded well to LysoPtdGlc. The team confirmed that this protein is also expressed in the spinal cord, and when they labeled axons in GPR55 knockout mice, they found pain-sensing axons had erroneously entered the upper-medial portion of the spinal cord--similar to when they had blocked LysoPtdGlc function by injecting the antibody into chick spinal cords. ""With these findings"" says Kamiguchi, ""we can begin to investigate whether this lipid-based signaling system can be a therapeutic target for spinal cord injury. I hope that our success here can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration aimed at tackling other problems in biomedical research."" RIKEN   press release Kamiguchi H et al.

For the first time since the disease was described 109 years ago, researchers affiliated with the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre (CRCHUM) have discovered accumulations of fat droplets in the brain of patients who died from the disease and have identified the nature of the fat. This breakthrough, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, opens up a new avenue in the search for a medication to cure or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""We found fatty acid deposits in the brain of patients who died from the disease and in mice that were genetically modified to develop Alzheimer's disease. Our experiments suggest that these abnormal fat deposits could be a trigger for the disease"", said Karl Fernandes, a researcher at the CRCHUM and a professor at University of Montreal. Over 47.5 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's disease or some other type of dementia, according to the World Health Organization. Despite decades of research, the only medications currently available treat the symptoms alone. This study highlights what might prove to be a missing link in the field. Researchers initially tried to understand why the brain's stem cells, which normally help repair brain damage, are unresponsive in Alzheimer's disease. Doctoral student Laura Hamilton was astonished to find fat droplets near the stem cells, on the inner surface of the brain in mice predisposed to develop the disease. ""We realized that Dr. Alois Alzheimer himself had noted the presence of lipid accumulations in patients' brains after their death when he first described the disease in 1906. But this observation was dismissed and largely forgotten due to the complexity of lipid biochemistry"", said Laura Hamilton. The researchers examined the brains of nine patients who died from Alzheimer's disease and found significantly more fat droplets compared with five healthy brains. A team of chemists from University of Montreal led by Pierre Chaurand then used an advanced mass spectrometry technique to identify these fat deposits as triglycerides enriched with specific fatty acids, which can also be found in animal fats and vegetable oils. ""We discovered that these fatty acids are produced by the brain, that they build up slowly with normal aging, but that the process is accelerated significantly in the presence of genes that predispose to Alzheimer's disease"", explained Karl Fernandes. In mice predisposed to the disease, we showed that these fatty acids accumulate very early on, at two months of age, which corresponds to the early twenties in humans. Therefore, we think that the build-up of fatty acids is not a consequence but rather a cause or accelerator of the disease."" Fortunately, there are pharmacological inhibitors of the enzyme that produces these fatty acids. These molecules, which are currently being tested for metabolic diseases such as obesity, could be effective in treating Alzheimer's disease. ""We succeeded in preventing these fatty acids from building up in the brains of mice predisposed to the disease. The impact of this treatment on all the aspects of the disease is not yet known, but it significantly increased stem cell activity,"" explained Karl Fernandes. ""This is very promising because stem cells play an important role in learning, memory and regeneration."" This discovery lends support to the argument that Alzheimer's disease is a metabolic brain disease, rather like obesity or diabetes are peripheral metabolic diseases. Karl Fernandes' team is continuing its experiments to verify whether this new approach can prevent or delay the problems with memory, learning and depression associated with the disease.

Function gives rise to structure, according to the textbooks. But scientists at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute have discovered that the textbooks might be wrong. Their results are published in Cell Reports. ""Retinal neurons associated with vision generate connections in the brain, and as the brain develops it strengthens and maintains some of those connections more than others. The disused connections are eliminated,"" said Michael Fox, an associate professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute who led the study. ""We found that this activity-dependent pruning might not be as simple as we'd like to believe."" Fox and his team of researchers used two different techniques to examine how retinal ganglion cells -- neurons that live in the retina and transmit visual information to the visual centers in the brain -- develop in a mouse model. ""It's widely accepted that synaptic connections from about 20 retinal ganglion cells converge onto cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus during development, but that number reduces to just one or two by the third week of a mouse's life,"" Fox said. ""It was thought that the mature retinal ganglion cells develop several synaptic terminals that cluster around information exchange points."" The theory of several terminals blossoming from the same retinal ganglion cell had not been proved, though, so Fox and his researchers decided to follow the terminals to their roots. Using a technique dubbed ""brainbow,"" the scientists tagged the terminals with proteins that fluoresce different colors. The researchers thought one color, representing the single source of the many terminals, would dominate in the clusters. Instead, several different colors appeared together, intertwined but distinct. ""The samples showed a true 'brainbow,'"" said Aboozar Monavarfeshani, a graduate student in Fox's laboratory who tagged the terminals. ""I could see, right in front of me, something very different than the concept I learned from my textbooks."" The results showed individual terminals from more than one retinal ganglion cell in a mature mouse brain. The study is a direct contradiction to some other research indicating neural development weeds out most connections between retinal ganglion axons and target cells in the brain, and Fox and his team have more questions. ""Is this a discrepancy a technical issue with the different types of approaches applied in all of these disparate studies?"" Fox asked. ""Possibly, but perhaps it's more likely that retinal ganglion cells are more complex than previously thought."" Along with the brainbow technique, Fox's team also imaged these synaptic connections with electron microscopy. Sarah Hammer, currently a sophomore at Virginia Tech, traced individual retinal terminals through hundreds of serial images. The data confirmed the results from ""brainbow"" analysis -- retinal axons from numerous retinal ganglion cells remained present on adult brain cells. ""These results are not what we expected, and they will force us to reevaluate our understanding of the architecture and flow of visual information through neural pathways,"" Fox said. ""The dichotomy of these results also sheds important light on the benefits of combining approaches to understand complicated problems in science."" Albert Pan, an assistant professor in the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Regents University, who is an expert in neural circuitry development, said the results are unexpected. ""The research provides strong evidence for multiple innervation and calls for a reevaluation of the current understanding of information flow and neural circuit maturation in the visual system"" said Pan, who was not involved in the study. ""The paper probably generates more questions than it answers, which is a hallmark of an exciting research study."" The research continues, as Fox's team works to understand exactly how many retinal terminals converge and how they might convey information differently. Once the scientists understand the intricacies of the brain's visual circuitry, they might be able to start developing therapeutics for when it goes wrong. ""The lesson in this particular study is that no single technique gives us all the right answers,"" Fox said. ""Science is never as simple as we like to make it seem.""

The neurodegenerative disorder affects over 100,000 Canadians and over 1,000,000 Americans. ""Like a motor constantly running at high speed, these neurons need to produce an incredible amount of energy to function. They appear to exhaust themselves and die prematurely,"" said lead researcher Louis- ric Trudeau, a professor at the university's Departments of Phamacology and Neurosciences. The research article, published today in Current Biology, includes contributions from Consiglia Pacelli, Nicolas Gigu re and Marie-Jos e Bourque, also of the University of Montreal, and Martin L vesque and Ruth Slack, of Laval and Ottawa universities, respectively. The findings are in some ways a culmination of Trudeau's 17 years of studying the part of the brain that causes Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug addiction. His findings could open the door to the creation of better animal models of Parkinson's disease and the identification of new treatment strategies. ""For some unknown reason, it has been incredibly difficult to reproduce the symptoms of Parkinson's in mice, even when introducing in the genome of these animals the same mutations found in humans afflicted by familial forms of the disease. Our discovery provides a new lead to potentially overcome such difficulties"" Trudeau explained. Improved animal models open a variety of new avenues of research. ""It's possible that new medications could be developed to help the neurons in question reduce their energy consumption or produce energy more efficiently, which would reduce accumulated damage over the years,"" Trudeau said. His team is already looking at the possible next steps with Professor Slack and her colleague Professor David Park. Unlike Alzheimer's, which has a wider-ranging impact on billions of brain neurons, the primary symptoms or Parkinson's are caused by the death of tens or hundreds of thousands of neurons in a few more restricted areas of the brain, including regions called the substantia nigra (literally ""the black substance""), the locus ceruleus and the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve. Key to the mystery may be mitochondria, the powerhouses that allow cells to grow and neurons to conduct electrical signals and release their chemical messengers such as dopamine, noradrenaline and acetylcholine. For the past three years, the research team carried out numerous experiments in order to identify why mitochondria in neurons of the substantia nigra work so hard and apparently lead neurons to ""overheat."" They discovered that this overheating could be caused by the fact that these neurons have an amazingly complex structure with a large number of extensions and neurotransmitter release sites, much like a tree with numerous branches. Providing energy to these numerous branches may make the neurons particularly vulnerable, leading, in the context of aging, to malfunction and cell death, thus triggering Parkinson's, with the onset of symptoms generally at around age sixty. ""Our work supports the theory that very complex neurons like those found in the substantia nigra force the mitochondria to constantly work at burnout rates to produce energy. This would explain the accelerated cell deterioration,"" Trudeau explained. ""To use the analogy of a motor, a car that overheats will burn significantly more fuel, and, not surprisingly, end up at the garage more often."" Professor Trudeau notes that the most common neurodegenerative diseases are particularly challenging for researchers, because in a way, their increasing prevalence is the result of increased life expectancy. ""From an evolutionary standpoint, some of our neurons are perhaps just not programmed to last 80, 90 or 100 years, as we are seeing more and more. It's to be expected that certain parts of our body are less able to withstand the effects of time,"" he said. However, given the more localized nature of Parkinson's disease (compared to other afflictions), an effective treatment may be discovered in the not-too-distant future. Nevertheless, Trudeau points out that his primary goal is to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of the brain in order to shed new light on neurological disorders.

Billed as a tool to help bring back the art of conversation for sufferers of severe paralysis and loss of speech, the prototype analyzes changes in breathing patterns and converts 'breath signals' into words using pattern recognition software and an analog-to-digital converter. A speech synthesizer then reads the words aloud. The Augmentative and Alternate Communication (AAC) device is designed for patients with complete or partial loss of voluntary muscle control who don't have the ability to make purposeful movements such as sniffing or blinking -- gestures which previous AAC devices have come to rely upon. Dr David Kerr, Senior Lecturer in the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, and Dr Kaddour Bouazza-Marouf, Reader in Mechatronics in Medicine, said the device learns from its user, building up its knowledge as it goes. It allows the user to control how he or she wishes to communicate -- effectively enabling them to create their own language by varying the speed of their breathing. The academics have been joined in the project by Dr Atul Gaur, Consultant Anesthetist at Glenfield Hospital. ""What we are proposing is a system that learns with the user to form an effective vocabulary that suits the person rather than the machine,"" said Dr Kerr. ""When it comes to teaching our invention to recognize words and phrases, we have so far recorded a 97.5 per cent success rate. Current AAC devices are slow and range from paper-based tools to expensive, sophisticated electronic devices. Our AAC device uses analog signals in continuous form, which should give us a greater speed advantage because more information can be collected in a shorter space of time."" Dr Gaur added: ""This device could transform the way people with severe muscular weakness or other speech disorders communicate. In an intensive care setting, the technology has the potential to be used to make an early diagnosis of locked-in syndrome (LIS), by allowing patients, including those on ventilators, to communicate effectively for the first time by breathing -- an almost effortless act which requires no speech, limb or facial movements."" The trio will be joined by Loughborough mechanical engineering student Robert Green, 20, who will work alongside them on the device as part of his final year individual project. Robert is no stranger to AAC devices, having already invented a prototype called the m(eye)DAQ -- a low cost digital letter board that allows victims of paralysis to communicate via eye blinks or finger movements.

The planned Phase I/Ib trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of bavituximab in combination with durvalumab in multiple solid tumours. AstraZeneca and Peregrine will collaborate on a non-exclusive basis, to evaluate the combination of bavituximab and durvalumab with chemotherapy as a potential treatment in various solid tumours. The Phase I part of the trial is expected to establish a recommended dose regimen for the combination and the Phase Ib part of the trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational combination. The initial trial will be conducted by Peregrine. Bavituximab and durvalumab are investigational immunotherapies with different mechanisms that assist the body's immune system in fighting cancer. Bavituximab targets and modulates the activity of phosphatidylserine, a highly immune-suppressive molecule expressed broadly on the surface of cells in the tumour microenvironment. The treatment increases activated T-cells in tumours and fights cancer by reversing the immunosuppressive environment that many tumours establish in order to proliferate. Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signals from PD-L1 help tumours avoid detection by the immune system. Preclinical data have demonstrated that by combining the enhanced T-cell mediated anti-tumour activity of bavituximab with checkpoint inhibitors like PD-L1 antibodies, the ability of tumour-specific T-cells to continue attacking the tumor is prolonged. Robert Iannone, Head of Immuno-Oncology, Global Medicines Development, at AstraZeneca said:  We believe that combination therapy in immuno-oncology has the potential to be a novel and highly effective approach to treating cancer. Our partnership with Peregrine provides the opportunity to explore an exciting, novel combination that could deliver important clinical benefit to patients across a range of cancers.  Steven W.

He also played a key role in the passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in 2008, which has helped to ensure that the insights from his extraordinary achievements and those of many others are not used for discriminatory purposes. President Obama nominated him as NIH director in 2009, proclaiming that his work had already  changed the very ways we consider our health and examine disease.  As NIH director, Collins  relentless advocacy helped shape President Obama s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), which was announced earlier this year as part of the President s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016. Collins remains one of the field s most passionate champions.  I see a day in the not too distant future when every person will have his or her genome sequenced and other important data collected as a routine part of medical care with individualized strategies developed for diagnosing, treating and preventing their disease,  said Dr. Collins.  I know that the PMC shares this vision and I am truly honored to receive this award from an organization that continues to pursue the vision with such great passion.  Collins will accept the award and deliver remarks at 10:30 a.m. on the second day of the conference, which will take place from Nov. 18 - 19 at the Harvard School of Medicine.

The findings, published in the journal European Child Adolescent Psychiatry, suggest that aspects of ADHD may persist into adulthood, even when current diagnostic criteria fail to identify the disorder. ADHD is a disorder characterized by short attention span, restlessness and impulsivity, and is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. Estimates suggest that more than three in every 100 boys and just under one in every 100 girls has ADHD. Less is known about the extent to which the disorder persists into adulthood, with estimates suggesting that between 10-50% of children still have ADHD in adulthood. Diagnosis in adulthood is currently reliant on meeting symptom checklists (such as the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual). Some have speculated that as the brain develops in adulthood, children may grow out of ADHD, but until now there has been little rigorous evidence to support this. So far, most of the research that has followed up children and adolescents with ADHD into adulthood has focused on interview-based assessments, leaving questions of brain structure and function unanswered. Now, researchers at Cambridge and Oulu have followed up 49 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD at age 16, to examine their brain structure and memory function in young adulthood, aged between 20-24 years old, compared to a control group of 34 young adults. The research was based within the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986, which has followed up thousands of children born in 1986 from gestation and birth into adulthood. The results showed that the group diagnosed in adolescence still had problems in terms of reduced brain volume and poorer memory function, irrespective of whether or not they still met diagnostic checklist criteria for ADHD. By analyzing the structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans and comparing them to the controls, the researchers found that the adolescents with ADHD had reduced grey matter in a region deep within the brain known as the caudate nucleus, a key brain region that integrates information across different parts of the brain, and supports important cognitive functions, including memory. To investigate whether or not these grey matter deficits were of any importance, the researchers conducted a functional MRI experiment (fMRI), which measured brain activity whilst 21 of the individuals previously diagnosed with ADHD and 23 of the controls undertook a test of working memory inside the scanner. One third of the adolescents with ADHD failed the memory test compared to less than one in twenty of the control group (an accuracy of less than 75% was classed as a fail). Even amongst the adolescent ADHD sample who passed the memory test, the scores were on average 6 percentage points less than controls. The poor memory scores seemed to relate to a lack of responsiveness in the activity of the caudate nucleus: in the controls, when the memory questions became more difficult, the caudate nucleus became more active, and this appeared to help the control group perform well; in the adolescent ADHD group, the caudate nucleus kept the same level of activity throughout the test. There were no differences in brain structure or memory test scores between those young adults previously diagnosed with ADHD who still met the diagnostic criteria and those who no longer met them. Dr Graham Murray from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, who led the study, says: ""In the controls, when the test got harder, the caudate nucleus went up a gear in its activity, and this is likely to have helped solve the memory problems. But in the group with adolescent ADHD, this region of the brain is smaller and doesn't seem to be able to respond to increasing memory demands, with the result that memory performance suffers. ""We know that good memory function supports a variety of other mental processes, and memory problems can certainly hold people back in terms of success in education and the workplace. The next step in our research will be to examine whether these differences in brain structure and memory function are linked to difficulties in everyday life, and, crucially, see if they respond to treatment."" The fact that the study was set in Finland, where medication is rarely used to treat ADHD, meant that only one of the 49 ADHD adolescents had been treated with medication. This meant the researchers could confidently rule out medication as a confounding factor. To date, 'recovery' in ADHD has focused on whether people do or do not continue to meet symptom checklist criteria for diagnosis. However, this research indicates that objective measures of brain structure and function may continue to be abnormal even if diagnostic criteria are no longer met. The results therefore emphasize the importance of taking a wider perspective on ADHD outcomes than simply whether or not a particular patient meets diagnostic criteria at any given point in time.

But in modern armies, every soldier is connected via an audio link that can instantly receive broadcasts -- reporting both positive and negative surprises -- based on new intelligence. The real-time broadcasts enable dispersed troops to learn from these reports and can be critical since no solider has an overview of the entire unit's situation. Similarly, as neuroscientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) have just discovered, there are a set of dedicated neurons in the basal forebrain that broadcast a message throughout the cerebral cortex, rapidly informing multiple distributed subregions of any surprising rewards or punishments -- what scientists call reinforcers. The neurons in question are cholinergic, and the team, led by Associate Professor Adam Kepecs, has succeeded in recording their activity for the first time in behaving animals (mice). Cholinergic neurons form one of the brain's several neuromodulatory systems -- they send signals in the form of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to broad swaths of the brain. Although they have been thought to play an important role in arousal, attention and learning, their precise role in behavior has remained mysterious -- in part, because of the technical difficulty in recording from them in vivo. Degeneration and loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, age-related cognitive decline, and other cognitive disorders and dementias. In a paper published in Cell, Kepecs and colleagues report on how central cholinergic neurons function, using optogenetic neuron identification --a technique in which mouse neurons are genetically engineered to respond to light. ""These are very, very, difficult-to-find neurons, and they form an incredibly important system in the brain,"" Kepecs says. ""Until recently we didn't have the techniques to approach this system with the precision required."" Once they identified cholinergic neurons, the team recorded their activity while mice performed a sound detection task requiring sustained attention. Depending on whether their response was correct or not, mice were either rewarded with drop of water or ""punished"" with a mild puff of air to their face. Postdoctoral fellow Balazs Hangya of the Kepecs lab discovered that these neurons respond to reward and punishment, with unusual speed and precision, taking only a few thousandths-of-a-second. To explain the responses researchers constructed a computational model which revealed that the modulation of the signal strength was proportional to how unexpected or surprising the mice found the reward or punishment. According to the model, if the mice were certain their response was correct, the reward generated a weak signal. But if they were unsure, the reward came as more of a surprise and generated a stronger cholinergic signal. ""This suggests to us that it's not really about punishment, per se, but it's simply that punishment usually is more surprising,"" Kepecs says. Kepecs suggests that cholinergic broadcasts to the cortex would be useful in boosting plasticity, allowing flexibility in neuronal connections that makes learning possible. Whether the surprise registers an outcome or event that was better or worse than expected, the fact it was unexpected, and the degree to which it was, is an obvious advantage to the individual -- as, indeed, constant intelligence is to soldiers in the unit enmeshed in jungle combat.

Researchers at the Ruhr-University Bochum and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University M nchen discovered this phenomenon during a scientifically monitored meditation retreat. The journal Scientific Reports has now published their new findings on the plasticity of the brain. The participants were all Zen-scholars with many years of meditation practice. They were scientifically escorted during a four-day Zen-retreat in the spiritual center  Benediktushof , Germany. The retreat was held in complete silence, with at least eight hours of meditation per day. All participants practiced their familiar meditation, which is characterized by a non-specific monitoring of thoughts and surroundings. Additionally, some participants applied a special finger-meditation for two hours per day, during which they were asked to specifically focus on their right index finger and become aware of spontaneously arising sensory percepts in this finger. Subsequent assessment of the group that practiced finger-meditation showed a significant improvement in the tactile acuity of the right index and middle finger. A control group that had maintained their familiar meditation practice for the whole time, showed no changes in tactile acuity. In order to assess the sense of touch quantitatively, researchers measured the so-called  two-point discrimination threshold . This marker indicates how far apart two stimuli need to be, in order to be discriminated as two separate sensations. After the finger meditation, the performance improved on average by 17 percent. By comparison, tactile acuity of the visually impaired is 15 to 25 percent above that of typical sighted individuals, because their sense of touch is used so intensively to make up for the reduced visual information. Hence, the changes induced by meditation are comparable to those achieved by intense long-term training. It is known for long that extensive training induces neuroplasticity, which denotes the ability of the brain to adapt and restructure itself, thereby improving perception and behavior.  Recently, the group of neuroscientists of the Neural Plasticity Lab headed by Hubert Dinse has shown that these processes can be initiated even without training by mere exposure to passive stimulation, which was translated only recently into a stimulating glove, which is used as therapeutical intervention in stroke patients. The fact that merely mental states without any physical stimulation can improve perception has now been shown for the first time.  The results of our study challenge what we know about learning mechanisms in the brain. Our concept of neuroplasticity must be extended, because mental activity seems to induce learning effects similar to active stimulation and physical training,  Dinse suggests.

This link may offer a way to identify causes and develop treatments of the disease and lead to new diagnostic tests.  The oropharynx of schizophrenics seems to harbor different proportions of oral bacteria than healthy individuals,  said Eduardo Castro-Nallar, a Ph.D. candidate at GW s Computational Biology Institute (CBI) and lead author of the study.  Specifically, our analyses revealed an association between microbes such as lactic-acid bacteria and schizophrenics.  Recent studies have shown that microbiomes the communities of microbes living within our bodies can affect the immune system and may be connected to mental health. Research linking immune disorders and schizophrenia has also been published, and this study furthers the possibility that shifts in oral communities are associated with schizophrenia.  Mr. Castro-Nallar s research sought to identify microbes associated with schizophrenia, as well as components that may be associated with or contribute to changes in the immune state of the person. In this study, the group found a significant difference in the microbiomes of healthy and schizophrenic patients.   Our results suggesting a link between microbiome diversity and schizophrenia require replication and expansion to a broader number of individuals for further validation,  said Keith Crandall, director of the CBI and contributing author of the study.  But the results are quite intriguing and suggest potential applications of biomarkers for diagnosis of schizophrenia and important metabolic pathways associated with the disease.  The study helps to identify possible contributing factors to schizophrenia.

Noroviruses are the predominant cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in community settings such as hospitals, cruise ships, and schools. The virus is extremely contagious and is mostly transmitted via ""fecal-oral-route"", i.e., through contaminated hands or contaminated food. Symptoms include violent and sudden onset of diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. ""It is therefore important to provide a safe and harmless disinfectant against human norovirus,"" explains Grant Hansman, head of CHS junior research group at the German Cancer Research Center noroviruses and the University of Heidelberg. The group is funded by the CHS Foundation. Some older observations found that fruit extracts, such as orange or pomegranate juice, could reduce the infectivity of surrogate noroviruses. This current study was a continuation of an earlier project conducted at the National Institutes of Health in the United States, where they discovered that citrate from a commercial company could bind to the norovirus capsid protein. ""However, it was only by chance that this discovery was made, like a lot of scientific research, but it turns out to be very interesting."" Dr Hansman explains. Human noroviruses does not grow in cell culture, so they tested the effects of increasing concentrations of citric buffer on the so called norovirus virus-like particles, which have the same surface characteristics as real viruses. Dr Hansman and his staff show that the virus particles change their shape after citrate binding. X-ray crystal structures revealed that the citrate - from lemon juice or citrate disinfectants - precisely interacts at the binding pocket on the particle that is involved in attaching to host ligands   the so-called histo-blood group antigens. These new results may explain why citrate reduces the infectivity of noroviruses. ""Maybe a few drops of lemon juice on contaminated food or surfaces may prevent the transmission of these viruses,"" speculates Hansman. With his staff, he now plans to investigate if citric acid could reduce symptoms in those already infected with noroviruses.","Published: August 27, 2015"

That emerges from a doctoral research Momen Abayazid of UT's MIRA research institute of the University of Twente.   In many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, a needle is inserted into soft tissue.Think for example of biopsies, or the insertion of radioactive seeds in order to combat prostate cancer. In many of these operations, the accuracy of the placement of the needle is very important. As a rule, using rigid needle having a relatively large diameter.Disadvantage is that it can only go straight, so you can avoid any obstacles along. Also, the tissue can deform during insertion of the needle, allowing the needle to aim fog.  Flexible needle with asymmetrical point The University of Twente has a computer-controlled system designed for flexible needles with an asymmetric point that can be sent in the body in curves. Such a needle bends automatically when you insert it. By turning the needle, you are now able to bring this as a chosen path in three dimensions. Because the needle is controlled by a robot, and during the insertion in real-time is monitored - which makes it possible to gradually make adjustments in the route - it is possible to control the needle accurately at submillimeter level in biological tissue. In his dissertation developed Momen Abayazid doctoral research involved the developed robotic system and the control system that controls the needle and the needle 3D localization algorithm, which uses ultrasound images.  Human factor To promote acceptance in clinical practice and to combine the precision of the robotic system with clinical expertise, Abayazid also developed a system that gives the doctor more control. In this variant, the doctor inserts the needle into himself, but he gets hereby control signals from the robot system using vibrations and visual feedback. The system allows, in principle, in the future, also possible that the needle is controlled by a doctor who is located somewhere other than the patient completely. The researchers are managed, for example to drive the needle in Enschede from the Italian Sienna.   Finally, the developed system has been integrated with a, based on ultrasound, breast-volume automatic scanner (ABVS). By combining the proposed system with a robotic, clinically approved, ABVS system, it is possible to bring robotic needle control from the research laboratory to the operating room.  Clinical studies in humans According promotor prof. Dr. Sarthak Misra shows the examination of Abayazid that the system is technically ready for use in humans. Misra expects three to four years, the first clinical trials could start.","Published: August 27, 2015"

Searching for DNA sequences in existing genomic databases can already take hours, and the problem is likely to get worse. Recently, Bonnie Berger s group at MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has been investigating techniques to make biological and chemical data easier to analyze by, in some sense, compressing it. In the latest issue of the journal Cell Systems, Berger and colleagues present a theoretical analysis that demonstrates why their previous compression schemes have been so successful. They identify properties of data sets that make them amenable to compression and present an algorithm for determining whether a given data set has those properties. They also show that several existing databases of chemical compounds and biological molecules do indeed exhibit them. Given measurements for those properties, the researchers can also calculate the improvements in search efficiency that their compression techniques afford. For the data sets they analyze, those efficiencies scale sublinearly, meaning that the larger the data set, the more efficient the search should be.  This paper provides a framework for how we can apply compressive algorithms to large-scale biological data,  says Berger, a professor of applied mathematics at MIT.  We also have proofs for how much efficiency we can get.  The key to the researchers  compression scheme is that evolution is stingy with good designs. There tends to be a lot of redundancy in the genomes of closely related - or even distantly related - organisms. That means that of all the possible sequences of the four DNA letters - A, T, C, and G - only a very small subset is represented by the genomes of real organisms. Moreover, within the space of possible genomes, those of real organisms are not distributed randomly. Instead, they trace out continuous patterns, which represent the relatively slow rate at which species diverge. Birds of a featherTo make searching more efficient, the Berger group s compression algorithms cluster together similar genomic sequences - those that diverge by only a few DNA letters - then choose one sequence as representative of the cluster. A search can concentrate only on the likeliest clusters; most of the data never has to be examined. If genomic data is envisioned as tracing a continuous path through a much larger space of possibilities, then the clusters can be envisioned as spheres superimposed on the data. Data points that fall within a single sphere are closely related. Berger and her colleagues - first authors Noah Daniels, a postdoc in her group, and William Yu, a graduate student in applied mathematics, and David Danko, an undergraduate major in computational biology - show that data sets are amenable to their compressive search techniques if they meet two criteria. The first they refer to as metric entropy. This means that the data inhabits only a small part of the larger space of possibilities. The second is low fractal dimension. That means that the density of the data points doesn t vary greatly as users move through the data. If their search requires them to explore three spheres rather than one, it takes only three times as long - not 10 times, or 100 times. In their paper, the MIT researchers analyze three data sets. Two describe proteins - one according to their sequences of amino acids, the other according to their shape - and the third describes organic molecules. In a separate paper, now under submission, the researchers apply the same types of analysis to DNA segments between 32 and 63 letters in length. Time s arrowThe efficiency of their search algorithm scales sublinearly, not with the number of data points, but with the metric entropy of the data set, which is a formal measure of the continuity of the data and their sparseness, relative to the space of possibilities. Because evolution is conservative, the metric entropy of genomic data should increase as new genomes are sequenced. That is, the addition of new genomes will not, in all likelihood, add new branches to the pattern traced out in the space of possibilities; rather, it will fill in gaps in the existing pattern, increasing the metric entropy. Many other large data sets, however, could prove to be conservative in the same way. The range of behaviors exhibited by Web users, for instance, may, relative to the entire space of possibilities, be constrained by biology, by cultural history, or both. The MIT researchers  compression techniques could thus be applicable to a wide range of data outside biology.","Published: August 27, 2015"

These proof-of-concept synthetic microfish will inspire a new generation of  smart  microrobots that have diverse capabilities such as detoxification, sensing and directed drug delivery, researchers said.The technique used to fabricate the microfish provides numerous improvements over other methods traditionally employed to create microrobots with various locomotion mechanisms, such as microjet engines, microdrillers and microrockets. Most of these microrobots are incapable of performing more sophisticated tasks because they feature simple designs   such as spherical or cylindrical structures   and are made of homogeneous inorganic materials. In this new study, researchers demonstrated a simple way to create more complex microrobots. The research, led by Professors Shaochen Chen and Joseph Wang of the NanoEngineering Department at the UC San Diego. By combining Chen s 3D printing technology with Wang s expertise in microrobots, the team was able to custom-build microfish that can do more than simply swim around when placed in a solution containing hydrogen peroxide. Nanoengineers were able to easily add functional nanoparticles into certain parts of the microfish bodies. They installed platinum nanoparticles in the tails, which react with hydrogen peroxide to propel the microfish forward, and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the heads, which allowed them to be steered with magnets. We have developed an entirely new method to engineer nature-inspired microscopic swimmers that have complex geometric structures and are smaller than the width of a human hair. With this method, we can easily integrate different functions inside these tiny robotic swimmers for a broad spectrum of applications,  said the co-first author Wei Zhu, a nanoengineering Ph.D. student in Chen s research group at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the researchers incorporated toxin-neutralizing nanoparticles throughout the bodies of the microfish. Specifically, the researchers mixed in polydiacetylene (PDA) nanoparticles, which capture harmful pore-forming toxins such as the ones found in bee venom. The researchers noted that the powerful swimming of the microfish in solution greatly enhanced their ability to clean up toxins. When the PDA nanoparticles bind with toxin molecules, they become fluorescent and emit red-colored light. The team was able to monitor the detoxification ability of the microfish by the intensity of their red glow.  The neat thing about this experiment is that it shows how the microfish can doubly serve as detoxification systems and as toxin sensors,  said Zhu.  Another exciting possibility we could explore is to encapsulate medicines inside the microfish and use them for directed drug delivery,  said Jinxing Li, the other co-first author of the study and a nanoengineering Ph.D. student in Wang s research group. How this new 3D printing technology works The new microfish fabrication method is based on a rapid, high-resolution 3D printing technology called microscale continuous optical printing ( COP), which was developed in Chen s lab. Some of the benefits of the  COP technology are speed, scalability, precision and flexibility. Within seconds, the researchers can print an array containing hundreds of microfish, each measuring 120 microns long and 30 microns thick. This process also does not require the use of harsh chemicals. Because the  COP technology is digitized, the researchers could easily experiment with different designs for their microfish, including shark and manta ray shapes. With our 3D printing technology, we are not limited to just fish shapes. We can rapidly build microrobots inspired by other biological organisms such as birds,  said Zhu. The key component of the  COP technology is a digital micromirror array device (DMD) chip, which contains approximately two million micromirrors. Each micromirror is individually controlled to project UV light in the desired pattern (in this case, a fish shape) onto a photosensitive material, which solidifies upon exposure to UV light. The microfish are built using a photosensitive material and are constructed one layer at a time, allowing each set of functional nanoparticles to be  printed  into specific parts of the fish bodies.

Before this technique, you could only look at the very superficial surface, so you really couldn t examine the entire kidney,  said Safirstein. To their surprise, the researchers uncovered evidence that the kidneys failed and developed damaged tubules (key structures that the kidney uses to transport fluids) before damage was detectable through more traditional methods. The findings could shift the direction of kidney research.  It changes the focus of research in kidney disease to find out how lesions form,  Safirstein noted. The imaging technique could also inform the study of diabetes and other conditions.  We think this is going to be applicable in a wide variety of diseases,  he noted.","Published: August 27, 2015"

One of these proteins, known as GDF11, has attracted great interest since 2013, when researchers showed that it could rejuvenate old mice. Based on these findings, scientists have speculated that drugs that increase GDF11 levels might reverse physiological manifestations of aging that lead to heart failure in people. The new study is part of an ongoing research effort by the UCSF-led team to use new technologies to identify and measure a suite of proteins in blood that may be associated with poor health outcomes, and that could serve as a gauge to estimate a person s risk of developing various cardiovascular problems, as well as their risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases. The study population included 1,899 men and women with heart disease, from separate study groups in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Norway, who ranged in age from 40 to 85 (average 69 years). Because they already had been diagnosed with stable ischemic heart disease, in which blood supply to the heart is reduced due to coronary artery disease, the participants were at elevated risk for stroke, heart attack, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Hundreds of the participants experienced one or more of these outcomes during the course of the study, in which they were monitored for nearly nine years. The UCSF research team, led by Peter Ganz, MD, professor of medicine and chief of cardiology at UCSF partner hospital San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, used a lab test to measure combined blood levels of GDF11 and a very similar protein called myostatin the test could not distinguish between the two, because they are quite similar both structurally and functionally. The scientists determined that research subjects who had relatively high blood levels of these two proteins at the beginning of the study   in the top 25 percent of all participants   were less than half as likely to die from any cause, in comparison to participants whose blood levels ranked them in the bottom 25 percent. Those in the highest 25 percent also experienced fewer adverse health events associated with heart disease.  Individuals with heart disease who have relatively high concentrations of these proteins have much lower odds of dying and much lower odds of experiencing devastating outcomes that we associate with aging, including heart attacks, strokes and heart failure,  Ganz said.  We also found that combined levels of GDF11 and myostatin in humans decline with advancing age, but that the rate of this decline varies among individuals.  In mouse studies published in 2013 in Cell and in 2014 in Science, a research team at Harvard Medical School led by Richard Lee, MD, and Amy Wagers, PhD, reported that old mice had less GDF11 circulating in their blood than younger mice. They also found that four weeks of GDF11 treatment in old mice that restored the youthful level of this protein reversed potentially harmful thickening of heart muscle. In humans this thickening of heart muscle, known as ventricular hypertrophy, is associated with aging and contributes to heart failure and death. In the new study, the UCSF researchers used standard clinical imaging tests to measure ventricular hypertrophy and found that participants with lower levels of the GDF11 and myostatin proteins were more prone to having thickened heart muscle.  This association with less ventricular hypertrophy and death suggests the possibility that GDF11 might act similarly in humans as in mice. Restoring GDF11 or myostatin to their higher, youthful levels might potentially serve as a so-called  fountain-of-youth  treatment, but far more work remains to be done,  Ganz said. The fewer heart-disease-related deaths among subjects with higher levels of GDF11 and myostatin did not entirely account for the magnitude of the fewer deaths from all causes in this group. It is possible that GDF11 and myostatin also prevent death from causes unrelated to heart disease, Ganz said. In addition to trying to find ways to boost the levels of GDF11 or myostatin proteins, Ganz and colleagues suggest another approach that could improve health outcomes: blocking the action of a circulating protein, called FSTL3, which inhibits the function of myostatin and GDF11. At an American College of Cardiology meeting in March, 2015, Ganz s lab team reported preliminary evidence that high FSTL3 levels are associated with worse health outcomes in heart disease patients. If the potential health benefits of higher levels of GDF11 and myostatin appear to outweigh risks, at least in heart disease patients, Ganz said,  it may be easier to get rid of the inhibitors of GDF11 and myostatin rather than to replace low levels of the proteins.

The research was conducted together with Sean Myles, a population geneticist at Dalhousie University. Researchers looked at the genotypes of 81 marijuana and 43 hemp samples. Using the DNA variants in the cannabis genome, they were able to search for relationships between different plants. They found that cannabis plants, which consist of three species (C. sativa, C. indicaand C. ruderalis), are often incorrectly labeled.Popular lore assigns different characteristics to marijuana plants. For example, Indica-type plants are believed to produce relaxing and sedative effects as opposed to more stimulating Sativa-type plants. The researchers found only a moderate correlation between the ancestry of marijuana strains reported by breeders and the ancestry inferred from their DNA. For example, a sample of Jamaican Lambs Bread, which is classified as C. sativa, was almost identical at a genetic level to a C. indica strain from Afghanistan.  Cannabis breeders and growers often indicate the percentage of Sativa or Indica in a cannabis strain, but they are not very accurate,  Page explained. While hemp plants also go by the latin name C. sativa, researchers discovered that hemp showed a high amount of genetic separation from marijuana, likely due to the breeding of the plants for radically different uses. Canada is a global leader in hemp production, with more than 80,000 acres devoted to seed and fibre production. A licence from Health Canada is required to grow marijuana for medical purposes, and there are now 25 licensed producers supplying about 21,000 Canadian patients. Understanding cannabis genetics and evolution could assist in better breeding efforts for both crops.  The genetic difference between marijuana and hemp has legal implications in many countries,  said Page.  Right now, the genetic identity of a marijuana strain cannot be accurately determined by its name or reported ancestry. Ultimately we require a practical, accurate and more reliable classification system of this plant.  Page founded a biotech startup, Anandia Labs, based at UBC, to use genomics for testing and breeding efforts in regulated cannabis production.","Published: August 27, 2015"

The composition of this bacterial population is very variable and influenced by our diet. Diseases, but also antibiotic treatments can induce significant shifts in this equilibrium. If entire bacterial groups suddenly multiply heavily, critical situations occur. They damage the intestinal tissue and cause inflammations. How such shifts are triggered largely remained a mystery.  A carbohydrate causes E. coli to multiply In their normal state, E. coli are harmless and only make up around 0.1 percent of the intestinal flora. If present in large amounts, however, they can cause diarrhea or a serious intestinal inflammation. The Zurich study reveals that an overproduction of E. coli can be attributed to the availability of the carbohydrate sialic acid, which is found in large amounts in the proteins of the intestinal mucosa. To actually be able to utilize the sialic acid, the bacteria enlist the aid of the enzyme sialidase, which is released by other intestinal bacteria. ""It's striking that E. coli doesn't produce this kind of enzyme itself,"" explains Thierry Hennet, a professor from the Institute of Physiology at the University of Zurich. Hennet and his colleagues succeeded in demonstrating the complex chain of events involved in a severe inflammation triggered by E. coli: An injury to the intestinal mucosa initially causes the increased multiplication of a non-pathogenic bacteria, which emits sialidase. This increased enzyme production releases sialic acid, which facilitates an overproduction of E. coliand can thus cause intestinal inflammation. Sialidase inhibitors combat intestinal inflammations The researchers also discovered that the intake of a sialidase inhibitor prevents the excessive formation of E. coli and was thus able to alleviate the disease symptoms. Interestingly, such sialidase inhibitors were already developed against the influenza virus. ""Derivatives of known flu agents such as Tamiflu and Relenza could therefore also be used for inflammatory intestinal diseases, which opens up new therapeutic possibilities,"" says Hennet.","Published: August 27, 2015"

While the genetic profiling of cancer is not yet routine, such testing typically is performed only at the time of diagnosis to try to pinpoint how aggressive a tumor is and whether it will respond to a particular treatment. The new findings suggest a different approach, one that focuses less on the specific set of mutations present in a patient s tumor at the time of diagnosis and more on whether those mutations are cleared by initial treatment with chemotherapy.  Most patients diagnosed with AML fall into a gray area when it comes to being able to predict their risk of relapse,  said senior author Timothy J. Ley, MD, the Lewis T. and Rosalind B. Apple Professor of Oncology in the Department of Medicine.  About 80 percent of AML patients go into remission with chemotherapy, but most of them eventually will relapse. Unfortunately, we still don t have a definitive test that tells us early on which patients will relapse.  Such information is important to know because high-risk patients need aggressive, potentially curative therapy with a stem-cell transplant when they are in remission, early in the course of the disease. However, we don t want to transplant patients who are unlikely to relapse following conventional chemotherapy because the transplant procedure is expensive and carries a significant risk of severe side effects and even death.  AML is a cancer of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. An estimated 19,000 cases of AML will be diagnosed in the United States this year, and some 14,000 will die of the disease. The current study was retrospective, meaning that the researchers looked at bone marrow samples from patients whose outcomes were already known. The investigators studied leukemic bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis from 71 AML patients treated at the Siteman Cancer Center atBarnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University.  Genome sequencing and analysis were performed at the university s McDonnell Genome Institute. The sequencing team was led by institute director Richard K. Wilson, PhD, and co-director Elaine R. Mardis, PhD. The analysis team was led by Christopher A. Miller, PhD, Malachi Griffith, PhD, and Allegra Petti, PhD.  The researchers first sequenced the 71 bone marrow samples obtained at the time of diagnosis to see if specific leukemia-related mutations found in each patient s AML cells correlated with relapse after initial treatment with chemotherapy. But they found that such mutations were no more informative than standard methods for assessing risk of relapse. The researchers then conducted genome sequencing on bone marrow samples that had been obtained from 50 patients at the time of diagnosis and again 30 days after the initiation of chemotherapy, when they were in remission. Analyzing these samples, the researchers found that 24 patients had persistent mutations in bone marrow cells after chemotherapy, even though by standard clinical measures they were in remission. This suggested that at least some leukemia cells had survived the initial therapy. In several cases, these same cells were shown to expand and contribute to relapse. Those with persistent mutations had a median survival of only 10.5 months, compared with 42 months for the 26 patients whose leukemia mutations had been cleared by initial chemotherapy.  If our results are confirmed in larger, prospective studies, genetic profiling after initial chemotherapy could help oncologists predict prognosis early in the course of a patient s leukemia and determine whether that patient has responded to the chemotherapy   without having to wait for the cancer to recur,  said first author Jeffery M. Klco, MD, PhD, now at St. Jude Children s Research Hospital.  This approach to genetic profiling, which focuses on performing genome sequencing after a patient s initial treatment, also may be useful for other cancers.  In an accompanying editorial, Friederike Pastore, MD, and Ross Levine, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, write:  Although many important questions remain, the findings reported by Klco and colleagues provide critical insights into the role of molecular monitoring in AML and into the dynamics of genetic mutations during AML treatment.  Pastore and Levine call for next steps to include the development of assays to detect residual disease after AML treatment, and the formulation of therapeutic regimens to target such residual disease, with the goal of improving outcomes for patients with AML. Ley added:  These findings build on studies performed more than a decade ago that suggested the failure to clear leukemia cells bearing chromosomal abnormalities was associated with increased risk of relapse. But that technology was applicable only for the subset of patients with abnormal chromosomes, while genome sequencing can detect mutations in virtually all patients and is much more sensitive and specific. This new approach gives us a way to think about how to use genomics to evaluate the risk of relapse for nearly all AML patients. ","Published: August 27, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/researchers-discover-synthesis-of-a-new-nanomaterial-207387,Researchers Discover Synthesis of a New Nanomaterial Interdisciplinary team creates biocomposite for first time using physiological conditions   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Faculty at Louisiana Tech University have discovered, for the first time, a new nanocomposite formed by the self-assembly of copper and a biological component that occurs under physiological conditions, which are similar to those found in the human body and could be used in targeted drug delivery for fighting diseases such as cancer. The team, led by Dr. Mark DeCoster, the James E. Wyche III Endowed Associate Professor in Biomedical Engineering at Louisiana Tech, has also discovered a way for this synthesis to be carried out in liquid form. This would allow for controlling the scale of the synthesis up or down, and to grow structures with larger features, so they can be observed. We are currently investigating how this new material interacts with cells,  said DeCoster.  It may be used, for example for drug delivery, which could be used in theory for fighting diseases such as cancer. Also, as a result of the copper component that we used, there could be some interesting electronics, energy, or optics applications that could impact consumer products. In addition, copper has some interesting and useful antimicrobial features.  Finally, as the recent environmental spill of mining waste into river systems showed us, metals, including copper, can sometimes make their way into freshwater systems, so our newly discovered metal-composite methods could provide a way to  bind up  unwanted copper into a useful or more stable form.  DeCoster said there were two aspects of this discovery that surprised him and his research team. First, they found that once formed, these copper nanocomposites were incredibly stable both in liquid or dried form, and remained stable for years.  We have been carrying out this research for at least four years and have a number of samples that are at least two years old and still stable,  DeCoster said. Second, DeCoster s group was very surprised that these composites are resistant to agglomeration, which is the process by which material clumps or sticks together.  This is of benefit because it allows us to work with individual structures in order to separate or modify them chemically,  explains DeCoster.  When materials stick together and clump, as many do, it is much harder to work with them in a logical way. Both of these aspects, however, fit with our hypothesis that the self-assembly that we have discovered is putting positively charged copper together with negatively charged sulfur-containing cystine.  The research discovery was a team effort that included DeCoster and Louisiana Tech students at the bachelor, master and doctoral level.  The quality of my team in putting together a sustained effort to figure out what was needed to reproducibly carry out the new self-assembly methods and to simplify them really speaks well as to what can be accomplished at Louisiana Tech University,  DeCoster said.  Furthermore, the work is very multi-disciplinary, meaning that it required nanotechnology as well as biological and biochemical insights to make it all work, as well as some essential core instrumentation that we have at Louisiana Tech.  DeCoster says the future of this research has some potentially high impacts. He and his team are speaking with colleagues and collaborators about how to test these new nanocomposites for applications in bioengineering and larger composites such as materials that would be large enough to be hand-held.  Our recent publication of the work could generate some interest and new ideas,  said DeCoster.  We are working on new proposals to fund the research and to keep it moving forward. We are currently making these materials on an  as needed  basis, knowing that they can be stored once generated, and if we discover new uses for the nanocomposites, then applications for the materials could lead to income generation through a start-up company that I have formed.

Better understanding of how adults develop RSV infection and immune system responses to infection will assist researchers in developing and testing future antivirals and vaccines to combat the virus. The research is being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections - including pneumonia and bronchiolitis mdash; among young children worldwide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States each year, RSV leads to an average of about 55,000 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years, with most of these hospitalizations involving infants younger than 6 months. Healthy adults infected with RSV tend to develop cold-like symptoms and recover without any problems, but the infection can cause severe disease in premature infants, children younger than two years with heart or lung problems, children and adults with weakened immune systems, and the elderly. RSV infection causes roughly 14,000 deaths annually among U.S. adults older than 65 years.  Challenge studies such as this are a unique way of enabling scientists to monitor, in a controlled setting, the natural history of a disease in exquisite detail, using the most powerful tools of molecular biology,  said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.  By studying RSV infection in healthy adults, we hope to improve understanding of how this infection develops and determine the suitability of this particular strain of the virus for use in future RSV vaccine and treatment trials.  The NIAID pilot study, led by Lesia K. Dropulic, M.D., of NIAID s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, will enroll up to 60 healthy men and non-pregnant women ages 18-50 years. Study participants will receive a drop of liquid containing RSV in each nostril and will remain hospitalized in isolation at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately one to two weeks. This is being done both to allow for monitoring of the study volunteers and because RSV is highly contagious. While at the Clinical Center, medical staff will monitor study participants daily for signs and symptoms of RSV infection and conduct blood draws and sample nasal secretions to intensively study the development of infection. Participants will also have tests to measure how much air they can move in and out of their lungs. Investigators will use a laboratory-developed strain of RSV commonly used in research called RSV A2. The strain is the first molecularly cloned challenge virus, meaning the RSV A2 study virus originates from a single clone of the virus strain and has been tested to ensure it is not contaminated with other infection-causing pathogens. Once infected with RSV A2, study participants are likely to develop cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, cough, ear pain, fever, headache, sinus congestion and sore throat. However, because virtually all adults have been infected with RSV during childhood, some study participants may remain completely well. Any volunteers who do become unexpectedly, seriously ill would be medically treated at the Clinical Center and provided with the standard of care.  We do not anticipate that the healthy, carefully screened adult volunteers in this study will become severely sick from the RSV challenge virus because, in general, healthy adults are repeatedly exposed to RSV in their lives and either remain asymptomatic or develop a mild to moderate cold,  said Dr. Dropulic. The first three participants enrolled in the study will receive a low dose of RSV A2 and will remain isolated for monitoring at the Clinical Center for at least one week. If no major safety concerns or complications arise, investigators will enroll additional participants who will be randomly assigned to receive either the same low dose of RSV A2 or a higher dose. Investigators are testing two different doses because some adults may need more of the virus to develop cold-like symptoms. Neither the study staff nor the participants will know which participants receive the higher dose. NIAID investigators, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, will analyze participant samples to measure levels of virus shedding and immune protection. Participants will be discharged from the Clinical Center once they have two consecutive negative tests for RSV and no symptoms of RSV-associated respiratory tract illness. All participants are expected to return to the Clinical Center for two follow-up visits 28 days and 56 days after they were infected. Participants who develop RSV disease will return for a third visit at 180 days (if it does not occur during RSV season), so that investigators can assess the durability of immune responses to RSV. Investigators expect to release results of the trial in 2017. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the testing of RSV A2 in healthy people, and an independent data and safety monitoring board composed of clinical research experts will closely monitor participant safety throughout the trial.","Published: August 27, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/investigating-the-vape-198630,Investigating the Vape  Expert independent review concludes that e cigarettes have potential to help smokers quit  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. An expert independent evidence review published today by Public Health England (PHE) concludes that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than tobacco and have the potential to help smokers quit smoking. Key findings of the review include:  the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking  nearly half the population (44.8%) don t realise e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking  there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers The review, commissioned by PHE and led by Professor Ann McNeill (King s College London) and Professor Peter Hajek (Queen Mary University of London), suggests that e-cigarettes may be contributing to falling smoking rates among adults and young people. Following the review PHE has published a paper on the implications of the evidence for policy and practice. The comprehensive review of the evidence finds that almost all of the 2.6 million adults using e-cigarettes in Great Britain are current or ex-smokers, most of whom are using the devices to help them quit smoking or to prevent them going back to cigarettes. It also provides reassurance that very few adults and young people who have never smoked are becoming regular e-cigarette users (less than 1% in each group). However, the review raises concerns that increasing numbers of people think e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than smoking (22.1% in 2015, up from 8.1% in 2013: ASH Smokefree GB survey) or don t know (22.7% in 2015, ASH Smokefree GB survey). Despite this trend all current evidence finds that e-cigarettes carry a fraction of the risk of smoking. Emerging evidence suggests some of the highest successful quit rates are now seen among smokers who use an e-cigarette and also receive additional support from their local stop smoking services. Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England said: Smoking remains England s number one killer and the best thing a smoker can do is to quit completely, now and forever. E-cigarettes are not completely risk free but when compared to smoking, evidence shows they carry just a fraction of the harm. The problem is people increasingly think they are at least as harmful and this may be keeping millions of smokers from quitting. Local stop smoking services should look to support e-cigarette users in their journey to quitting completely. Professor Ann McNeill, King s College London and independent author of the review, said: There is no evidence that e-cigarettes are undermining England s falling smoking rates. Instead the evidence consistently finds that e-cigarettes are another tool for stopping smoking and in my view smokers should try vaping and vapers should stop smoking entirely. E-cigarettes could be a game changer in public health in particular by reducing the enormous health inequalities caused by smoking. Professor Peter Hajek, Queen Mary University London and independent author of the review said: My reading of the evidence is that smokers who switch to vaping remove almost all the risks smoking poses to their health. Smokers differ in their needs and I would advise them not to give up on e-cigarettes if they do not like the first one they try. It may take some experimentation with different products and e-liquids to find the right one. Professor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK s expert in cancer prevention, said: Fears that e-cigarettes have made smoking seem normal again or even led to people taking up tobacco smoking are not so far being realised based on the evidence assessed by this important independent review. In fact, the overall evidence points to e-cigarettes actually helping people to give up smoking tobacco. Free Stop Smoking Services remain the most effective way for people to quit but we recognise the potential benefits for e-cigarettes in helping large numbers of people move away from tobacco. Cancer Research UK is funding more research to deal with the unanswered questions around these products including the longer-term impact. Lisa Surtees, acting director at Fresh Smoke Free North East, the first region where all local stop smoking services are actively promoted as e-cigarette friendly, said: Despite making great strides to reduce smoking, tobacco is still our biggest killer. Our region has always kept an open mind towards using electronic cigarettes as we can see the massive potential health benefits from switching. All of our local NHS Stop Smoking Services now proactively welcome anyone who wants to use these devices as part of their quit attempt and increase their chance of success.","Published: August 27, 2015"

More than 1.5 billion people around the world are at risk for cholera, a severe diarrheal illness caused by bacteria linked to poor water and sanitation. It is a major killer worldwide, causing an estimated two to three million cases and 100,000 deaths each year, primarily in developing nations. A relatively new vaccine   internationally licensed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2011   is in short supply, with roughly two million doses kept in a WHO stockpile. Current protocol calls for two doses of the vaccine to be given at least two weeks apart. During recent outbreaks, including the one in Port-au-Prince following Haiti s devastating 2010 earthquake, the vaccine has not been in wide use   in part because there isn t enough of it. Roughly 120,000 people contracted cholera and more than 800 died from it in the months after the quake. The Bloomberg School researchers set out to determine the best way to use this limited supply to make the biggest impact on health. Using mathematical modeling, the researchers estimated that if vaccination had begun within a year of the earthquake, with enough vaccine to cover 50 percent of the population of Port-au-Prince with a single dose (1.05 million doses), the one-dose strategy would have prevented 78,317 cases of cholera and prevented 783 deaths. They found that two doses would have protected five percent fewer people. That s because the logistics of refrigerating the vaccine between doses and ensuring that people were found for their second dose two weeks after the first would cost money and valuable time that could have been spent vaccinating more people. Little is known about the effectiveness of a single dose of the vaccine, and the researchers concede that giving one dose to more people may lead to less individual immunity. But a single dose could actually improve herd immunity, protecting more people in the long run.  When vaccine supplies are limited, one dose of vaccine is at least as good as two and it makes things logistically easier and cheaper to deliver. And in an outbreak, it is important to get as much vaccine out there as quickly as you can,  says study leader Justin Lessler, an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Bloomberg School.  When we have a limited supply of vaccine, we need to make hard decisions. This research tells us that when responding to an outbreak, one dose may be the way to go.  An estimated five to 10 percent of people who develop the cholera infection in their intestines will have severe disease characterized by excessive diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps. The rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock and, without treatment, death can occur within hours. There is virtually no cholera in the United States as it tends to be transmitted by unclean water and poor sanitation practices. The key to eradicating cholera, the researchers say, is upgrading water and sanitation. The vaccine is supposed to be a stopgap measure, they say, until sustainable infrastructure improvements can be implemented. Along with Haiti, the researchers also used their models to analyze a 2008-2009 cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe, which resulted in 98,351 reported cases and 4,288 deaths. If vaccination had begun four months after the first reported case, with enough vaccine to cover 50 percent of the population with one dose (6.7 million doses), a single-dose vaccination campaign would likely have averted an estimated 70,854 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths. That means administering one dose would have averted 16 percent more cholera cases and deaths than a two-dose campaign, according to the model. The findings were similar when looking at a 2013 outbreak in Guinea. A two-dose campaign took place in two rural areas but not in the capital, Conakry. If a timely campaign had been done there starting two months after the first case was reported, the researchers found, a one-dose campaign covering 50 percent of the population (828,000 doses) would likely have averted an estimated 2,826 cases and 51 deaths. The model predicts that 21 percent fewer cases and deaths would have been reported with a one-dose campaign than if a two-dose campaign had been conducted.  Either of these scenarios would have been a huge improvement over what really happened, but our model shows that less is often more,  says study co-author Andrew S. Azman, a research associate at the Bloomberg School.  Because of the herd immunity that occurs when more people are vaccinated, it appears people are safer getting one dose of cholera vaccine instead of two because their neighbors would also be protected if there are doses available to more people. One dose with more indirect protection means people are less likely to be exposed to the disease.  In Juba, the capital of South Sudan, there is currently a cholera outbreak underway and there are about 250,000 doses of vaccine available. Officials there have chosen to test the one-dose strategy in order to reach more people more quickly. Azman, Lessler and other co-authors from M decins Sans Fronti res of the current study will be investigating the Juba experience to see how this mathematical research is translated in the real world.

With 4,000 patients followed over a five-year period, the study is one of the largest and longest of its kind. ""Contrary to popular belief, we didn't see any benefit of omega-3 supplements for stopping cognitive decline,"" said Emily Chew, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications and deputy clinical director at the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of NIH. Dr. Chew leads the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), which was designed to investigate a combination of nutritional supplements for slowing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of vision loss among older Americans. That study established that daily high doses of certain antioxidants and minerals-called the AREDS formulation-can help slow the progression to advanced AMD. A later study, called AREDS2, tested the addition of omega-3 fatty acids to the AREDS formula. But the omega-3's made no difference. Omega-3 fatty acids are made by marine algae and are concentrated in fish oils; they are believed to be responsible for the health benefits associated with regularly eating fish, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut. Where studies have surveyed people on their dietary habits and health, they've found that regular consumption of fish is associated with lower rates of AMD, cardiovascular disease, and possibly dementia. ""We've seen data that eating foods with omega-3 may have a benefit for eye, brain, and heart health,"" Dr. Chew explained. Omega-3 supplements are available over the counter and often labeled as supporting brain health. A large 2011 study found that omega-3 supplements did not improve the brain health of older patients with preexisting heart disease. With AREDS2, Dr. Chew and her team saw another opportunity to investigate the possible cognitive benefits of omega-3 supplements, she said. All participants had early or intermediate AMD. They were 72 years old on average and 58 percent were female. They were randomly assigned to one of the following groups:1) Placebo (an inert pill)2) Omega-3 [specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 350 mg) and eicosapentaenoic acid (650 mg)]3) Lutein and zeaxanthin (nutrients found in large amounts in green leafy vegetables)4) Omega-3 and Lutein/zeaxanthin Because all participants were at risk for worsening of their AMD, they were also offered the original or a modified version of the AREDS formulation (without omega-3 or lutein/zeaxanthin). Participants were given cognitive function tests at the beginning of the study to establish a baseline, then at two and four years later. The tests, all validated and used in previous cognitive function studies, included eight parts designed to test immediate and delayed recall, attention and memory, and processing speed. The cognition scores of each subgroup decreased to a similar extent over time, indicating that no combination of nutritional supplements made a difference. Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia and affects as many as 5.1 million Americans age 65 and older in the U.S., may triple in the next 40 years. Some research has examined the potential benefits of DHA for Alzheimer's. Studies in mice specially bred to have features of the disease found that DHA reduces beta-amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits in the brain that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, although a clinical trial of DHA showed no impact on people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. ""The AREDS2 data add to our efforts to understand the relationship between dietary components and Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline,"" said Lenore Launer, Ph.D. senior investigator in the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Science at the National Institute on Aging. ""It may be, for example, that the timing of nutrients, or consuming them in a certain dietary pattern, has an impact. More research would be needed to see if dietary patterns or taking the supplements earlier in the development of diseases like Alzheimer's would make a difference.""","Published: August 27, 2015"

Dr Ali Ert rk has been using light sheet and 2-photon microscopy in his research for a number of years during work in both the USA (with Genentech) and currently in Germany in the Klinikum der Universit t M nchen (KUM), of the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich. He is now Group Leader of the Acute Brain Injury Research Group where his main interest is in understanding key mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury. At present, virtually nothing is known about how the initial trauma alters the brain structure over months/years and ultimately its function. Dr Ert rk describes the challenges he faces.  One of the main struggles in neuroscience in general is the difficulty to accurately analyze long connections in the brain using tissue sections which deliver only limited spatial information. We use a novel approach aiming at mapping the acute and chronic changes in the entire brain caused by small, well-defined brain lesions. To map the pathological brain, we utilize cutting-edge imaging techniques including high-resolution 3D imaging of the entire brain - that we recently developed - and in vivo 2-photon imaging. Subsequently, we screen for novel molecular players that are altered in chronically affected brain regions to halt secondary neurological problems.  Choosing the instrumentation from LaVision BioTec for his laboratory in Munich started with his experience gained using their first generation UltraMicroscope while in Genentech's Department of Neuroscience. He was a member of the development team which discovered a highly reproducible and versatile clearing procedure called 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs, or 3DISCO, which is applicable to diverse tissues including brain, spinal cord, immune organs and tumors. This has continued in Munich where he images entire transparent rodent brains. As Dr Ert rk says, the UltraMicroscope is the only commercial solution for this type of imaging where he looks at centimeter lengths of tissue. He also makes use of a two-photon microscope for higher resolution imaging of transparent organs albeit with a smaller field of view.","Published: August 27, 2015"

This method was found to deliver medicine to the brain with few side effects. About one out of every hundred Norwegians develop schizophrenia or autism in the course of their lifetime. Moreover, at any one time some 20,000 people are receiving treatment for these problems. Many psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are characterized by poor social functioning. Oxytocin is a hormone that influences social behavior and has shown promise for the treatment of mental illness. Researchers at UiO have now discovered that low doses of oxytocin may help patients with mental illness to better perceive social signals. As part of this project, they have collaborated with the company OptiNose, who have developed a new device designed to improve medicine delivery to the brain via the nose. Oxytocin has historically been known to play a crucial role in child rearing as it facilitates pregnancy, birth, and the release of milk during nursing. Further, oxytocin helps regulate cardiac functions and fluid levels. More recent research has revealed the importance of oxytocin for social behavior. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide and was discovered in 1953. Peptides are a group of molecules that consist of a chain of amino acids. Amino acids are also known as the building blocks of proteins, which we find in all types of cells. Oxytocin is produced in the hypothalamus, which is the brain's coordinating center for the hormone system. Because of oxytocin's role in social behavior, researchers have explored the possibility of administering the hormone for the treatment of mental illness. As oxytocin is a relatively large molecule, it has trouble crossing the barrier between the brain and circulating blood. Thus, researchers have administered oxytocin to patients through the nose as this route offers a direct pathway to the brain that bypasses this barrier. However, researchers have a poor understanding of how oxytocin reaches and affects the brain. The most effective dose for treatment has also received little research attention. Professor Ole A. Andreassen and his research team have collaborated with OptiNose on a project that evaluated two different doses of oxytocin and on how they affect the way in which social signals are perceived. Sixteen healthy men received two different doses of oxytocin, along with placebo. Volunteers were also given an intravenous dose of oxytocin, for a comparison of the effects of oxytocin in circulating blood. The research showed that only those administered a low dose of oxytocin experienced an effect on how they perceived social signals. Professor Ole A. Andreassen explains: ""The results show that intranasal administration, i.e. introducing oxytocin through the nose, affects the function of the brain. As no effect was observed after intravenous treatment, this indicates that intranasally administered oxytocin travels directly to the brain, as we have long believed. The fact that we have shown the efficacy of a low dose of oxytocin on social perception is even more important. A dose that is lower, but that still influences behavior, will entail a lower risk of affecting other regulatory systems in the body. Very high doses of oxytocin could, in fact, have the opposite effect on social behaviour."" The scientists also discovered that individuals with larger nasal cavities had a stronger response to a low dose of oxytocin. OptiNose uses a new technology to distribute medicine to the brain, making use of the user's breath to propel medicine deep into the nasal cavity. The device administers oxytocin high up into the patient's nasal cavity. When the medicine is targeted deep inside the nose, it enables brain delivery along nerve pathways from the uppermost part of the nasal cavity. Conventional nasal spray devices are not suited to consistently deliver medicine high up enough into the nose. The device also expands the nasal cavity, facilitating nose-to-brain medicine delivery. As the user exhales into the device, this closes the soft palate and prevents the medicine from being lost down the throat. Since less medicine is lost along the way, patients can take smaller doses and accordingly experience fewer side effects. The next step in the research is to carry out the same tests on people with mental illness. ""We are now running tests in volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders,"" says Dr Quintana. ""We hope that this research project is the first step in the development of a series of new medicines that may be of great help to more people with mental illness,"" concludes Professor Andreassen.

Enough light exposure at night can keep anyone from falling asleep as quickly as they otherwise would have. But the new research, published online in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, finds that the sleep biology of boys and girls aged 9 to 15 who were in the earlier stages of puberty were especially sensitive to light at night compared to older teens. In lab experiments, an hour of nighttime light exposure suppressed their production of the sleep-timing hormone melatonin significantly more than the same light exposure did for teens aged 11 to 16 who were farther into puberty. The brighter the light in the experiments, the more melatonin was suppressed. Among 38 children in early to middle puberty an hour of 15 lux of light (think dim ""mood"" lighting) suppressed melatonin by 9.2 percent, 150 lux (normal room light) reduced it by 26 percent, and 500 lux (as bright as in a supermarket) reduced it by 36.9 percent. The 29 teens in the late or post-puberty stage were also affected, but not as much. Exposure to 15 lux did not suppress melatonin at all, 150 lux reduced it 12.5 percent, and 500 lux reduced it by 23.9 percent. The effects were the same for boys and girls. ""Small amounts of light at night, such as light from screens, can be enough to affect sleep patterns,"" said study senior author Mary Carskadon, professor of psychiatry and human behavior in the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of chronobiology and sleep research at the E.P. Bradley Hospital in East Providence, R.I. ""Students who have tablets or TVs or computers -- even an 'old-school' flashlight under the covers to read -- are pushing their circadian clocks to a later timing. This makes it harder to go to sleep and wake up at times early the next morning for school."" Carskadon, lead author Stephanie Crowley of Rush University Medical Center, and their co-authors said children and their parents should limit use of screens at bedtime, even though it has become pervasive. One study found that 96 percent of teens use at least one form of technology in the hour before going to bed.

We put it between buns. Tuck it inside burritos. Stir it into chili. Even as U.S. red meat consumption has dropped overall in recent years, we still bought 4.6 billion pounds of beef in grocery and big-box stores over the past year. And more of the beef we buy today is in the ground form about 50 percent vs. 42 percent a decade ago. We like its convenience, and often its price. The appetite persists despite solid evidence including new test results here at Consumer Reports that ground beef can make you seriously sick, particularly when it s cooked at rare or medium-rare temperatures under 160  F.  Up to 28 percent of Americans eat ground beef that s raw or undercooked,  says Hannah Gould, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All meat potentially contains bacteria that if not destroyed by proper cooking can cause food poisoning, but some meats are more risky than others. Beef, and especially ground beef, has a combination of qualities that can make it particularly problematic and the consequences of eating tainted beef can be severe. Indeed, food poisoning outbreaks and recalls of bacteria-tainted ground beef are all too frequent. Just before the July 4 holiday this year, 13.5 tons of ground beef and steak destined for restaurants and other food-service operations were recalled on a single day because of possible contamination with a dangerous bacteria known as E. coli O157:H7. That particular bacterial strain can release a toxin that damages the lining of the intestine, often leading to abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and in some cases, life-threatening kidney damage. Though the contaminated meat was discovered by the meat-packing company s inspectors before any cases of food poisoning were reported, we haven t always been so lucky. Between 2003 and 2012, there were almost 80 outbreaks of E. coli O157 due to tainted beef, sickening 1,144 people, putting 316 in the hospital, and killing five. Ground beef was the source of the majority of those outbreaks. And incidences of food poisoning are vastly underreported.  For every case of E. coli O157 that we hear about, we estimate that another 26 cases actually occur,  Gould says. She also reports that beef is the fourth most common cause of salmonella outbreaks one of the most common foodborne illnesses in the U.S. and for each reported illness caused by that bacteria, an estimated 29 other people are infected.","Published: August 26, 2015"

An outbreak of salmonella from Danish eggs was also recorded in 2014, which is the first time in five years and illness was again attributed Danish chicken meat. These are some of the findings presented in the annual report on the occurrence of diseases that can be transmitted from animals and food to humans. The report was prepared by the National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, in cooperation with Statens Serum Institut, the national institute of public health, and the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. In 2014 a total of 1,122 salmonella infections were reported among Danes, which is equivalent to 19.9 infected cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The figure is in line with the previous year when a historically low number of Danes was infected with salmonella. Many travellers take infections home In all, 48% became ill with salmonella after travelling overseas in 2014. Most of those who returned home with a travel-related infection had been to Thailand (17.5%), Turkey (15.4%) and Spain (6.4%). Thus, foreign travel is still the largest cause of salmonella infections among Danes. Salmonella illness from Danish chicken meat In the annual source account which the National Food Institute calculates, salmonella infections were attributed Danish chicken meat for the first time since 2011. In total 2% of the infections were estimated to be attributed this source. ""For two decades Danish producers, authorities and researchers have successfully worked hard to make fresh chicken salmonella-free. It is not allowed to sell fresh meat from Danish chickens if the flock is positive for salmonella. There will always be a small risk that positive fresh meat goes under the surveillance radar and makes its way to store refrigerators. This is why it is important to continue to have a close monitoring,"" Senior Academic Officer Birgitte Helwigh from the National Food Institute says. The first salmonella outbreak from Danish eggs for five years has also been registered in 2014. ""It has been five years since we last had a foodborne outbreak caused by Danish eggs. The outbreak was associated with an outbreak of acute salmonella illness in the flock, which is extremely rare. The results show how important it is that producers and authorities continue to focus on maintaining the low incidence of salmonella in the egg production,"" says Birgitte Helwigh says. Danish pork main source Danish pork was the food source associated with the most infections among persons infected in Denmark. Overall 15% of the reported illness cases were attributed to Danish pork. There were three outbreaks where Danish pork was registered as the source of infection, which contributed 4.6% of the cases. Approximately one fifth of all salmonella cases in Denmark were not attributed to a specific food source. The reason may be that the cases were caused by foods which were not included in the salmonella source account, e.g. fruit and vegetables, or other sources of infection such as contact with livestock and pets.  Other foodborne infections With 3,782 cases registered in 2014, campylobacter still causes the most cases of foodborne bacterial illnesses in Denmark. In 2014 a total of 92 listeria infections were registered, which is an increase of 84% compared to the year before. The increase is mainly due to an outbreak in  rullep lse  (a Danish cold cut ready-to-eat speciality) with 41 reported cases. In 2014, a total of 60 foodborne disease outbreaks were registered compared with 74 outbreaks the year before. An outbreak is when several people become sick from the same food source. As in previous years, norovirus caused the most outbreaks (40%). These outbreaks usually take place in restaurants, where a total of 363 people were infected in 24 of the recorded outbreaks.","Published: August 26, 2015"

The organic food industry is one of the key factors behind the surge in healthy product recalls. According to the USDA, 70 percent of consumers believe a food is safer, more nutritious, or of higher quality if it is labeled as organic. However, with a greater amount of healthy products available in the marketplace, the industry is experiencing an uptick in associated recalls. According to the Q2 Index, more than 64 percent of food recalls have been related to healthy products since 2012. This trend continued to manifest itself strongly in Q2 2015. Sixty-five percent of the quarter's events were related to healthy food, with listeria contamination and labeling issues among the chief drivers. ""The Q2 Index data underscores that consumer demand for healthy products is growing rapidly,"" said Kevin Pollack, Vice President, Stericycle. ""The trend shows no sign of slowing and companies are looking for ways to expand into this high-growth sector. For example, leading food manufacturers have reconfigured their products to cater to the health-conscious consumer. In other industries, companies focusing on eco-friendly products are experiencing record success. Our analysis reveals that this heightened awareness results in an increase in associated recalls, making it essential that companies rethink their recall execution plans and expectations for consumer response."" The impact of increased consumer interest in healthy living extends beyond food into other sectors as well. Numerous large-scale recalls in the fitness equipment and clothing industries have been challenging for businesses in wide geographical markets. One company paid over $67 million in expenses related to a 2013 recall and was in the news again in 2015 for another event. This highlights how greater demand for fitness products leads to more large-scale, distributed recalls, which compounds the overall financial impact for manufacturers and brings new brand protection complexities. A prime example of consumers' increased preference for eco-friendly products can be found in the solar panel industry. As these products grow in popularity, they also experience recall ramifications. More than 1.3 million solar panels were recalled in 2014 due to an electrical shock hazard -- becoming the first large-scale recall the category has experienced. With analysts predicting increased growth for the U.S. solar industry in 2015, these new investments may result in a similar uptick in associated recalls. Electric vehicles and hybrid cars are additional products frequently preferred by today's environmentally-conscious consumer. As with any new product on the market, hybrid vehicle manufacturers face an increased risk of potential recalls as they master new technologies, designs, and production processes. These aspects, combined with the fact that major hybrid manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., will likely pose new recall execution challenges as sales of these vehicles continue to grow. ""Increased activity related to healthy products is resulting in greater regulatory scrutiny, which adds further complexity for manufacturers,"" continued Pollack. ""In order to maintain compliance, prevent financial and reputational damage, and protect consumers, it's essential that companies review and revise their recalls plans on a regular basis. Those that do so are primed to successfully capitalize on the market potential of the health-conscious movement, grow revenue, and increase consumer loyalty in the process.""","Published: August 26, 2015"

""However, like many other viruses, adenovirus can replicate at will when a patient's immune system is suppressed. Adenovirus can become very dangerous, such as for a child who is undergoing a bone marrow transplant to treat leukemia.""Wold and his colleagues found that Type 1 interferon is critical to prevent adenovirus from multiplying. Interferon is a protein and part of the body's immune response that fights against invading pathogens. Cells that are infected by a virus release interferon to signal nearby non-infected cells to be on alert to fight the invading virus. Researchers turned off the STAT2 gene in a group of Syrian hamsters, which disrupted the Type 1 interferon pathway by interrupting the cascade of cell signaling. They compared that group with a group of wild-type control animals, both of which had adenovirus. The genetically modified Syrian hamsters had 100 to 1,000 times more virus in their bodies than the control. ""While thousands of papers have been published on the replication of adenovirus in a cell culture model, until now, not much has been understood about the molecular details during adenovirus replication in humans,"" Wold said. The study also was the first to report findings with a genetically modified Syrian hamster infected with a virus. The genetically modified Syrian hamster with the STAT2 gene disrupted (or knocked out) was constructed by Zhongde Wang, Ph.D., and his colleagues at Utah State University. Wang's laboratory is the first to develop gene-targeting technologies in the Syrian hamster. ""The success we achieved in conducting gene-targeting in the Syrian hamster has provided the opportunity to create models for many of the human diseases for which there are either no existent animal models or severe limitations in the available animal models,"" Wang said. Previously, Wold led a research team that identified the Syrian hamster as an appropriate animal model to study adenoviruses because human adenovirus replicates in these animals, causing sickness that is similar to that seen in humans. Before their findings, scientists lacked an animal model in which to conduct adenovirus research. ""Besides providing an insight into adenovirus infection in humans, our results are also interesting from the perspective of the animal model: the STAT2 knockout Syrian hamster may also be an important animal model for studying other viral infections, including Ebola, hanta and dengue viruses,"" he said.","Published: August 26, 2015"

There have been a number of proposals for fingerprint dating in recent years, but the technique used by Muramoto and Sisco has a potential advantage in that it doesn t depend on chemical changes in the fingerprint, which are highly dependent on circumstances. Rather, it depends primarily on molecular weight and fairly well-understood models of molecular diffusion. Even the approximate age of a fingerprint can have a critical bearing on forensic results. It can rule out some prints as being too old to be relevant to a crime scene or, conversely, to help fix the time of the crime. Military forensics experts would like to be able to date the multitude of fingerprints found on improvised bombs used by insurgents to winnow out prints of individuals who may simply have handled the components in a shop from those of the actual bombmakers. But a reliable technique has yet to be found. People have tried for 30 or 40 years to date fingerprints, usually by looking at changes in bulk chemical properties,  says Sisco, but the specific chemical make-up of a fingerprint varies hugely from person to person, and the chemical changes with time depend heavily on the environment.  We map chemical composition with a submicrometer resolution and look at how the compounds move,  Sisco says, explaining that most of the material deposited in a fingerprint initially is in the ridges of the pattern, but over time it diffuses down into the valleys. Smaller molecules move faster, heavier ones slower, but all can be modeled with a standard function for molecular diffusion. The NIST paper only reports on aging fingerprints up to four days, but Sisco says that in fact,  you can distinguish between the first day and a week, between a week and a month, between a month and four months.  The primary instrument, an imaging mass spectrometer, is not exactly a field device, and the NIST experiments used ideal test subjects: single prints deposited on polished silicon surfaces. Given the promising results of their initial study, the NIST researchers say the next steps are to test the technique over longer timespans, on more realistic surfaces such as metal or paint, and under more uneven environmental conditions.","Published: August 26, 2015"

That code was unraveled by the discovery that adhesion proteins   the glue that keeps cells together   interact with the microprocessor, a key player in the production of molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs). The miRNAs orchestrate whole cellular programs by simultaneously regulating expression of a group of genes. The investigators found that when normal cells come in contact with each other, a specific subset of miRNAs suppresses genes that promote cell growth. However, when adhesion is disrupted in cancer cells, these miRNAs are misregulated and cells grow out of control. The investigators showed, in laboratory experiments, that restoring the normal miRNA levels in cancer cells can reverse that aberrant cell growth.  The study brings together two so-far unrelated research fields   cell-to-cell adhesion and miRNA biology   to resolve a long-standing problem about the role of adhesion proteins in cell behavior that was baffling scientists,  says the study s lead author Antonis Kourtidis, Ph.D., a research associate in Dr. Anastasiadis  lab.  Most significantly, it uncovers a new strategy for cancer therapy,  he adds. That problem arose from conflicting reports about E-cadherin and p120 catenin   adhesion proteins that are essential for normal epithelial tissues to form, and which have long been considered to be tumor suppressors.  However, we and other researchers had found that this hypothesis didn t seem to be true, since both E-cadherin and p120 are still present in tumor cells and required for their progression,  Dr. Anastasiadis says.  That led us to believe that these molecules have two faces   a good one, maintaining the normal behavior of the cells, and a bad one that drives tumorigenesis.  Their theory turned out to be true, but what was regulating this behavior was still unknown. To answer this, the researchers studied a new protein called PLEKHA7, which associates with E-cadherin and p120 only at the top, or the  apical  part of normal polarized epithelial cells. The investigators discovered that PLEKHA7 maintains the normal state of the cells, via a set of miRNAs, by tethering the microprocessor to E-cadherin and p120. In this state, E-cadherin and p120 exert their good tumor suppressor sides. However,  when this apical adhesion complex was disrupted after loss of PLEKHA7, this set of miRNAs was misregulated, and the E-cadherin and p120 switched sides to become oncogenic,  Dr. Anastasiadis says.  We believe that loss of the apical PLEKHA7-microprocessor complex is an early and somewhat universal event in cancer,  he adds.  In the vast majority of human tumor samples we examined, this apical structure is absent, although E-cadherin and p120 are still present. This produces the equivalent of a speeding car that has a lot of gas (the bad p120) and no brakes (the PLEKHA7-microprocessor complex).  By administering the affected miRNAs in cancer cells to restore their normal levels, we should be able to re-establish the brakes and restore normal cell function,  Dr. Anastasiadis says.  Initial experiments in some aggressive types of cancer are indeed very promising. ","Published: August 26, 2015"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-identifies-the-off-switch-for-biofilm-formation-210594,Study Identifies the Off Switch for Biofilm Formation New discovery could help prevent the formation of infectious bacterial films on hospital equipment   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Bacteria are best known as free-living single cells, but in reality their lives are much more complex. To survive in harsh environments, many species of bacteria will band together and form a biofilm a collection of cells held together by a tough web of fibers that offers protection from all manner of threats, including antibiotics. A familiar biofilm is the dental plaque that forms on teeth between brushings, but biofilms can form almost anywhere given the right conditions. Biofilms are a huge problem in the health care industry. When disease-causing bacteria establish a biofilm on sensitive equipment, it can be impossible to sterilize the devices, raising rates of infection and necessitating expensive replacements. So researchers look for ways to break down the defenses of biofilms to prevent them from establishing a foothold. Now, a University of Maryland-led team has found an important link in the biofilm formation process: an enzyme that shuts down the signals that bacteria use to form a biofilm. The findings have far-reaching implications for the development of new treatments, and could one day help make biofilm-related complications a distant memory. Bacteria form biofilms because they sense a change in their environment. They do this by generating a signaling molecule, which binds to a receptor that turns on the response,  said Mona Orr, the lead author of the study and a UMD biological sciences graduate student.  But you need a way to turn off the switch to remove the signal when it s no longer needed. We ve identified the enzyme that completes the process of turning off the switch.  The well-known switch that activates biofilm formation is a signaling molecule called Cyclic-di-GMP, also known as c-di-GMP. Many species of disease-causing bacteria use c-di-GMP to signal the formation of biofilms, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Vibrio cholerae. But Orr and her colleagues are the first to identify the molecule that completes the process of clearing c-di-GMP from the cell, thus ending the biofilm signaling process. The molecule is an enzyme called oligoribonuclease, and much like c-di-GMP, oligoribonuclease is also common among disease-causing bacterial species. The team studied the process in the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common species known to cause infections in hospital patients. But because of the genetic and physiological similarities between P. aeruginosa and other infectious species, the researchers believe that oligoribonuclease serves the same function across a wide variety of bacteria.  You can think of this process in terms of water filling a sink. The rate of water from the faucet is just as important as the size of the drain in determining the level of water in the sink,  said Vincent Lee, a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the UMD Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics and the Maryland Pathogen Research Institute.  The level of c-di-GMP in the cell is analogous to the amount of water in the sink. Because no one knew what the drain was, our findings create a complete picture of the signaling process.  Orr, Lee and their colleagues from the UMD Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Michigan State University focused their work on P. aeruginosa because it is well studied and can survive under a variety of conditions, making it notoriously difficult to control. Contact lens wearers might already be familiar with P. aeruginosa, as it commonly forms infectious, green-tinted biofilms on older lenses or those that have not been cleaned properly. The team found that oligoribonuclease is necessary for the second of a two-step process. The first, which converts c-di-GMP into an intermediate molecule called pGpG, was already known. Orr, Lee and their colleagues have now filled in the important second step in this process: oligoribonuclease breaks apart pGpG and thus completely shuts off the signaling pathway. The result suggests that oligoribonuclease could be used to help design new antibiotics, disinfectants, and surface treatments to control biofilms. Such measures could prevent infections and preclude the need for frequent replacement of expensive hospital equipment. Because biofilms can also form on implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers and synthetic joints, effective treatments against biofilms could eliminate the need for costly and risky replacement surgeries. While oligoribonuclease most likely shuts down biofilm formation in many infectious bacterial species, Orr and Lee acknowledge that their discovery is not quite a  silver bullet  that can fight every type of biofilm.  The genes that make these signals are found in most bacteria. The oligoribonuclease enzyme that breaks the effect is only found in some, however,  Lee explained.  So there must be parallels in the organisms that don t have oligoribonuclease. Finding these other  off  switches is high on our list of future research goals. ","Published: August 26, 2015"

Immatics believes that ACT approaches to be developed by the new company can achieve a step change in the treatment of cancer, by delivering significant, long- lasting clinical benefits. The new company will strive to develop three different ACT approaches for the treatment of tumors with high un-met medical needs, the first of which will enter the clinic in 2016. Immatics US, Inc. will develop both autologous and allogenic ACT approaches by capitalizing on MD Anderson s world-leading clinical oncology and cell therapy expertise and Immatics  unrivaled cancer target and T-cell receptor (TCR) discovery capabilities. Immatics US, Inc. will be based in Houston and has secured a first funding round totaling over $60m with more than $40m committed by the parent company Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH and $19.7 million by a recently awarded grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). Immatics has been able to use its unique and world-leading technology platform XPRESIDENT  for the discovery and further qualification of dozens of novel, proprietary and highly specific cancer targets that can be used as the basis for a range of cancer immunotherapy applications including ACT. This capability will enable Immatics US, Inc. to develop TCR-based approaches and to have complementary utility with other approaches for addressing tumor targets. Immatics believes its ACT will be both efficacious and safe due to the specificity of its novel well-characterized targets, including novel over-expressed, cancer-testis and neo-antigens ideally suited for specific and safe ACT approaches. lmmatics has been benefiting from MDACC's outstanding understanding of cancer immunotherapy. Two leading MD Anderson scientists, Patrick Hwu, M.D., Division Head of Cancer Medicine, and Cassian Yee, M.D., Professor of Medical Melanoma Oncology, have laid the scientific foundation for the adoptive cell therapy development plans of lmmatics US, Inc., and they will continue to provide ongoing practical support and guidance as the Company develops its ACT approaches and therapies. Immatics has also gained access to various technologies developed or in-licensed by MD Anderson. These include the use of the cytokine IL-21 for expansion of T cells, a gamma-delta T-cell platform for allogeneic cell therapy approaches and various technologies designed to optimize the development of ACT.  The potential of cancer immunotherapy has been constrained by the lack of novel targets. Immatics has been working for the last 15 years to gain a broad and in-depth understanding of the immunopeptidome of tumor and normal tissue cells,  said Harpreet Singh, CEO of Immatics US, Inc.  Based on this unique expertise we have discovered dozens of novel immunotherapy targets that will be central to the success of Immatics US, Inc. With several complementary development programs guided by some of the most exceptional scientists in the field of cancer immunotherapy, we are in exactly the right place to deliver transforming therapies to cancer patients with high medical need.   We are extremely excited about the potential of Immatics US, Inc. to develop and commercialize the world s best ACT,  said Paul Higham, CEO of the parent company Immatics.  The combination of MD Anderson s significant clinical oncology and cell therapy expertise and our own unrivaled cancer target discovery capabilities will allow us to develop the optimal ACT for the treatment of cancer, initially a range of solid tumors with high un-met medical need. I would like to thank CPRIT and our investors for their financial support and look forward to developing Immatics US, Inc. into one of the world s leading cancer immunotherapy companies.   Our on-going efforts to provide the most innovative therapies to our patients are due, in part, to collaborations both in academia and industry,  said Ronald DePinho, M.D., president of MD Anderson.  It is only through working with other leaders in cancer science will we provide the solutions of tomorrow. ","Published: August 26, 2015"

Researchers said the software could improve breast cancer management, particularly in developing countries where pathologists are not routinely available.  To evaluate fresh breast tissue at the point of care could change the current practice of pathology,  said lead researcher Rebecca Richards-Kortum, Rice s Malcolm Gillis University Professor and professor of bioengineering and of electrical and computer engineering.  We have developed a faster means to classify benign and malignant human breast tissues using fresh samples and thereby removing the need for time-consuming tissue preparation. Today, breast-cancer diagnosis is an intricate process. Tissue first must be obtained, typically by either a core needle biopsy or surgical excision. Next, pathologists must complete a complex process to prepare the tissue for analysis and histological assessment. When examined under a microscope, cancerous and precancerous cells typically appear different from healthy cells. The study of cellular structures is known as histology, and a histological analysis is typically required for an accurate diagnosis of both the type and stage of a cancerous tumor. The software developed in Richards-Kortum s lab allows for an automated histological assessment of breast cancer from tissue samples without the need for complex tissue-sample preparation or assessment by a pathologist. The software uses high-speed optical microscopy of intact breast tissue specimens.  We performed our analysis without tissue fixation, cutting and staining and achieved comparable classification with current methods,  Richards-Kortum said.  This cuts out the tissue-preparation process and allows for rapid diagnosis. It is also reliant on measurable criteria, which could reduce subjectivity in the evaluation of breast histology.  The software uses images from a confocal fluorescence microscope to analyze freshly cut human breast tissue samples for certain histological parameters that are typically used in breast cancer diagnosis. The software uses the parameter data to classify the tissue in each image and make a determination whether the imaged tissue is benign or malignant. Although the software could have substantial clinical relevance, Richards-Kortum said more research and refinement of the classification procedures are needed before the software can be used in a clinical setting. Rice graduate student Jessica Dobbs, the study s lead author, said,  We are excited about the possibility of using these imaging techniques to improve access to histologic diagnosis in developing regions that lack the human resources and equipment necessary to perform standard histologic assessment.

To defend themselves from infection, hosts attempt to block pathogens  access to these nutrients. Now researchers at MIT have discovered the vital role a protein, calprotectin, plays in this process, known as  nutritional immunity.  The researchers have described the process by which human calprotectin prevents invading pathogens from obtaining iron, an extremely important nutrient. Transition metal ions, such as iron, zinc, and manganese, are essential for all organisms, according to Elizabeth Nolan, an associate professor of chemistry at MIT, who led the research.  What that means in the context of the host-pathogen interaction is that an invading microorganism needs to acquire these nutrient metal ions from the host,  Nolan says.  That is a challenge because the host tries to restrict metal-ion availability during infection, using a variety of strategies,  she says.Broad antimicrobial effects One such strategy is the use of proteins that chelate, or bind with metal ions, and so take them out of the pathogen s reach. Previous research has identified that the protein calprotectin can sequester zinc and manganese. But while important, these nutrients alone do not fully explain the broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect that calprotectin is known to have, since different organisms have different metal-ion requirements, Nolan says. So Nolan and her colleagues began to investigate whether the protein is also capable of sequestering iron. The researchers first added calprotectin to a bacterial growth medium containing metal ions, to determine which metals it would bind to, and under what conditions. They found that the protein did indeed deplete the iron from the medium, and the presence of excess calcium in the medium resulted in substantially greater iron depletion. This calcium effect was in line with previous work by the researchers, which had shown that the protein  morphs  into a far more effective scavenger of zinc and manganese ions when calcium is present.  Calcium converts calprotectin into a form that more readily sequesters iron, so it binds to it with higher affinity,  Nolan says. Unlike when scavenging zinc and manganese, however, the researchers observed that the ability of calprotectin to sequester iron also depended on the presence of a reducing agent, beta-mercaptoethanol (BME).  This observation suggests that the protein has a preference for scavenging ferrous iron, or iron(II). That is because the reducing agent, BME, will keep iron in the iron(II) oxidation state.  We found there was approximately a 30-fold reduction in total iron in the medium, under the presence of calcium and BME,  Nolan says.  So this shows that calprotectin is very good at sequestering iron(II), and it does so in a way that s dependent on the presence of calcium ions,  she says. Bacterial growth blocked The researchers then added bacteria to the calprotectin-treated medium, in a bid to determine what effect this reduction in iron concentration would have on the invading pathogens. They found that the growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by the lack of available iron. They then substituted metal ions back into the medium. They found that Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli were only able to grow back once iron was added to the medium. Indeed, adding iron alone was enough for some Gram-negative bacteria to fully recover, Nolan says. In the case of Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, however, the microorganisms required mixtures of iron, manganese, and zinc to show maximum growth recovery, she says.  The data indicates that the ability of calprotectin to sequester iron has a significant impact on the growth of Gram-negative organisms,  Nolan says.  Iron sequestration also contributes to the growth inhibition of Gram-positive organisms, but we need to add more than just iron back in, in order for them to recover,  she says. When the researchers then added both calprotectin and bacteria to a growth medium containing the radioactive isotope iron-55, they were able to observe that the presence of the protein prevented the microorganisms from acquiring the metal. Finally, the researchers performed biochemical and spectroscopic analysis   the latter in collaboration with Carsten Krebs, a professor of chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology at Penn State University   to characterize the iron(II) binding site of calprotectin. They found that calprotectin uses an unusual hexahistidine motif to bind iron(II). The research suggests a model by which calprotectin, which is housed in the cytoplasm of a cell, uses changes in calcium concentration to tune its metal-sequestering function, Nolan says.  Under resting conditions calcium ion concentrations are low [within the cytoplasm], but then when calprotectin is released into the extracellular space at the site of an infection, the concentration of calcium is orders of magnitude higher,  she says.  Calprotectin then binds to calcium and converts to its high-affinity form, and that allows it to sequester metals from microbes.  The research could contribute to efforts to develop methods to boost the immune system s metal ion withholding response, and thereby fight bacterial infection, Nolan says. This study highlights the versatility of calprotectin, according to David Giedroc, a professor of chemistry at Indiana University who was not involved in the research.  Calprotectin is exclusively regarded by the community as a calcium-activated manganese- and zinc-binding protein, and all the physiological effects of calprotectin in nutritional immunity have previously been attributed to the withholding of these two important transition metal ions only,  Giedroc says.  This new work establishes clearly, for the first time, that [calprotectin] has the ability to bind iron(II), and this activity appears to be important for inhibition of growth of a wide range of bacterial pathogens,  he says.","Published: August 26, 2015"

Scott Fitzgerald once said that the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. Now, scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have found the biological equivalent of that idea or something very close. For the first time, they have uncovered the structural details of how some proteins interact to turn two different signals into a single integrated output. These new findings could aid future drug design by giving scientists an edge in fine tuning the signal between these partnered proteins and the drug s course of action.  Thyroid, vitamin D and retinoid receptors all rely on integrated signals their own signal plus a partner receptor,  said TSRI Associate Professor Kendall Nettles, who led the study with TSRI colleague Associate Professor Douglas Kojetin.  These new findings will have important implications for drug design by clearly defining exactly how these signals become integrated, so we will be able to predict how changes in a drug s design could affect signaling.  Using a number of complementary technologies, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography and hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry from the laboratory of Scripps Florida colleague Chair of the Department of Molecular Therapeutics Patrick R. Griffin, the scientists were able to determine the mechanism through which two signaling pathways become integrated. The study focused on a small subset of nuclear receptors, a large family of proteins that regulate gene expression in response to signals from various binding partners, including steroids and fats. Once receptors sense the presence of these binding partners, they send out new signals that initiate other cellular processes.  Nuclear receptors bind different types of molecules, and some of these receptors physically interact with each other to integrate different signals,  Kojetin said.  Earlier studies basically accepted this without any structural evidence for communication between receptors. This is the first time that anyone has looked at what s actually going on at the atomic level. ","Published: August 26, 2015"

DuBois, a leader in colorectal cancer research for more than two decades, has been exploring the risk factors between chronic inflammation and cancer, including colorectal cancer.  We ve long known that simple things like taking aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs (called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs), have beneficial effects on reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,  DuBois said.  But non-aspirin NSAIDs can cause serious cardiovascular side effects when taken over a long period of time, so we ve needed to discover better drug targets. This study points us in the right direction.  The findings could mean new hope for more effective colorectal cancer treatments and screening methods. Currently, nearly half of patients with advanced colorectal cancer die within five years following treatment. One reason may be that the cancer becomes more chemotherapy-resistant, but other evidence has supported the role of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in tumor metastasis.The research team was able to show how a colon cancer tumor could outwit its host, using an inflammatory mediator to expand its cancer stem cells in order to seek out other organs. They showed a direct link between the pro-inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 and increased colorectal cancer stem cells. A cancer is a genetic menagerie made up of many different types of cells. Some of these cells, called cancer stem cells, are thought to be responsible for tumor initiation, growth, relapse and recurrence.  Prostaglandin E2 is the most abundant pro-inflammatory bioactive fat, or lipid, found in colon, lung, breast, head and neck cancers. When high levels of PGE2 are found in cancer, it often indicates a poor prognosis.  The normal role of PGE2 is to come to the rescue when you do something like cut your finger,  DuBois said.  It attracts the body s immune cells and stimulates pathways that heal the wound site. The level of PGE2 goes up and then goes down within a few days of healing the wound. ""But in cancer, the cells keep making PGE2 chronically, so it s like this wounding process that never heals. In doing so, it generates these cancer stem cells that promote cancer progression and metastatic spread.  DuBois  research team proved that when PGE2 binds to its receptor on the surface of the cancer cell, PGE receptor 4, or EP4, it triggers a signaling cascade for cancer stem cells to renew, differentiate and eventually become resistant to chemotherapy. It s as if the original cancer tumor cells, starved for oxygen and running low on supplies in the colon, trick its host body by making PGE2 to send out a help signal for the new stem cells to build a life raft and find safe harbor throughout the body and multiply again. DuBois was able to show in a mouse model of colorectal cancer that adding PGE2 increased the number of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and overall tumor burden, with the liver being one of the prime organ targets for colorectal cancer to first spread.  We use a combination of approaches that utilize human tissues and mouse models to complete our studies,  DuBois said.  We take samples from human colon cancers and then purify the cancer stem cell population. When we treat these stem cells with PGE2, we found that they are 1,000 times more metastatic than the cells we don t treat with PGE2.  In addition, the elevated PGE2 levels and increased numbers of CSCs were also seen in human colon cancer tissue specimens. Furthermore, when they were able to block the PGE2 signaling by adding a drug that inhibits binding to the EP4 receptor, it reduced the number of polyps and CSCs, and blocked liver metastasis. The paper was the first to show the impact PGE2 had on the spread of CSCs to the liver. With the new proof in hand, DuBois is optimistic about future research.  Now, if we can just target and eliminate the stem cells from people with colon cancer, we can develop a new therapeutic approach to treat colorectal cancer and improve outcomes,  DuBois said. DuBois is hopeful that human clinical trials can be initiated in a reasonable time to show the effectiveness of the new drug target strategy.","Published: August 26, 2015"

Leveraging a biologically inspired sponge-like gel called ""cryogel"" as an injectable biomaterial, the vaccine delivers patient-specific tumor cells together with immune-stimulating biomolecules to enhance the body s attack against cancer. The approach, a so-called ""injectable cryogel whole-cell cancer vaccine,"" is reported online in Nature Communications on August 12. Mooney, who leads a Wyss Institute team developing a broad suite of novel cancer vaccines and immunotherapies, is also the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. His team s latest approach differs from other cancer cell transplantation therapies-which harvest tumor cells and then genetically engineer them to trigger immune responses once they are transplanted back into the patient s body-in that the new cryogel vaccine s properties are used to evoke the immune response in a far simpler and more economical way. Cryogels are a type of hydrogel made up of cross-linked hydrophilic polymer chains that can hold up to 99 percent water. They are created by freezing a solution of the polymer that is in the process of gelling. When thawed back again to room temperature, the substance turns into a highly interconnected pore-containing hydrogel, which is similar in composition to bodily soft tissues in terms of their water content, structure, and mechanics. By adjusting their shape, physical properties, and chemical composition, Mooney s team generated sponge-like, porous cryogels that can be infused with living cells, biological molecules or drugs for a variety of potential therapeutic applications including cancer immunotherapy. ""Instead of genetically engineering the cancer cells to influence the behavior of immune cells, we use immune-stimulating chemicals or biological molecules inserted alongside harvested cancer cells in the porous, sponge-like spaces of the cryogel vaccine,"" said Mooney. The cryogels can be delivered in a minimally invasive manner due to their extreme flexibility and resilience, enabling them to be compressed to a fraction of their size and injected underneath the skin via a surgical needle. Once injected, they quickly bounce back to their original dimensions to do their job. ""After injection into the body, the cryogels can release their immune-enhancing factors in a highly controlled fashion to recruit specialized immune cells which then make contact and read unique signatures off the patient s tumor cells, also contained in the cryogels. This has two consequences: immune cells become primed to mount a robust and destructive response against patient-specific tumor tissue and the immune tolerance developing within the tumor microenvironment is broken,"" said Sidi Bencherif, the study s co-first author and a Research Associate in Mooney s research group. In experimental animal models on melanoma tumors, results show that utilizing the cryogel to deliver whole cells and drugs triggers a dramatic immune response that can shrink tumors and even prophylactically protect animals from tumor growth.

The Brown University analysis found that between 2000 and 2009, the better matched the vaccine was for the influenza strain going around, the fewer nursing home residents died or were hospitalized. Although flu vaccination is a standard of care and a measure of quality in nursing homes, some public health experts question the evidence of whether they do any good, said Vincent Mor, corresponding author of the study and the Florence Pirce Grant Professor in the Brown University School of Public Health. Clinical trials that would withhold vaccination for a control group are not ethical, and observational studies that track differences among those who are vaccinated and those who are not have been suspected of bias (i.e., people left unvaccinated may be too frail compared to the vaccinated general population).In the new research Brown public health and infectious disease experts took a different approach to assess whether vaccination helps. Year-to-year the ability of the vaccine to fight the flu can vary widely. Sometimes vaccine makers produce a great match that is highly protective. In other years the prevailing flu strain does not match the vaccine well. The researchers took advantage of this natural variation over the decade 2000-09 to see whether nursing home residents were better off when the match was good compared to when the match was bad. If vaccines don t help the elderly, as some critics suggest, then nursing home residents shouldn t fare any better when the vaccine is a good match than when it s a bad match.  What we ve used is the randomness of the match,  Mor said.  Ours is the first study to, we think, come up with an unbiased approach.  The results show that vaccinations help keep some nursing home residents alive and out of the hospital. The match rate varied particularly widely in the flu strain A/H3N2, which is typically the strain that leads to most flu hospitalizations and deaths. Over the 10-year study period, the match rate ranged from 11.2 percent in 2003-2004 and 22 percent the next year, to 100 percent in the first two study years and in the last one. Match rates for strain A/H1N1 were usually very high and for strain B were usually low. By comparing weekly deaths and flu-related hospitalizations in each year s flu season, the researchers were able to calculate that for every percentage point increase in the A/H3N2 match rate, weekly deaths declined by about 0.0016 and hospitalizations declined by about 0.002 per 1,000 nursing home residents. Those numbers may seem small, but put another way, among about 1 million elderly persons living in nursing homes each year, a 50-percentage point increase in the match rate for a flu season would save the lives of 2,560 people and prevent 3,200 hospitalizations.  That s saving lives,  Mor said.  That s really a profound effect.  Mor said the results are likely applicable to all elderly people, the vast majority of whom do not live in nursing homes. Vaccination rates among the elderly in the community, however, tend to be much lower than in nursing homes. Co-author Dr. Stefan Gravenstein, adjunct professor of medicine and health services, policy and practice, agreed.  This study evidences protection for an elderly population for whom vaccine efficacy has been questioned,  he said.  Annual vaccination is the only way to maximize the benefit of vaccine, no matter what the age. ","Published: August 26, 2015"

This link may offer a way to identify causes and develop treatments of the disease and lead to new diagnostic tests. ""The oropharynx of schizophrenics seems to harbor different proportions of oral bacteria than healthy individuals,"" said Eduardo Castro-Nallar, a Ph.D. candidate at GW's Computational Biology Institute (CBI) and lead author of the study. ""Specifically, our analyses revealed an association between microbes such as lactic-acid bacteria and schizophrenics."" Recent studies have shown that microbiomes--the communities of microbes living within our bodies--can affect the immune system and may be connected to mental health. Research linking immune disorders and schizophrenia has also been published, and this study furthers the possibility that shifts in oral communities are associated with schizophrenia. Mr. Castro-Nallar's research sought to identify microbes associated with schizophrenia, as well as components that may be associated with or contribute to changes in the immune state of the person. In this study, the group found a significant difference in the microbiomes of healthy and schizophrenic patients. ""Our results suggesting a link between microbiome diversity and schizophrenia require replication and expansion to a broader number of individuals for further validation,"" said Keith Crandall, director of the CBI and contributing author of the study. ""But the results are quite intriguing and suggest potential applications of biomarkers for diagnosis of schizophrenia and important metabolic pathways associated with the disease."" The study helps to identify possible contributing factors to schizophrenia. With additional studies, researchers may be able to determine if microbiome changes are a contributing factor to schizophrenia, are a result of schizophrenia or do not have a connection to the disorder.","Published: August 26, 2015"

But when they misfire, life-threatening cancers can occur. This information is seen as critical in developing treatments for some of the most lethal types of cancer including pancreatic, colon and lung, which are characterized by uncontrolled cell growth caused by breakdowns in cell signaling cascades. The research focused on a molecular switch called K-Ras. Mutated versions of K-Ras are found in about 20 percent of all human cancers in the United States and these mutations lock the K-Ras switch in the on position.  When K-Ras is locked in the on position, it drives cell division, which leads to the production of a cancer,  said John Hancock, M.B., B.Chir, Ph.D., ScD, the study s senior author and chairman of the Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology at UTHealth Medical School.  We have identified a completely new molecular mechanism that further enhances the activity of K-Ras.  The study focused on the tiny electrical charges that all cells carry across their limiting (plasma) membrane.  What we have shown is that the electrical potential (charge) that a cell carries is inversely proportional to the strength of a K-Ras signal,  Hancock said. With the aid of a high-powered electron microscope, the investigators observed that certain lipid molecules in the plasma membrane respond to an electrical charge, which in turn amplifies the output of the Ras signaling circuit. This is exactly like a transistor in an electronic circuit board. Yong Zhou, Ph.D., first author and assistant professor of integrative biology and pharmacology at UTHealth Medical School, said,  Our results may finally account for a long-standing but unexplained observation that many cancer cells actively try to reduce their electrical charge.  Initial work was done with human and animal cells and findings were subsequently confirmed in a fruit fly model on membrane organization.  This has huge implications for biology,  Hancock said.  Beyond the immediate relevance to K-Ras in cancer, it is a completely new way that cells can use electrical charge to control a multitude of signaling pathways, which may be particularly relevant to the nervous system.

Rice, Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Professor in Virology and head of the Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, report that when they overexpressed a particular gene in human liver cancer cell lines, the virus could easily replicate.   Being able to easily culture HCV in the lab has many important implications for basic science research,  says Rice.  There is still much we don t understand about how the virus operates, and how it interacts with liver cells and the immune system.  Scientists have long attempted to understand what makes HCV tick, and in 1999 a group of German scientists  succeeded in coaxing modified forms of the virus to replicate in cells in the laboratory. However, it was soon discovered that these forms of the virus were able to replicate because they had acquired certain  adaptive  mutations. This was true for all samples from patients, except one, and left scientists with a puzzling question for more than a decade: what prevents non-mutated HCV from replicating in laboratory-grown cell lines? Rice and colleagues hypothesized that one or more critical elements might be missing in these cell lines. To test this idea, they screened a library of about 7,000 human genes to look for one whose expression would allow replication of non-mutated HCV. When the scientists expressed the gene SEC14L2, the virus replicated in its wild-type, non-mutated form. Even adding serum samples from HCV-infected patients to these engineered cell lines resulted in virus replication.  Practically speaking, this means that if scientists want to study HCV from an infected patient, it s now possible to take a blood sample, inoculate the engineered cells, and grow that patient s form of the virus in the lab,  says first author Mohsan Saeed, a postdoc in Rice s laboratory. It s not entirely clear how the protein expressed bySEC14L2 works, says Saeed, but it appears to inhibit lipids from interacting with dangerous reactive oxygen species, a process that prevents HCV replication. Recent advances in HCV treatment have made it possible for millions of people to be cured of the virus.  New therapies, however, are extremely expensive and not perfect,  Saeed notes.  As more patients are treated, drug resistant forms of HCV are emerging. Having a cell culture system where patient isolates can be grown and tested for resistance or susceptibility to alternative antiviral drug combinations should be useful for optimizing re-treatment strategies for those that fail treatment.  Even though effective therapies for HCV do exist, there is still much we need to understand about the virus, adds Saeed   and understanding how HCV interacts with its host cell can help scientists learn more about similar viruses for which effective treatments have yet to be developed.  The lessons learned from one disease can be true for other diseases as well,  he observes.","Published: August 26, 2015"

David Allis, Joy and Jack Fishman Professor in the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics, in collaboration with Robert B. Darnell, Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology. The findings will likely fuel more research into the brain effects of BET inhibitors, and could lead to the development of safer drugs that reduce the risk of potential side effects such as memory loss. First author Erica Korb, a postdoctoral fellow in Allis s lab, says the compound they tested in the study has the ability to cross into the brain from the bloodstream. However, this may not be the case for other drug variants tested in patients. Several companies are testing the inhibitors using unique formulations that they ve optimized in proprietary ways   for example, by adding chemical groups to make a compound more targeted or effective   which might make it more difficult for the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier.Many patients with hard-to-treat cancers have already received these experimental drugs. The Rockefeller scientists say their findings suggests more research is needed to determine whether the therapies can enter the brain, since that could potentially cause some unwanted side effects.  We found that if a drug blocks a BET protein throughout the body, and that drug can get into the brain, you could very well produce neurological side effects,  says Korb. Allis, Korb, and their colleagues decided to test BET inhibitors in the brain. BET proteins help regulate the process of transcribing genes into proteins, a key step in cell division. Since neurons divide less frequently than other cell types, scientists hadn t given much consideration to the role of BET proteins in the brain, says Korb. During the study, the researchers used a compound that was designed to thwart the activity of a specific BET protein, called Brd4. They used the original version of the drug, called Jq1, says Korb, which they knew could cross the blood-brain barrier. The researchers added the drug to mouse neurons grown in the laboratory, then stimulated the cells in a way that mimicked the process of memory formation. Normally, when neurons receive this type of signal, they begin transcribing genes into proteins, resulting in the formation of new memories   a process that is partly regulated by Brd4.  To turn a recent experience into a long-term memory, you need to have gene transcription in response to these extracellular signals,  says Korb. Indeed, when the researchers stimulated mouse neurons with signals that mimicked those they would normally receive in the brain, they saw massive changes in gene transcription. But when they performed this experiment after adding Jq1, they saw much less activity.  After administering a Brd4 inhibitor, we no longer saw those changes in transcription after stimuli,  says Korb. To test how the drug affected mice s memories, researchers placed the animals in a box with two objects they ve never seen before, such as pieces of lego or tiny figurines. Mice typically explore anything unfamiliar, climbing and sniffing around it. After a few minutes, the researchers took the mice out of the box. One day later, they put them back in, this time with one of the objects from the day before and another, unfamiliar one. Mice that received the placebo drug were much more interested in the new object, presumably because the one from the day before was familiar. But mice treated with Jq1 were equally interested in both objects, suggesting they didn t remember the previous day s experience. Next, the researchers took their findings one step further. If Jq1 reduces molecular activity in the brain, they asked, could it help in conditions marked by too much brain activity, such as epilepsy? Brd4 regulates a receptor protein present at the synapse, a structure where two neurons connect and transmit signals. When the researchers administered the Brd4 inhibitor, they saw decreased levels of that receptor, which likely results in neurons firing less frequently. Next, they gave the drug to mice for a week, then added a chemical that induces seizures. The experiment showed that mice that received Jq1 had a much lower rate of seizures than those given a placebo drug.  In the case of the epileptic brain, when there s too much activity and neurons talking to each other, this drug could be potentially be beneficial,  says Korb.  Extending the use of these drugs into non-cancer diseases, including neurological disorders, is a largely unexplored area with much potential,  Allis adds.","Published: August 26, 2015"

Kwansei Gakuin University is situated in the Hyogo prefecture in the Japanese cities of Nishinomiya and Sanda. Professor Noboru Ohtani is a member of the Department of Nanotechnology for Sustainable Energy in the School of Science and Technology. His major fields of research are the study of wide bandgap semiconductors and crystallographic defects. Crystallographic defects in 4H-SiC epitaxial wafers, such as dislocations and stacking faults, limit the commercialization of SiC devices and must therefore be eliminated or reduced to levels lower than some critical density. The department s research goal is to establish SiC crystal growth processes that can produce large ultra-high quality SiC epitaxial wafers. To achieve this, they try to clarify the cause and formation mechanism of crystallographic defects in SiC bulk crystal and epitaxial film. Crystallographic defects give rise to residual stresses in the crystals. The stresses can occur through a variety of mechanisms in 4H-SiC crystals. For example, temperature gradients in the grown crystals, which are a primary driving force for crystal growth, lead to plastic deformation of the crystals during the growth and/or cooling process. This deformation results in residual stresses when the crystals are cooled to room temperature. The spatial variation of stresses in the crystals can be measured using Renishaw s inVia confocal Raman microscope. These measurements provide valuable information about the formation of defects during physical vapour transport (PVT) growth and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) processes. This information is used to improve the crystal growth process. Professor Ohtani s laboratory also uses high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) to characterize stress distribution. Raman microscopy provides complementary information to the HRXRD data but with much higher spatial resolution. When asked why the inVia was chosen for the lab, Professor Ohtani said:  The key benefit is the ultra-high-speed data acquisition system, which results in a higher sensitivity to measuring stresses in the materials compared to other Raman systems.  Professor Ohtani and his colleagues recently published a paper with the Materials Science Forum describing the structural and electrical characterization of the initial stage of physical vapour transport growth of 4H-SiC crystals. It illustrates the power of micro Raman imaging to help show the influence of heavily-doped nitrogen donors on the defect formation in SiC crystals.","Published: August 26, 2015"

The updated label also includes a new oral suspension formulation of Promacta that is designed for younger children who may not be able to swallow tablets. Promacta was approved by the FDA as a tablet formulation in June 2015 for children 6 years of age and older and in 2008 for use in adult patients with the same condition. ITP affects as many as 5 in 100,000 children each year and is characterized by a low platelet count. Chronic ITP, defined as ongoing disease more than 12 months after diagnosis, occurs in 13-36% of children with immune thrombocytopenia. A small number of pediatric patients with chronic ITP may be at risk of significant bleeding. ""It's challenging and often very emotional for parents of a baby or toddler affected by a rare condition to manage their child's disease with limited treatment options,"" said Bruno Strigini, President, Novartis Oncology. ""Today's label expansion for Promacta provides a new disease management option for families affected by chronic ITP and highlights our commitment to providing treatments for even the youngest children with rare diseases."" The label expansion of Promacta was based on data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, including the largest Phase III clinical trial in this patient population. Treatment with Promacta significantly increased and sustained platelet counts among pediatric patients with chronic ITP with an insufficient response to prior chronic ITP therapies, and some patients taking concomitant ITP medications were able to reduce or discontinue their use of these medications, primarily corticosteroids. Promacta should be used only in those whose degree of thrombocytopenia and clinical condition increase the risk for bleeding. Promacta is a once-daily oral thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that works by inducing stimulation and differentiation of megakaryocytes (large cells, found especially in bone marrow) from bone marrow stem cells to increase platelet production.","Published: August 26, 2015"

That makes amblyopia   more commonly known as ""lazy eye""   all the more obvious, but the physical manifestation of the most common cause of vision problems among children the world over is actually a brain disorder. ""Most often in amblyopia patients, one eye is better at focusing,"" says Bas Rokers, a University of Wisconsin-Madison psychology professor. ""The brain prefers the information from that eye, and pushes down the signal coming from the other, 'lazy' eye. In a way, it's better to think of the better eye as a bully, rather than the poorer eye as lazy."" As the brain develops its preference for the dominant eye's input, it alters its connections to the weaker eye, according to a study Rokers and colleagues published this week in a special edition of the journal Vision Research. ""If you continually have that bullying happening, that changes the signals coming from the lazy eye,"" Rokers says. ""We wondered, if you don't have as many signals traveling back and forth, does that come with a physical change in those passageways?"" Using a brain scanning method called diffusion-weighted imaging, the researchers mapped three sets of pathways known to carry visual information from the eyes to the brain. In people with amblyopia, the researchers saw water diffusing more easily down the brain's visual pathways. ""What we think may be happening in amblyopia is that the conductive sheath around neurons becomes thinner,"" Rokers says. ""In order to conduct information from one location to another, neurons have a sheath of material called myelin around them to insulate and speed up processing. When the myelin is thinner, there is less of it in the way and the water diffuses more easily."" This understanding of the structural effects of amblyopia may improve treatments for amblyopia and similar vision disorders in which sufferers have trouble judging distance and location of objects in parts of their visual field. The most common medical response to lazy eye is to correct the cause   most often muscular misalignment of the eyes, but sometimes a misshapen lens   through surgery, and put a patch over the amblyope's strong eye to force the brain to adapt to using the formerly lazy one. But that treatment is usually limited to children. ""You don't see any adults walking around with patched eyes, because adults' brains are less plastic, less trainable, and we think the patch approach doesn't have any effect late in life,"" says Rokers, whose group's work has been funded by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. ""But that belief is changing, and this diffusion-weighted imaging approach will help us understand whether, and how much, brain training treatments work."" It will also aid in the development of new treatments   like some Rokers and ophthalmologists are developing using video games and virtual reality headsets. ""You can put patients in the scanner and see if your treatment actually has an effect,"" Rokers says.

With 4,000 patients followed over a five-year period, the study is one of the largest and longest of its kind. It is published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association). ""Contrary to popular belief, we didn't see any benefit of omega-3 supplements for stopping cognitive decline,"" said Emily Chew, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications and deputy clinical director at the National Eye Institute, part of NIH. Dr. Chew leads the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), which was designed to investigate a combination of nutritional supplements for slowing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of vision loss among older Americans. That study established that daily high doses of certain antioxidants and minerals -- called the AREDS formulation -- can help slow the progression to advanced AMD. A later study, called AREDS2, tested the addition of omega-3 fatty acids to the AREDS formula. But the omega-3's made no difference. Omega-3 fatty acids are made by marine algae and are concentrated in fish oils; they are believed to be responsible for the health benefits associated with regularly eating fish, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut. (Other omega-3 fatty acids are found in plant foods such as flaxseed, walnuts, soy products, and canola and soybean oils, however, sSpecific omega-3 fatty acids from these sources were not studied). Where studies have surveyed people on their dietary habits and health, they've found that regular consumption of fish is associated with lower rates of AMD, cardiovascular disease, and possibly dementia. ""We've seen data that eating foods with omega-3 may have a benefit for eye, brain, and heart health,"" Dr. Chew explained. Omega-3 supplements are available over the counter and often labeled as supporting brain health. A large 2011 study found that omega-3 supplements did not improve the brain health of older patients with preexisting heart disease. With AREDS2, Dr. Chew and her team saw another opportunity to investigate the possible cognitive benefits of omega-3 supplements, she said. All participants had early or intermediate AMD. They were 72 years old on average and 58 percent were female. They were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Because all participants were at risk for worsening of their AMD, they were also offered the original or a modified version of the AREDS formulation (without omega-3 or lutein/zeaxanthin). Participants were given cognitive function tests at the beginning of the study to establish a baseline, then at two and four years later. The tests, all validated and used in previous cognitive function studies, included eight parts designed to test immediate and delayed recall, attention and memory, and processing speed. The cognition scores of each subgroup decreased to a similar extent over time, indicating that no combination of nutritional supplements made a difference. Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia and affects as many as 5.1 million Americans age 65 and older in the U.S., may triple in the next 40 years. Some research has examined the potential benefits of DHA for Alzheimer's. Studies in mice specially bred to have features of the disease found that DHA reduces beta-amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits in the brain that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's, although a clinical trial of DHA showed no impact on people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. ""The AREDS2 data add to our efforts to understand the relationship between dietary components and Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline,"" said Lenore Launer, Ph.D. senior investigator in the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Science at the National Institute on Aging. ""It may be, for example, that the timing of nutrients, or consuming them in a certain dietary pattern, has an impact.

""This is the first demonstration of naturally occurring proteins assembling chemically created polymers into complex structures that modern machinery can't duplicate,"" said Sandia National Laboratories researcher George Bachand. Sandia co-researcher Wally Paxton said, ""This is foundational science, but one possibility we see, way down the road, is to use soft artificial structures like these to painlessly interface with the body's nerve structures."" Currently, rigid electrodes that cause inflammation are used to penetrate nerve tissue trying to communicate with an artificial limb, he explained. Instead, in a future application, the polymer network could be used extend the nerve, providing a gentler prosthetic interface. Creation of the neural structure, unachievable by normal manufacturing techniques, begins by altering the behavior of kinesin motor proteins -- biological machines found in every human cell. These tiny motors normally tote material from one part of a cell to another, carrying them on what, in video graphics, is portrayed as a vertical body with two legs. These stride along protein microtubules that form the cell structure. The purposefulness of the motors resembles that of the spellbound brooms in Disney's Fantasia, relentlessly carrying buckets of water up the castle stairs. Turning natures' machinery on its head, the researchers used known techniques to glue the ""shoulders"" of kinesin motors to a glass substrate. This prevents their bodies from traveling, but their ""legs"" above them continue their vigorous movements. These pass microtubules above them, like an audience crowdsurfing entertainers on upraised hands. In the next laboratory step, these traveling protein microtubules, microns in length, encounter relatively large polymer spheres, tens of microns in diameter, inserted by the researchers. ""At that point, we have structures that want to do work -- the kinesin-powered microtubules -- and something they want to do work on -- the spheres,"" Paxton said. The microtubules, pre-coated with a sticky substance, pinch off polymer nanotubes from the sphere that lengthen as the kinesin motors travel on. The process resembles stringy strands of cheese lengthening as a piece of pizza is removed from a pan, said Paxton. As the nanotubes lengthen and crosslink, they form structures complex enough to bring to mind the lights of a city seen at night from an airplane at high altitude. The networks range from hundreds of micrometers to tens of millimeters in total size and are composed of tubes 30 to 50 nanometers in diameter. ""One goal of our work is to make an artificial, highly branched neural structure,"" said Bachand. ""The next step is, can we wire them together? The answer is, the motors should do it naturally. And two such networks, joined together, would have self-healing built into them. The motors never stop running until they run out of fuel. A neural branch breaks, and then a motor can act on that area to produce a new branch."" The insertion of quantum dots also proved stable, which means that light could be used to carry information through the structure as well as electricity.

These therapies act on a group of proteins that help regulate the expression of many genes, some of which play a role in cancer. New findings from The Rockefeller University suggest that the original version of BET inhibitors causes molecular changes in mouse neurons, and can lead to memory loss in mice that receive it. Published in Nature Neuroscience, the study was led by C. David Allis, Joy and Jack Fishman Professor in the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics, in collaboration with Robert B. Darnell, Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology. The findings will likely fuel more research into the brain effects of BET inhibitors, and could lead to the development of safer drugs that reduce the risk of potential side effects such as memory loss. First author Erica Korb, a postdoctoral fellow in Allis's lab, says the compound they tested in the study has the ability to cross into the brain from the bloodstream. However, this may not be the case for other drug variants tested in patients. Several companies are testing the inhibitors using unique formulations that they've optimized in proprietary ways--for example, by adding chemical groups to make a compound more targeted or effective--which might make it more difficult for the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier. Many patients with hard-to-treat cancers have already received these experimental drugs. The Rockefeller scientists say their findings suggests more research is needed to determine whether the therapies can enter the brain, since that could potentially cause some unwanted side effects. ""We found that if a drug blocks a BET protein throughout the body, and that drug can get into the brain, you could very well produce neurological side effects,"" says Korb. Allis, Korb and their colleagues decided to test BET inhibitors in the brain. BET proteins help regulate the process of transcribing genes into proteins, a key step in cell division. Since neurons divide less frequently than other cell types, scientists hadn't given much consideration to the role of BET proteins in the brain, says Korb. During the study, the researchers used a compound that was designed to thwart the activity of a specific BET protein, called Brd4. They used the original version of the drug, called Jq1, says Korb, which they knew could cross the blood-brain barrier. The researchers added the drug to mouse neurons grown in the laboratory, then stimulated the cells in a way that mimicked the process of memory formation. Normally, when neurons receive this type of signal, they begin transcribing genes into proteins, resulting in the formation of new memories--a process that is partly regulated by Brd4. ""To turn a recent experience into a long-term memory, you need to have gene transcription in response to these extracellular signals,"" says Korb. Indeed, when the researchers stimulated mouse neurons with signals that mimicked those they would normally receive in the brain, they saw massive changes in gene transcription. But when they performed this experiment after adding Jq1, they saw much less activity. ""After administering a Brd4 inhibitor, we no longer saw those changes in transcription after stimuli,"" says Korb. To test how the drug affected mice's memories, researchers placed the animals in a box with two objects they've never seen before, such as pieces of lego or tiny figurines. Mice typically explore anything unfamiliar, climbing and sniffing around it. After a few minutes, the researchers took the mice out of the box. One day later, they put them back in, this time with one of the objects from the day before and another, unfamiliar one. Mice that received the placebo drug were much more interested in the new object, presumably because the one from the day before was familiar. But mice treated with Jq1 were equally interested in both objects, suggesting they didn't remember the previous day's experience. Next, the researchers took their findings one step further. If Jq1 reduces molecular activity in the brain, they asked, could it help in conditions marked by too much brain activity, such as epilepsy? Brd4 regulates a receptor protein present at the synapse, a structure where two neurons connect and transmit signals. When the researchers administered the Brd4 inhibitor, they saw decreased levels of that receptor, and neurons fired much less frequently. Next, they gave the drug to mice for a week, then added a chemical that induces seizures. The experiment showed that mice that received Jq1 had a much lower rate of seizures than those given a placebo drug. ""In the case of the epileptic brain, when there's too much activity and neurons talking to each other, this drug could be potentially be beneficial,"" says Korb. ""Extending the use of these drugs into non-cancer diseases, including neurological disorders, is a largely unexplored area with much potential."" Allis adds.

The newly understood mechanism could yield insights into more precise future treatments for nerve pain and depression. The study was conducted in mice suffering from chronic neuropathic pain, a condition which is caused in mice and humans by nerve damage. Chronic neuropathic pain is often related to diabetes, infection or trauma -- and it persists even after the original source of the pain is gone. Past studies have shown that such pain often leads to depression, but brain mechanisms underlying this connection were previously unknown, as were the mechanisms by which common antidepressant drug classes -tricyclic (TCA) antidepressants or Selective Serotonin-Norepinephrine inhibitors (SNRIs) -- counter both pain and depression-related symptoms. The current study found that the molecular adaptations required for ""recovery"" from pain and depression are controlled by a gene (RGS9), and the protein it codes for, named RGS9-2. Mice that lacked the gene responsible for encoding RGS9-2 responded much earlier to very low doses of antidepressants, showed significant improvement of sensory deficits and had no signs of depression-related behaviors. The study suggests that antidepressants that target monoamines, signaling chemicals in the brain that regulate chronic pain and depression, act in the nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain's reward system, and likely through pathways that pass on messages to nerve cells through RGS9-2. ""Our data reveals that antidepressants that target specific neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly TCAs and SNRIs, regulate chronic pain and depression-related symptoms through actions in the nucleus accumbens,"" said Venetia Zachariou, PhD, Associate Professor in the Fishberg Department of Neuroscience and the Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""We don't yet know if the typical pain-processing pathways in the spinal cord and the pathways we've identified in the brain reward center are directly linked, but we now know more about the cellular pathways that need to be activated in order to achieve pain relief and that effective therapeutics must target both pathways."" In the treatment of pain, a common course is to treat patients with opioid medications, but these medications show limited effectiveness for neuropathic pain and come with safety and addiction issues. Because antidepressant medications are not addictive, they have become increasingly prescribed to treat neuropathic pain and related depression. Earlier research identified that antidepressants act in the spinal cord to control pain transmission, but little is known about their pain-controlling actions in the brain. ""We found that the molecular pathways required for recovery from neuropathic pain are controlled by RGS9-2,"" says Vasiliki Mitsi, a PhD student in the Zachariou lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""In addition, we discovered that by inhibiting RGS9-2, the function of hundreds of other molecules that are important for pain-relief and mood-elevation was boosted."" The study suggests that therapeutic treatments should target both the brain reward center as well as the previously identified pain-transmitting pathways in the spine. Insight from this study will be used to develop new targets for the treatment of this debilitating disorder. Mount Sinai Health System   press release Zachariou V et al.

This work, was led by MBI co-Principal Investigator Professor Benoit Ladoux and conducted in collaboration with scientists from the Pierre et Marie Curie University, France; the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Spain; Chronic Disease Research Centre, Portugal, the Weizmann Institute, Israel; and the Cambridge University, UK.  How tissue shape regulates wound repair mechanisms The epithelial tissue, or the epithelium, is one of four major types of tissue that lines the surfaces of all organs and hollow spaces in our body. The epithelium protects the organs from damage and maintains the body in a state of balance by allowing a selective in-and-out passage of substances. Proper function of the epithelium requires an intact layer of epithelial cells.During the lifetime of an organism, gaps or holes of different sizes and shapes are introduced into this intact epithelium. They may appear as a consequence of natural biological processes such as embryo development when cells move around and rearrange to establish body patterns, or during cell turnover in adult tissues, when dead cells are cleared away by neighbouring healthy cells. In addition, injury or disease may also lead to wounds or ulcers in the tissue. In either case, any gap in the tissue needs to be sealed so that the normal functioning of the tissue is restored. In the likelihood of an open wound or gap causing complications such as infections, inflammation or even cancer, our body has developed two major repair mechanisms whereby cells surrounding the gap collectively move in and seal the open spaces completely. To do so, cells either put forth finger-like protrusions called lamellipodia to crawl along the underlying surface or form an interconnecting belt or cable of actin filaments and myosin proteins. When this cable contracts, it pulls the cells closer in a coordinated fashion, similar to the action of drawing a purse-string. However, the extent to which either mechanism contributes to tissue repair is known to depend on several factors such as the gap geometry, gap size or the presence or absence of an underlying supporting surface. To determine the impact of tissue geometry on gap closure, the international research team studied the effects of gap shapes on gap closure mechanisms. By using microfabrication techniques to grow epithelial cells around stencils made of an inert polymer, they created gaps of desired shapes within the cell culture. The boundaries of the gap were either protruding inwards (concave edges) or were extending away (convex edges). Interestingly, the researchers noted that the speed at which cells along the gap edge moved depended on the local curvature. Specifically, they found that cells at the convex edge moved in faster than those at the concave edges. To test the relevance of their findings in a living system, the researchers studied wound repair in flies and found a similar association between wound shape and wound repair. The current study has identified a universal mechanism that explains how the geometrical properties of tissue regulate forces and guide cellular movement during physiological processes such as cell turnover, embryo development and wound healing. Cells essentially receive the instructions on how to close a gap by sensing and measuring the shape of the gap itself. Further understanding of how cells do this will help researchers know how to treat chronic medical conditions involving wounds or unsealed gaps as well as designing new substrates to optimise tissue regeneration.","Published: August 25, 2015"

Filgotinib was well tolerated in this study. Hemoglobin levels increased. These final 24-week study results are consistent with the efficacy and safety profile of filgotinib observed in prior clinical studies. With these final results, the data package for AbbVie is complete, which triggers the start of the licensing decision period. DARWIN 2 is a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of filgotinib, as once-daily administration (QD dosing) at 3 dose levels. Results were reported for 283 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who showed an inadequate response to methotrexate. Filgotinib or placebo was given as monotherapy. The patients were evaluated up to 24 weeks. The results from this study show a rapid onset of efficacy, as of week 1 for ACR and DAS28(CRP) responses. Maximum ACR20 and ACR50 responses were obtained at week 8 and week 12 respectively. Additional gain was reported for ACR70 and DAS28(CRP) during the second half of the study. In the highest dose groups, up to 50% of the patients reached low disease activity or remission. The 100 mg and 200 mg QD doses achieve similar levels of efficacy. Over all dose groups including placebo, 3.9% of patients stopped treatment during the study for safety reasons. A higher discontinuation rate for safety was observed for placebo (5.6%) during the first 12 weeks of the study compared to filgotinib treated patients (2.5%) up to week 24. Similar incidence of serious and non-serious treatment-emergent adverse events was reported, evenly spread over the dose groups including placebo. A higher rate of infections was observed in filgotinib (19% over 24 weeks) compared to placebo (10% up to week 12), with serious infections remaining limited (1.4% of filgotinib patients). No malignancies, TB, MACE, opportunistic infections, or death were reported. Consistent with its selective JAK1 inhibition, filgotinib treatment led to an improvement in hemoglobin (up to 0.4 g/dL, or 3.6% increase from baseline). Neutrophil levels remained stable after initial decline to mid-normal range at week 4. There was no impact on lymphocytes or liver function tests. The similar increases in LDL and HDL were maintained. ""The DARWIN 2 24-week data clearly show the efficacy of this compound in rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the safety profile is quite notable. The increase in hemoglobin and lack of lymphocyte reduction suggest that there can be differentiation of various safety signals among different JAK inhibitors,"" said Professor Arthur Kavanaugh, MD, Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine, and Principal Investigator for DARWIN 2. ""These final 24-week monotherapy data of DARWIN 2 confirm previous results and we believe these support the best-in-class potential of filgotinib, our oral, once a day, JAK1 selective treatment in RA,"" said Dr Piet Wigerinck, Chief Scientific Officer of Galapagos.

This study shows that we re moving in the right direction for a universal flu vaccine,  said Ian Wilson, Hansen Professor of Structural Biology and chair of the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at TSRI.The study was part of TSRI s long-term collaboration to strengthen research against infectious disease with the former Crucell Vaccine Institute, now known as Janssen Prevention Center and headquartered in Leiden, the Netherlands. The Need for Better Flu Shots Seasonal flu typically causes more than 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths every year in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While a yearly flu shot provides some protection, subtypes not covered by the vaccine can emerge rapidly. This phenomenon was evident in the 2009 spread of the H1N1 ( swine flu ) subtype that killed an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 people worldwide. In the last decade, several studies from TSRI, Janssen and other institutions have shown that some people are capable of making powerful antibodies that can fight many subtypes of influenza at once by targeting a site on the influenza virus that does not mutate rapidly. Unfortunately, these  broadly neutralizing antibodies,  or bnAbs, are rare. Still, the tantalizing existence of broadly neutralizing antibodies led Janssen and TRSI to try creating an influenza vaccine specially designed to elicit them. Researchers zeroed in on a possible target: a protein on the surface of influenza, called hemagglutinin (HA). HA is present on all subtypes of influenza, providing the key viral  machinery  that enables the virus to enter cells. Most importantly, the long  stem  region of HA, which connects the virus to cells, plays such a crucial role that mutations at the site are unlikely to be passed on.  If the body can make an immune response against the HA stem, it s difficult for the virus to escape,  Wilson explained. Fighting  Bird Flu  and Other Strains To create antibodies against the HA stem, the research team looked to influenza s own structure, specifically the universal recognition site of the broadly protective antibody CR9114 in the HA stem (described by Dreyfus et al., Science 2012). This vaccine candidate was designed, produced and tested by a team of scientists led by Jaap Goudsmit, head of the Janssen Prevention Center, the paper s first author Antonietta Impagliazzo (responsible for the design) and co-senior author Katarina Rado evi . The effort represents the first time scientists have been able to cut off the variable head region of HA, designing features able to stabilize the conformation of the original protein, and at the same time faithfully mimicking the key broadly neutralizing site. The ultimate goal was to use this synthetic version of the HA stem in a vaccine to teach the body to make powerful antibodies against influenza virus, priming it to fight off a variety of flu strains. The scientists then studied the response of rodent and nonhuman primate models given one of several candidate immunogens. They found that animals given one especially stable immunogen produced antibodies that could bind with HAs in many influenza subtypes, even neutralizing H5N1 viruses ( avian  or  bird  flu).  This was the proof of principle,  said Wilson.  These tests showed that antibodies elicited against one influenza subtype could protect against a different subtype.  Scientists at TSRI studied the structure of the immunogen at every point in the process. Using the imaging techniques of electron microscopy (led by TSRI Associate Professor Andrew Ward and postdoctoral fellow Ryan Hoffman) and x-ray crystallography (led by Wilson and TSRI Staff Scientist Xueyong Zhu), the team showed that the most promising candidate immunogen mimicked the HA stem and that antibodies could bind with the immunogen just as they would with a real virus. With proof that an immunogen can elicit antibodies against the stem region, Wilson said the next step in this research is to see if the immunogen can do the same in humans.  While there is more work to be done, the ultimate goal, of course, would be to create a life-long vaccine,  Wilson said.","Published: August 25, 2015"

Use green fluorescent protein, or GFP, and the cells will light up. Want to turn that gene on or off in an organism? You might use an enzyme called Cre recombinase. Want to turn a gene on or off only in one cell type? That s tough. But the job just got a lot easier: Harvard Medical School researchers have found a way to combine GFP and Cre. The new tool, called  Cre dependent on GFP  or Cre-DOG for short, piggybacks Cre onto GFP so researchers can not only look at but also manipulate genes in GFP-expressing cells while leaving other cells alone. In one step you can go from just looking at a cell to asking something about its physiology, its circuitry and its anatomy. That s very powerful,  said Connie Cepko, the Bullard Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience at HMS and senior author of the study. Over a thousand transgenic mouse lines have been engineered to express GFP in particular kinds of cells, while there are far fewer Cre lines. Cre-DOG allows researchers to skip the laborious creation of Cre lines by doing more with existing GFP lines.  It opens up genetic manipulations in a much larger number of specific cell types and saves a huge amount of time and money,  said Cepko.  The more we know about how cells function, the better we can understand disease and development, allowing us to design more effective therapies.   In our lab we have a lot of mouse lines that express GFP, but so far, we only use them for anatomical studies. Now we can use them to study circuit function and development in the brain, define the roles of subpopulations of neurons within a circuit and study which neurotransmitters they release,  said Stephanie Rudolph, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of HMS neurobiologist Wade Regehr and second author of the paper. Cre-DOG was the brainchild of Jonathan C.Y. Tang, a postdoctoral researcher in the Cepko lab and first author of the paper. Tang split the Cre enzyme in two, which inactivated it. He attached each half to a portion of a GFP antibody that had recently been generated through the immunization of camels. When the Cre-and-antibody fragments are introduced into cells that don t express GFP, they float around and don t do much. But when they re added to cells that do express GFP, the antibodies latch onto GFP and the Cre halves reunite. The newly activated Cre then turns the desired gene on or off. Cre-DOG expanded on a similar tool that Tang and colleagues reported in 2013. That tool requires an extra component to generate Cre activity and may be more toxic than Cre-DOG. Both tools have their advantages, the authors said, and researchers might want to use one over the other depending on their project. One perk of Cre-DOG is that the Cre-and-antibody molecules can be injected using adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs, a tool many researchers already use.  From the standpoint of a mentor, it s really wonderful to see a student come in with a very cool and clever idea and bring it to fruition,  said Cepko.  There is also pleasure in making tools that move all of us forward.  Tang and Cepko collaborated with researchers at HMS, including the Regehr lab and the lab of David Ginty in the Department of Neurobiology, as well as scientists at the University of California, San Diego, to test Cre-DOG in different kinds of cells. They were able to show that it works in the retina, the cortex and the spinal cord.  I think every human being wants to understand how the brain works,  added Tang.  We are at the forefront of that endeavor, but we still don t have all the tools. This work expands our arsenal of genetic tools to study that question. ","Published: August 25, 2015"

While efforts to combat the obesity epidemic will need to include changes in diet and exercise, insights into the genes involved may also help with prevention and treatment. Now a research team led by Harvard Medical School investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and MIT reveals the mechanistic explanation behind the strongest genetic association with obesity.  The findings uncover a genetic circuit that controls whether our bodies burn or store fat. Manipulating that genetic circuit may offer a new approach for obesity treatments. The strongest genetic association with obesity lies within an unexpressed region of the FTO gene and contains 89 common variants in a region of 47,000 nucelotides. The obesity-risk version of the region that predisposes individuals to increased body weight is found in 44 percent of individuals in European populations, but its mechanistic basis has until now remained unknown, despite extensive investigation. Assessing epigenetic modifications To identify the cell types in which the FTO obesity-risk region might exert its effects, the researchers analyzed information from the Roadmap Epigenomics project, which assesses chemical or  epigenetic  modifications within chromosomes that switch genes on or off. The project s data revealed that the strongest epigenetic signal was found in  preadipocyte  cells, the progenitor cells that go on to become fat cells. Previous studies attempted to uncover a link between FTO and the regulation of appetite or propensity to exercise controlled by the brain,  said the study s lead and corresponding author Melina Claussnitzer, an HMS instructor in medicine and an investigator in the Division of Gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess and Hebrew SeniorLife, a visiting professor at MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and member of the Broad Institute.  But an unbiased look across more than one hundred human tissues and cell types indicated that the obesity-associated region acts primarily in adipocyte progenitor cells not the brain,  she said. The researchers collected fat, or adipose, tissue samples from individuals who carried the genetic obesity risk variant and compared it with tissue samples of individuals who did not carry the variant; they found increased expression of two distant genes, IRX3 and IRX5, indicating that these genes are under genetic control by the obesity risk variant.  Despite years of investigating the FTO obesity region, no substantial expression differences were found between obesity-risk and non-risk individuals in brain or other tissue types, making it difficult to trace its mechanism of action,  said Manolis Kellis, professor at MIT s CSAIL.  We found a strong difference for both IRX3 and IRX5 in preadipocytes, revealing the target genes, cell type and developmental stage where the genetic variant acts, thus enabling us to begin dissecting its mechanism of action,  said Kellis. Manipulating the pathways Elevated expression of these genes resulted in a shift from energy-burning beige fat cells to energy-storing white fat cells. The researchers showed that they could manipulate this new pathway to reverse the signatures of obesity.  By altering the expression of either gene in human preadipoctyes, we could alter adipocyte metabolism between energy storage and energy dissipation, providing a direct link between IRX3 and IRX5 expression and energy balance,  said Kellis. To evaluate the effect of IRX3 inhibition on whole-body energy metabolism and body weight, the team inhibited the corresponding gene in the fat cells of mice. The animals  metabolism increased and they lost weight, even though their physical activity and appetite were unchanged.  The results at the organism level were dramatic,  said Claussnitzer.  These mice were 50 percent thinner than the control mice, and they did not gain any weight on a high-fat diet. Instead they dissipated more energy, even in their sleep, suggesting a dramatic shift in their global metabolism. The circuitry underlying the FTO region functions like a master regulatory switch between energy storage and energy dissipation,  she said. The researchers then sought to connect these differences in metabolism and gene expression to the genetic differences between lean and obese people within the FTO gene. They predicted that the specific T-to-C single-nucleotide alteration within FTO is responsible for the obesity association by repressing an evolutionarily conserved gene regulator called ARID5B. Loss of repression turns on IRX3 and IRX5 during early adipocyte differentiation, leading to a shift from beige adipocyte functions and thermogenesis, or energy burning, to white adipocyte lipid accumulation.  We could narrow down a genetic region spanning 47,000 nucleotides to reveal a single-nucleotide alteration, and explain precisely how it leads to loss of repressor binding, activation of a regulatory region, gain of distal gene expression, a change in adipocyte metabolism, and ultimately, obesity at the organism level,  explained Claussnitzer. Noncoding variants  This can serve as a model for understanding the mechanistic basis of other non-coding variants in other diseases and traits. Noncoding variants make up more than 90 percent of top-scoring variants that have emerged from genome-wide association studies, which find association between genetic variants and disease risk, she said.  Using the genome editing technique known as CRISPR/Cas9, the team found that switching the risk variant to the protective variant in preadipocytes turned off IRX3 and IRX5and restored thermogenesis, while the reverse change turned on IRX3 and IRX5 and turned off thermogenesis.  Bidirectional genome editing of the causal nucleotide variant allowed us to demonstrate that a single nucleotide is responsible for flipping this metabolic switch between obese and lean individuals,  said Claussnitzer.  This is the first time that causality has been demonstrated for a genetic variant in a distal non-coding region, but we hope it will be the first of many such studies to come, now that genome editing is becoming broadly adopted,  she added.","Published: August 25, 2015"

MutL puts a nick in the newly synthesized DNA strand to mark it as defective and signals a different protein to gobble up the portion of the DNA containing the error. Then the nucleotide matching starts over, filling the gap again. The entire process reduces replication errors around a thousand fold, serving as our body s best defense against genetic mutations and the problems that can arise from them, like cancer. Every living thing uses this process for DNA replication and repair, and we know what the components are, but there are some key mechanisms that aren t well understood,  says Keith Weninger, professor of physics at NC State and co-author of a paper describing the research.  For example, when the DNA is repaired, it only happens on the new portion of the DNA strand, and not the older template. And the proteins know which way to move along the strand in order to get rid of the defective portion. There s communication happening here, but disagreement about how it works.  Scientists know that a protein called PCNA plays an important role in this communication. PCNA sits at the site of a DNA split, and its physical orientation at that site indicates which part of a DNA strand is new. This is called a strand discrimination signal. Somehow, MutS and MutL interact with that signal, allowing MutL to nick the strand in the proper place and indicate need for repair. Scientists have three models for this communication: MutS and MutL combine to form a clamp that slides toward PCNA to interact with the signal, marking the area they slide along for deletion; or they make a fold in the DNA and  pull  the PCNA toward them to the same effect; or MutL somehow coats the defective area, signaling for repair that way. Weninger, along with co-author Dorothy Erie from UNC-Chapel Hill, set out to determine the most likely method of communication. Using single molecule fluorescence methods, which allowed the researchers to watch one protein moving on one piece of DNA at a time, they determined that when MutS finds an error, it changes shape in a way that allows MutL to bind with it, holding it in place at the site of the mismatch. MutL then changes its shape to  grab  another MutL, and so on, coating the defective part of the strand and nicking the area that needs repair. In other words, Weninger, Erie and their colleagues found that the third model was the correct one.  This system is essential to keeping the genome stable,  says Weninger.  We know all the players and the beginning and end of the process, but this work fills in one of the middle steps that was completely unknown and very different from what some have imagined.  We also know that mutations in MutS and MutL are associated with very specific cancers,  he continues.  But if we re going to figure out how defects lead to disease, we first must understand how these proteins normally do their job. This research is another step toward that understanding.

At The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) scientists have been working to develop new forms of these drugs, including an antibiotic called arylomycin but tests have shown that it is possible for bacteria to become resistant to arylomycin, too.  This explains why antibiotic resistance rates in some bacteria are higher than in others,  said TSRI Professor Floyd Romesberg, senior author of the new study.  Resistance depends on this little set of genes that no one knew could contribute to tolerating the arylomycins.  The Not-So-Essential Protein Arylomycin antibiotics usually stop bacteria from growing by inhibiting a protein called Type I signal peptidase (SPase), long known as an  essential  protein because scientists thought bacteria could not live without it. SPase s job is to clip peptide sequences off proteins as the proteins pass from the inside of a cell to the outside to perform functions such as nutrient acquisition. Without this cleaving of the peptide  postal codes,  these crucial proteins cannot reach the outside of the cell and instead accumulate in the membrane and the bacterium dies. At least, that s what scientists thought until studies in the Romesberg lab at TSRI showed that some bacteria survived even when an arylomycin targeted and inhibited SPase. To the researchers  surprise, they found that S. aureus could survive after they deleted the gene to produce SPase altogether.  We did not believe it,  said Romesberg.  No one would have believed SPase was not essential. If you take the wheels off a car it s not going to drive.  Their next step was to figure out how S. aureus survived without SPase.  There had to be an answer,  said Arryn Craney, a TSRI research associate and first author of the new study. Unlocking Resistance Using DNA sequencing technology, the researchers identified a group of genes that work together to fill in for SPase. They found that, in the absence of SPase, a protein called AyrR switches these genes on to produce proteins called AyrA and AyrBC, which can also cleave off the peptide postal-code sequences. The scientists believe this work-around may have evolved to help bacteria at times when protein secretion levels are high and SPase can t do the job alone.  We took it for granted that we knew all the steps of protein secretion,  said Craney.  Now we ve found a way to bypass SPase.  Romesberg said this discovery shows the built-in redundancies that help bacteria survive in many environments. He said the next step in this research is to figure out how the AyrA- and AyrBC-producing genes are switched on in the first place.  Trafficking proteins through a cell is also very important for human cells,  said Romesberg.  All forms of life have to secrete proteins, so discovering this new step in protein secretion has important implications. ","Published: August 25, 2015"

The collaboration will evaluate Peregrine's investigational phosphatidylserine (PS)-signaling pathway inhibitor, bavituximab, in combination with AstraZeneca's investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab (MEDI4736).  The planned Phase I/Ib trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of bavituximab in combination with durvalumab in multiple solid tumors. Peregrine and AstraZeneca will collaborate on a non-exclusive basis, to evaluate the combination of bavituximab and durvalumab with chemotherapy as a potential treatment in various solid tumors. The Phase I part of the trial is expected to establish a recommended dose regimen for the combination and the Phase Ib part of the trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational combination. Under the terms of the agreement, the initial trial will be conducted by Peregrine. Robert Iannone, Head of Immuno-Oncology, Global Medicines Development, at AstraZeneca said, ""We believe that combination therapy in immuno-oncology has the potential to be a novel and highly effective approach to treating cancer. Our partnership with Peregrine provides the opportunity to explore an exciting, novel combination that could deliver important clinical benefit to patients across a range of cancers."" Bavituximab and durvalumab are investigational immunotherapies with different mechanisms that assist the body's immune system in fighting cancer. Bavituximab targets and modulates the activity of phosphatidylserine, a highly immune-suppressive molecule expressed broadly on the surface of cells in the tumor microenvironment.  The treatment increases activated T-cells in tumors and fights cancer by reversing the immunosuppressive environment that many tumors establish in order to proliferate.  MEDI4736 is a monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1).  Signals from PD-L1 help tumors avoid detection by the immune system. Preclinical data have demonstrated that combining the enhanced T-cell mediated anti-tumor activity of bavituximab with checkpoint inhibitors, like PD-L1 antibodies, prolong the ability of tumor-specific T-cells to continue attacking the tumor.   ""Data generated to date have shown significant potential for combining bavituximab with agents targeting the PD-1/PDL-1 pathway and we're excited to further explore this approach in studies with AstraZeneca's durvalumab,"" said Steven W. King, president and chief executive officer of Peregrine.

These shared gene sites may reveal potential new targets for treating many of these diseases, in some cases with existing drugs already available for non-autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, collectively affect 7 to 10 percent of the population in the Western Hemisphere. ""Our approach did more than finding genetic associations among a group of diseases,"" said study leader, Hakon Hakonarson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Applied Genomics at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). ""We identified genes with a biological relevance to these diseases, acting along gene networks and pathways that may offer very useful targets for therapy.""The international study team performed a meta-analysis, including a case-control study of 6,035 subjects with automimmune disease and 10,700 controls, all of European ancestry. The study's lead analyst, Yun (Rose) Li, an M.D./Ph.D. graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania and the Center for Applied Genomics, mentored by Hakonarson and his research team, applied highly innovative and integrative approaches in supporting the study of pathogenic roles of the genes uncovered across multiple diseases. The research encompassed 10 clinically distinct autoimmune diseases with onset during childhood: type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, common variable immunodeficiency disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, autoimmune thyroiditis and ankylosing spondylitis. Because many of these diseases run in families and because individual patients often have more than one autoimmune condition, clinicians have long suspected these conditions have shared genetic predispositions. Previous genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of susceptibility genes among autoimmune diseases, largely affecting adults. The current research was a systematic analysis of multiple pediatric-onset diseases simultaneously. The study team found 27 genome-wide loci, including five novel loci, among the diseases examined. Of those 27 signals, 22 were shared by at least two of the autoimmune diseases, and 19 of them were shared by at least three of them. Many of the gene signals the investigators discovered were on biological pathways functionally linked to cell activation, cell proliferation and signaling systems important in immune processes. One of the five novel signals, near the CD40LG gene, was especially compelling, said Hakonarson, who added, ""That gene encodes the ligand for the CD40 receptor, which is associated with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. This ligand may represent another promising drug target in treating these diseases."" Many of the 27 gene signals the investigators uncovered have a biological relevance to autoimmune disease processes, Hakonarson said. ""Rather than looking at overall gene expression in all cells, we focused on how these genes upregulated gene expression in specific cell types and tissues, and found patterns that were directly relevant to specific diseases. For instance, among several of the diseases, we saw genes with stronger expression in B cells. Looking at diseases such as lupus or juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which feature dysfunctions in B cells, we can start to design therapies to dial down over-expression in those cells."" He added that ""the level of granularity the study team uncovered offers opportunities for researchers to better target gene networks and pathways in specific autoimmune diseases, and perhaps to fine tune and expedite drug development by repurposing existing drugs, based on our findings.""","Published: August 25, 2015"

""It's hard to overestimate the importance of high-quality sleep,"" said Diana Grigsby-Toussaint, a U of I professor of kinesiology and community health and a faculty member in the U of I's Division of Nutritional Sciences. ""Studies show that inadequate sleep is associated with declines in mental and physical health, reduced cognitive function, and increased obesity. This new study shows that exposure to a natural environment may help people get the sleep they need."" In the study, Grigsby-Toussaint worked with both U of I researchers and scientists from the New York University School of Medicine. The team used data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveyed 255,171 representative U.S. adults, to learn whether there was an association between self-reported days of insufficient sleep and access to green space. The team also used a USDA index that scores the country's geographical areas for their natural amenities, using hours of sunlight, which is important in regulating a person's circadian rhythm, and temperature. In response to the survey question about sleep quality in the last month, the researchers found that the most common answer was that respondents had slept poorly for less than one week. ""Interestingly, though, across the entire sample, individuals reporting 21 to 29 days of insufficient sleep consistently had lower odds of access to green space and natural amenities compared to those reporting less than one week,"" she said. For men, the relationship between sleep and exposure to green space was much stronger than for women. And males and females 65 and over found nature to be a potent sleep aid, she added. Grigsby-Toussaint noted that living near green landscapes is associated with higher levels of physical activity and that exercise in turn predicts beneficial sleep patterns. But men appeared to benefit much more from their natural surroundings. The researcher speculated that women may take less advantage of nearby natural settings out of concern for their safety, but she added that more research is needed. The finding should be a boon for people who are having trouble sleeping as they age. ""If there is a way for persons over 65 to spend time in nature, it would improve the quality of their sleep--and their quality of life--if they did so,"" Grigsby-Toussaint said. The study points to the importance of conserving nature in general, she added. ""And, specifically, our results provide an incentive for nursing homes and communities with many retired residents to design buildings with more lighting, create nature trails and dedicated garden spaces, and provide safe outdoor areas that encourage outdoor activity for men and women,"" she said.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/researchers-find-inaccuracies-head-impact-sensors-283523,Researchers find inaccuracies in head impact sensors With increasing concern about concussions from sports  some players have started wearing electronic sensors to measure head impacts  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. With increasing concern about concussions from sports, some players have started wearing electronic sensors to measure head impacts. But a new study by Washington State University (WSU) researchers has found that some of the sensors for non-helmeted sports are not fast enough to measure hard hits and don't accurately measure what are thought to be the most serious, angular hits. They report on their work online in the journal Procedia Engineering. ""Concussions are a really challenging problem,'' said Lloyd Smith, professor in the Voiland College's School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and director of WSU's Sports Science Laboratory. ""What we're worried about is what's going on with the brain, but we don't have brain sensors that we can plug into. The closest thing is to see what is happening to the skull. That's what these sensors are trying to do. ""The message is that you have to be careful with these sensors,"" he said. ""They may not work for every type of impact.'' The laboratory is the official baseball bat-testing facility for the NCAA and one of the premier labs in the nation for exploring the physics of bats, balls and, recently, the interplay of balls and the human head. Most head-impact sensors have been developed within the past five years, and many college-level football teams have their players wear them. When a player receives a hard hit, the sensor records it and alerts trainers. Researchers are also using data they're collecting from the sensors to improve their understanding about sports-related head trauma. They have found that the helmeted sensors accurately measure hits. Less commonly used are non-helmeted wireless sensors, which are affixed to headbands, mouth guards, adhesive patches or within an earpiece that the player can wear for sports like soccer, women's lacrosse or softball. In the study, the researchers attached the non-helmeted sensor to a head dummy. Using a pneumatic cannon, they fired lacrosse balls, soccer balls and softballs at it at different speeds. The researchers equipped the dummy with high-fidelity, wired accelerometers to collect data for comparison with feedback from the small, battery-powered sensor. The researchers recorded 234 impacts, directing the balls at the dummy's chin and forehead. Ball speeds were similar to those found in game conditions, although the softball was projected at speeds slower than seen in fast-pitch competition to avoid damaging the dummy. The soccer ball was only directed at the forehead. The researchers found that the non-helmeted sensors aren't able to accurately measure harder and faster hits, such as an impact from a hard-thrown softball. To measure the impact from a ball, the devices take a lot of measurements in rapid succession. The sensors were able to accurately see the hits from the softer, slower balls, but they couldn't take data fast enough to keep up with the faster hits. When the impact is harder, the sensor missed the peak acceleration, which would have the highest potential for causing a concussion. ""The harder the ball, the less correlation we found,'' Smith said. The researchers also found that the sensors did worse at measuring rotational than linear acceleration. Earlier work has found that most head injuries from sports come about from a hit that twists the head rather than a direct hit. The researchers used a sensor with hardware specifications representative of most sensors of its kind. They are working with the sensor manufacturer and hope to do more studies that could lead to improvements. The manufacturer had no say in the study design or the interpretation of results. ""These sensors are one element in many ways to make sports safer,'' said Smith. ""I'm optimistic that people are taking these injuries more seriously, and I think it's really encouraging in helping us better understand the effects and causes of concussions.''

The causes are not fully understood and there may be both physiological and psychological components to the condition. In a new study published in Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, researchers report that repetitive sacral root magnetic stimulation (rSMS) can reduce the frequency of nighttime bedwetting and improve quality-of-life for sufferers. In a study conducted by researchers at the Assiut University Hospital, Assiut, Egypt, 41 patients experiencing nocturnal enuresis were divided into two groups receiving either real magnetic stimulation or a sham stimulation using the same equipment and procedures. The identities of the real vs. sham patients were unknown to both the researchers and the patients. Each participant received 10 sessions, five per week. A magnetic stimulator was placed over the sacral vertebrae in the lower back and 15 Hz pulses were applied for 10 seconds on and 30 seconds off. For the sham procedure, the stimulator was internally adjusted so that little magnetic stimulation could reach the underlying tissue. All patients had been taking the tricyclic antidepressant drug imipramine (25mg once at night /day) for at least three months without satisfactory results and they continued taking their prescribed medication throughout the study. ""It seems likely that rSMS produced some of its effect in the present patients by a direct effect on bladder control,"" explained lead investigator Eman M. Khedr, MD, Professor, Department of Neurology, Assiut University Hospital. ""In the present study rSMS could have increased arousal or enhanced inhibition of neuronal re-uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin. We have previously reported that patients with nocturnal enuresis have pathologically increased excitability and reduced inhibitory processing in the motor cortex and it is possible that rSMS could affect these measures as well."" The average number of weekly nocturnal bedwetting episodes fell from 5.7 to 0.3 per week after the end of the treatment sessions for the real group compared to 6.5 to 1.8 per week after sham stimulation. Although the sham procedure resulted in improvement (placebo effect), the improvement in the real group continued one month later (1 per week) whereas the sham group returned to baseline behaviour (5.2 per week). All patients were asked to complete a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and a generic Health Survey (SF-36v2). The VAS assesses how bedwetting affects the patient's life, while the Health Survey measures physical health and mental well-being in eight different health domains. This treatment resulted in significant improvements in the mental health scores including social functioning, vitality, mental health, and component mental health summation in the real group compared to the sham group. While further trials will be needed to determine the optimum stimulation protocols, the potential benefits to young patients and their caregivers are clear.

The researchers used a specifically tailored hydrogel to  scaffold  and control an implant containing stem cells to form a functional brown-fat-like tissue. While white fat   the kind associated with obesity   stores excess energy, brown fat serves as a heat generator, burning calories as it does its job.  What is truly exciting about this system is its potential to provide plentiful supplies of brown fat for therapeutic purposes,  said study lead author Kevin Tharp, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology.  The implant is made from the stem cells that reside in white fat, which could be made from tissue obtained through liposuction. Human babies, which cannot yet produce heat by shivering, have greater stores of brown fat, so-called because it contains high levels of darker-hued mitochondria. It was once believed that brown fat disappears with age, but in recent years, this tissue has been discovered in the neck, shoulders, and spinal cord among adults.  This is figuratively and literally a hot area of research right now,  said the study s senior author, Andreas Stahl, an associate professor of nutritional sciences and toxicology.  We are the first to implant in mice an artificial brown-fat depot and show that it has the expected effects on body temperature and beneficial effects on metabolism.  Studies have shown that cold temperatures can bump up activity in brown fat. Stahl noted, however, that the exposure to cold often led to increases in food intake, as well, potentially negating any calorie-burning benefits from brown-fat activity.Get the fat, not the cold There are three basic types of fat tissue in our bodies. There is the classic, energy-storing white fat that many of us are most familiar with, and two kinds of energy-burning fat used to generate heat, namely brown fat, which arises during fetal development, and beige fat, which is brown-like fat formed within white fat tissue after exposure to cold and other situations. This UC Berkeley experiment explored the idea of increasing brown-like beige fat without the temperature drop. Stahl teamed up with Kevin Healy, UC Berkeley professor of bioengineering, and postdoctoral researcher Amit Jha to develop a system of physical cues to guide stem cell differentiation.  It s already known that for a number of organs, including the heart, the extracellular matrix in which a cell resides provides signals to guide growth and development,  said Healy, who also has an appointment in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.  We applied this concept to stem cells isolated from white-fat tissue.  The specific matrix recipe for converting white-fat stem cells to brown fat had been unclear, the researchers said, but they noted that previous studies suggested that stiffness of the surrounding environment was a factor. White-fat stem cells placed in a 3D environment that is soft, with little resistance as the cell grows, became fat. When the surrounding environment was very stiff, the stem cells grew into bone. Injected brown fat reduces weight gain, glucose The researchers created a tightly knit 3D mesh in a hydrogel containing water, hyaluronic acid and short protein sequences associated with brown-fat growth and function. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring carbohydrate that helps make water thicker and gel-like. They then took white-fat stem cells from mice genetically engineered to express an enzyme from fireflies. This made the cells luminescent, allowing the researchers to track them more easily. The researchers then added the cells to the hydrogel and, before the mixture thickened, injected them under the skin of genetically identical mice. The gel polymerizes after injection and completes its transformation in the animal. The researchers monitored the glowing cells after injection to determine how well they stayed put, how long they persisted in the body and whether they were metabolically functional. They noticed an increase in the core body temperature of the mice at ambient temperatures of 21 degrees Celsius and after 24 hours at a chilly 4 degrees Celsius. In both cases, the mice with the implanted cells were up to half a degree Celsius warmer than a control group of mice with no injection. The higher the concentration of cells, the larger the effect on temperature. The researchers also put the experimental mice on a high-fat diet. By the end of three weeks, the mice with injected beige fat gained half as much weight and had lower levels of blood glucose and circulating fatty acids compared with control mice.  This is a feasibility study, but the results were very encouraging,  said Stahl.  It is the first time an optimized 3D environment has been created to stimulate the growth of brown-like fat. Given the negative health effects of obesity, research into the role of brown fat should continue to see if these findings would be effective in humans. ","Published: August 24, 2015"

Vemurafenib previously has been proven to treat BRAFV600-mutated melanoma. People with lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers were among those included in the study as well as people with rare diseases, such as Erdheim-Chester disease. Until this point, the efficacy of vemurafenib in nonmelanoma cancers has remained unexplored despite significant therapeutic potential.  This study is the first deliverable of precision medicine. We have proven that histology-independent, biomarker-selected basket studies are feasible and can serve as a tool for developing molecularly targeted cancer therapy,  said Dr. Baselga, the study s senior author.  While we can   and should   be cautiously optimistic, this is what the future of precision medicine looks like.  Basket studies permit the detection of early signals of activity across multiple tumor types simultaneously, while allowing for the possibility that tumor lineage might influence drug sensitivity. The first to follow this model, this new study aims to explore treatment responses among tumors based on their mutation types and to identify promising signals of activity in individual tumor types that could be pursued in subsequent studies. The results will ultimately guide researchers in looking for different drug targets or developing therapies that combine vemurafenib with complementary treatments. Basket studies also have the ability to greatly increase the number of patients eligible to receive certain drugs. The mixed efficacy seen in this study proves that drugs can reach patients beyond the current approved use but, expectedly, do not work for everyone. As a pioneering trial, this data demonstrates the promising benefits of basket studies and the need for more work to be done with these types of trials. The findings illustrate the preliminary clinical efficacy of vemurafenib in multiple nonmelanoma BRAFV600-mutated cancers. Of the 122 trial participants, clinical activity was observed in various tumor types. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small cell lung cancer as well as Erdheim-Chester disease and Langherhans cell histiocytosis. Response rate and median progression-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer was 42 percent and 7.3 months, respectively. In Erdheim-Chester disease and Langherhans cell histiocytosis, response rate was 43 percent; despite median treatment duration of 5.9 months, no patients progressed during therapy. Anecdotal responses were seen in anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary duct cancer, ovarian cancer, clear cell sarcoma, and colorectal cancer (cetuximab combination only).  This kind of study is a beneficial way to do rare tumor research because it allows us to open the study to patients with diseases that are completely underrepresented in clinical trials in general, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer and glioblastoma,  said David Hyman, MD, the study s first author and Acting Director of Developmental Therapeutics at MSK.  By broadening eligibility, we are translating potential benefits to as large a patient population as possible.  This clinical trial is the first in an impending wave of such studies focused on cancer-related mutations identified through the huge amounts of genomic data generated in recent years. It highlights the importance of further investigation into precision medicine, a promising area that has recently received attention from President Obama and the National Cancer Institute, among others. Last May, MSK launched an initiative in this space   the Marie-Jos e and Henry R. Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology   that works to transform cancer care through genomic analysis of patient-derived tumors. Currently the center is analyzing 410 of the most important cancer genes in thousands of patients.  We now have the landscape of all the most frequent cancer-causing mutations in the majority of tumor types, and we know there are a number of genes that are frequently mutated in some tumors and less frequently in others,  explained Dr. Baselga.  The next step is exploring appropriate drug combinations, knowing that these cells have a finite number of pathways. ","Published: August 24, 2015"

Sprout also has global rights for flibanserin. Valeant will leverage its global scale to register flibanserin internationally. Sprout is passionate about women's sexual health and has focused solely on the delivery of a treatment option for the unmet need of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) as characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is not due to a co-existing medical or psychiatric condition, problems within the relationship, or the effects of a medication or other drug substance.   Addyi is not indicated for use in postmenopausal women or men or to enhance sexual function. Addyi was approved with a Boxed Warning. Use of Addyi with alcohol increases the risk of severe hypotension and syncope; therefore, alcohol use is contraindicated.  Severe hypotension and syncope occurs when Addyi is used with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore use of Addyi in patients with hepatic impairment is also contraindicated.  Hypotension, syncope and central nervous system (CNS) depression can occur with Addyi alone. The most common adverse reactions are dizziness, somnolence, nausea, fatigue, insomnia and dry mouth. Valeant expects Addyi to be available in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 through prescribers and pharmacies that have been certified under the U.S. FDA's comprehensive Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to assure safe use. Following the closing of the transaction, Valeant, under the REMS, will offer physicians and pharmacists the required certification programs for prescribing and dispensing Addyi.  Following the closing of the acquisition, Sprout will remain headquartered in Raleigh, N.C. and become a division of Valeant.Cindy Whitehead, Chief Executive Officer of Sprout, will join Valeant to lead this division dedicated to the introduction and global commercialization of Addyi, reporting to Anne Whitaker, Executive Vice President and Company Group Chairman. Valeant's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Michael Pearson, said, ""Delivering a first-ever treatment for a commonly reported form of female sexual dysfunction gives us the perfect opportunity to establish a new portfolio of important medications that uniquely impact women. We applaud the efforts of the Sprout team to address this important area of unmet need and look forward to working with them to bring the benefits of Addyi to additional markets around the world.""  Sprout Chief Executive Officer, Cindy Whitehead, said, ""I am extremely proud of the commitment and passion of our 34 employees who have been mission driven to get to this breakthrough first for women.  This partnership with Valeant allows us the capacity to now ensure broader, more affordable access to all the women who have been waiting for this treatment.  Beyond building this in the United States, Valeant also offers us a global footprint that could eventually bring Addyi to women across the globe."" ""The Valeant team is excited to be a part of the launch of this critically important treatment for women, and I am personally delighted to welcome Cindy and her colleagues at Sprout to Valeant,"" added Anne Whitaker, Executive Vice President and Company Group Chairman.  ""The Sprout team, along with the healthcare providers involved in the Addyi pivotal clinical trials, has delivered on its promise to provide access to a safe and effective treatment for a condition that affects millions of women."" Under terms of the acquisition agreement, Valeant will pay approximately $500 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, upon the closing of the transaction and an additional payment in the amount of $500 million, payable in the first quarter of 2016, plus a share of future profits based upon the achievement of certain milestones.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/why-were-smarter-than-chickens-214026,Why We re Smarter Than Chickens Toronto researchers have discovered that a single molecular event in our cells could hold the key to how we evolved to become the smartest animal on the planet  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Benjamin Blencowe, a professor in the University of Toronto s Donnelly Centre and Banbury Chair in Medical Research, and his team have uncovered how a small change in a protein called PTBP1 can spur the creation of neurons   cells that make the brain   that could have fuelled the evolution of mammalian brains to become the largest and most complex among vertebrates. Brain size and complexity vary enormously across vertebrates, but it is not clear how these differences came about. Humans and frogs, for example, have been evolving separately for 350 million years and have very different brain abilities. Yet scientists have shown that they use a remarkably similar repertoire of genes to build organs in the body. So how is it that a similar number of genes, that are also switched on or off in similar ways in diverse vertebrate species, generate a vast range of organ size and complexity?The key lays in the process that Blencowe s group studies, known as alternative splicing (AS), whereby gene products are assembled into proteins, which are the building blocks of life. During AS, gene fragments   called exons   are shuffled to make different protein shapes. It s like LEGO, where some fragments can be missing from the final protein shape. AS enables cells to make more than one protein from a single gene, so that the total number of different proteins in a cell greatly surpasses the number of available genes. A cell s ability to regulate protein diversity at any given time reflects its ability to take on different roles in the body. Blencowe s previous work showed that AS prevalence increases with vertebrate complexity. So although the genes that make bodies of vertebrates might be similar, the proteins they give rise to are far more diverse in animals such as mammals, than in birds and frogs. And nowhere is AS more widespread than in the brain.  We wanted to see if AS could drive morphological differences in the brains of different vertebrate species,  says Serge Gueroussov, a graduate student in Blencowe s lab who is the lead author of the study. Gueroussov previously helped identify PTBP1 as a protein that takes on another form in mammals, in addition to the one common to all vertebrates. The second form of mammalian PTBP1 is shorter because a small fragment is omitted during AS and does not make it into the final protein shape. Could this newly acquired, mammalian version of PTBP1 give clues to how our brains evolved? PTBP1 is both a target and major regulator of AS. PTBP1 s job in a cell is to stop it from becoming a neuron by holding off AS of hundreds of other gene products. Gueroussov showed that in mammalian cells, the presence of the second, shorter version of PTBP1 unleashes a cascade of AS events, tipping the scales of protein balance so that a cell becomes a neuron. What s more, when Gueroussov engineered chicken cells to make the shorter, mammalian-like, PTBP1, this triggered AS events that are found in mammals.  One interesting implication of our work is that this particular switch between the two versions of PTBP1 could have affected the timing of when neurons are made in the embryo in a way that creates differences in morphological complexity and brain size,  says Blencowe, who is also a professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics. As scientists continue to sift through countless molecular events occurring in our cells, they ll keep finding clues as to how our bodies and minds came to be.  This is the tip of an iceberg in terms of the full repertoire of AS changes that likely have contributed major roles in driving evolutionary differences,  says Blencowe.

The study also showed that detection of circulating tumor DNA in the blood could provide an early indication of tumor recurrence. Using whole-exome sequencing -- looking at the DNA protein-coding regions of 24 tumors -- and targeted genomic analyses of 77 other tumors, the study identified mutations in chromatin-regulating genes MLL, MLL2, MLL3 and ARID1A in 20 percent of patients associated with improved survival. In addition, using a liquid biopsy analysis, the study found that 43 percent of pancreatic cancer patients had circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in their bloodstream at the time of diagnosis. Very importantly, the study also found that detection of ctDNA following surgery predicts clinical relapse of the cancer and poor outcomes for patients. In addition, using a liquid biopsy detected the recurrence of cancer 6.5 months earlier than using CT imaging. ""These observations provide predictors of outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer and have implications for detection of tumor recurrence, and perhaps someday for early detection of the cancer,"" said Dr. Daniel D. Von Hoff, TGen Distinguished Professor and Physician-In-Chief, Co-Director of TGen's SU2C Pancreatic Cancer Dream Team, and Chief Scientific Officer at the Virginia G. Piper Cancer Center Clinical Trials at HonorHealth (formerly Scottsdale Healthcare). Dr. Von Hoff was one of the authors of the study. The pancreatic cancers analyzed in the study were stage II tumors from patients who underwent potentially curative surgery. Only 15-20 percent of patients are candidates for tumor resection, because pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and usually is not diagnosed until its late stages when surgery is no longer an option. The 5-year survival rate for those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is less than 10 percent. The study's results found that a significant number of early-stage pancreatic cancers could be diagnosed non-invasively using liquid biopsy blood analysis that focuses on a few specific genetic alterations. ""We have identified MML genes as markers of improved prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer,"" Dr. Von Hoff said. ""We have also shown that ctDNA in the blood of pancreatic cancer patients may provide a marker of earlier detection of recurrence of the disease."". This analysis suggests that additional studies should ""evaluate more intensive therapies"" for patients without MLL mutations or with detectable ctDNA following surgical removal of their tumors, as well as interventional clinical trials, the study said.","Published: August 24, 2015"

Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a known tumor suppressing protein that is encoded by the PTEN gene.  When expressed normally, the protein acts as an enzyme at the cell membrane, instigating a complex biochemical reaction that regulates the cell cycle and prevents cells from growing or dividing in an unregulated fashion. Each cell in the body contains two copies of the PTEN gene, one inherited from each parent. When there is a mutation in one or both of the PTEN genes, it interferes with the protein s enzymatic activity and, as a result inhibits its tumor suppressing ability. Membrane-incorporated and membrane-associated proteins like PTEN make up one-third of all proteins in our body. Many important functions in health and disease depend on their proper functioning,  said L sche, who with other researchers within Carnegie Mellon s Center for Membrane Biology and Biophysics aim to understand the structure and function of cell membranes and membrane proteins.  Despite PTEN s importance in human physiology and disease, there is a critical lack of understanding of the complex mechanisms that govern its activity.  Recently, researchers led by Pier Paolo Pandolfi at Harvard Medical School found that PTEN s tumor suppressing activity becomes elevated when two copies of the protein bind together, forming a dimeric protein.  PTEN dimerization may be the key to understanding an individual s susceptibility for PTEN-sensitive tumors,  said L sche, a professor of physics and biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon. In order to reveal how dimerization improves PTEN s ability to thwart tumor development, researchers needed to establish the protein s dimeric structure. Normally, protein structure is identified using crystallography, but attempts to crystallize the PTEN dimer had failed. L sche and colleagues used a different technique called small-angle X ray scattering (SAXS) which gains information about a protein s structure by scattering X-rays through a solution containing the protein. They then used computer modeling to establish the dimer s structure. They found that in the PTEN dimers, the C-terminal tails of the two proteins may bind the protein bodies in a cross-wise fashion, which makes them more stable. As a result, they can more efficiently interact with the cell membrane, regulate cell growth and suppress tumor formation. Now that more is known about the structure of the PTEN dimer, researchers will be able to use molecular biology tools to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of tumor formation facilitated by PTEN mutations. The researchers also hope that their findings will offer up a new avenue for cancer therapeutics.","Published: August 24, 2015"

Global wine production leaves an estimated 13 million tonnes of grape marc waste each year. Nationally it is estimated that several hundred thousand tonnes are generated annually and it is generally disposed of at a cost to the winery.  This is a potentially economic use for what is largely a waste product,  says Associate Professor Rachel Burton, Program Leader with the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence in Plant Cell Walls in the School of Agriculture, Food and Wine. PhD candidate Kendall Corbin analysed the composition of grape marc from two grape varieties, cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc. She also investigated pre-treatment of the grape marc with acid and enzymes. Ms Corbin found that the majority of the carbohydrates found in grape marc could be converted directly to ethanol through fermentation with a yield of up to 270 litres per tonne of grape marc. The leftover product was suitable for use as an animal feed or fertiliser. Ethanol yields could be increased by pre-treatment with acid and enzymes up to 400 litres a tonne.   Using plant biomass for the production of liquid biofuels can be difficult because of it structurally complex nature that is not always easily broken down,  says Ms Corbin.  Grape marc is readily available, can be sourced cheaply and is rich in the type of carbohydrates that are easily fermented.  Associate Professor Burton says:  We ve shown that there is a potential new industry with the evolution of local biofuel processing plants to add value to the grape for an environmentally friendly biofuel.

Researchers at the School of Medicine and the Department of Energy s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory mapped the 3-D atomic structure of a two-part protein complex that controls the release of signalling chemicals, called neurotransmitters, from brain cells. Understanding how cells release those signals in less than one-thousandth of a second could help launch a new wave of research on drugs for treating brain disorders. The experiments, at the Linac Coherent Light Source X-ray laser at SLAC, build upon decades of previous research at Stanford and the national lab. This is a very important, exciting advance that may open up possibilities for targeting new drugs to control neurotransmitter release,  said Axel Brunger, PhD, professor and chair of molecular and cellular physiology and professor of neurology and neurological sciences.  Many mental disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and anxiety, affect neurotransmitter systems.  Brunger, who is also professor of photon science at SLAC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, is the senior author of the paper. The first author is postdoctoral scholar Qiangjun Zhou, PhD.  Both parts of this protein complex are essential,  Brunger added,  but until now it was unclear how its two pieces fit and work together.  Unraveling the combined secrets of two proteins The two protein structures are known as neuronal SNAREs and synaptotagmin-1. Earlier X-ray studies, including experiments at SLAC s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, or SSRL, nearly two decades ago, shed light on the structure of the SNARE complex, a helical protein bundle found in yeasts and mammals. SNAREs play a key role in the brain s chemical signaling by joining, or  fusing,  little packets of neurotransmitters to the outer edges of neurons, where they are released and then dock with chemical receptors in another neuron to trigger a response. In this latest research, the scientists found that when the SNAREs and synaptotagmin-1 join up, they act as an amplifier for a slight increase in calcium concentration, triggering a gunshot-like release of neurotransmitters from one neuron to another. They also found that the proteins join together before they arrive at a neuron s membrane, which helps to explain how they trigger brain signaling so rapidly.  The neuron is not building the  gun  as it sits there on the membrane   it s already there,  Brunger said. The team speculates that several of the joined protein complexes may group together and simultaneously interact with the same vesicle to efficiently trigger neurotransmitter release, an exciting area for further studies.  The structure of the SNARE-synaptotagmin-1 complex is a milestone that the field has awaited for a long time, and it sets the framework for a better understanding of the system,  said James Rothman, a professor at Yale University who discovered the SNARE proteins and shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Thomas S dhof, MD, a Stanford professor of molecular and cellular physiology and HHMI investigator who shared that 2013 Nobel Prize with Rothman, discovered synaptotagmin-1 and showed that it plays an important role as a calcium sensor and calcium-dependent trigger for neurotransmitter release.  The new structure has identified unanticipated interfaces between synaptotagmin-1 and the neuronal SNARE complex that change how we think about their interaction by revealing, in atomic detail, exactly where they bind together,  said S dhof, a co-author of the paper.  This is a new concept that goes much beyond previous general models of how synaptotagmin-1 functions.  Using crystals, robotics and X-rays to advance neuroscience To study the joined protein structure, researchers in Brunger s laboratory at the School of Medicine found a way to grow crystals of the complex. They used a robotic system developed at SSRL to study the crystals at the Linac Coherent Light Source, an X-ray laser that is one of the brightest sources of X-rays on the planet. The researchers combined and analyzed hundreds of X-ray images from about 150 protein crystals to reveal the atomic-scale details of the joined structure.  This experiment was the first to use this robotic platform at LCLS to determine a previously unsolved structure of a large, challenging multi-protein complex,  said Aina Cohen, PhD, co-head of the Structural Molecular Biology Division at SSRL, who oversaw the development of the highly automated platform used for the neuroscience experiment.    This is a good example of how advanced tools, instruments and X-ray methods are providing us new insights into what are truly complex mechanisms,  added Cohen, a co-author of the study. Brunger said future studies will explore other protein interactions relevant to neurotransmitter release.  What we studied is only a subset,  he said.  There are many other factors interacting with this system and we want to know what these look like. This by no means is the end of the story. ","Published: August 24, 2015"

There is little in terms of treatment, partly because of poor understanding of how DMD develops, although it is known that abnormal expression of the protein dystrophin is at fault. Normally, to study DMD development, patient muscles, the cells that develop into muscle cells, are used to study DMD development. However, because patients suffer from variable stages of DMD, their cells are not suitable for studying the early stages of DMD development and preventative measures. To overcome this problem, Hidetoshi Sakurai, Senior Lecturer at CiRA, and his team, in collaboration with the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University, have designed a model that reprograms fibroblasts to the early stages of their differentiation into intact muscle cells.The strategy depends on first reprogramming the patient cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and then introducing a gene that differentiates the iPS cells to muscle cells. ""Our model allows us to use the same genetic background to study the early stage of pathogenesis which was not possible in the past,"" says CiRA researcher Emi Shoji, the first author of a study that gives new insights on DMD development. Muscle contraction depends on an influx of calcium (Ca2+) ions into the cells. However, too much influx leads to cell dysfunction or death, which is believed to be the underlying cause of DMD. ""It is critical to assess intact cells for an accurate evaluation how Ca2+ influx leads to DMD pathogenic cascades,"" says Shoji. She therefore stimulated their model electrically to simulate muscle cell contraction, finding that cells from DMD patients had significantly increased influx. Further study laid blame on transient receptor potential (TRP) channels through which the Ca2+ ions enter the cell. This observation is consistent with other models and provides a clear drug target for the treatment of DMD. More important, it should allow scientists to uncover drug agents that can counter DMD at early development. ""TRP channels have been identified before. But because our model uses patient-derived hiPS cells, there is a potential that we can find new drugs for DMD,""says Sakurai.","Published: August 24, 2015"

Metastatic brain tumours   cancers that have spread to the brain from another tumour   are currently incurable, with life expectancy ranging from a few months to a few years after diagnosis. Dr Saunus said their study was the first of its kind to use genome sequencing to examine a cohort of secondary brain tumours. This study deepens our understanding of secondary brain tumours and highlights opportunities for new drug targets,  she said.  We have identified particular genes and inter-related networks of genes linked to the development of brain metastases.  We have also found potential drug targets in a large proportion of the tumours, including a molecule called HER3 that we had already been investigating.  Dr Saunus said new treatment options for metastatic brain cancer patients were desperately needed.  Identifying new targets could have a huge impact on fighting this disease, as it lays a foundation for the development of new treatments,  she said.  With the incidence of brain metastases increasing, the burden of this complication is now greater than any individual cancer type.  Despite being responsible for most cancer-related deaths and illness, secondary cancers are not a current focus of large-scale cancer genome sequencing studies.  However, with increasing development of more effective cancer treatments, there could be new opportunities to explore.  Dr Saunus said the discoveries would not have been possible without the valuable samples provided by the Brisbane Breast Bank, as metastatic brain cancer tissue samples were not easy to come by. She said the research team anticipated the data from the study would be more extensively analysed by the international research community.

The new paper describes how POP1 blocks a pro-inflammatory mediator called IL-1b.  Inflammation is controlled by a complex network of regulators that is still poorly understood,  said senior author Christian Stehlik, PhD, John P. Gallagher Research Professor of Rheumatology.  Here, we describe a novel inhibitor of the inflammatory response.  Stehlik worked with co-senior author Andrea Dorfleutner, PhD, research assistant professor in Medicine-Rheumatology, and a team headed by postdoctoral fellow Lucia de Almeida, PhD. They found that mice expressing POP1 were protected from systemic inflammation. Those mice also recovered more quickly than controls from inflammatory diseases, including peritonitis, sepsis and cryopyrinopathy.Interestingly, the scientists also discovered that human patients with cryopyrinopathy and sepsis have less POP1 in their immune cells than others.  Based on this finding, we developed a proof-of-principle drug based on POP1 and administered this treatment for peritonitis in a mouse model,  Dorfleutner said.  We found significantly reduced inflammation.  The scientists believe that treatments based on POP1 could improve many inflammatory diseases, not just the ones tested in this study.  A better understanding of the molecular events that contribute to autoinflammatory diseases is critical for the development of novel therapies that may benefit patients in the future,  said Stehlik, who is also a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.  Understanding the critical role of POP1 in inflammation leads us to believe that novel POP1-based therapies may be applicable in humans.  In a previous study, Stehlik and colleagues showed how another protein in the POP family, POP3, inhibits the immune response to virus infection. Unlike POP1, POP3 did not affect autoinflammatory disease. POP proteins are unique in their function to regulate specific aspects of the immune response.","Published: August 24, 2015"

As the lesions are usually highly visible and located predominantly on the face, they can impact patients both physically and emotionally,"" said Reinhard Dummer, MD, Professor and Vice Chairman, Department of Dermatology at the University of Zurich. ""The approval of Odomzo brings new hope in the form of a non-invasive option to help treat this disfiguring and potentially life-threatening disease."" Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) consists of abnormal, uncontrolled growths or lesions that arise in the skin's basal cells, which line the deepest layer of the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin)[3] and accounts for more than 80% of non-melanoma skin cancers[4]. Advanced BCC is thought to represent roughly 1-10% of all cases of BCC[5]-[7]. Although BCC rarely becomes advanced, there have been few treatment options at this stage of the disease. Worldwide incidence of BCC is rising by 10% each year due to factors such as an aging population and increased ultraviolet exposure[8]. The EU approval of Odomzo was based on data from the Phase II randomized, double-blind, multi-center BOLT (Basal cell carcinoma Outcomes in LDE225 Trial) study in patients with laBCC not amenable to local therapy or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC). In patients with laBCC treated with Odomzo 200 mg, the objective response rate (ORR) was 56% per central review and 71% per investigator review. The median duration of response per central review has not been reached. The median progression-free survival was 22 months per central review and 19 months per investigator review. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients treated with Odomzo 200 mg were fatigue, decreased weight and muscle spasms[1]. ""We are pleased to have a new treatment option for European patients living with advanced basal cell carcinoma,"" said Bruno Strigini, President, Novartis Oncology. ""This milestone follows the recent approval of Odomzo in the US and is the latest example of our commitment to precision oncology and developing targeted treatments to address unmet needs."" The EU approval follows a positive opinion adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in June 2015 and applies to all 28 EU member states, plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

Known as the UCSF Center for Next-Gen Precision Medicine Diagnostics, the new initiative will initially focus on radically improving diagnosis of encephalitis and meningitis, devastating and sometimes deadly conditions characterized by inflammation of the brain or its surrounding tissues. Despite their severity and the high cost of hospital care associated with these conditions, studies have shown that in more than half of encephalitis and meningitis cases a cause is never identified.  Knowing the cause can significantly impact the course of clinical care. Therefore the use of genomic technology in these situations is incredibly exciting the results may have immediate and actionable consequences,  said principal investigator Joseph DeRisi, PhD, chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UCSF.  There s no question the technology works, but research at this center will help us find out how well it will compete with typical  send-out  tests in terms of cost, scale, and turnaround times. We will also push the technology to do more, in order to drive sensitivity up and cost down. The new center is backed by $2.4 million in start-up funding from the Sandler Foundation and the William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation. That support was recently buttressed by a $1.2 million grant from the California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine, a public-private effort spearheaded by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr.  UCSF has all the components critical to success, including great vision, outstanding science, and a collaborative culture that brings together exceptional basic scientists and clinical scientists,  said Herbert Sandler, president of the Sandler Foundation.  The new center will help advance medical research to a point where, with a single test, we can rapidly and accurately diagnose a whole array of life-threatening diseases that previously required putting patients through a range of burdensome, expensive, and speculative tests. The center will contribute to both better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.  UCSF Chancellor Sam Hawgood, MBBS, said,  This center is an exemplar of UCSF s leadership in precision medicine, and thanks to the visionary support of Herb Sandler and Bill Bowes, and that from the State of California, some of the nation s most seriously ill patients will see more rapid benefits from the power of next-generation diagnostics.  The center will bring together an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians, as well as a health economist, to develop and deploy genomic testing for patients suffering from encephalitis  and meningitis. This testing is primarily designed to identify infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses, but many cases of meningitis and encephalitis are caused by an autoimmune response, so the center will also develop new technologies to better understand such cases.  Next-Gen  in the center s name is a reference to next-generation sequencing, a term for techniques by which complete genomes can be deciphered at the level of individual genetic  letters.  Over the past several years, DeRisi and center member Charles Chiu, MD, PhD, have developed pathbreaking diagnostic tests based on next-gen sequencing. In encephalitis and meningitis, for example, a sample from a patient of the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord can be rapidly analyzed to detect  foreign  genomic sequences that may reflect the presence of disease-causing pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. DeRisi and Chiu are continually refining and adapting their sequencing and bioinformatics platforms to apply to a wide range of both human and veterinary diseases. In 2014, DeRisi, Chiu and Michael Wilson, MD   also a member of the new center   attracted international attention with a New England Journal of Medicine article on their use of these techniques to identify a rare bacterium causing a life-threatening case of encephalitis in a Wisconsin boy. The test results, which were generated in about 48 hours in Chiu s lab, are credited with saving the boy s life.  From a health outcomes standpoint, encephalitis and meningitis are very serious diseases,  DeRisi said.  Five or six percent of patients will die, and many more will suffer long-term damage, such as cognitive problems, memory loss, or loss of hearing. These patients often have extended stays in Intensive Care Units, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in more than 50 percent of the cases no diagnosis is ever made. This is shocking in this day and age, especially when the stakes are so high.  One reason encephalitis and meningitis resist diagnosis, DeRisi said, is that they can be caused by hundreds of different kinds of infectious agents or parasites viruses, bacteria, fungi, and even amoebae.  If you re sending out for tests of the agent you guess is at work, one at a time, it can take a heck of a long time to cover those hundreds of things. But these pathogens all have nucleic acids   RNA or DNA   and a sequencing approach is the fastest and most comprehensive way to detect that.  Moreover, the fact that cases due to autoimmunity cannot be easily distinguished from infectious ones creates  a diagnostic conundrum  for doctors, according to DeRisi: for autoimmune encephalitis, doctors may administer steroids to tamp down the immune response, but that therapy can hamper the body s ability to heal if the inflammation is actually caused by an invading bacterium or virus. Because so little is known about autoimmune encephalitis and meningitis, when next-gen tests conducted at the new center do not detect an infectious agent, center member Sam Pleasure, MD, will conduct research to try to determine why the brain or meninges are eliciting an immune response. In parallel, members of the center will work to develop new protein-based tests to specifically diagnose autoimmune causes of these diseases, an unmet need in critical-care medicine.","Published: August 24, 2015"

Their work shows how the body provides the important killer cells with a helper in the case of an infection.  The study could point the way to better vaccines in the future.  It is like having a spy thriller in our immune system. The so-called killer T cells play the role of James Bond: They have a license to kill. If they come upon a cell infected by viruses, they make holes in its cell membrane until the cell bursts and dies. This prevents the virus from spreading further. No innocent victims are to be injured in this battle. The killer cells are therefore carefully briefed prior to their deployment   similar to 007 by his superior, M. The dendritic cells of the immune system undertake the briefing: They collect evidence of an infection and hold it under the noses of the killer cells like a type of mug shot. Wherever M and 007 are, Q cannot be far away either   the chief engineer in the service of the agency who always equips Bond with the most sophisticated weapons. The role of Q is played in the body's own defenses by the so-called helper T cells. For example, they boost the reproduction of killer T cells and give their memory a helping hand.   In the event of a repeat infection with the same virus, 007 can thus remember that he already dealt with this enemy.   Conspiratorial meeting in the lymph node The actors of the immune system and their respective roles have been known for some time. However, it has not been clear to date what type of dendritic cell M is. It was also not known how M, Q and 007 managed to meet up. It was suspected that this meeting took place in the lymph node. But a lymph node is big   it is extremely unlikely that the three key figures would find each other by chance. The immunologists at the University of Bonn were now able to answer this question. The killer T and helper T cells are initially separated from each other after an infection, in a state of alert. In this process, they are equipped with a type of GPS receiver. ""This receiver guides the two to a so-called XCR1 cell,"" explains the immunologist Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Kastenmueller from the University of Bonn. ""That is a dendritic cell with special properties. Helper T cells as well as killer T cells can dock onto it."" The scientists were able to visualize these processes using what is known as an intravital microscope. In this way, cellular processes can be observed in living animals   thus under real-time conditions. The results may also be of interest for the development of new vaccines. Because killer cells are activated best by living viruses or bacteria. However, a live vaccine presents risks precisely in the case of harmful pathogens which one would like to avoid. It would be better to be able to activate killer cells through harmless fragments of disease pathogens. ""Over the long term, our findings could help turn this idea into reality,"" says Prof. Kastenmueller.","Published: August 24, 2015"

It can also be announced that Sygnature Discovery, currently based in the Laurus building at BioCity, will take up 30,000 sq ft of the 50,000 sq ft available in the new building. This is part of the company s plan to increase headcount in Nottingham by a further 70 scientists and support staff, to over 200 by 2018. It will also further cement its reputation as the UK s leading provider of advanced scientific expertise to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.   This in turn frees up space in the existing building for more developing companies to make use of its excellent incubator facilities. Willmott Dixon has been appointed main contractor and CPMG of Nottingham the architects, under an agreement which will see local people benefit from construction jobs on the project. Expected to complete in spring 2017, the facility will help to bring more life science employers to Nottingham and create and safeguard around 250 specialist bioscience jobs, with 700 more created over a 30-year period   often graduates from the city s universities. The prominent brownfield site on Plough Lane overlooking Parliament Street will benefit from a striking new building which design includes a sunscreen created by acclaimed local artist Wolfgang Buttress. The building will be designed to aim to achieve a BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) rating, aimed at reducing its environmental impact. It will be connected to the district heating system and so its energy needs will be provided from burning the city s waste. The new development is expected to act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the Eastside of the city. The site was bought, cleared and decontaminated by Nottingham City Council for the state-of-the-art life science incubator to be developed. The facility will be fitted with high-tech biology and chemistry laboratories which will be built in a range of sizes to allow companies to expand, with ancillary space for commercial leasing to both start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises.  The City Council successfully applied to the D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership for  6.5m from its Local Growth Fund towards the overall costs of the scheme, with the remaining costs funded by the council. Councillor Jon Collins, Leader of Nottingham City Council and Portfolio Holder for Strategic Regeneration, said:  This is a significant development because not only will it cement our position as the UK s fastest-growing life science community, bringing new investment and job opportunities in one of our key growth sectors, but it will also help to regenerate the east side of the city and bring job opportunities during its construction.  Operations Director at BioCity Toby Reid said: ""This is a real statement of intent for Nottingham as a leader in the life sciences sector. Not only have we ensured that a company of the standing of Sygnature Discovery has remained here as a beacon of excellence in the sector but we've also been able to create further space to accommodate our own growth and that of the next generation of innovative entrepreneurs.""","Published: August 24, 2015"

So state officials turned to scientists at the University of Rhode Island s Graduate School of Oceanography for answers. It didn t take long before they had solved the mystery. Janet Coit, director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which operates the state beaches, contacted Oceanography Dean Bruce Corliss, who turned to Professor John King, an expert on coastal geology, and Professor Arthur Spivack, whose knowledge of the chemistry of ocean sediments would quickly come into play.  After the bomb squad had ruled out explosives, terrorism and old munitions, the hypothesis was that there could have been a significant source of methane in the sand,  said Spivack, who studies biologically-produced methane in ocean sediments.  Methane is produced almost everywhere in the ocean. And in the nearshore environment there is often a lot of buried peat, and that s a potential source of methane. So it was a realistic hypothesis. But methane wasn t the only realistic hypothesis promulgated by URI scientists. Professor Brian Heikes walked into Spivack s office and suggested an alternative idea   hydrogen. He proposed that hydrogen might have been created through an electrochemical process by an abandoned underground cable discovered at the site of the explosion. Spivack was skeptical at first, but Heikes convinced him to keep an open mind. And neither man came up with any other likely scenarios. As beachgoers and the media watched, King gathered a team of faculty and graduate students, along with soil scientists from the Natural Resource Conservation Service, to collect several sediment cores up to 5 feet deep. Back at a lab at the URI Narragansett Bay Campus, doctoral students Justine Sauvage and Kira Homola worked long hours through the weekend slicing up the cores, placing samples into test tubes, sealing the test tubes to allow the gases to diffuse from the sand, and using a hypodermic needle to collect the gas. They then injected the contents of the needle into a gas chromatograph, which separates out the different gases and calculates the quantities of each. Spivack said the researchers were lucky to have Sauvage as part of the team. A native of Belgium, she is an expert on the analysis of hydrogen in sand and sediments and  one of a handful of people in the country who could just walk on the scene and do the work. We were uniquely capable of responding to this situation because of her skills,  he said. Sauvage s doctoral dissertation examines how naturally occurring radioactivity in the ocean leads to the production of hydrogen. She uses the gas chromatograph at least weekly and has conducted hundreds of analyses of sediment samples in the last few years.  There are a lot of intricate details involved in getting a reliable measurement from the instrument, and it can take up to a week just to set it up and calibrate it,  Sauvage said.  But since I ve been doing it weekly for more than two years, it was really easy because it was ready to go.  While the samples were being analyzed, Spivack visited Salty Brine State Beach for the first time since the explosion and observed the cable that had been 3 feet below the injured beachgoer when the blast occurred. He noted that the copper cable and steel sheath around it were clean and uncorroded.   The copper was like a shiny new penny, and the steel was silvery, even though it had been in seawater for many years,  Spivack said.  That told me that it was consistent with there being a slight negative voltage in that end of the cable, which protects it from corroding but also could produce hydrogen.  The rest of the 30-foot cable was highly corroded. When he looked at the results of the gas chromatography, Spivack knew the mystery was solved. It showed exceptionally high levels of hydrogen in a few pockets just beneath the area of the explosion, far higher levels than Sauvage had ever previously measured. Hydrogen is typically recorded at just a few parts per million, but in the beach sand there were up to 50,000 parts per million, which could easily have become flammable. Methane, the other gas that was hypothesized as the cause of the explosion, was found at barely detectable levels. When additional sediment cores were collected and analyzed, the results were the same.  Spivack explained that corrosion in the underground cable is like a short-circuited battery in salt water. As the cable corrodes at one end, electrons travel through the metal to the opposite end, protecting it from corrosion and leaving it shiny and clean while producing hydrogen that dissipates into the sand. He calls it  really simple chemistry.  But how did it explode? That s simple, too. Hydrogen needs very little energy to ignite, approximately one tenth as much as it takes to light a gas stove, so the spark could have come from static electricity, a cigarette ember or other common source. When hydrogen combusts, it does not produce visible flames, nor does it radiate much heat, which explains why no one saw any flames or got burned by the explosion. And a hydrogen blast leaves behind no ash or other residue to indicate an explosion even happened. It only produces water. To ensure that beachgoers could safely return to the site of the explosion, the researchers conducted additional tests and found that excavation of the sands in the area of the blast had released any residual hydrogen, making another blast nearly impossible. To Spivack, the explosion occurred as a result of a confluence of simple scientific principles. But solving the mystery took  the commitment of a world-class graduate school. If it happened at some other place along the East Coast, it would have been difficult to find someone nearby who could provide the answer,  he said.  We just happen to have the right people and a uniquely collegial environment that brought a group of people together to figure it out. We solved this mystery because the Graduate School of Oceanography has been able to attract good people to come to Rhode Island.  State officials agree, and many offered accolades for the work of the URI researchers. Gov. Gina Raimondo said,  I m grateful to the extraordinary scientists at URI, especially the team from the Graduate School of Oceanography, whose hard work led to this explanation. Having the talent and research expertise of the teams at URI to turn to for quick results has proven invaluable.  DEM Director Coit added,  The talented scientists at our world renowned Graduate School of Oceanography at URI have given us an explanation for what happened when the ground shook at our beach.  The night before the press conference announcing the results of the investigation, Spivack spent a great deal of time thinking about how to explain his findings in a way that would be both scientifically valid and understandable to non-scientists. It was the first press conference in which he had ever participated, and it generated stories in more than 300 news outlets around the world. The big question that many reporters asked him was how likely is it that another beach could experience a similar explosion.  You can t build a probability theory about an event that has only occurred once,  he told them.  But the fact that it occurred once tells you that there s really a very low probability of it ever happening again. ","Published: August 24, 2015"

These results led to TRER's adoption of the heap leaching model for extraction of rare earth from the Round Top ore. Since that time the Company has reviewed the raw data to evaluate the potential of the high value trace elements, notably scandium. Careful review of the 2013 solution analyses indicates that if the scandium present in these leach solutions were recovered it would produce a projected 5,400 kilograms of scandium oxide per year in the envisioned 20,000 tonnes per day operation at Round Top. Additional leaching has been carried out in 8"" columns installed at the K-Tech lab with the objective of producing a primary leach solution (PLS) for continuous ion exchange and continuous ion chromatography testing. Analysis of this PLS has also shown potential recovery of scandium at even greater levels than being reported today. The behavior of scandium in the continuous ion exchange (CIX) and continuous ion chromatography (CIC) process is similar enough to rare earth elements that its extraction from solution does not require additional procedures or equipment. Dan Gorski, CEO, commented: Although the production of heavy rare earths is the primary objective at Round Top, the numerous other elements being recovered in leaching of this rock are proving to make a significant contribution to the potential revenue stream. To date, uranium, lithium, beryllium and now scandium show promise of being valuable by-products. Scandium in particular is significant because of its strategic nature, lack of a domestic supply and limited worldwide production."" According to Adamas Intelligence, scandium sells for approximately $2,000-$5,000 per kilogram, depending on quality and purity characteristics. Furthermore, Adamas estimates annual worldwide production and consumption at 5,000-15,000 kilograms. The USGS (United States Geological Service), reports that 100% of US consumption of scandium in 2014 was imported, primarily from China. Scandium exhibits very good electrical conductivity and excellent heat stabilization qualities. The primary use for scandium today is in solid oxide fuel cells (""SOFCs""), where both of these attributes dramatically improve performance. Incorporation of scandium in SOFCs delivers higher power outputs and promotes the desired chemical reaction at a lower operating temperature, resulting in dramatically improved unit life cycles. Numerous other applications have been identified and are under development, most notably for strength and superior conductivity in high voltage power transmission lines. Relatively small scandium additions into aluminum alloys produce stronger, lighter, heat and corrosion resistant, aluminum products. The aircraft industry depends on advanced aluminum alloys, and would incorporate aluminum-scandium alloys if consistent scandium supply was available. The automotive sector is increasingly incorporating aluminum alloys into its products to achieve weight reductions and better fuel efficiency.","Published: August 24, 2015"

Much like a community s network for garbage handling, cells also have their garbage sites, lysosomes, where proteins, which are functioning badly because of age or other reasons, go for degradation and potential recycling, said Dr. Wen-Cheng Xiong, developmental neurobiologist and Weiss Research Professor at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Regents University. Inside lysosomes, proteases help cut up proteins that can no longer do their job and enable salvaging of things like precious amino acids. It s a normal cell degradation process called autophagy that actually helps cells survive and is particularly important in cells such as neurons, which regenerate extremely slowly, said Xiong, corresponding author of the study in the Journal of Neuroscience. Key to the process   and as scientists have shown, to each other   are two more proteins, VPS35 and Lamp2a. VPS35 is essential for retrieving membrane proteins vital to cell function. Levels naturally decrease with age, and mutations in the VPS35 gene have been found in patients with a rare form of Parkinson s. VPS35 also is a critical part of a protein complex called a retromer, which has a major role in recycling inside cells. Lamp2a enables unfit proteins to be chewed up and degraded inside lysosomes. If the two sound like a natural couple, scientists now have more evidence that they are. They have shown that without VPS35 to retrieve Lamp2a from the trash site for reuse, Lamp2a, or lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2, will be degraded and its vital function lost. When the scientists generated VPS35-deficient mice, the mice exhibited Parkinson s-like deficits, including impaired motor control. When they looked further, they found the lysosomes inside dopamine neurons, which are targets in Parkinson s, didn t function properly in the mice. In fact, without VPS35, the degradation of Lamp2a itself is accelerated. Consequently, yet another protein, alpha-synuclein, which is normally destroyed by Lamp2a, is increased. Alpha-synuclein is a major component of abnormal protein clumps, called Lewy bodies, found in the brains of patients with Parkinson s.  If alpha-synuclein is not degraded, it just accumulates. If VPS35 function is normal, we won t see its accumulation,  Xiong said. Conversely, when MCG scientists increased expression of Lamp2a in the dopamine neurons of the VPS35-deficient mice, alpha-synuclein levels were reduced, a finding that further supports the linkage of the three proteins in the essential ability of the neurons to deal with undesirables in their lysosomes. Without lamp2a, dopamine neurons essentially start producing more garbage rather than eliminating it. Recycling of valuables such as amino acids basically stops, and alpha-synuclein is free to roam to other places in the cell or other brain regions where it can damage still viable proteins. The bottom line is dopamine neurons are lost instead of preserved. Brain scans document the empty spaces where neurons used to be in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s. One of the many problems with treatment of these diseases is that by the time the empty spaces and sometimes the associated symptoms are apparent, much damage has occurred, Xiong said. Putting these pieces together provides several new, early targets for disease intervention.  Everything is linked,  Xiong said. Dopamine has many roles, including motor control, and patients with Parkinson s have a loss of the neurons that secrete this neurotransmitter. At least in mice, VPS35 is naturally expressed in dopamine neurons in areas of the brain affected by Parkinson s. Xiong and her colleagues reported in 2011 that reduced expression of VPS35 enables activity of the dormant-in-healthy-adults protein BACE1 to increase along with accumulation of the brain plaque that is a hallmark of Alzheimer s. Xiong said then that impaired VPS35 function likely also was a factor in Parkinson s. In a definite vicious circle, trash starts overwhelming the brain cell s natural garbage disposal system. Proteins start getting misfolded and dysfunctional, potentially destructive proteins such as BACE1 and Lamp2a end up in the wrong place and get activated/inactivated, while good proteins get chopped up and/or bad proteins accumulate.

Using a panel of 1,698 ancestry informative genetic markers, the study found that greater African genetic ancestry was associated with lower amounts of slow-wave sleep in African-American adults. African ancestry explained 11 percent of the variation in slow-wave sleep after adjustment for potential confounders. Although a similar association was observed for delta power, no association with African ancestry was observed for sleep duration and efficiency.  Our data are the first to show that race differences in slow-wave sleep may have an independent and significant genetic basis,  said senior author Martica Hall, professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Although all humans have the same set of genes, variations within the genes sometimes follow population-specific patterns. By identifying the specific genetic variants that influence slow-wave sleep, we can eventually develop population-specific treatment approaches and therapies for sleep.  Study results are published in the August issue of the journal Sleep. Led by Hall and lead author Indrani Halder, the research team analyzed data from a community-based sample of 70 African-American adults and 101 European Americans with a mean age of about 60 years. Objective sleep data were gathered by polysomnography. Blood samples for genotyping were collected, and DNA was isolated following standard protocols.  According to the authors, African-Americans have varying proportions of genetic admixture and exhibit a wide range of African genetic ancestry.

Kinneret Savitsky, Ph.D., CEO of BioLineRx, remarked,  We expect some very exciting milestones for our BL-8040 oncology platform in the coming few months. First, we expect to report top-line data, including response rates, from our Phase 2 clinical study for treating relapsed/refractory AML in the fourth quarter of 2015, following the highly encouraging results to date we reported from the dose escalation stage of this study. Additionally, we presented positive safety and efficacy results from our Phase 1 study of BL-8040 as a novel stem cell mobilization treatment at the European Hematology Association conference in June, which supported the use of BL-8040 as a single-agent, single-injection, one-day regimen for the collection and transplantation of stem cells. This is a major improvement over currently available procedures, and the superior composition of the collected cells may offer the potential for better quality grafts and improved transplant outcomes. We look forward to meeting with the FDA in October to discuss the next steps in the clinical development of this program. Based on the outcome of the meeting, we would expect to initiate a Phase 2 study as early as the first quarter of 2016.   We are also expanding our BL-8040 platform into multiple hematological indications beyond our primary AML program, which allows us to pursue additional high-potential, unmet medical needs, while at the same time reducing the overall development risk of our platform. In this regard, we have just announced the initiation of a Phase 2 study as a novel consolidation treatment for AML. The Phase 2b study, which is conducted in collaboration with the German Study Alliance Leukemia Group, will examine BL-8040 as part of a second-stage treatment, termed consolidation therapy, to improve outcomes for AML patients who have achieved remission after the standard first-line treatment regimen, called induction therapy. The consolidation therapy is aimed at eliminating the minimal residual disease left in the bone marrow that can lead to relapse. In addition, we are in the final planning stages for additional studies in AML patients with the FLT3-ITD mutation, and for hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia, which we expect to initiate by the end of this year.  Dr. Savitsky continued,  In parallel, we have continued our ongoing dialogue with the EU regulatory authorities to confirm that our novel polymer BL-7010 for treating celiac disease can be developed on the medical device pathway in Europe. Following confirmation of the device pathway, we expect to initiate a pivotal CE Mark registration study for BL-7010 in the fourth quarter of 2015 or beginning of 2016. Currently, we are completing additional non-clinical studies and formulation work to further support advancing and potential approval of BL-7010 in Europe.   In addition to our core programs, we were proud to publish the results of our clinical trial for BL-5010, a novel formulation for the non-surgical removal of skin lesions, in The British Journal of Dermatology. Our partner Omega Pharma, now part of Perrigo, plans to submit an application for CE marking for BL-5010 in the third quarter of 2015. Upon potential CE Marking, we would expect the first sales of BL-5010 in Europe to start in 2016.  Dr. Savitsky concluded,  We continue to pursue various collaboration agreements to maximize the value of our current pipeline assets, including discussions with additional partners for the purpose of monetizing some of our non-core programs. In parallel to our internal pipeline development, we continue to screen potential assets to develop under our strategic partnership with Novartis, and we will provide timely updates on therapeutic candidates selected by Novartis when these promising candidates emerge. Finally, we remain well capitalized to execute on our development program and to achieve significant milestones across our expanded therapeutic pipeline and we look forward to demonstrating our enhanced value proposition over the coming months.  Financial Results for Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were $2.9 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 4%, compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The small increase resulted primarily from increased spending on BL-8040 in the 2015 period, partially offset by decreased spending on BL-7010, BL-9020 and BL-5010. Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $6.1 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 11%, compared to $5.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The reason for the increase is similar to the one discussed above in the three-month comparison. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were $0.3 million, substantially similar to the comparable period in 2014. Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $0.6 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 14%, compared to $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from professional fees related to a number of significant business development activities carried out during the six-month period in 2014, which resulted in collaboration and outlicensing agreements later in the year. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were $1.0 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 17%, compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The small increase resulted primarily from an increase in salary-related payments. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $1.8 million, substantially similar to the comparable period in 2014. The Company s operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 amounted to $4.2 million, compared with an operating loss of $3.9 million for the corresponding 2014 period. The Company s operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015 amounted to $8.5 million, compared with an operating loss of $8.0 million for the corresponding 2014 period. Net non-operating expenses amounted to $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a change of $1.1 million, compared to net non-operating income of $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Non-operating income (expenses) for both periods primarily relates to fair-value adjustments of liabilities on account of the warrants issued in the private and direct placements conducted in February 2012 and 2013. These fair-value adjustments were highly influenced by the Company s share price at each period end (revaluation date). Net non-operating expenses amounted to $0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a change of $2.9 million, compared to net non-operating income of $2.0 million for the corresponding 2014 period. The reason for the decrease is similar to the one discussed above in the three-month comparison. Net financial income amounted to $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to net financial expense of $0.4 million for the corresponding 2014 period. Net financial income amounted to $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to net financial expense of $0.2 million for the corresponding 2014 period. Net financial income (expenses) for the 2015 period primarily relates to investment income earned on our bank deposits, as well as banking fees. The 2014 period also includes exchange rate differences primarily relating to changes in the USD/NIS exchange rate. The Company s net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 amounted to $4.8 million, compared with a net loss of $4.1 million for the corresponding 2014 period. The Company s net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015 amounted to $9.1 million, compared with a net loss of $6.2 million for the corresponding 2014 period. The Company held $54.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits as of June 30, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities was $7.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $7.7 million for the corresponding 2014 period. The $0.5 million decrease in net cash used in operating activities during the six-month period in 2015, compared to the six-month period in 2014, was primarily the result of an increase in trade payables and accruals. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $17.9 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $15.5 million for the corresponding 2014 period. The changes in cash flows from investing activities relate primarily to investments in, and maturities of, short-term bank deposits and other investments during the respective periods. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $28.6 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $22.6 million for the corresponding 2014 period. The cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the underwritten public offerings of our ADSs in March 2015 and 2014.","Published: August 22, 2015"

Going back into antiquity, it is claimed even that Egypt s Pharaoh Akhenaten and his queen Nefertiti called asparagus a  food of the gods.  Now, on a more scientific note, scientists have determined that sulfur-containing compounds in plants can inhibit ACE, an enzyme known to contribute to hypertension. In research published in the Journal of Natural Products, a group of scientists from the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, along with colleagues from Chiba University, have used a field they are pioneering-targeted metabolomics-to identify a new ACE-inhibiting molecule in the asparagus, which they dubbed asparaptine. To identify the molecule, the group used mass spectrometry-a technique that involves scanning compounds to find the molecules contained within them-and looked specifically for different molecules containing sulfur. They identified several and then screened them to test their effectiveness in inhibiting ACE. The new compound they found in asparagus spears-asparaptine-turns out to have a very high effectiveness.

More than 80 per cent of the world s agricultural land is for grazing to support the ever increasing demand for meat and milk for an expanding and growing urban population, while boosting the income of rural families. The scarcity of grass feed is a worrying constraint standing in the way of this livestock productivity. Some Brachiaria species have been cultivated as forage grasses, providing nutrition for ruminants across the globe. As well as nutrition, the grasses have desirable genetic characteristics linked to drought and pest-resistance and adaptation to poor and acidic soils. Over the past 25 years, several African species of Brachiaria have been used commercially as forages in the tropics; the most widely sown forage plant in tropical America.With its combined high nutritional value and stress resistant properties, the Brachiaria breeding programme at CIAT is crossing different species to produce new varieties with superior traits. A particular Brachiaria species, B. decumbens, grants resistance to aluminium, which has a high concentration in acid soils. Most low-income livestock keepers live in tropical grasslands in countries in central Africa with great grazing potential, but are vulnerable due to the growing problem of increasing acid soils and longer extreme weather seasons. TGAC is working to identify high aluminium-resistant genes and chromosome regions in the Brachiaria genome, contributing to the international breeding programmes developing the new generation of forage crops. This genomic approach to forage breeding, will help to produce varieties with high nutritional value under physical stresses, such as low soil fertility. Strengthening and improving livestock forage-systems will contribute to the sustainability of food production, while helping to reduce carbon dioxide and mitigating the effects of climate change. The international team of scientists will apply next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and genomics to help improve forage breeding by reducing the length of the Brachiaria breeding cycle.Ultimately, these approaches could be applied to other crop species. Future developments of the CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) Research Programmes will provide opportunities to leverage UK investment to support the internationalization and expansion of UK agri-science. Project lead, Sarah Ayling, Crop Genomics and Diversity Group Leader at TGAC, said:  Our scientists are working towards a common goal of increasing sustainable agriculture, and collaborations like this allow us to exploit our combined expertise to contribute to the important issue of food security.  This project will deepen our interactions with international centres in Africa and Latin America, and improve forage breeding for livestock production.  Jose De Vega, co-project lead and Post-Doctoral Scientist in the Crop Genomics and Diversity at TGAC, added:  The most valuable part of the project is in relation to the link between tropical forage improvement and reducing poverty and ecosystems degradation. Improving livestock forages will give many small farmers in the tropics the opportunity to improve their livelihoods.  Our experience in genomics of temperate forage species (cool weather species) will assist with the tropical species of forage grasses in our cross-continent collaborative project, bringing the power of genomic technologies to tropical forage breeding.  This project is in partnership with the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS), UK, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia, and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Kenya. These activities are supported by a BBSRC International Partnering Award, which aims to support the development of long-term international collaborations, and funding from the Research Councils UK (RCUK) and British Council s Newton Fund, which through science and innovation partnerships, promotes the economic development and welfare of poor people in partnering countries.","Published: August 22, 2015"

Professor Benjamin Blencowe and his team at the Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research have determined that a small change in a protein called PTBP1 spurred the creation of neurons and fuelled the evolution of mammalian brains to become the largest and most complex among vertebrates. The study is published in the August 20 issue of Science.  Brain size and complexity vary enormously across vertebrates, but it is not clear how these differences came about. Humans and frogs, for example, have been evolving separately for 350 million years and have very different brain abilities. Yet scientists have shown that they use a remarkably similar repertoire of genes to build organs in the body. So how is it that a similar number of genes, which are also switched on or off in similar ways in diverse vertebrate species, generate a vast range of organ size and complexity? The key lies in alternative splicing (AS), whereby gene products are assembled into proteins, which are the building blocks of life. During AS, gene fragments called exons are shuffled to make different protein shapes. It s like LEGO, where some fragments can be missing from the final protein shape. AS enables cells to make more than one protein from a single gene, so that the total number of different proteins in a cell greatly surpasses the number of available genes. A cell s ability to regulate protein diversity at any given time reflects its ability to take on different roles in the body. Blencowe s previous work showed that AS prevalence increases with vertebrate complexity. So although the genes that make bodies of vertebrates might be similar, the proteins they give rise to are far more diverse in mammals than in birds and frogs. And nowhere is AS more widespread than in the brain.  We wanted to see if AS could drive morphological differences in the brains of different vertebrate species,  says graduate student Serge Gueroussov, lead author of the study. Gueroussov previously helped identify PTBP1 as a protein that takes on another form in mammals. The mammalian form of PTBP1 is shorter because a small fragment is omitted during AS and does not make it into the final protein shape. Could this newly acquired, mammalian version of PTBP1 provide clues to how our brains evolved? PTBP1 is both a target and major regulator of AS. PTBP1 s job in a cell is to stop it from becoming a neuron by holding off AS of hundreds of other gene products. Gueroussov showed that in mammalian cells, the presence of the shorter version of PTBP1 unleashes a cascade of AS events, tipping the scales of protein balance so that a cell becomes a neuron. What s more, when Gueroussov engineered chicken cells to make the shorter, mammalian-like PTBP1, this triggered AS events that are found in mammals.  One interesting implication of our work is that this particular switch between the two versions of PTBP1 could have affected the timing of when neurons are made in the embryo in a way that creates differences in morphological complexity and brain size,  says Blencowe, who is also Banbury Chair in Medical Research and a professor in the department of molecular genetics. As scientists continue to sift through countless molecular events occurring in our cells, they will keep finding clues as to how our bodies and minds came to be.  This is the tip of an iceberg in terms of the full repertoire of AS changes that likely have contributed major roles in driving evolutionary differences,  says Blencowe.

Past studies on sleep-deprived individuals have shown a strong positive effect of modafinil on these functions, but there has been less attention and scientific consensus on the drug's overall effectiveness as a cognitive enhancer in people that are not sleep-deprived -- presumably the majority of people taking it. Now, a new systematic review, published online in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology shows that modafinil does indeed confer significant cognitive benefits in this group, at least on a particular subset of tasks. Dr. Ruairidh Battleday and Dr. Anna-Katharine Brem from the University of Oxford and Harvard Medical School evaluated all research papers on cognitive enhancement with modafinil from January 1990 to December 2014. They found 24 studies dealing with different benefits associated with taking modafinil, including planning and decision making, flexibility, learning and memory, and creativity. Unsurprisingly, they found that the performance-enhancing capacity of modafinil varied according to the task. What emerged was that the longer and more complex the task tested, the more consistently modafinil conferred cognitive benefits. Modafinil made no difference to working memory, or flexibility of thought, but did improve decision-making and planning. Very encouragingly, the 70% of studies that looked at the effects of modafinil on mood and side effects showed very little overall effect, although a couple reported insomnia, headache, stomach ache or nausea (which were also reported in the placebo group). According to Ruairidh McLennan Battleday (University of Oxford): ""This is the first overview of modafinil's actions in non-sleep-deprived individuals since 2008, and so we were able to include a lot of recent data. Interestingly, we found that the type of test used to assess modafinil's cognitive benefits has changed over the last few decades. In the past, people were using very basic tests of cognition, developed for neurologically-impaired individuals. In contrast, more recent studies have, in general, used more complex tests: when these are used, it appears that modafinil more reliably enhances cognition: in particular 'higher' brain functions that rely on contribution from multiple simple cognitive processes."" According to Anna-Katharine Brem (University of Oxford and Harvard Medical School): ""So, we ended up having two main conclusions: first, that, in the face of vanishingly few side effects in these controlled environments, modafinil can be considered a cognitive enhancer; and, second that we need to figure out better ways of testing normal or even supra-normal cognition in a reliable manner. However, we would like to stress the point that with any method used to enhance cognition, ethical considerations always have to be taken into account: this is an important avenue for future work to explore."" Professor Guy Goodwin, President of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) commented: ""This overview suggests that, on current evidence, modafinil enhances cognition independent of its known effects in sleep disordered populations. Thus, the authors say that ""modafinil may well deserve the title of the first well-validated pharmaceutical nootropic agent."" In other words, it's the first real example of a 'smart drug', which can genuinely help, for example, with exam preparation. Previous ethical discussion of such agents has tended to assume extravagant effects before it was clear that there were any. If correct, the present update means the ethical debate is real: how should we classify, condone or condemn a drug that improves human performance in the absence of pre-existing cognitive impairment? As the authors point out, modafinil is not licenced for this use, and it will not be because it would be outside the current terms of reference of regulatory bodies. The non-medical use of mind altering drugs has hitherto broadly conflicted with the work ethic of many societies, has been very popular but leads to a range of demonstrable harms. Regulation has been and remains problematic. We cannot know either if demand for modafinil in the same societies will actually be significant, whether society will be more accepting and how regulation will then be framed.

The aging of the circadian clock may be a main driver of this change, argues a study published online in Cell Reports. Researchers in the United States and Japan found that fertility in middle-aged mice could be improved or reduced according to differences in the light-dark cycle, whereas younger mice were unaffected. Many of the body's processes follow a natural daily rhythm, or so-called circadian clock, that is based on 24-hour day-night cycles. Previous research has shown that the menstrual cycle in female mammals is affected by the region of the brain, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), that controls the circadian clock. Because of this link, research collaborators in Japan and the United States investigated the relationship between the circadian clock and age-related changes in reproductive function. The investigators found that genetic or environmental manipulations that altered the SCN timing signal and disrupted the circadian rhythms of young female mice did not affect reproductive cycling and function, whereas the same conditions led to infertility in older female mice. ""Importantly, changing the environmental conditions by matching the periodicity of the light cycle to the altered periodicity of the SCN could restore reproductive function in the older females,"" said senior author Wataru Nakamura, of Osaka University and the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The results indicate that, although aging mammals are susceptible to reproductive dysfunction when changes occur in SCN signaling and the circadian clock, these effects might be reversed. While corresponding studies are needed in humans, the findings suggest that ensuring harmony between internal and environmental rhythms may help improve fertility. ""In modern society, females are exposed to many challenging perturbations in the environment that might play a role in fertility difficulties--we now live with high light levels in the evening, and our sleep cycle is disrupted by shift work or crossing time zones,"" said co-author Gene Block, of the University of California Los Angeles. ""The ability to rescue reproductive function by altering the light schedule in a rodent model suggests that improvements in 'circadian hygiene'--for example, reductions in evening illumination, more regular meal timing, or avoiding rotating shiftwork or schedules that lead to irregular sleep--may all be important remedies for reproductive difficulty.""

Researchers have for the first time demonstrated that it is also involved in quick and successful conflict resolution. The team headed by Prof Dr Nikolai Axmacher from the Ruhr-Universit t Bochum (RUB), together with colleagues from the University Hospital of Bonn as well as in Aachen and Birmingham, reported in the journal Current Biology. In their everyday life, people are constantly confronted with decision conflicts, especially if they need to suppress an action that would have made sense under normal circumstances. For example: when the pedestrian lights go green, a pedestrian would normally start walking. If, however, a car comes speeding along at the same time, the pedestrian should stay where he is. In their experiment, researchers opted for a less threatening situation. Test participants heard the words ""high"" or ""low  spoken in a high or low tone, and they had to state   regardless of the meaning of the word   at what pitch the speaker said them. If the pitch doesn't correspond with the meaning of the word, a conflict is generated: the participants would answer more slowly and make more mistakes. The team demonstrated with two different measurement methods that the hippocampus is active in such conflicting situations; this applies particularly when a person solves the conflicts quickly and successfully. Nikolai Axmacher from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and his colleagues analyzed the brain activity in healthy participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. They gained the same results in epilepsy patients who had EEG electrodes implanted in the hippocampus for the purpose of surgery planning; this is how the researchers could measure the activity in that brain region directly. Because the hippocampus is essential for memory, the researchers speculate about its role in conflict resolution: ""Our data show first of all a completely new function of the Hippocampus   processing of activity conflicts,"" says Carina Oehrn from the Department of Epileptology at the University Hospital of Bonn. ""However, in order to answer the question how that function interacts with memory processes, we will have to carry out additional tests."" ""Perhaps the memory system becomes particularly active if a conflict has been successfully resolved,"" speculates Nikolai Axmacher. ""Permanently unsolved conflicts can't be used for learning helpful lessons for the future. According to our model, the brain works like a filter. It responds strongly to resolved conflicts, but not to unsolved conflicts or standard situations. However, we have to verify this hypothesis in additional studies.""

Yawning after spotting someone else yawn is associated with empathy and bonding, and ""catching"" yawns happens with many social mammals, among them humans, chimpanzees and dogs, researchers say. The study -- ""Contagious yawning and psychopathy"" -- involved 135 college student respondents and was published online in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. ""You may yawn, even if you don't have to,"" said lead researcher Brian Rundle, a doctoral student in psychology and neuroscience in Baylor's College of Arts and Sciences. ""We all know it and always wonder why. I thought, 'If it's true that yawning is related to empathy, I'll bet that psychopaths yawn a lot less.' So I put it to the test."" Psychopathy is characterized by an antisocial lifestyle, including being selfish, manipulative, impulsive, fearless, domineering and, in particular, lacking in empathy, previous research has shown. Students in the Baylor study first took a standard psychological test -- the 156-question Psychopathic Personality Inventory, with questions aimed at determining their degree of cold-heartedness, fearless dominance and self-centered impulsivity. ""It's not an 'on/off' of whether you're a psychopath,"" Rundle said. ""It's a spectrum."" Next, students were seated in a dim room in front of computers. They wore noise-canceling headphones, with electrodes placed below their eyelids, next to the outer corners of their eyes, on their foreheads and to index and middle fingers. They were shown 10-second video clips of different facial movements -- a yawn, a laugh or a neutral face -- with 10 seconds of blank screen separating 20 video snippets of those expressions. Based on the psychological test results, the frequency of yawns and the amount of physiological response of muscle, nerve and skin, the study showed that the less empathy a person had, the less likely he or she was to ""catch"" a yawn. ""The take-home lesson is not that if you yawn and someone else doesn't, the other person is a psychopath,"" Rundle cautions. ""A lot of people didn't yawn, and we know that we're not very likely to yawn in response to a stranger we don't have empathetic connections with. ""But what we found tells us there is a neurological connection -- some overlap -- between psychopathy and contagious yawning. This is a good starting point to ask more questions.""

More studies need to be done, but we think there s potentially no limit on the diseases this screening technique could be applied to other than the human imagination,  says Jeffrey Mumm, Ph.D., associate professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute and McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Essentially, says Mumm, their method is an adaptation of high throughput screening (HTS), an automated system developed in the 1980s that uses robotic equipment to  dose  cell or tissue samples with candidate drugs in wells of lab dishes known as microtiter plates. The plates act as miniature test tubes and enable specially programmed computers to find chemical compounds that produce a desired effect, such as prompting cells to produce particular proteins or increase in number, positive findings known as hits. Because the microtiter plates contain hundreds of wells and the entire process is automated, tens of thousands of samples can be processed daily, increasing the chances of finding a hit quickly.Unfortunately, Mumm says, the vast majority of hits discovered in the past using cell-based HTS techniques haven t proven effective when tested in whole animals because cells and tissues lack the complicated and dynamic biology of whole animals. In an effort to adapt HTS to whole animal screening   and more quickly find drugs more likely to work in humans   a team led by Mumm and Michael Parsons, Ph.D., associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, turned to zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish have long been used as model organisms for biological research because they re transparent, making the effects of experiments easily visible, and because they share most of their genes with humans. Using standard genetic engineering technology, the researchers bred zebrafish in which pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin glowed yellow, and other pancreatic cells not responsible for producing insulin glowed red. The scientists then placed embryos from the modified fish in microtiter plate wells and tested thousands of compounds from a Johns Hopkins library of drugs, most of which were already approved for human use. Overall, each compound was screened at six different concentrations, which, they report, increased the chances of finding a hit while decreasing the chances of a false negative. Computer programs automatically monitored the effects on the embryos by  looking  for differences in the amount of yellow glow, which signified an increase in beta cell number. After evaluating more than 500,000 zebrafish embryos, the researchers identified 24 compounds that effectively increased beta cell number in these animals, Mumm says. Besides identifying new drug candidates, the research also identified biological pathways not previously known to have an effect on beta cell production. For example, some of the newly identified drugs appeared to increase beta cell production through a pathway involving serotonin, a chemical better known for transmitting signals in the brain. The authors suggest that if these newly identified drug candidates have the same effect in other lab models and, eventually, humans, they might someday be used directly to increase beta cell numbers in people who take them or for more effectively growing beta cells in the lab for transplant. In the meantime, they add, this new technique could be used to speed drug discovery for a variety of other medical conditions, from heart disease to neurodegenerative conditions to birth defects.","Published: August 21, 2015"

The work was done by Saba Emrani and Hamid Krim, researchers in the National Science Foundation Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies, or ASSIST Center, which is based at NC State.  Researchers at ASSIST have developed wearable sensors that are powered by a patient s body heat and can monitor the sound of a patient s breathing,  says Krim, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State and senior author of a paper on the work.  Now we ve developed an algorithm that can assess the onset time, pitch and magnitude (or volume) of wheezing sounds to give healthcare professionals information about the condition of the lungs. This information, in turn, can be used to help doctors make more informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment.  Wheezing sounds vary depending on where the problem is in the lungs and on the severity of the problem, Krim explains. The algorithm accounts for these differences to tell doctors exactly what is going on.  The algorithm is effective regardless of the physical size of the patient,  Krim says,  and is able to handle the variability and complexity associated with breathing patterns.  Because the algorithm was developed to work in concert with wearable technology, the goal is for it to ultimately be used to continuously assess the sound of a patient s breathing over time. This would make it possible for doctors to monitor breathing under a patient s real-world, day-to-day conditions. Here s how the system is eventually supposed to work: sensors that monitor breathing transmit information to a smart device, such as a smartphone. That data is then run through the algorithm. If the algorithm finds that there is a breathing problem, the smart device could then notify the patient and his or her medical provider. Moreover, due to the low computational cost of the algorithm, the long-term goal is for it to be implemented on the sensor device itself. The sensor would then transmit an alert to the smart device only if it detects a problem. But while researchers have come a long way, they still have challenges to address.  We have the sensors and we have the algorithm   and we know that they work   but we haven t yet integrated them into a smart device. That s next,  Krim says.  We re currently weighing whether to modify the sensors so that they can run the algorithm and transmit only if there is a problem, or to maintain the current approach of having the sensor transmit all of the data so that the smart device runs the algorithm. ASSIST is also working to develop sensors that can operate wirelessly, so that the sensors don t need to be physically connected to the smart device.  Krim also notes that it s difficult to assess the cost of the relevant hardware at this point, since it s still under development.","Published: August 21, 2015"

The treatment aimed at suppressing abnormal angiogenesis (blood vessel growth) which is recognized as the cause of many eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. The researchers reported that the AMSCs successfully migrated to the retinas of the test animals and, because of the growth factors secreted by the cells, were able to suppress retinal neovascularization. The benefit of using MSCs in stem cell therapy is their ability to self-renew and differentiate into a variety of specialized cell types, such as osteoblasts (cells that contribute to bone formation), chondrocytes (cartilage cells), adipocytes (fat cells), myocardiocytes (heart muscle cells), and neuron-like cells (nervous system cells). In addition, it has been shown that MSCs have the ability to modulate the immune response and reduce local inflammation. They can be isolated from a variety of sources, such as adipose (fat) tissues, tendons, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, human placenta, and bone marrow. MSCs have been successfully transplanted in a number of disease models for which they have been shown to offer therapeutic benefits. MSCs isolated from human placenta, however, may be richer in growth factors than those derived from other sources because of their essential role in fetal development, said the researchers. According to the researchers, AMSCs secrete higher levels of certain growth factors (such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF- ) and cytokines) than MSCs derived from other sources, such as fat or bone. The beneficial growth factors secreted by the placenta-derived stem cells included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), the latter, a well-known natural inhibitor of angiogenesis. They also cited the abundance of placental tissues over other sources, and the greater ease of MSC isolation from these growth factor-rich tissues as another benefit for their therapeutic use. ""Placenta-derived MSCs have powerful immunomodulatory functions,"" said study co-author Dr. Jisook Moon, Department of Applied Bioscience and Department of Engineering, CHA University, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Korea. ""In our study the AMSCs were administered via intraperitoneal injection. Detection of the transplanted cells in the retina illustrated their ability to migrate from the site of injection to the injured tissue. The blood brain barrier (BBB) restricts the permeation of molecules and cells through the circulatory system into the central nervous system (CNS). Confirming that AMSCs were able to traverse the BBB was crucial in elucidating whether or not these cells are viable candidates for treatment of retinopathy. The researchers concluded that although further studies are needed to confirm the effect of AMSCs on neovascular diseases, the data collected in their study provided insights into the mechanisms by which these cells exert their therapeutic effects. ""As the researchers astutely pointed out, the use of a tissue that would normally be discarded as biomedical waste circumvents the need for using invasive procedures to obtain stem cells for therapeutic purposes,"" said Dr. Cesar Borlongan, President Elect of the International Placenta Stem Cell Society.

The researchers say TDP-43 is normally responsible for keeping unwanted stretches of the genetic material RNA, called cryptic exons, from being used by nerve cells to make proteins. When TDP-43 bunches up inside those cells, it malfunctions, lifting the brakes on cryptic exons and causing a cascade of events that kills brain or spinal cord cells.  TDP-43 s role in both healthy and diseased cells has long been a mystery, and we hope that solving it will open new pathways toward preventing and treating ALS and FTD,  says Philip Wong, Ph.D., a professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and senior author of the study.Almost a decade ago, Wong says, scientists first described the clumps of TDP-43 that commonly appear in the degenerated brain or nerve cells of those with FTD or ALS. But whether the clumps were a cause or an effect of the diseases, and exactly what they did, was unknown.  Some people thought that the aggregates themselves were toxic,  says Jonathan Ling, a graduate student in Wong s lab and first author of the new paper.  Another theory is that the aggregates were just preventing TDP-43 from doing what it should be doing, and that was the problem.  To figure out which theory might be right, Ling deleted the gene for TDP-43 from both lab-grown mouse and human cells and detected abnormal processing of strands of RNA, genetic material responsible for coding and decoding DNA blueprint instructions for making proteins. Specifically, they found that cryptic exons   segments of RNA usually blocked by cells from becoming part of the final RNA used to make a protein   were in fact working as blueprints. With the cryptic exons included rather than blocked, proteins involved in key processes in the studied cells were abnormal. When the researchers studied brain autopsies from patients with ALS and FTD, they confirmed that not only were there buildups of TDP-43, but also cryptic exons in the degenerated brain cells. In the brains of healthy people, however, they saw no cryptic exons. This finding, the investigators say, suggests that when TDP-43 is clumped together, it no longer works, causing cells to function abnormally as though there s no TDP-43 at all. TDP-43 only recognizes one particular class of cryptic exon, but other proteins can block many types of exons, so Ling and Wong next tested what would happen when they added one of these blocking proteins to directly target cryptic exons in cells missing TDP-43. Indeed, adding this protein allowed cells to block cryptic exons and remain disease-free.  What s thought provoking is that we may soon be able to fix this in patients who have lots of accumulated TDP-43,  says Ling. Ling cautions that questions remain about the role of TDP-43 in ALS and FTD.  We ve explained what happens after TDP-43 is lost, but we still don t know why it aggregates in the first place,  he says. Wong s group is planning studies that may answer these questions, as well as additional tests on how to treat TDP-43 pathology in humans. The ALS Association estimates that as many as 30,000 Americans are living with ALS at any given time, and more than 5,000 people are newly diagnosed each year. There is no cure for the disease, and most people live two to five years after diagnosis. Similarly, FTD   thought to affect around 50,000 people in the U.S.   has no treatment and shortens life span.","Published: August 21, 2015"

It cleanses pathogens and toxins from blood circulating through a dialysis-like circuit. Now, the Wyss Institute team has developed an improved device that synergizes with conventional antibiotic therapies and that has been streamlined to better position it for near-term translation to the clinic. The improved design is described in the October volume 67 of Biomaterials. Sepsis is a common and frequently fatal medical complication that can occur when a person's body attempts to fight off serious infection. Resulting widespread inflammation can cause organs to shut down, blood pressure to drop, and the heart to weaken. This can lead to septic shock, and more than 30 percent of septic patients in the United States eventually die. In most cases, the pathogen responsible for triggering the septic condition is never pinpointed, so clinicians blindly prescribe an antibiotic course in a blanket attempt to stave off infectious bacteria and halt the body's dangerous inflammatory response. But sepsis can be caused by a wide-ranging variety of pathogens that are not susceptible to antibiotics, including viruses, fungi and parasites. What's more, even when antibiotics are effective at killing invading bacteria, the dead pathogens fragment and release toxins into the patient's bloodstream. ""The inflammatory cascade that leads to sepsis is triggered by pathogens, and specifically by the toxins they release,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who leads the Wyss team developing the device and is the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science. ""Thus, the most effective strategy is to treat with the best antibiotics you can muster, while also removing the toxins and remaining pathogens from the patient's blood as quickly as possible."" The Wyss team's blood-cleansing approach can be administered quickly, even without identifying the infectious agent. This is because it uses the Wyss Institute's proprietary pathogen-capturing agent, FcMBL, that binds all types of live and dead infectious microbes, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, as well as toxins they release. FcMBL is a genetically engineered blood protein inspired by a naturally-occurring human molecule called Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL), which is found in the innate immune system and binds to toxic invaders, marking them for capture by immune cells in the spleen. The original device concept was similar to how a dialysis machine works: infected blood in an animal, or potentially one day in a patient, is flowed from one vein through catheters to the device where FcMBL-coated magnetic beads are added to the blood, and then the bead-bound pathogens are extracted from the circulating blood by magnets within the device before the cleansed blood is returned to the body through another vein. The new and improved device removes the complexity, regulatory challenges and cost associated with the magnetic beads and microfluidic architecture of its predecessor, but it retains the ability of the FcMBL protein to bind to all different kinds of live or dead pathogens and toxins. The optimized system uses hollow fiber filters found in already-FDA-approved dialysis cartridges whose inner walls are coated with FcMBL protein to remove pathogens from circulating blood. In animal studies, treatment with this new pathogen-extracting device reduced the number of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and endotoxins circulating in the bloodstream by more than 99 percent. ""Using the device, alone or alongside antibiotics, we can quickly bring blood back to normal conditions, curtailing an inflammatory response rather than exacerbating it,"" said the paper's first author Tohid Fatanat Didar, Ph.D., Postdoctoral Fellow at the Wyss Institute and Research Fellow at Boston Children's Hospital. ""If all goes well, physicians will someday be able to use the device in tandem with standard antibiotic treatments to deliver a one-two punch to pathogens, synergistically killing and cleansing all live and dead invaders from the bloodstream."" With the new improved blood-cleansing therapeutic device proving extremely effective in small animal studies, the Wyss team is planning to move to large animal studies as a next step to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that is required before it could advance to human clinical trials. ""Seeing our system work in animal models gives us confidence that this could work in humans, because we are successfully treating animals infected with human pathogens,"" said Wyss Senior Staff Scientist Michael Super, Ph.D., who works on the Institute's Advanced Technology Team and is also an author on the new study. ""Since the development of earlier prototypes of the device, we've applied the Wyss model of de-risking the technology to prime it for commercialization,"" said Ingber. ""Our goal is to see this move out of the lab and into hospitals as well as onto the battlefield, where it can save lives within years rather than decades.""","Published: August 21, 2015"

As a result, scientists have struggled to develop an effective vaccine for HIV for thirty years. ""The results are pretty spectacular,"" said Dennis Burton, chair of the TSRI Department of Immunology and Microbial Science and scientific director of two centers at TSRI, the IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Consortium (NAC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology and Immunogen Discovery (CHAVI-ID).  The study was co-led by Dr. Burton, TSRI Professor and IAVI NAC Director of Vaccine Design William Schief, and TSRI Professor David Nemazee. The Cell study was co-led by Dr. Schief and Michel Nussenzweig, who is Zanvil A. Cohn and Ralph M. Steinman Professor at The Rockefeller University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator.  The researchers' long-term goal is to design a vaccine that prompts the body to produce antibodies that bind to HIV and prevent infection.  The challenges in developing an HIV vaccine have led many researchers to believe that a successful AIDS vaccine will need to consist of a series of shots of related, but slightly different, proteins (immunogens) to train the body to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies that will work against nearly all strains of HIV   a twist on the traditional ""booster"" shot, in which a person is exposed to the same immunogen multiple times.  In the new studies, the scientists tested one of these potential proteins, an immunogen called eOD-GT8 60mer designed to bind and activate B cells needed to fight HIV. The eOD-GT8 60mer was developed in the Schief lab and tested in mouse models engineered by the Nemazee lab to produce antibodies that resemble human antibodies.  Using a technique called B cell sorting, the researchers showed that immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody ""precursors"" with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection. This suggested that eOD-GT8 60mer could be a good candidate to serve as the first in a series of immunizations against HIV.  ""The vaccine appears to work well in our mouse model to 'prime' the antibody response,"" said Dr. Nemazee.  In the Cell paper, researchers used the same eOD-GT8 60mer immunogen but a slightly different mouse model.  The immunogen again launched the immune system in the right direction,"" said Dr. Schief.  A concurrent study also in Science, led by Professor John Moore of Weill Cornell Medical College, showed engineered immunogens also triggered immune responses in rabbit models and non-human primate models.  With eOD-GT8 60mer in the running as a potential contributor to an HIV vaccine, the researchers are now investigating other immunogens that could work in conjunction with it.  Dr. Schief said the Nemazee lab s mouse models will be crucial resources for testing other engineered immunogens. He emphasized the importance of bringing different disciplines together to engineer mouse models, design antibodies and analyze results. ""This was a beautiful collaboration of three labs at TSRI,"" he said.","Published: August 21, 2015"

Better understanding their impact on memory could lead to a better understanding of neurodegenerative diseases in humans, including Alzheimer's and Huntington's. ""Our systematic screen offers an important first step toward the comprehensive identification of all miRNAs and their potential targets that serve in gene networks important for normal learning and memory,"" said Ron Davis, chair of TSRI's Department of Neuroscience, who led the study. ""This is a valuable resource for future studies.""  Unlike some types of RNA, miRNAs do not code for proteins. Instead, they regulate various biological processes by modulating the level of gene expression. A number of studies have shown that miRNAs are critical for normal development and cellular growth and may contribute to the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases.  In the new study, 134 different miRNAs were tested for roles in learning and memory in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, which is a recognized animal model for memory studies.  The researchers tested the potential involvement of miRNAs in intermediate-term memory by silencing them individually and identified at least five different miRNAs involved in memory formation or retention.  ""Among the five miRNAs identified in this study, we found one that is necessary for memory formation,"" said Research Associate Germain U. Busto, a first author of the study with Research Associate Tugba Guven-Ozkan. ""Interestingly, its human counterpart is altered in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer s and Huntington s. It s possible that this might be a potential model to study and solve some specific aspects of those disorders.""  Surprisingly, the researchers found some miRNAs decreased memory formation, while others increased it. The identified miRNAs affected either neuronal physiology underlying memory formation or the development of the nervous system.  ""These microRNAs are highly regulated during brain development and for adult brain function,"" said Dr. Guven-Ozkan. ""When misregulated, they may exacerbate brain diseases like autism, and Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases.

The finding, they say, advances the scientific understanding of how DNA segments get moved around among bacteria, often bringing with them genes that confer toxicity or antibiotic resistance.  The protein, called IstB, is genetically similar to a whole family of related proteins found in bacteria, plants and animals, so the Johns Hopkins team says it was surprised to learn that its structure and function are not so similar to those of its family members.  What we learned is that IstB showcases the ability of natural selection to find new uses for class of enzyme that s been around a very long time,  says James Berger, Ph.D., professor of biophysics and biophysical chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.At the heart of the research, Berger says, is a piece of DNA, called IS21, which is a type of transposon, or jumping gene. These segments of DNA hold the blueprint for making proteins that can cut and otherwise manipulate DNA to leave one spot in a genome and land elsewhere. On its own, Berger points out, a jumping gene is neither helpful nor harmful but can become so if, for example, it inserts itself into and disrupts a normally functional gene.  Or it could take a nearby gene with it when it jumps,  he adds.  That gene will then be in new surroundings and under new control, which could be helpful or harmful to an organism depending on the gene s function.  Berger says he and postdoctoral fellow Ernesto Arias-Palomo, Ph.D., were aware that IS21 is found in some disease-causing bacteria, like plague s Yersinia pestis, and close to genes that make those bacteria toxic to people.  That made us suspect it might play a role in moving those genes around, which can ultimately cause the transfer of harmful genes to previously harmless bacteria,  he says. To examine the idea, the team focused on IstB, one of the two proteins IS21 encodes. The other encoded protein is IstA, which cuts and pastes the IS21 transposon. IstB is its helper protein. The team knew based on IstB s genetic sequence that it contains a  reactor  site that extracts the energy found in certain chemical molecules and uses it to alter DNA. But how it works and how it collaborates with IstA was a mystery. Using X-rays and beams of electrons to probe IstB s structure and function, the researchers found that IstB is made of 10 smaller units, which are organized into two parallel horseshoes of five units each. Double strands of DNA fit in between.  What we saw is that IstB can take a straight piece of DNA and bend it 180 degrees, or take a bent piece of DNA and hold it in that position,  says Berger.  That primes the DNA for the insertion of a transposon. Biochemical tests further showed that IstA recognizes the bent DNA bound by IstB and kicks off the IstB, probably to make the DNA accessible for the cuts it will make, explains Berger.","Published: August 21, 2015"

Disruption of this sorting pathway in neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases severely hampers the efficient communication between neurons. Joris de Wit (VIB/KU Leuven): ""Our results suggest that therapeutic targeting of this pathway may prove efficacious in treating multiple neurological diseases. Jeff and I started this work in the US, when Jeff was a postdoc with John R. Yates III at The Scripps Research Institute and I was a postdoc with Anirvan Ghosh at the University of California San Diego. We continued this work after we both established our own labs, with the help of Lu s Ribeiro here at VIB/KU Leuven. This intense international collaboration has enabled us to use cutting-edge proteomic technology to study the entire synaptic machinery rather than individual elements. Our work identifies a master regulator of sorting of synaptic proteins and shows that experimental disruption of this pathway impedes efficient communication between neurons. Mutations in this sorting pathway have been found in several synaptic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Our work highlights the importance of proper synaptic protein sorting for efficient neuronal communication and suggests that therapeutic targeting of this pathway could prove beneficial to improve synaptic function in brain disorders."" Key findings of the paper Synapses are specialized, protein-rich cell junctions that are essential for normal brain function and are dysfunctional in many diseases and disorders of the nervous system. Synapses are made up of many different proteins that link neurons together and regulate communication between these cells. Our results now show that perturbed sorting of these synaptic proteins hampers neuron-neuron communication and culminates in an increased level of silent synapses. These results highlight the importance of proper synaptic protein sorting, which was a previously under-appreciated aspect of synapse development, function, and disease.

The structure and function of this root network can be highly adapted to particular environments, such as desert soils where plants like Mesquite develop tap roots capable of digging 50 meters deep to capture precious water resources.  Excavation of root systems reveals these kinds of adaptations but is laborious, time consuming, and does not provide information on how growing roots behave. Despite their importance, roots remain one of the most mysterious parts of the plant. They cannot easily be studied since they grow hidden in soil. Most of what scientists know about roots today comes from either digging up roots, or growing them in transparent media that do not reflect their natural environment.  To visualize the intricate growth patterns and functions of roots we needed to develop a different approach,  Dinneny explained.  We were very mindful that the method had to allow us to vary conditions, in order to present roots with different combinations of environmental conditions that simulate important stresses such as drought or low-fertility soil. The team s imaging system is called GLO-Roots (for Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots). It is an integrated platform for growing plants in soil in custom-built vessels, imaging roots using bioluminescence, and analyzing root growth, architecture and gene expression using software designed in collaboration with Guillaume Lobet at the University of Li ge.  The GLO-Roots system involved the genetic engineering of plants to produce an enzyme from fireflies called luciferase, which causes them to glow in the dark of the soil.  Light-sensitive cameras then detect the light emitted by the roots and allow researchers to discriminate between the roots and the surrounding soil.  Using multiple genetically encoded luciferases, each one emitting light of a different wavelength, the team was able to simultaneously track whole root system architecture and the gene expression of adult plants.  Roots grow through a pathfinding process, somewhat like neurons, and must make decisions regarding which direction to grow and when to branch.  This is heavily influenced by soil quality and the location of water and nutrients.  Our ability to track gene expression using GLO-Roots is a game changer that will enable an understanding of the molecular events enabling these root decisions,  explained Dinneny. The Dinneny lab used GLO-Roots to study the response of roots to environmental stresses relevant to sustainable agriculture.  Understanding how root architecture is altered by environmental conditions and stresses can teach scientists how plants adapt to their surroundings and also about the genetic and biochemical activities underlying these adaptive processes. The team s findings may be particularly important for understanding how plants survive during droughts.  The GLO-Roots system enabled Dinneny and his team to track growth rate and direction of dozens of root tips simultaneously and relate this to the amount of water present in the soil surrounding the roots.  Rub n R llan- lvarez, the lead post-doctoral scientist on the project and current assistant professor at Langebio, Cinvestav in Irapuato, M xico, found that simulated drought caused roots to growth deeper into the soil column, presumably enabling access to untapped water resources.  This project combines two of Carnegie Science s historical strengths: development of advanced imaging platforms and understanding of how plants acclimate to their environment.  Our study shows that roots have several tricks that enable efficient recovery of water from their environment,  R llan- lvarez said. The GLO-Roots system will enable the characterization of genetic pathways that enable efficient exploration of the soil environment, which may be relevant to establishing strategies for sustainable and drought-tolerant agriculture.","Published: August 21, 2015"

Weiner, PhD, a professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and colleagues published their work recently. The experimental, preventive vaccine, given six weeks before exposure to the MERS virus, was found to fully protect rhesus macaques from disease. The vaccine also generated potentially protective antibodies in blood drawn from camels, the purported source of MERS transmission in the Middle East. MERS is caused by an emerging human coronavirus, which is distinct from the SARS coronavirus. Since its identification in 2012, MERS has been linked to over 1,300 infections and close to 400 deaths. It has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, and in the U.S.  The recent 2015 outbreak in South Korea was of great concern as the infection spread from a single patient to infect more than 181 people, resulting in hospital closings, severe economic impact, and more than 30 deaths. During this outbreak rapid human-to-human transmission was documented with in-hospital transmission the most common route of infection. The significant recent increase in MERS cases, coupled with the lack of effective antiviral therapies or vaccines to treat or prevent this infection, have raised significant concern,  Weiner said.  Accordingly the development of a vaccine for MERS remains a high priority.  The vaccine was able to prevent MERS disease in the monkeys and offered benefit to 100 percent of the animals in this study in terms of minimizing symptoms. In addition, the vaccine induced antibodies that are linked with protection in camels, a species that is thought to be a major source of transmission to humans in the Middle East, showing that this vaccine could be deployed to break this this link in the MERS transmission cycle. In the field, say the researchers, this vaccine could decrease person-to-person spread of infection in the event of an outbreak and help to protect health care workers or exposed individuals.   This study was only possible by bringing together an international group of investigators with the necessary skills, including, the lab of Heinz Feldmann at the NIH, Gary Kobinger from the Canadian government, scientists from Inovio who developed the plasmid delivery technology, along with Penn colleagues,  said first author Karuppiah Muthumani, PhD, a research assistant professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.  This simple synthetic vaccine has the potential to overcome important production and deployment limitations, and what s more, the vaccine is non-live, so does not pose a risk of spreading to unintended individuals.  Collaborators include researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, the University of Washington, and the University of South Florida.","Published: August 21, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/a-metabolic-master-switch-underlying-human-obesity-186279,A Metabolic Master Switch Underlying Human Obesity Researchers find pathway that controls metabolism by prompting fat cells to store or burn fat  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Obesity is one of the biggest public health challenges of the 21st century. Affecting more than 500 million people worldwide, obesity costs at least $200 billion each year in the United States alone, and contributes to potentially fatal disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. But there may now be a new approach to prevent and even cure obesity, thanks to a study led by researchers at MIT and Harvard Medical School. By analyzing the cellular circuitry underlying the strongest genetic association with obesity, the researchers have unveiled a new pathway that controls human metabolism by prompting our adipocytes, or fat cells, to store fat or burn it away.  Obesity has traditionally been seen as the result of an imbalance between the amount of food we eat and how much we exercise, but this view ignores the contribution of genetics to each individual s metabolism,  says senior author Manolis Kellis, a professor of computer science and a member of MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and of the Broad Institute. New mechanism found The strongest association with obesity resides in a gene region known as  FTO,  which has been the focus of intense scrutiny since its discovery in 2007. However, previous studies have failed to find a mechanism to explain how genetic differences in the region lead to obesity.  Many studies attempted to link the FTO region with brain circuits that control appetite or propensity to exercise,  says first author Melina Claussnitzer, a visiting professor at CSAIL and instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  Our results indicate that the obesity-associated region acts primarily in adipocyte progenitor cells in a brain-independent way.  To recognize the cell types where the obesity-associated region may act, the researchers used annotations of genomic control switches across more than 100 tissues and cell types. They found evidence of a major control switchboard in human adipocyte progenitor cells, suggesting that genetic differences may affect the functioning of human fat stores. To study the effects of genetic differences in adipocytes, the researchers gathered adipose samples from healthy Europeans carrying either the risk or the non-risk version of the region. They found that the risk version activated a major control region in adipocyte progenitor cells, which turned on two distant genes, IRX3 and IRX5. Control of thermogenesis Follow-up experiments showed that IRX3 and IRX5 act as master controllers of a process known as thermogenesis, whereby adipocytes dissipate energy as heat, instead of storing it as fat. Thermogenesis can be triggered by exercise, diet, or exposure to cold, and occurs both in mitochondria-rich brown adipocytes that are developmentally related to muscle, and in beige adipocytes that are instead related to energy-storing white adipocytes.  Early studies of thermogenesis focused primarily on brown fat, which plays a major role in mice, but is virtually nonexistent in human adults,  Claussnitzer says.  This new pathway controls thermogenesis in the more abundant white fat stores instead, and its genetic association with obesity indicates it affects global energy balance in humans.  The researchers predicted that a genetic difference of only one nucleotide is responsible for the obesity association. In risk individuals, a thymine (T) is replaced by a cytosine (C) nucleobase, which disrupts repression of the control region and turns on IRX3 and IRX5. This then turns off thermogenesis, leading to lipid accumulation and ultimately obesity. By editing a single nucleotide position using the CRISPR/Cas9 system   a technology that allows researchers to make precise changes to a DNA sequence   the researchers could switch between lean and obese signatures in human pre-adipocytes. Switching the C to a T in risk individuals turned off IRX3 and IRX5, restored thermogenesis to non-risk levels, and switched off lipid storage genes.  Knowing the causal variant underlying the obesity association may allow somatic genome editing as a therapeutic avenue for individuals carrying the risk allele,  Kellis says.  But more importantly, the uncovered cellular circuits may allow us to dial a metabolic master switch for both risk and non-risk individuals, as a means to counter environmental, lifestyle, or genetic contributors to obesity.  Success in human and mouse cells The researchers showed that they could indeed manipulate this new pathway to reverse the signatures of obesity in both human cells and mice. In primary adipose cells from either risk or non-risk individuals, altering the expression of either IRX3 or IRX5 switched between energy-storing white adipocyte functions and energy-burning beige adipocyte functions. Similarly, repression of IRX3 in mouse adipocytes led to dramatic changes in whole-body energy balance, resulting in a reduction of body weight and all major fat stores, and complete resistance to a high-fat diet.  By manipulating this new pathway, we could switch between energy storage and energy dissipation programs at both the cellular and the organismal level, providing new hope for a cure against obesity,  Kellis says. The researchers are currently establishing collaborations in academia and industry to translate their findings into obesity therapeutics. They are also using their approach as a model to understand the circuitry of other disease-associated regions in the human genome. The paper is a tour de force, according to Evan Rosen, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the research.  The researchers present a near-complete unveiling of how a genetic risk allele in a noncoding region of the genome really works,  Rosen says.  It s really an extraordinary piece of science, and it provides a template for how we should be approaching these genetic variants in all disease areas. ","Published: August 21, 2015"

Yet, its cause remains unknown despite more than 80 years of research since the disorder was first described in 1935. Using the DNA of thousands of women and genotyping nearly 700,000 genetic markers from each individual, an international team led by Northwestern Medicine investigators has identified two new genetic susceptibility regions that appear to be unique to European women with PCOS, as well as one region also present in Chinese women with PCOS. Most importantly, one of these new regions contains the gene for the pituitary hormone gonadotropin, FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), providing evidence that disruption in this pathway that regulates ovarian function plays an essential role in the development of PCOS. Identifying the genes associated with PCOS give us clues about the biological pathways that cause the disorder,  said senior author Andrea Dunaif, MD, Charles F. Kettering Professor of Endocrinology and Metabolism in the Department of Medicine.  Understanding these pathways can lead to new treatments and disease prevention approaches.   There are no FDA-approved drugs for PCOS,  Dr. Dunaif said.  We can manage symptoms and improve fertility in patients but, without understanding the cause of PCOS, we cannot cure the condition.   Large-scale genetic analyses that became possible after the mapping of the human genome allow us to investigate the entire genome for disease-causing DNA variants,  she said.  This information will be critical for the development of effective treatments for PCOS and for genetic testing to identify at-risk girls before the onset of symptoms.  PCOS affects seven to 10 percent of reproductive-age women worldwide with symptoms such as increased male-pattern hair growth, weight gain, irregular periods and infertility. These symptoms are due to increased production of male hormones, in particular testosterone, by the ovary and disordered secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH, resulting in anovulation (the absence of ovulation). As a result of previous research from Dr. Dunaif s lab, PCOS also is associated with insulin resistance and is now recognized as a leading risk factor for type-2 diabetes in young women. Her group has been at the forefront of genetic studies of PCOS and has shown that male relatives and the children of affected women are at increased risk type 2 diabetes and reproductive problems. This study complements a recent genome-wide association study of Chinese women that identified 11 PCOS susceptibility regions of the genome. The regions include the genes for the receptors for the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. LH and FSH acting through these receptors regulate the production of ovarian hormones, such as estradiol and testosterone (ovaries make both male and female hormones), as well as the maturation and ovulation of the egg. Taken together with the current study, finding the gene for FSH hormone itself, these analyses implicate genes regulating gonadotropins and their actions in causing PCOS.  For a number of years, researchers had been thinking that it was testosterone produced by the ovary that was a major problem in PCOS, but our study did not find signals for genes regulating testosterone,  Dr. Dunaif said.  In contrast, we did find a signal for the FSH gene, which is produced in the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. This suggests that FSH, in either how it acts on the ovary or how it is secreted, is very important in the development of PCOS. This is a new way of thinking about the biology of PCOS.  The current study included three phases with three different sets of DNA. All of the DNA was from women of European ancestry, those with PCOS and those without it (the controls).  My lab focuses on big data analysis such as this genome wide analysis to identify genetic variants that are associated with increased disease risk,  said M. Geoffrey Hayes, PhD, assistant professor of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Molecular Medicine and lead author of the study, who specializes in statistical genetics at Feinberg.  We genotyped nearly 700,000 markers across the genomes in each of nearly 4,000 women from the U.S. in the first phase. Then we replicated our findings with two additional groups of more than 4,500 women from the U.S. and Europe.  Hayes is also an assistant professor of Anthropology at Northwestern s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Altogether, nearly 9,000 individual DNA samples were used in the study with samples provided from Northwestern Medicine and partner institutions around the world. The NUgene Project, a genomic biobank sponsored by the Center for Genetic Medicine in partnership with Northwestern Medicine, provided many of the control samples.  The next step in this research is to use the genetic variations in the genes that confer increased risk for PCOS and build models to investigate the how the biologic pathways implicated are disrupted functionally,  Hayes said.  One of the three gene regions identified in our study in Europeans was also found in Chinese suggesting that there may be some shared genetic susceptibility to PCOS in Europeans and Chinese, who diverged evolutionarily more than 40,000 years ago. We plan to DNA sequence the regions that we found in common with the Chinese.  The Northwestern Medicine scientists are partnering with Professor Zi-Jiang Chen and her colleagues at Shandong University, PRC to advance this work. More genome-wide association studies of PCOS are needed in other racial and ethnic groups. Next, the scientists plan to investigate the genomes of women of African ancestry with the disorder. These studies will provide insight into the shared genetic basis for PCOS and will aid in the finding of the genes that are key players in the development of the disease across ethnicities.","Published: August 21, 2015"

""I have seen first-hand the devastating impact advanced basal cell carcinoma can have on those living with the disease. As the lesions are usually highly visible and located predominantly on the face, they can impact patients both physically and emotionally,"" said Reinhard Dummer, MD, Professor and Vice Chairman, Department of Dermatology at the University of Zurich. ""The approval of Odomzo brings new hope in the form of a non-invasive option to help treat this disfiguring and potentially life-threatening disease."" Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) consists of abnormal, uncontrolled growths or lesions that arise in the skin's basal cells, which line the deepest layer of the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin) and accounts for more than 80% of non-melanoma skin cancers. Advanced BCC is thought to represent roughly 1-10% of all cases of BCC. Although BCC rarely becomes advanced, there have been few treatment options at this stage of the disease. Worldwide incidence of BCC is rising by 10% each year due to factors such as an aging population and increased ultraviolet exposure. The EU approval of Odomzo was based on data from the Phase II randomized, double-blind, multi-center BOLT (Basal cell carcinoma Outcomes in LDE225 Trial) study in patients with laBCC not amenable to local therapy or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC). In patients with laBCC treated with Odomzo 200 mg, the objective response rate (ORR) was 56% per central review and 71% per investigator review. The median duration of response per central review has not been reached. The median progression-free survival was 22 months per central review and 19 months per investigator review. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients treated with Odomzo 200 mg were fatigue, decreased weight and muscle spasms. ""We are pleased to have a new treatment option for European patients living with advanced basal cell carcinoma,"" said Bruno Strigini, President, Novartis Oncology. ""This milestone follows the recent approval of Odomzo in the US and is the latest example of our commitment to precision oncology and developing targeted treatments to address unmet needs."" The EU approval follows a positive opinion adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in June 2015 and applies to all 28 EU member states, plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Outside the EU, Odomzo is approved in the United States, Australia and Switzerland. Additional regulatory submissions are being reviewed by health authorities worldwide.","Published: August 21, 2015"

These include constructing a resistant outer coat, growing defensive structures on their surface or producing enzymes that break down the DNA of an attacker.  The new research shows that a protein called sigma54 holds a bacterium s defences back until it encounters stress, at which point the protein rearranges its structure to trigger the defences into action. The range of defences that sigma54 controls is so broad that the scientists are moving quickly to learn how to block its action and disable some of the bacteria's armour. The findings of the study have been published by researchers at Imperial College London with collaborators at Peking University in China, Pennsylvania State University and University of Wisconsin-Madison, in the USA. Scientists already knew of sigma54 s existence but in the new research, the team used the UK's national synchrotron facility - Diamond Light Source, based in Oxfordshire - to explore sigma54 s structure and function in minute detail.   A cellular machine called RNA polymerase (RNAP) is essential for enabling bacteria to function. In the study, the team used the advanced capabilities at Diamond s Membrane Protein Laboratory to see for the first time how sigma54 directs RNAP to sit on the bacterial DNA, where it is poised to build the bacteria s defences.  The RNAP-sigma54 complex can only work when it is activated and the scientists have long been trying to find out how sigma54 keeps RNAP in check, at a molecular level. They hope that ultimately, understanding how RNAP is controlled could lead to new ways of disabling bacterial defence mechanisms, and to new compounds that can kill bacteria.  Lead author Professor Xiaodong Zhang, from the Centre for Structural Biology and Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said: ""Bacteria are increasingly developing resistance to antibiotics and with the rise of resistant strains of bacteria that cause diseases like tuberculosis, we desperately need to find new ways of tackling this problem.   The RNAP machine is absolutely essential for a bacterium to function and in our new research we have uncovered multiple strategies that sigma54 uses to silence it. If we can find ways to harness sigma54 s ability to control bacteria s defences, we can potentially inhibit bacteria from functioning normally, or prevent them from defending themselves. We are in the early stages of this research but if we are ultimately successful, we could give medicine the upper hand again,"" she added. Co-author Professor Martin Buck, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London, said, ""Many important bacteria, such as Salmonella and Klebsiella, rely on this mechanism to trigger their stress responses and defences, which makes the prospect of manipulating it all the more tantalising. The use of sigma-54 and RNAP together to control the defences appears to be a very ancient but sophisticated strategy to control gene expression."" This research was funded by the UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) over the last four years, and following the publication of these findings a grant has been awarded from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to explore controlling genes in pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella and Klebsiella.  The structure of the protein was determined by experiments at Diamond Light Source, where Imperial jointly runs the Membrane Protein Laboratory in partnership with Diamond. The cutting-edge laboratory is a research and training facility for scientists interested in solving the 3D structures of membrane proteins by X-ray crystallography. The majority of the work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, with further support from the Chinese National Science Foundation, the China Scholarship Council and the National Institutes of Health.","Published: August 21, 2015"

The team collected breast milk samples from 20 lactating volunteers, irrespective of their habitual NNS intake. Saccharin, sucralose, and acesulfame-potassium were present in 65 percent of samples, and aspartame was not detected. Before this study, saccharin had been the only NNS reported to be found in human breast milk after maternal consumption. The investigators also discovered that, of the six participants who did not knowingly ingest NNS, four of them had detectable levels in their breast milk. This supports the 2014 analysis suggesting many people do not recognize that NNS are present in various foods and beverages they consume. More research is needed to determine how, if at all, exposure to NNS via breast milk affects infants.  Since we don t have information on the effects artificial sweeteners may have on infants, these findings are only a first step, but they represent an important development in our understanding of the topic,  said Rother.","Published: August 21, 2015"

This could improve breast cancer management, particularly in developing countries where pathologists are not routinely available.  To evaluate fresh breast tissue at the point of care could change the current practice of pathology,  says Rebecca Richards-Kortum, Rice University, Houston, Texas.  We have developed a faster means to classify benign and malignant human breast tissues using fresh samples and thereby removing the need for time consuming tissue preparation.  Today, breast cancer diagnosis is an intricate process. Firstly, tissue has to be obtained, then rigorously prepared and assessed, whether this is in the context of core needle biopsy diagnosis or surgical excision. Pathologists must currently undergo a complex method to prepare tissue samples for assessment and this is followed by a lengthy diagnosis process. The researchers used high speed optical microscopy of intact breast tissue specimens to analyze breast tissue. This automated method for diagnosing breast cancer from tissue samples is performed without the need for complex tissue sample preparation or assessment by a specialist pathologist.  We performed our analysis without tissue fixation, cutting and staining, and achieved comparable classification with current methods. This cuts out the tissue preparation process and allows for rapid diagnosis. It is also reliant on measurable criteria, which could reduce subjectivity in the evaluation of breast histology,  says Rebecca Richards-Kortum. The programme analyzes images of freshly cut human breast tissue samples taken using a confocal fluorescence microscope to determine certain parameters typically used in breast tissue analysis. These parameters are then inputted into a classification tree the researchers have developed, to determine whether the tissue sample is benign or malignant. Although this could have substantial clinical relevance, there are limitations that need to be overcome before the software can be regularly used. Certain criteria are reliant on the user s observations, which could lead to incorrect classification of breast tissue. Optical microscopy is not frequently used in patient care because it is costly and has high maintenance requirements. Lead author, Jessica Dobbs, Rice University, says  We are excited about the possibility to use these imaging techniques to improve access to histologic diagnosis in developing regions that lack the human resources and equipment necessary to perform standard histologic assessment.

Electronic data collection has grown rapidly over the course of the last ten years and has already emerged as a common asset in clinical research for the completion of Clinical Outcome Assessments (COA), including the outcomes captured directly from patients; patient reported outcomes (PRO). The global growth of mobile technology has provided a new and efficient method of accessing patients, creating an ideal platform for capturing ePRO assessments. Mobile eCOA has brought a plethora of benefits to clinical studies. In addition to supporting diaries and questionnaires, native apps have proven a highly useful resource for facilitating the collection of objective data from medical devices, such as spirometers and glucometers, and wearable technology including activity trackers, alongside patient diaries. Data from these devices, transmitted directly into an app via Bluetooth , enables the collection of physiological data without the need for the patient to complete a site visit or the requirement to transcribe results manually. Mobile eCOA can also boost patient engagement through the use of a simple, yet familiar interface supported by motivational messages, alerts, reminders and educational materials as appropriate for each study. Additionally, alerts can be raised to sites to highlight missed entries, enabling them to contact patients and discuss any difficulties or misunderstandings before the patient is lost to follow up. Furthermore, mobile offers a safe and secure method of collecting patient data, protecting confidentiality in ePRO through the introduction of unique PINs created by the users. Both data transmission and offline storage is secured through data encryption. Data accessibility enables real-time access to PRO data by sites and sponsor teams through reports and metrics, providing comprehensive oversight to both individual and merged data. Electronic data collection provides the benefit of being applicable through either the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) approach or through provisioning devices. Adoption of the BYOD approach to collect eCOA data, which has been used in late phase post approval studies for some time, is now becoming increasingly used in Phase II & III clinical trials. Moreover, the use of apps simplifies device management, for example, by enabling remote deployment of interim study updates, without any need to recall patients and their devices back to sites. As ePRO has become more embedded as a tool for clinical data capture, many PRO instruments that are widely accepted in paper formats have been adapted into ePRO versions. Since the manual, paper-based process for collecting PROs may not only be cost- and time-inefficient, but also unreliable, mobile devices will play an ever increasing role in the accumulation of patient endpoint data due to its ease of accessibility and cost- and time- efficiency. Tim Davis, CEO and Founder of Exco InTouch, commented:  Mobile eCOA has proved to be highly beneficial and versatile for use in clinical trials, significantly improving the efficiency of studies and the quality of patient reported outcomes. It is set for further expansion and growth as the industry escalates the adoption of existing mobile PRO as the standard approach to self-reported clinical data. ","Published: August 21, 2015"

The study found that people with higher levels of cortisol in the evening were more likely to have a smaller total brain volume and to perform worse on tests of thinking and memory skills. ""Studies have shown that depression increases the risk for dementia, but we don't know much about how this relationship occurs,"" said study author Lenore J. Launer, PhD, of the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md., and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. ""High levels of the stress hormone cortisol have been found in people with depression, and the theory is that cortisol has a toxic effect on the hippocampus area of the brain, which plays an important role in memory."" The study involved 4,244 people with an average age of 76 who did not have dementia. Participants had a brain scan to look at brain volume and took tests of their thinking and memory skills. Saliva samples were taken from the participants once in the morning and in the evening to determine cortisol levels. Participants were divided into three groups based on cortisol levels of high, medium and low. People with the highest level of cortisol were more likely to have a smaller overall brain volume than those with lower levels of cortisol, with a difference of 16 milliliters between the two groups. Those with the highest level of cortisol also performed worse on the memory and thinking tests than those with low levels of the hormone. ""Since this study just looked at a snapshot in time, we don't know which came first: the high levels of cortisol or the loss of brain volume,"" Launer said. ""It's possible that the loss of brain volume that can occur with aging leads to a lesser ability of the brain to stop the effects of cortisol, which in turn leads to further loss of brain cells. Understanding these relationships may help us develop strategies to reduce the effects of cortisol on the brain and thinking skills."" Launer noted that a limitation of the study was that cortisol was tested only during one day, but said that the large size of the study may balance out that limitation.

These and other findings from a new study conducted by researchers at Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, offer the first clinical recommendations for making diagnostic decisions about headaches in pregnant women. The study, the largest of its kind, is published online in the journal Neurology. ""Headaches during pregnancy are quite common, but it is not always easy to distinguish between a recurring, preexisting migraine condition and a headache caused by a pregnancy complication,"" said lead author Matthew S. Robbins, M.D., director of inpatient services at Montefiore Headache Center, chief of neurology at Jack D. Weiler Hospital of Montefiore, and associate professor of clinical neurology at Einstein. ""Our study suggests that physicians should pay close attention when a pregnant woman presents with a severe headache, especially if she has elevated blood pressure or lack of past headache history. Those patients should be referred immediately for neuroimaging and monitoring for preeclampsia."" Preeclampsia (previously called toxemia) typically occurs during the second or third trimester of pregnancy and may be related to an abnormal interaction of blood vessels that supply the placenta. Symptoms and signs can include high blood pressure, headaches, blurry vision, or abdominal pain, although some patients may have no symptoms. Depending on the severity and the age of the fetus, treatment ranges from bed rest for mild preeclampsia to premature delivery if the condition is severe. Dr. Robbins and colleagues analyzed records of every pregnant woman with headache who had been referred for a neurological consultation at Weiler Hospital over a five-year period. The study involved 140 women with an average age of 29. A large majority of the patients were Hispanic or African-American, reflecting the makeup of the Bronx population. Most (91) of the 140 women had primary headaches, 90 percent of which were migraines. Among the 49 patients with secondary headache, 51 percent were diagnosed with pregnancy-related high blood pressure, including the 38 percent of women who had preeclampsia. The most telling indicator of a secondary headache among pregnant women proved to be high blood pressure. Compared to pregnant women with headache but no high blood pressure, women with headache plus high blood pressure faced a 17-fold increased likelihood that their headaches were caused by some other condition. ""In most of these patients, their elevated blood pressure was driven by preeclampsia,"" said Dr. Robbins. The researchers found that another red flag for a headache that should be taken seriously was lack of a previous history of headache, which was associated with a five-fold increased likelihood that the headache was secondary to something else.

In a new study, neuroeconomists from the University of Zurich (UZH) now reveal that the intensity of the communication between different regions of the brain dictates whether we are indecisive or not. It s the same old story: You re in a restaurant and can t make up your mind what to order. After studying the menu for some time and many discussions, you eventually choose the steak. But you can t relax during the meal and keep wondering whether you should have gone for the veal after all. Such difficulties with decisions crop up in all aspects of life, not only food. However, they predominantly affect preference-based decisions, i.e. questions like ""what do I prefer   melon or cherries?"" Purely sensory decisions based on sensorial information such as ""what is bigger   melon or cherry?"" are less prone to indecisiveness.    How come some people are so uncertain of their preferences and keep making new choices while others know exactly what they like and want? A team headed by Professor Christian Ruff, a neuroeconomist from the University of Zurich, set about investigating this question. The Zurich researchers discovered that the precision and stability of preference decisions do not only depend on the strength of the activation of one or more brain regions. Instead, the key for stable preference choices is the intensity of the communication between two areas of the brain which represent our preferences or are involved in spatial orientation and action planning.    The researchers used transcranial alternating current stimulation, a non-invasive brain stimulation method that enables generation of coordinated oscillations in the activity of particular brain regions. The test subjects did not realize that they were being stimulated. Using this technique, the researchers intensified or reduced the information flow between the prefrontal cortex located directly below the forehead and the parietal cortex just above both ears. The test subjects had to make preference-based or purely sensory decisions about food.  ""We discovered that preference-based decisions were less stable if the information flow between the two brain regions was disrupted. Our test subjects were therefore more indecisive. For the purely sensory decisions, however, there was no such effect,"" explains Ruff. ""Consequently, the communication between the two brain regions is only relevant if we have to decide whether we like something and not when we make decisions based on objective facts."" There was no evidence of any gender-specific effects in the experiments. It was not possible to make the decisions more stable by intensifying the information flow. However, the study participants were young, healthy test subjects with highly developed decision-making skills. On the other hand, the results of the study could be used for therapeutic measures in the future   such as in patients who suffer from a high degree of impulsiveness and indecisiveness in the aftermath of brain disorders.

Scientists have long known that the functional neural architecture for perception and cognition strongly depends upon plasticity: in other words, our brain has the capacity to change and adapt as a result of experience. As a number of neuroimaging studies show, the early onset of permanent blindness alters the response of the neurons of the visual cortex and causes a cortical compensatory re-organization in the occipital lobe. This lobe, where visual functions are typically located, becomes active during the processing of auditory stimuli. The recruitment of visual areas for auditory tasks is sometimes thought to underlie the better performance in processing inputs from other senses observed in congenitally blind people. What was not clear yet was whether a short and transient period of postnatal visual deprivation is sufficient to trigger crossmodal reorganization that persists after years of visual experience. In order to answer that question, the researchers characterized the brain responses to auditory stimuli in 11 adults who had been treated for congenital cataracts in both eyes. These adults had been deprived of all patterned vision from birth until the cataracts were removed surgically and the eyes fitted with appropriate contact lenses that restored nearly normal visual input. The age at treatment varied from 9 days to just under 8 months of age. The control group consisted of 11 visually normal adults.  The cataract-recovery participants had been blind for less than 8 months, but their blindness occurred at birth, during the most sensitive period for brain development. They showed enhanced auditory-driven activity in focal visual regions , explained study leader Olivier Collignon, who undertook the work at University of Trento and the University of Montreal.  Thus, a short and transient period of visual deprivation early in life leads to enduring large-scale crossmodal reorganization of the brain circuitry typically dedicated to vision. This compellingly highlights the role early postnatal experience plays in shaping the functional architecture of the brain . Crossmodal plasticity in the case of blindness is a vital brain mechanism for compensating for visual deprivation, but the mechanism can have also negative effects on visual restoration, because it might interfere, to a certain extend, with the optimal resettlement of the regained sensory inputs.  Crossmodal plasticity may therefore be considered as a two-edged sword , Collignon added. The existence of auditory responses in the occipital cortex of cataract-recovery patients, as observed in the study, therefore poses crucial questions regarding how these non-visual inputs coexist or even interfere with visual functions. Olivier Collignon and his collaborators are now investigating further how this crossmodal reorganization might contribute to the impaired visual abilities observed in cataract-reversal patients. Resolving this crucial question may impact on how visual training programs are developed for visual restoration. University of Montreal Maurer D et al.

This disease can have a significant impact on quality of life. New research, presented at the American Academy of Dermatology's 2015 Summer Academy Meeting in New York, indicates that psoriasis patients may have an increased risk of depression. The following information was provided by board-certified dermatologist Roger S. Ho, MD, MPH, FAAD, assistant professor of dermatology, The Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology, NYU School of Medicine/Langone Medical Center, New York. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease that typically involves the skin and joints. The majority of people diagnosed with the condition have plaque psoriasis, characterized by red, raised patches of skin covered with silvery-white scales. These raised patches, also known as plaques, usually appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, lower back, hands and feet. Psoriasis is associated with a number of other medical conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and depression. Dr. Ho has seen the latter condition firsthand in his patients, starting with one who had severe psoriasis and a clear case of depression. ""After treating that patient,"" he says, ""the more I looked, the more I saw depression symptoms in my other patients with psoriasis."" Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Dr. Ho and his colleagues studied cases of psoriasis and depression in a pool of 12,382 adult patients. About 16.5 percent of the psoriasis patients studied met the criteria for major depression, and the odds of having major depression were doubled among psoriasis patients. The association between the two conditions remained significant even when researchers adjusted for other risk factors, including age, gender, race, body mass index, physical activity, history of alcohol use and smoking, and history of other conditions like myocardial infarction, stroke and diabetes mellitus. Dr. Ho believes the connection between psoriasis and depression may be linked to the public's stigmatization of psoriasis. The condition is highly visible on the skin, especially in the summer months when more skin is exposed, he says, and those who are unfamiliar with the disease may react unfavorably to people who have it. ""The public should know that psoriasis is not contagious, so there is no need to act differently around psoriasis patients than you would around anyone else,"" Dr. Ho says. Dr. Ho initially expected that patients' likelihood of depression would be linked to the severity of their psoriasis, but his research indicated that this is not the case. ""It seems that it really depends on the patients' view of themselves, rather than the extent of their psoriasis,"" he says. Although Dr. Ho's research indicates an association between psoriasis and depression, it does not prove that one causes the other. In order to learn more about the connection between these two conditions, he says, researchers will need to further investigate the nature of that connection and the science behind it. ""There may be some biologic or genetic factors in play that we are not aware of yet,"" he says. In the meantime, Dr. Ho says psoriasis patients should be aware of their depression risk and consult a doctor immediately if they experience any depression symptoms. He also encourages psoriasis patients to follow the treatment plan prescribed by their dermatologist, as improving their psoriasis symptoms may help alleviate their depression symptoms or prevent the future development of depression. The family and friends of psoriasis patients also should be aware of the condition's connection with depression, Dr. Ho says, as they can help recognize depression symptoms and encourage proper treatment. ""Psoriasis has far-reaching implications for patients' physical and mental health, and that can include an increased risk of depression,"" Dr. Ho says. ""I encourage all psoriasis patients to see a board-certified dermatologist for treatment, which may help improve their quality of life.""

Through a global analysis of the synaptic machinery Jeffrey Savas (Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine) and Joris de Wit (VIB/KU Leuven) together with their colleagues revealed for the first time a new pathway that governs the proper sorting of many essential synaptic proteins in neurons. Disruption of this sorting pathway in neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases severely hampers the efficient communication between neurons.

Mutations in this sorting pathway have been found in several synaptic diseases, including Alzheimer s disease. Our work highlights the importance of proper synaptic protein sorting for efficient neuronal communication and suggests that therapeutic targeting of this pathway could prove beneficial to improve synaptic function in brain disorders.  Synapses are specialized, protein-rich cell junctions that are essential for normal brain function and are dysfunctional in many diseases and disorders of the nervous system. Synapses are made up of many different proteins that link neurons together and regulate communication between these cells. Our results now show that perturbed sorting of these synaptic proteins hampers neuron-neuron communication and culminates in an increased level of silent synapses. These results highlight the importance of proper synaptic protein sorting, which was a previously under-appreciated aspect of synapse development, function, and disease.

Rotam will take the lead in choosing rapeseed breeding partners and establishing the relevant business model to commercialize both the seeds and herbicides in China.  Global rapeseed production has grown rapidly over the past 40 years, rising from the sixth largest oil crop to the second largest. Between 1999 and 2008, rapeseed oil made up 13-16 percent of world vegetable oil production The Chinese breeding society believes with its launch in China, Cibus and Rotam will provide a way to strengthen the Chinese rapeseed industry by lowering the cost of production and increasing yield.   China, which currently imports one-third of its rapeseed needs, has seen its rapeseed oil imports increase exponentially in recent years   from 132,000 metric tons in 2000 to 644,000 metric tons in 2010. As GDP per capita grows throughout China, Chinese consumers will have more disposable income to purchase items such as rapeseed oil, which is generally priced higher than other oils.  Chinese consumers view non-transgenic rapeseed oil as a healthier alternative to soybean and palm oil, and as more Chinese move into the middle class in the upcoming decade, rapeseed oil demand is set to outpace supply,  said Jean-Michel Duhamel, Rotam s Chief Commercial Officer.  We believe that bringing this non-transgenic technology to multiple rapeseed varieties will eliminate crop rotation issues for the crop and help meet China s growing demand for rapeseed oil.   With the demand for rapeseed oil soaring with an emphasis on non-transgenic product, this agreement with Rotam will not only help meet a pressing need in the Chinese market, but will also help Chinese farmers,  said Cibus President & CEO Peter Beetham.  This new product reduces the amount of chemicals needed to achieve weed control, cutting costs, increasing crop yield and providing benefits to the environment.   Beetham continued,  Rotam is the foremost crop protection company in China, so it was a natural step to work with Rotam on bringing a new non-transgenic rapeseed solution to a country with a growing need for rapeseed oil.  In partnership with Rotam, Cibus looks forward to bringing a new class of non-transgenic rapeseed breeding technologies to China.   ","Published: August 20, 2015"

Background  Especially in the UK liver disease has risen sharply over the past few decades and is the third biggest cause of premature mortality. Patients do not often present with symptoms until the disease is advanced. Even then diagnosis is difficult and the symptoms are often general and can be mistaken for other pathologies.  Breath gas analysis is a non-invasive method to collect information on the state of an individual by monitoring the concentration of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the exhaled breath, which are directly correlate to their concentrations in blood.  The study  Patients with a diseased liver showed very high levels of limonene, a flavour compound that is predominantly found in citrus fruits, in their breath   higher than in a healthy person, reports Raquel Fernandez del Rio, the lead author of the paper. Limonene, which is metabolized by a healthy liver, is accumulated in patients with liver disease. This hypothesis is supported by further studies on a sub-group of those patients before and after liver transplantation. Once the transplanted liver starts to work, limonene is cleared from the body.  IONICON supplied the PTR-MS instrument that carried out the analysis  Lukas M rk, IONICON s CEO comments on the study:  A direct link between a compound s concentration in breath and a disease state is a promising basis for the development of a clinical test. The non-invasive character of a breath test is captivating, especially in comparison to invasive alternatives such as a biopsy. But breath analysis has even more to offer: the possibility to analyze breath in real-time delivers immediate results, with a high-throughput and no waiting for lab tests.  The analyzer employed in this study, an IONICON PTR-MS, has become the reference method for real-time breath analysis. Moreover, IONICON provides an optimized inlet system for breath analysis with PTR-MS.

The study, led by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, is the first to link genetic mutations in myeloma cells to the chances of surviving the disease. The research was funded by Myeloma UK, Cancer Research UK and the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). Researchers used genetic sequencing to analyse all of the genes of 463 patients enrolled in the Myeloma XI clinical trial. The study identified 15 genes that were significantly mutated in a subset of patients with myeloma   and mapped how having these mutations related to long-term survival. The researchers found that testing for nine of these mutated genes, in combination with a test to determine the stage of myeloma, identified 90 per cent of patients with very aggressive disease who died prematurely. Myeloma patients with mutations within their cancers in a gene called CCND1, which helps control cell division, were more likely to have severe forms of disease than those without. Only 38 per cent of patients with mutations in CCND1 survived longer than two years, compared with 80 per cent of patients without faults in this gene. DNA repair gene TP53 was found to be faulty in 11 per cent of the patients, and was also associated with a shorter survival time   54 per cent of patients with TP53 mutations survived more than two years. The most common genetic faults in myeloma were found to be errors in members of the RAS gene family, one of which was discovered at the ICR, and which are defective in many cancer types. The researchers discovered mutations in the genes NRAS and KRAS in 43 per cent of patients   suggesting that in myeloma RAS mutations drive cells to become cancerous, and potentially opening up new avenues for treatment. Strikingly, over 50 per cent of the mutations identified in the study can be targeted by new or existing cancer drugs developed for other cancer types   opening up potential new avenues for targeted treatment. The scientists also found that patients with myeloma who had errors in some genes had a more favourable outlook. All the patients in the study with mutations in the genes IRF4 and EGR1 survived more than two years, compared with 79 and 78 per cent of patients with error-free copies of the genes, respectively. Study leader Professor Gareth Morgan, who conducted the research as Professor of Haematology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:  Our study has identified genetic features which can identify those patients whose myeloma is likely to prove aggressive and to progress quickly.  We hope our study ultimately paves the way for genetic testing to pick out the minority of patients with myeloma with a poor prognosis, who might benefit from the most intensive possible treatment.  Eric Low, Chief Executive of Myeloma UK, said:  The results of this innovative and first-of-its kind genetic study are pivotal. Myeloma patients with aggressive, high-risk disease experience suboptimal outcomes and poorer overall survival, so identification of this group of patients at diagnosis is crucial. These results will lead to the development of new, and the better use of existing treatments, to overcome high-risk, aggressive myeloma and therefore improve survival in this important sub-group of patients.  Through this and other ongoing studies, researchers at the ICR are shining a very bright torch on the genetic differences and complexities behind myeloma which will result in the right patients getting the right treatment for their myeloma at the right time.  Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:  We now know that cancer is much more complex than had once been thought, and that each individual form of cancer can in fact be divided up into many different sub-types, each with different sets of genetic drivers.   This new study has found that testing for a particular set of mutations seems to pick out patients whose myeloma is likely to prove particularly aggressive, and who will need the most intensive possible treatment to maximise their chances of survival. The findings could also make it possible to start treating myeloma patients with particular targeted treatments, depending on the collection of mutations within their cancers.

Despite having tightly controlled expression levels, little is known about how miRNAs themselves are regulated because their genes are poorly defined.  Although mature miRNAs are only ~22 nucleotides, their transcripts are up to hundreds of kilobases long. Primary miRNA transcripts, or pri-miRNAs, are quickly processed into mature miRNAs from hairpin structures located in the exons or introns of pri-miRNA transcripts. Because processing occurs very quickly, standard methods such as RT-PCR or RNA sequencing detect full-length pri-miRNAs with poor sensitivity. Many miRNA genes, therefore, lack annotated features such as a promoter or splice sites, hindering progress in understanding their transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. To overcome this, researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Johns Hopkins University stabilized pri-miRNAs by expressing a dominant negative form of DROSHA, the RNase III enzyme responsible for pri-miRNA cleavage, in a variety of human and mouse cell lines. By deeply sequencing nuclear RNAs and applying the computational tool StringTie to assemble transcripts, the researchers were able to annotate 69% of human miRNAs and 75% of mouse miRNAs. The newly annotated pri-miRNA gene structures can be visualized using standard genome browsers including the UCSC Genome Browser. ""One remarkable feature of primary miRNAs is their extreme length, even in cases where they function only to produce a single ~22 nucleotide miRNA,"" said Joshua Mendell, corresponding author of the study. ""Although it seems wasteful to produce such long RNAs, most of which will be immediately degraded, this organization may have arisen to allow complex mechanisms of regulation of the encoded miRNA."" Although clustered miRNAs are generally thought to be co-transcribed, the researchers found evidence that several human intergenic conserved miRNA clusters have alternative promoters. ""We were surprised to find cases where such miRNAs could be alternatively co-transcribed or separately transcribed, depending on which promoter is used,"" Mendell said. The researchers classified pri-miRNAs into three broad categories based on gene structure: Class I, which are transcribed independently of other genes and likely represent independent transcription units, Class II, which are transcribed as an extension of a protein-coding gene, and Class III, which are transcribed as an extension of a noncoding RNA. One example of a Class III pri-miRNA is located upstream of the noncoding RNA SPACA6P and encodes miR-99b, let-7e, and miR-125a. The authors suggest SPACA6P is a cleavage product of DROSHA processing due to the fact the 5' end is immediately adjacent to the 3' end of the pre-mir-125a hairpin. The new annotations will allow researchers to address questions regarding the transcriptional complexity of miRNA regulation, including how a miRNA promoter may be regulated or how splicing affects miRNA expression. ""It is also possible that these data will reveal that some previously identified disease-associated sequence variants actually fall within a formerly unrecognized primary miRNA gene, thereby raising the possibility that such variants may influence expression of the encoded miRNA,"" Mendell said.","Published: August 20, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/algae-nutrient-recycling-is-a-triple-win-185880,Algae Nutrient Recycling is a Triple Win Sandia method cheaper  greener and cuts competition for fertilizer   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Nitrogen and phosphate nutrients are among the biggest costs in cultivating algae for biofuels. Sandia molecular biologists Todd Lane and Ryan Davis have shown they can recycle about two-thirds of those critical nutrients, and aim to raise the recycling rate to close to 100 percent. Recycling nitrogen and phosphate has benefits that go far beyond cost. While nitrogen can be produced through a costly artificial nitrogen fixation process using natural gas and atmospheric nitrogen, phosphate is a limited natural resource that can be toxic at high concentration.  We have a finite amount of phosphate in the world, but it s in high demand as a fertilizer. Half of the phosphates that go into our crops in the form of fertilizer end up in the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to hypoxic zones,  said Lane. Better known as  dead zones,  hypoxic zones are areas of low oxygen concentration that kill or drive out marine life.Economic models show that replacing just 10 percent of liquid transportation fuels with algal-derived fuels, though beneficial to the environment in many ways, could double fertilizer consumption, which, in turn, would drive up the cost of food. But recycling phosphates means everyone wins: algal-derived biofuels producers, farmers and the environment.  By recycling phosphates from one batch of algae to the next, we save money, no longer compete with agriculture for a non-renewable resource and keep those phosphates out of the environment,  said Lane. Lane and Davis are considering other applications for their closed-loop algae nutrient recycling methods.  Our method could be used to strip phosphates from the agricultural runoff before it reaches the Salton Sea,  said Davis. Fertilizer runoff into the saltwater sea, California s largest lake, has led to dead zones that threaten fish and other wildlife.  Those nutrients that would otherwise further contribute to the dead zone could be used to grow algae intentionally for biofuels and other biobased commodities.  Osmotic shock key to releasing phosphates Lane and Davis found their nutrient recycling method works on many different algae feedstocks, even mixed feedstocks. Because algae have more genetic diversity than any other organism, many methods developed in the past haven t worked universally. The researchers use a fairly simple process, osmotic shock, to liberate phosphate from the cultivated algae.  We shock the algae with fresh water while controlling certain conditions like pH and temperature. This disrupts the internal structure of the cell and releases naturally occurring enzymes,  explained Lane.  These enzymes chew up the cell and rapidly release the phosphates.  The next step is fermentation to convert the nitrogen, which is mostly in the form of amino acids, into ammonia. The phosphates and ammonia are then recombined   with help from magnesium, present in great quantities in the algal biomass   to form struvite, a solid salt. In 2014, a Sandia team proved the method with 20 weeks of continuous recycling and reuse of phosphates and nutrients. They were able to carry over 60 to 80 percent of the nutrients from batch to batch.  Every two weeks, we recycled the nutrients and fed them back into the next batch of algae,  said Davis.  The process worked better than we expected, as we saw enhanced growth with the recycled nutrients. We aren t quite sure why this happened. It could be from trace metals carried over in the phosphate.  Lipid extraction enables nutrient recycling The algae nutrient recycling research is part of a larger project funded by the Department of Energy s BioEnergy Technologies Office, part of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program. The Sandia team s partners include Texas A&M AgriLife Research, which grows marine strains of algae, and Texas-based OpenAlgae, which patented methods to lyse algal cells and recover algal lipids without using solvent. Recovered algal oils could be turned into fuel.  We were very interested in OpenAlgae s lipid extraction because it doesn t use solvents, so the biomass is left in a native conformation that works very well with our process,  said Lane. OpenAlgae s method subjects algae cells to high energy electromagnetic pulses that rupture the cell walls and cause the cells to burst, releasing the lipids. In this disrupted state, the algae cells are much more susceptible to osmotic shock. The nutrient recycling process also releases more compounds that can be turned into fuels.  There is a lot of protein in biomass and that soaks up the nitrogen. As we re liberating the ammonia, we re also capturing that carbon so it can be turned into fuel,  said Davis. Better and easier nutrient recycling Lane and Davis are working to further refine their method to recycle more of the nutrients, including a collaboration with James Liao of the University of California, Los Angeles, to genetically refine their fermentation strain to increase yield and extract different fuel products. Liao runs the Metabolic Engineering and Synthetic Biology Laboratory and is chairman of the department of chemical and biomolecular engineering and the department of bioengineering. Another facet of the project is the development of a reactor system to capture the ammonia as the biomass is fermented to release phosphates. Currently, these steps are performed separately.  The goal is a one-pot system,  said Davis.  That will be the tipping point for scaling up our method. We grew 2 liters of algae in our 20-week test. The next step is to grow 3,000 liters in our raceways.  Later this year, Sandia will open three 1,000-liter raceway testbeds, shallow artificial ponds for algae cultivation. Pond-side processing is another goal. A single module combining lipid extraction and nutrient recycling could separate biomass into nutrients and fuel at a cultivation facility. Panning for phosphate gold Lane and Davis think their method could help the environmental if applied to agricultural runoff. Nutrient recycling is like panning for gold   or in this case, phosphates   anywhere that fertilizer-laden agricultural runoff enters bodies of water. The key, said Lane, is getting the concentrated runoff before it enters the body of water and dilutes.  Our method can t fix the existing dead zones,  said Lane.  But it can stop them from growing. The irony is that those nutrients are so valuable to growing plants, but so damaging when they flow into large bodies of water. Isaac Asimov famously called phosphates  life s bottleneck.  We aim to put an end to that bottleneck. ","Published: August 20, 2015"

They found that this deletion actually fosters the growth of cells that generate myelin, the important protective coating neurons need to function.  The research on lab animals provides new insight into how critical brain cells are generated. The finding may lead to improved treatments for brain injury, demyelinating diseases, certain developmental diseases and brain tumors. The UB researchers studied Nuclear Factor I X (NFIX), a transcription factor   a protein that turns genes on and off. NFIX is required for normal development of the early brain and it s known that losing NFIX before birth results in a number of rare human diseases, characterized by severe developmental and physiological defects.However, the new study shows that the loss of NFIX is necessary at a certain point in order for some brain cells to develop normally.  This paper is about the increase in oligodendrocytes, the myelin-making cells, that we discovered when we deleted NFIX from adult neural stem cells,  explained lead author Richard M. Gronostajski, PhD, professor in the UB Department of Biochemistry.  This is of interest because producing more oligodendrocytes could help prevent the damage to neurons that occurs in MS and other demyelinating diseases, such as Krabbe s Disease.  He directs the Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics Graduate program in the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and UB s Western New York Stem Cell Culture and Analysis Center (WNYSTEM). Gronostajski s lab is at UB s New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences and he is also a professor at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Thirty years ago, while working in a lab at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he contributed to the discovery of NFI proteins. His new research demonstrates how complex a role NFIX and other related transcription factors play in development. He explained that oligodendrocytes surround neurons, which transmit electrical signals in the brain, protecting them from damage and speeding the transmission of those signals. The research shows that as neural stem cells differentiate into oligodendrocytes, the expression of NFIX decreases, apparently an essential step in the normal formation of the myelin-making cells.  In terms of a treatment, this could lead to the development of a small molecule that could be used to shut off NFIX activity in MS patients, thus promoting the growth of more oligodendrocytes,  explained Gronostajski. This study and previous ones have found that loss of NFIX could also increase the growth of adult neural stem cells, which, in turn, generate new neurons in adult animals.  This could also help us find ways to stimulate new neuron production in diseases where neurons die, such as in Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases and in spinal cord injury,  he said. The researchers  next step is to learn which genes are regulated by NFIX, and the best way to promote this increase in both oligodendrocytes and neural stem cells.","Published: August 20, 2015"

This mechanism may act as a firewall, shutting down the immune response before it gets out of hand. However, from a clinical standpoint, this discovery could lead to more effective cancer immunotherapies, better drugs for autoimmune conditions and new ways to expedite recovery from sepsis.   There s a three-signal process to activate T cells of which each component is essential for proper activation,  said first author Gail Sckisel, a post-doctoral fellow.  But no one had really looked at what happens if they are delivered out of sequence. If the third signal   cytokines   is given prematurely, it basically paralyzes CD4 T cells.  To be activated, T cells must first recognize an antigen, receive appropriate costimulatory signals, and then encounter inflammatory cytokines to expand the immune response. Until now, no one realized that sending the third signal early   as is done with some immunotherapies   could actually hamper overall immunity.   These stimulatory immunotherapies are designed to activate the immune system,  said Sckisel,  but considering how T cells respond, that approach could damage a patient s ability to fight off pathogens. While immunotherapies might fight cancer, they may also open the door to opportunistic infections.  This was shown in mice which, after receiving systemic immunotherapy, had trouble mounting a primary T-cell response. The finding was confirmed in samples from patients receiving high-dose interleukin 2 therapy to treat metastatic melanoma. ""We need to be very careful because immunotherapy could be generating both short-term gain and long-term loss,  noted lead author William Murphy, professor and acting chair in the UC Davis Department of Dermatology.  The patients who were receiving immunotherapy were totally shut down, which shows how profoundly we were suppressing the immune system.   In addition to illuminating how T cells respond to cancer immunotherapy, the study also provides insights into autoimmune disorders. The researchers believe this CD4 paralysis mechanism could play a role in preventing autoimmunity, a hypothesis they supported by testing immunotherapy in a multiple sclerosis model.  By shutting down CD4 T cells, immune stimulation prevented an autoimmune response. This offers the potential to paralyze the immune system to prevent autoimmunity or modulate it to accept transplanted cells or entire organs.  ""Transplant patients go on immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives, but if we could safely induce paralysis just prior to surgery, it s possible that patients could develop tolerance,  said Sckisel.  CD4 paralysis may also be co-opted by pathogens, such as HIV, which could use this chronic inflammation response to disable the immune system.  This really highlights the importance of CD4 T cells,  said Murphy.  The fact that they re regulated and suppressed means they are definitely the orchestrators we need to take into account. It also shows how smart HIV is. The virus has been telling us CD4 T cells are critical because that s what it attacks.  The team s next step is to continue this research in older mice. Age can bring a measurable loss in immune function, and inflammation may play a role in that process.  For elderly people who have flu or pneumonia, their immune systems are  activated, but maybe they can t fight anything else,  said Murphy.  This could change how we treat people who are very sick. If we can block pathways that suppress the immune response, we may be able to better fight infection. ","Published: August 20, 2015"

Less than a year ago, a consortium of some hundred researchers reported that the relationship between all major bird clades had been mapped out by analysing the complete genome of around 50 bird species. This included the exact order in which the various lineages had diverged. Since then, two of the members of the consortium, Alexander Suh and Hans Ellegren at the Uppsala University Evolutionary Biology Centre, have expanded upon this model by analysing the avian genome through a new method, which hinges on so-called  jumping genes . Their results paint a partially contrasting picture of the kinship between the various species. We can see that the very rapid rate at which various bird species started evolving once the dinosaurs went extinct, i.e. around 65 million years ago, meant that the genome failed to split into separate lineages during the process of speciation , Hans Ellegren says. This is because evolution moved quickly, and many species arose in quick succession. When this happens, different parts of the genome can tell disparate tales of the kinship between the new species. The phenomenon has previously been explained theoretically and is a result of the genetic variation passing from one species to another. If new species then continue to evolve quickly, random chance can end up determining which original genetic variants end up in each lineage. The phenomenon is called incomplete lineage sorting.  Previously, the difficulty resided in finding instances of incomplete lineage sorting far back in time , Hans Ellegren says.  Therefore, it s been unknown if this phenomenon has affected evolution to any appreciable extent . By using the jumping genes, or so-called retrotransposed elements, the Uppsala researchers have found that, for instance, a cuckoo can be more closely related to a hummingbird than a pigeon in a certain part of its genome, while the opposite holds true in another part. The study found numerous examples to corroborate the existence of the phenomenon. This is one of the first cases in evolutionary research where researchers have been able to document and quantify incomplete lineage sorting far back in time. It is likely a far more common occurrence than previously thought.  The more complex kinship patterns that result from this phenomenon mean that the Tree of Life should often be understood as a Bush of Life , Alexander Suh and Hans Ellegren say.","Published: August 20, 2015"

The stomach stretches when it is full, which activates nerves in the stomach to tell the body that it has had enough food. We found that this activation is regulated through hot chilli pepper or TRPV1 receptors,  says Associate Professor Amanda Page, Senior Research Fellow in the University of Adelaide s School of Medicine and lead author on the paper.   It is known from previous studies that capsaicin, found in hot chillies, reduces food intake in humans. And what we ve discovered is that deletion of TRPV1 receptors dampens the response of gastric nerves to stretch   resulting in a delayed feeling of fullness and the consumption of more food. Therefore part of the effect of capsaicin on food intake may be mediated via the stomach.  We also found that TRPV1 receptors can be disrupted in high fat diet induced obesity,  she says.  Dr Stephen Kentish says these findings will inform further studies and the development of new therapies.   It s exciting that we now know more about the TRPV1 receptor pathway and that the consumption of capsaicin may be able to prevent overeating through an action on nerves in the stomach,  says Dr Kentish, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Fellow from the University of Adelaide s School of Medicine.   The next stage of research will involve investigation of the mechanisms behind TRPV1 receptor activation with the aim of developing a more palatable therapy.   We will also do further work to determine why a high-fat diet de-sensitises TRPV1 receptors and investigate if we can reverse the damage,  he says.  This research was funded by the Blue Gum bequest, Royal Adelaide Hospital.","Published: August 20, 2015"

But there s one thing that traditional media have over hard drives: longevity. To address this modern shortcoming, scientists are turning to DNA to save unprecedented amounts of digital data for posterity.  The researchers presented their work at the 250th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS, the world s largest scientific society, is holding the meeting here through Thursday. It features more than 9,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.  If you go back to medieval times in Europe, we had monks writing in books to transmit information for the future, and some of those books still exist,  says Robert Grass, Ph.D.  Now, we save information on hard drives, which wear out in a few decades. At the same time, digital technology has spurred an explosion in the amount of information available at any given moment. Any new techniques scientists develop to preserve even parts of our digital universe would have to be extremely small. This is where DNA comes in.  A little after the discovery of the double helix architecture of DNA, people figured out that the coding language of nature is very similar to the binary language we use in computers,  says Grass, who is with ETH Zurich.  On a hard drive, we use 0s and 1s to represent data, and in DNA, we have four nucleotides A, C, T and G.  But DNA has two major advantages over hard drives: size and durability. An external hard drive about the size of a paperback book can back up five terabytes of information and might last 50 years. In theory, a fraction of an ounce of DNA could store more than 300,000 terabytes. And, from archaeological finds, scientists know that DNA from hundreds of thousands of years ago can still be sequenced today. A handful of research groups are exploring methods to take advantage of DNA s storage potential. Grass  team has encoded DNA with 83 kilobytes of text from the Swiss Federal Charter from 1291 and the Method of Archimedes from the 10th century. They encapsulated the DNA in silica spheres and warmed it to nearly 160 degrees Fahrenheit for one week, which is the equivalent of keeping it for 2,000 years at about 50 degrees. When they decoded it, it was error-free. Now that the researchers have demonstrated how to synthetically preserve DNA for long periods of time, they re tackling the next challenge.  In DNA storage, you have a drop of liquid containing floating molecules encoded with information,  Grass says.  Right now, we can read everything that s in that drop. But I can t point to a specific place within the drop and read only one file.  So, he and his colleagues are currently developing ways to label specific pieces of information on DNA strands to make them searchable. Like many technologies in their early years, DNA storage comes with a hefty price tag. Encoding and saving a few megabytes of data costs thousands of dollars, Grass says. In other words, consumers won t have the option of buying DNA-based hard drives anytime soon. So what will this technology accomplish? Grass says that question has yet to be answered. If it were up to him, he says he would take data snapshots of the ever-evolving Wikipedia, for example, to preserve its various iterations so they re not lost forever as users make edits. DNA storage also could preserve troves of historical texts, government documents or entire archives of private companies, all in a droplet.  This interest in preserving information is something we have lost, especially in a digital world,  he says.  And that s what I d like to help address and encourage people to do: Save information we have today for future times. ","Published: August 20, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/agricultural-intervention-improves-hiv-outcomes-185783,Agricultural Intervention Improves HIV Outcomes A multifaceted farming intervention can reduce food insecurity while improving HIV outcomes in patients in Kenya  according to a randomized  controlled trial led by researchers at UC San Francisco  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The study found that participants in the intervention arm, who received agricultural and financial support, were able to increase the quantity and quality of food consumed.  At the same time, their CD4 T-cell counts increased and their rate of viral suppression increased by about one half. In contrast, both the CD4 cell counts and the rate of suppression fell for those in the control arm.  While this was a pilot study, these results prove the concept that improving food insecurity and alleviating poverty can affect HIV clinical outcomes,  said the trial s co-primary investigator, Sheri D. Weiser, MD, MPH, UCSF associate professor of medicine at the UCSF Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital.In sub-Saharan Africa, where 24.7 million people are living with HIV (71 percent of all people living with HIV), 240 million people are food insecure. Food insecurity increases the risk of becoming infected with HIV and food insecure people with HIV are less able to take anti-HIV therapies and make clinic visits, and have poorer nutritional status. Together, those issues make treating and preventing HIV more difficult, leading to sicker patients and more deaths. In turn, once someone is infected with HIV, food insecurity gets worse due to loss of economic activity and productivity, loss of social support due to HIV stigma and the costs of medical care.   HIV/AIDS and food insecurity are intertwined in a vicious cycle, with each increasing vulnerability to and exacerbating the severity of the other,  Weiser said.  We have the biomedical tools to treat and prevent HIV, but we need interventions like this that combine healthcare with development, and address food insecurity, poverty and disempowerment if we are to achieve the UNAIDS goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030.  The trial, conducted over one year at two Family AIDS Care & Education Services (FACES) health facilities in the Nyanza region in Kenya, enrolled 72 participants at one facility for the intervention group and 68 at the other facility for the control group.  Participants were HIV positive individuals between 18 and 49 years old on anti-HIV therapy and all had access to surface water for irrigation and land. The intervention, titled Shamba Maisha, Swahili for  Farm Life,  had three components.  Microfinance loans were provided by and managed by Adok Timo, a Kenyan microfinance organization, with support from the two collaborating partners in FACES: UCSF and the Kenyan Medical Research Institute.  These loans were used to purchase farming implements and supplies along with manual irrigation pumps designed by KickStart, a non-profit organization that develops and markets new technologies that are used to establish new small businesses.   The pumps make it possible for farmers to irrigate year round, which reduced dependence on seasonal rainfalls. Producing food year round enables farmers to move from subsistence farming to commercial farming and also allows them to capture higher crop prices during the dry season,  said the trial s co-primary investigator, Craig R. Cohen, MD, MPH, UCSF professor in the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences. The third element was agricultural and financial management training. Agricultural training included practical demonstrations on sustainable farming techniques, use of the water pump, planting, soil and water conservation, and integrated disease and pest management. Financial training focused on record keeping, along with savings and investments.  Shamba Maisha is the first trial to link agriculture with HIV outcomes,  Cohen said.  The intervention is unique in that it is sustainable, transformative and empowering.  If you were to take away our involvement tomorrow, the knowledge and materials to continue the livelihood intervention would still exist in the community. ","Published: August 20, 2015"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/viral-comparisons-213660,Viral Comparisons ORNL team applies genomics expertise to analyze  map virus sequence database  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Viruses are tiny merely millionths of a millimeter in diameter but what they lack in size, they make up in quantity.    If you were to take all the viruses from the planet, and lay them side by side, the length would be 1,000 times the length of the Milky Way,  said David Ussery, who leads the comparative genomics group at the Department of Energy s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This universe of viruses is largely unexplored, even as new viruses are regularly identified in metagenomic studies that sample and sequence different viral species. Scientists use advanced genetic sequencing methods to sequence hundreds of viral genomes in a matter of hours. But making sense of the data is a challenge. An ORNL team of comparative genomics and computational science researchers is attempting to bring some order to this viral data overload. In a recent study Ussery and a team of researchers compared approximately 4,000 complete virus genomes downloaded from a public database known as GenBank.By compressing the sequence files, the team created a virus dendrogram that maps out the relationships among all the different virus families. Ussery notes the figure is not a true evolutionary tree. Rather, it roughly approximates how divergent sequences are from one another.  No one has published a dendrogram like this of all viruses,  he said.  This is an example of where we want to go in terms of building up the computational facilities to do these kinds of comparisons.  The team s ongoing biosciences and computing collaboration will benefit other ORNL research projects that rely on comparative genomics and environmental metagenomics. The storage infrastructure for viral genomes will serve as a template and prototype for bacterial, fungal and plant genomes, which are used in the lab s Plant-Microbe Interfaces and BioEnergy Science Center projects.  Viral genomes are short   one million times smaller than human genomes,  Ussery said.  In principle, it should be million times easier. You have to start with something small and tractable and build your way up.  As an example, the researchers used the comparative map to more closely analyze sequences in the Filovirus family, which includes the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Comparing genomes and understanding variability within an individual virus s genome could inform efforts in preventing or responding to outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Ussery explains it would be possible to take the genome sequence for a new virus and quickly find the nearest neighbors.  The idea in the future, if there is an outbreak, you can use the genome sequences collected from individuals across the country to track the spread in real time, in much the same way that we track the weather,  he said. Likewise, comparative genomics is helpful in directing immunologists toward potential treatments. Collaborators on the paper, led by Ole Lund from the Technical University of Denmark, used the comparative sequencing analysis to look for specific regions of an Ebola virus protein that could be potential targets for vaccine development. Enabling collaboration among genomics, computational and health experts is a key role for ORNL, explains Michael Leuze, who leads the lab s Computational Biomolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics group. He and Ussery envision establishing a center that leverages lab expertise in genomics, computer science and big data and neutron science.  Many of the technologies and techniques that we use on regular basis are applicable to viruses,  he said.  Dealing with viral outbreaks is outside of our scope, but understanding the genomics of viruses is an area where we can make a real contribution. ","Published: August 20, 2015"

In the 1920s Nobel laureate Otto Heinrich Warburg asked why these cells were so wasteful of energy. He suggested that this seemingly inefficient cellular use of resources was a root cause of cancer, a hypothesis that has been the subject of research ever since. Almost a century later, two Yale scientists have used magnetic resonance measurements showing how glucose is metabolized in yeast to answer the puzzle of the  Warburg Effect.  The production of these byproducts is a result of the cell s need to keep its internal state constant during glucose consumption, they report. This biochemical response is an example of homeostasis, a fundamental need of all life forms.  It s the cell s way of saying it has enough to eat,  said Robert Shulman, professor emeritus of molecular biophysics and biochemistry. In the 1980s, Shulman conducted pioneering studies of metabolism in yeast using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a method then confined to the study of cells but now used routinely in patients. More recently, Shulman and co-author Douglas Rothman, professor of diagnostic radiology and of biomedical engineering, reviewed the data applying new methods of analyzing metabolic control. They found key intermediate molecular steps involved in the conversion of glucose to ethanol as well as to ATP, the chief energy source of cells. When these molecular switches that maintained homeostasis were disabled by mutations, the cells died from accumulated excesses of both byproducts and ATP. This chemical balancing act explains why yeast and likely cancer cells do not convert all available fuel to energy that they could use to divide and flourish.  Cancer cells have to survive first,  Rothman said. Shulman and Rothman point out that their results open a new direction for cancer researchers   identifying metabolic homeostasis mechanisms and targeting them for treatment.  By taking another look at the in vivo data available from magnetic resonance experiments, I think we can revitalize research efforts in a host of areas,  Shulman said.","Published: August 20, 2015"

While gene expression profiles have been shown to provide analytical information in a variety of cancers, translating gene expression-based methods into clinical use has been met with great difficulties. In order to provide an accurate MPI for patients with stage I NSCLC, Andrew J. Gentles, Ph.D., Department of Radiology, Stanford University, and colleagues, looked at gene expression profiles from 1106 nonsquamous NSCLCs for generation and internal validation of a nine-gene MPI and used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to validate an independent cohort of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. They then built a prognostic score that combined the molecular MPI with clinical variable data provided by the national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER.) database. The researchers found that by incorporating genes expressed in both the tumor and its microenvironment, the MPI was highly robust and can be applied in a clinical setting using qPCR assays on FFPE tissues. ""The MPI outperforms other signatures that satisfy key characteristics of clinical applicability (ie, qPCR assays validated on FFPE tissues),"" the authors write.

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/so-long-snout-209757,So Long  Snout Research helps answer how birds got their beaks   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Birds are among the most successful creatures on the planet, with more than 10,000 species living across the globe, occupying a dizzying array of niches and eating everything from large animals to hard-to-open nuts and seeds. Part of the key to that success, scientists say, might be right in front of their faces. Led by Arkhat Abzhanov, a former associate professor of organismic and evolutionary biology, a team of researchers has shown that bird beaks are the result of skeletal changes controlled by two genetic pathways, shedding light on the origins of one of nature s most efficient tools.   The evolution of the beak was a seminal step for modern birds that made them distinct from primitive birds who still had snouts,  Abzhanov said.  With this paper we wanted to understand that process in mechanistic terms. The first step toward answers, Abzhanov said, was to clarify why birds have beaks at all.  The immediate ancestors of birds had very long fingers and a somewhat opposable thumb,  he said.  It s believed they could use their hands to build nests and manipulate small prey   and that s exactly what birds lost when they evolved wings   those fingers became bones in the wing. So once birds lost them, they replaced them with a finger on their face   the beak.  Both the upper and lower beak can move, so it works like pincers, allowing a level of accuracy in handling and manipulating objects you can only achieve with fingers. I like to show my students a video of weaver birds, which use long grasses to weave nests, and even tie real knots during construction. You cannot do that with a snout.  To get an up-close-and-personal view of how developmental patterns reveal the evolution of birds, Abzhanov and colleagues turned to their closest living relative   the alligator, a crocodilian.  Because we can get live alligator embryos with snouts, we can actually compare them with beaked modern birds to see how they develop their faces, and what genes are activating during that process,  Abzhanov said. The team discovered two genetic pathways, both of which are present in virtually all vertebrates, but which work differently in the development of bird faces. These signaling pathways, FGF8 and WNT, tell cells how to proliferate and differentiate, and in land vertebrates are normally expressed in two regions, around the left and right nasal pits. In birds, however, expression also occurs in the middle of the face, causing the two regions to fuse to produce a single beak bone instead of paired facial bones.  We later found that FGF8 mediates the expression of WNT,  Abzhanov said.  So the critical molecule in this entire story is FGF8. It s expressed very early, and only transiently, but this change, this novel medial expression of FGF8, coincides with the appearance of the beak in modern birds.  For insight into beak development, Abzhanov and colleagues interrupted the pathways in chickens, producing embryos with facial bones that looked remarkably like their snouted dinosaur ancestors.  What happened is we got a range of phenotypes,  Abzhanov said.  Some looked fairly normal, and others were very different. In some embryos the bones that make up the beak did not fuse properly and developed more blunt shapes.  The results of the study, he said, indicate that beaks did not emerge fully formed, but developed gradually through intermediate shape changes, some of which are yet to be found in the fossil record.  We suggest paleontologists will be able to find fossils in the future which will bridge this gap between beaked modern birds and their snouted ancestors,  Abzhanov said.  That transition may have happened in an isolated geographic area, or may have happened very quickly, so they may be hard to find, but we predict that such transitional fossils will eventually be recovered and they will match some of our experimental animals.  He added:  What s important is we can now explain an important characteristic of the face unique to modern birds, an example of an evolutionary novelty. ","Published: August 20, 2015"

Ke Xu, a faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab s Life Sciences Division, has dubbed his innovation SR-STORM, or spectrally resolved stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. Because SR-STORM gives full spectral and spatial information for each molecule, the technology opens the door to high-resolution imaging of multiple components and local chemical environments, such as pH variations, inside a cell. The research was reported in a paper titled,  Ultrahigh-throughput single-molecule spectroscopy and spectrally resolved super-resolution microscopy,  with co-authors Zhengyang Zhang, Samuel Kenny, Margaret Hauser, and Wan Li, all of UC Berkeley. Xu is also an assistant professor at UC Berkeley s Department of Chemistry. We measure both the position and spectrum of each individual molecule, plotting its super-resolved spatial position in two dimensions and coloring each molecule according to its spectral position, so in that sense, it s true-color super-resolution microscopy, which is the first of its kind,  Xu said.  This is a new type of imaging, combining single-molecule spectral measurement with super-resolution microscopy.  What s more, SR-STORM is high-throughput, able to deliver spatial and spectral information for millions of single molecules in about five minutes, compared to several minutes for a single frame of image comprising tens of molecules using conventional scanning-based techniques. Xu built on work he did as a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard with Xiaowei Zhuang, who invented STORM, a super-resolution microscopy method based on single-molecule imaging and photoswitching. By devising a dual-objective system with two microscope lenses facing each other, Xu and colleagues viewed the front and back of the sample at the same time and achieved unprecedented optical resolution (of approximately 10 nanometers) of a cell. Using this method to image neurons, they showed that actin, a key component of the cytoskeleton (backbone of the cell), has a different structure in axons than in dendrites, two parts of a neuron. But current super-resolution microscopy techniques do not deliver spectral information, which is useful for scientists to understand the behavior of individual molecules, as well as to enable high-quality multicolor imaging of multiple targets.  So we constructed a dual-objective system but dispersed the single-molecule image collected by one objective lens into spectrum while keeping the other image for single-molecule localization,  Xu said.  Now we are simultaneously accumulating the spectrum of the single molecules and also their position, so we solved the conundrum.  Next they dyed the sample with 14 different dyes in a narrow emission window and excited and photoswitched the molecules with one laser. While the spectra of the 14 dyes are heavily overlapping since they re close in emission, they found that the spectra of the individual molecules were surprisingly different and thus readily identifiable.  That s useful because it means we had a way to do multicolor imaging within a very narrow emission window,  Xu said. Indeed, using four dyes to label four different subcellular structures, such as mitochondria and microtubules, they were able to easily distinguish molecules of different dyes based on their spectral mean alone, and each subcellular structure was a distinct color.  So using this method we can look at interactions between four biological components inside a cell in three-dimension and at very high resolution of about 10 nanometers,  Xu said.  The applications are mostly in fundamental research and cell biology at this point, but hopefully it will lead to medical applications. This gives us new opportunities to look at cell structures, how they re built up, and whether there s any degradation of those structures in diseases.  Many diseases are caused either by an invading pathogen or degradation of a cell s internal structure. Alzheimer s, for example, may be related to degradation of the cytoskeleton inside neurons.  The cytoskeleton system is comprised of a host of interacting subcellular structures and proteins, and our technique will enable research on the interactions between these different targets with unprecedented number of color channels and spatial resolution,  he said. Next, Xu is trying to refine the method by using a single-objective system, and make it work with conventional microscope systems, thus making it more broadly accessible. He is also trying to develop suitable dyes and probes to monitor the local environment, such as the pH, in live cells at the nanometer scale.","Published: August 20, 2015"

An international team of researchers, led by Dr Munitta Muthana from the University of Sheffield s Department of Oncology, have now found MRI scanners can non-invasively steer cells, which have been injected with tiny super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs), to both primary and secondary tumour sites within the body. This targeted approach is extremely beneficial for patients as it dramatically increases the efficiency of treatment and drug doses could potentially be reduced   helping to alleviate side effects. Revolutionary cell-based therapies, which exploit modified human cells to treat diseases such as cancer, have advanced greatly over recent years. However, targeted application of cell-based therapy in specific tissues, such as those lying deep in the body where injection is not possible, has remained problematic. The new research suggests MRI scanners are the key to administering treatments directly to both primary and secondary tumours wherever they are located in the body. The study shows that cancer mouse models injected with immune cells carrying SPIOs and armed with the cancer killing oncolytic virus (OV) which infects and kills cancer cells, showed an 800 per cent increase in the effects of the therapy. Dr Munitta Muthana, from the University of Sheffield, said:  Our results suggest that it is possible to use a standard MRI scanner to naturally deliver cell-based therapies to both primary and secondary tumours which would normally be impossible to reach by injection.  This not only increases the therapeutic efficacy but also decreases the risk of unwanted side effects.

It was previously known that the structure of a piece of DNA could be changed using acid, which causes it to fold up into what is known as an  i-motif . But new research reveals that the structure can be switched a second time into a hair-pin structure using positively-charged copper (copper cations). This change can also be reversed using EDTA.The applications for this discovery include nanotechnology - where DNA is used to make tiny machines, and in DNA-based computing   where computers are built from DNA rather than silicon. It could also be used for detecting the presence of copper cations, which are highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms, in water. Lead researcher Dr Zo  Waller, from UEA s School of Pharmacy, said:  Our research shows how the structure of our genetic material - DNA - can be changed and used in a way we didn t realise.  A single switch was possible before   but we show for the first time how the structure can be switched twice.  A potential application of this finding could be to create logic gates for DNA based computing. Logic gates are an elementary building block of digital circuits   used in computers and other electronic equipment. They are traditionally made using diodes or transistors which act as electronic switches.  This research expands how DNA could be used as a switching mechanism for a logic gate in DNA-based computing or in nano-technology. ","Published: August 20, 2015"

It remains extremely challenging to understand these chemical interactions in natural environments, e.g. to tie the production of particular molecules to individual bacterial cells or at least populations of cells. Scientists now made an important step into this direction by simultaneously visualizing the distribution of antibiotics and their producers in natural samples. Since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928, antibiotics have revolutionized human medicine by providing successful treatment against numerous infectious diseases. The medical application of antibiotics has led to the notion that these compounds are produced by microbes in nature as weapons to combat competing organisms. However, recent discoveries of low concentrations of antibiotics affecting gene expression without detrimental consequences for the target organisms have challenged this view, providing evidence for signaling functions of these substances.In general, surprisingly little is known about the ecology of antibiotics and how they function in the natural context, despite important implications for human medicine. One of the main problems is to detect and quantify antibiotics in complex environmental samples and monitor their production and effect in situ. In order to achieve this, the scientists focused on a comparatively simple system that involves only a limited number of interacting organisms: The defensive alliance between European beewolf wasps, Philanthus triangulum, and bacteria of the genus Streptomyces. In this association, the symbionts are cultivated in specialized antennal reservoirs of female beewolves and later transferred to the cocoon of the developing offspring, providing protection against mold fungi during the long period of hibernation. The knowledge about the presence of the symbionts as well as the antibiotics they produce on the beewolf cocoon provided an excellent basis for the scientists to devise a method for simultaneously localizing bacterial cells and the production of secondary metabolites in an environmental sample. The measurement of antibiotics on the beewolf cocoon was achieved by mass-spectrometric (MS) imaging, a technique that uses a tightly focused laser beam to desorp and ionize compounds from the surface of a sample and analyze the resulting molecule ions in a mass spectrometer. ""Even though the lateral resolution of MS imaging is still limited, it has enormous potential for the detection and visualization of chemical compounds in nature, due to its broad applicability to a wide range of substances"", says Ale  Svato , head of the Mass Spectrometry Research Group. On the beewolf cocoon, MS imaging revealed the patchy but widespread distribution of the antibiotics piericidin A1 and B1 across the outer surface. Subsequently, the cocoons were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): By binding fluorescently labeled probes to the RNA of the bacteria, individual symbiont cells could be visualized under the fluorescence microscope. Applying paint markings around the samples that were visible in both MS imaging and FISH then enabled the scientists to combine the resulting images of both techniques. This allowed for the simultaneous localization of individual symbiont cells and the abundance of antibiotics around them. ""Both methods were known before, but nobody had combined them yet. The strength of this approach lies in the potential for FISH to localize and identify individual cells in complex samples, and at the same time monitor ecologically relevant compounds by MS imaging"", Martin Kaltenpoth comments, who headed the Max Planck Research Group Insect Symbiosis and is now a professor at the University of Mainz. The world is full of microbes, and they affect all life on the planet. Understanding how they interact with each other and with multicellular organisms therefore presents a fundamental question in biology. Detecting and visualizing compounds in nature and identifying their microbial producers constitutes a first step to ultimately be able to monitor complex interactions directly where they occur and understand the original function of antibiotics and many other microbe-produced chemicals.","Published: August 20, 2015"

The contract manufacturing organization (CMO) has received no critical or major observations and this comes amidst various quality-related issues affecting several other sterile manufacturing sites in the UK and US. Symbiosis has been re-inspected and approved for the ongoing production of Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP s) for clinical trials, In a further boost to support the growth and strategic development of the company, it received confirmation of continued authorization for the GMP-manufacture of aseptically-filled licensed commercial products following initial approval of the commercial Manufacturer  s / Importers (MIA) license last year. The regulatory inspection and approval of Symbiosis  Scotland-based facility comes in the wake of several high profile pull-outs and inspection failures at sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities globally. The growing CMO continues to thrive in light of increased demand for its services and due to wider industrial trends such the number of injectable drugs in development, increased biotech funding and more oncology and orphan drugs. Colin MacKay, CEO at Symbiosis Pharmaceutical Services, said:  Inspection failures at sterile filling sites has been a sensitive topic recently so it has been essential for us to maintain our focus on absolute GMP compliance, continual investment in meeting the latest emerging regulatory requirements and preserving our quality-driven business culture.  Although our core business remains the sterile fill/finish of biologic and small molecule products into vials for clinical trials, the commercial license provides us with the opportunity to cater for small scale commercial manufacturing projects which the bigger CMOs see as unprofitable and therefore unattractive. Our operational flexibility and our cost base make those projects financially attractive both to us and to our clients.  These abilities allow us to proactively support biotech and speciality pharmaceutical companies with products in niche markets and orphan indications that require relatively low volume or infrequent sterile filling. At the same time, it also gives us the potential to scale-up existing client projects which are successfully progressing through clinical trials towards market.  Since 2011, Symbiosis has built a strong reputation for offering clients rapid access to sterile manufacturing slots and quick release of drug products to ensure tight clinical trial timelines are successfully met. The CMO specializes in injectable medicines, which are either liquid or lyophilized formulations filled into vials. Its specialist capabilities include the ability to handle and fill antibodies, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, cytotoxic, cytostatic and highly potent APIs including ADCs along with conventional small molecules.","Published: August 20, 2015"

The new solution, which eliminates the need for pharmacists or consumers to first open a package before obtaining detailed product information, meets related requirements of the EU Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62/EU. Among other measures, the EU directive requires a security seal for the outer or secondary packaging of medicines, in order to prevent risk of manipulations. With traditional packages, pharmacists can only read the package insert after destroying the seal, which is meant to form a barrier and serve as a first-opening indication. To eliminate the need for the package s opening, Schreiner MediPharm worked with Germany-based Edelmann, a leading supplier of folding boxes, to create a novel solution combining a folding box with a Booklet-Label applied to the outside. Applied to the outer packaging, the multi-page Booklet-Label from Schreiner MediPharm makes even multi-lingual product information easily accessible and readily visible without damaging the original package. It reliably adheres to folding cartons and is easy to open and close again via a top layer of film that serves as a cover. The Booklet-Label also is equipped with a security color-shifting ink for integrated protection against counterfeiting.  The solution that has been jointly developed with Edelmann maintains the integrity of the folding carton while allowing easy access to the package insert,  said Gene Dul, President of Schreiner MediPharm U.S.  In addition to helping pharmacists comply with new regulations, the Booklet-Label also benefits consumers. Since the booklet is firmly attached to the package, it is less likely to be misplaced. ","Published: August 20, 2015"

Under the agreement, MedImmune will acquire exclusive rights to Inovio s INO-3112 immunotherapy, which targets cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. INO-3112, which is in phase I/II clinical trials for cervical and head and neck cancers, works by generating killer T-cell responses that are able to destroy HPV 16- and 18-driven tumours. These HPV types are responsible for more than 70 per cent of cervical pre-cancers and cancers. MedImmune intends to study INO-3112 in combination with selected immunotherapy molecules within its pipeline in HPV-driven cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that the benefits from immuno-oncology molecules, such as those in MedImmune s portfolio, can be enhanced when they are used in combination with cancer vaccines that generate tumour-specific T-cells. Under the terms of the agreement, MedImmune will make an upfront payment of $27.5 million to Inovio as well as potential future payments upon reaching development and commercial milestones totaling up to $700 million. MedImmune will fund all development costs. Inovio is entitled to receive up to double-digit tiered royalties on INO-3112 product sales. Within the broader collaboration, MedImmune and Inovio will develop up to two additional DNA-based cancer vaccine products not included in Inovio s current product pipeline, which MedImmune will have the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize. Inovio will receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments and will be eligible to receive royalties on worldwide net sales for these additional cancer vaccine products. David Berman, Senior Vice President and Head of the Oncology Innovative Medicines unit, MedImmune, said:  Today s collaboration with Inovio leverages our deep internal expertise in the use of vaccines to drive antigen-specific T-cell responses. The unique combination of our broad immuno-oncology portfolio with Inovio s T-cell-activating INO-3112, which enhances cancer specific killer T-cells, has the potential to deliver real clinical benefits for patients.  J. Joseph Kim, President and CEO, Inovio, said:  Our licensing partnership with MedImmune represents an important step in executing our immuno-oncology combination strategy and advancing Inovio s cancer vaccine R&D pipeline with a leading cancer immunotherapy company. INO-3112 is progressing, with positive interim data generated in an Inovio-initiated phase I study. We appreciate MedImmune s recognition of our ability to activate best-in-class killer T-cells in vivo and look forward to working with them on this collaboration.  Today s agreement builds on the existing partnership between Inovio and MedImmune on two research and development collaborations in the infectious disease area. Both efforts are funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and support R&D focused on Ebola, influenza, and bacterial infections. MedImmune has a strong heritage in infectious disease and vaccine innovation, having developed the first monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food & Drug Administration for the prevention of an infectious disease and the technology that led to the creation of an HPV vaccine.","Published: August 20, 2015"

TruTags offer a unique solution for drug manufacturers, allowing a digital scan of a drug to confirm its authenticity and reveal provenance information such as manufacturing location, dosage, images of packaging, expiration date, supply chain data, and lot or batch number. WuXi and TruTag Technologies announced their alliance in 2014, including an investment by the WuXi Venture Fund in TruTag. TruTags have a number of benefits for pharmaceutical manufacturers that were confirmed in this joint testing:   TruTags can be applied to qualifying solid oral dosage form (SODF) products using a consistent, repeatable process.  No new manufacturing equipment and changes in manufacturing processes are needed.  After application on manufactured tablets, TruTags are successfully detected using TruTag's proprietary optical detection device.  Apart from this detection process, TruTags are covert and not visually identifiable and remain with the tablet for its entire life.  Once applied, the TruTag solution did not affect the stability or dissolution properties of API drugs in completed accelerated open and closed bottle testing.  Implementing the TruTag solution on existing drugs requires minimal regulatory reporting changes for drug manufacturers and complies with the physical-chemical identifier (PCID) guidance issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011. WuXi and TruTag will now begin further testing of TruTags on additional API products. They will also produce a technical white paper for the industry detailing the results of the application method and practice, the detection process and data collection, and outcomes of dissolution and stability testing. TruTag is already working with several multinational pharmaceutical companies in pilot testing for broad deployment of this technology in marketed SODF drugs and product candidates.

The academics found that having friends can help teenagers recover from depression or even avoid becoming depressed in the first instance. The findings are the result of a study of the way teenagers in a group of US high schools influenced each others  mood. The academics used a mathematical model to establish if depression spreads from friend to friend. Professor Frances Griffiths, head of social science and systems in health at Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, said:  Depression is a major public health concern worldwide. But the good news is we ve found that a healthy mood amongst friends is linked with a significantly reduced risk of developing and increased chance of recovering from depression.  Our results offer implications for improving adolescent mood. In particular they suggest the hypothesis that encouraging friendship networks between adolescents could reduce both the incidence and prevalence of depression among teenagers.  The study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B entitled Spreading of healthy mood in adolescent social networks. Using data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health they looked at more than 2,000 adolescents in a network of US high school students. They examined how their mood influenced each other by modelling the spread of moods using similar methods to those used to track the spread of infectious diseases. Individuals were classified as either having depressive symptoms (low mood) or not being depressed (healthy mood) according to the score cut-off associated with a clinical diagnosis of depression. The team found that while depression does not  spread , having enough friends with a healthy mood can halve the probability of developing, or double the probability of recovering from, depression over a six to 12 month period. The mathematical model used suggests that adolescents who have five or more mentally healthy friends have half the probability of becoming depressed compared to adolescents with no healthy friends. And teenagers who have 10 healthy friends have double the probability of recovering from depressive symptoms compared to adolescents with just three healthy friends. University of Warwick mathematics researcher Edward Hill is lead author of the research paper. He said:  In the context of depression, this is a very large effect size. Changing risk by a factor of two is unusual.  Our results suggest that promotion of any friendship between adolescents can reduce depression since having depressed friends does not put them at risk, but having healthy friends is both protective and curative.  Social factors such as living alone or having experienced abuse in childhood are already linked to depression. Also social support, such as having someone to talk to has been cited as important for recovery from depression. However this study looks at the effect of being friends with people on the likelihood of developing depression or recovering from it. Another author of the paper, Dr Thomas House senior lecturer in applied mathematics from the University of Manchester said:  It could be that having a stronger social network is an effective way to treat depression. More work needs to be done but it may be that we could significantly reduce the burden of depression through cheap, low-risk social interventions.  As a society, if we enable friendships to develop among adolescents (for example providing youth clubs) each adolescent is more likely to have enough friends with healthy mood to have a protective effect. This would reduce the prevalence of depression.  The University of Warwick   press release Hill EM, Griffiths FE, House T. Spreading of healthy mood in adolescent social networks.

In the article ""Understanding and predicting suicidality using a combined genomic and clinical risk assessment approach,"" researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine reported in the journal Molecular Psychiatry that they have developed blood tests and questionnaire instruments that can predict with more than 90 percent accuracy which of those patients will begin thinking of suicide, or attempt it. ""We believe that widespread adoption of risk prediction tests based on these findings during healthcare assessments will enable clinicians to intervene with lifestyle changes or treatments that can save lives,"" said Alexander B. Niculescu III, M.D., Ph.D., professor of psychiatry and medical neuroscience at the IU School of Medicine and attending psychiatrist and research and development investigator at the Richard L. Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Using RNA biomarkers from blood samples along with a newly developed questionnaires in the form of an app, the researchers were able to predict which individuals in a group of patients being seen for a variety of psychiatric illnesses would experience significant suicidal ideation with approximately 92 percent accuracy. Among patients with bipolar disorder, the accuracy reached 98 percent, Dr. Niculescu said. The combination of biomarkers and app was also accurate in predicting which of the patients would be hospitalized for suicidality in the year following testing (71 percent across all diagnoses, 94 percent for bipolar disorder). The questionnaires by themselves, implemented as apps on tablets, were able to predict the onset of significant suicidal thoughts with more than 80 percent accuracy. The research expands upon work reported by Dr. Niculescu and colleagues in 2013 in which they identified a panel of biomarkers that were significantly elevated in bipolar disorder patients with suicidal thoughts or who were hospitalized as a result of suicide attempts. ""We now have developed a better panel of biomarkers that are predictive across several psychiatric diagnoses. Combined with the apps, we have a broader spectrum predictor for suicidality,"" Dr. Niculescu said.  In additional to reproducing and expanding our own previous work, we reproduce and expand other groups' results in this burgeoning field.  The current study began with a group of 217 male psychiatric participants, followed by Dr. Niculescu and colleagues for several years with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. The researchers identified 37 participants who switched from no suicidal ideation to high suicidal ideation at different testing visits. The scientists were able to identify RNAs that were present at different levels in blood samples taken at those different testing visits, in common across these 37 individuals. Those candidate biomarkers were then evaluated using the Niculescu group's Convergent Functional Genomics approach, to prioritize the best markers. Next, working with the Marion County (Indianapolis, Ind.) Coroner's Office, the researchers validated those prioritized biomarkers using blood samples from 26 men who had committed suicide. Finally, the researchers used blood samples and medical records from a different group of patients with the same psychiatric diagnoses to confirm that the biomarkers and apps predicted suicidal ideation, and also examined their ability to predict future hospitalizations for suicidality in the first year following testing. The app-based questionnaires were developed separately, said Dr. Niculescu, director of the Laboratory of Neurophenomics at the Institute of Psychiatric Research at the IU School of Medicine. One of the apps assesses measures of mood and anxiety; the other asks questions related to life issues including physical and mental health, addictions, cultural factors and environmental stress. Neither app, he emphasized, asks whether the individual is thinking of committing suicide. Dr. Niculescu said he believes the apps are ready to be deployed and tested by medical professionals, particularly in emergency department settings. The biomarkers could also be more widely tested for in the near future he said. However, he noted two limitations that require additional research. First, all of the participants in this study were men. Studies in women are currently being conducted and are showing promising preliminary results. In addition, the research was based on work with people with psychiatric diagnoses. How well the biomarkers would work among people who have not been diagnosed with a psychiatric disease is not known. Indiana University   press release Salomon DR et al.

The results, published this week in The Journal of Neuroscience, suggest that a young, developing brain has a striking capacity for functional adaptation.  The traditional view is that cortical function is rigidly constrained by evolution. We found in childhood, the human cortex is remarkably flexible,  said Johns Hopkins cognitive neuroscientist Marina Bedny, who conducted the research while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  And experience has a much bigger role in shaping the brain than we thought.  Bedny, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, studied 19 blind and 40 sighted children, ages 4 to 17, along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology cognitive scientists Hilary Richardson and Rebecca Saxe. All but one of the blind children were blind since birth. They monitored the children s brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while the children listened to stories, music or the sound of someone speaking an unfamiliar language. The blind children s vision portion of the brain, the left lateral occipital area, responded to spoken language, music and foreign speech   but most strongly to stories they could understand. In sighted children and sighted children wearing blindfolds, that same area of the brain didn t respond. The researchers concluded that blind children s  visual  cortex is involved in understanding language. Working with individuals who are blind offers cognitive researchers an opportunity to discover how nature and nurture, or a person s genes and their experience, sculpt brain function. Though scientists have shown that occipital cortexes of congenitally blind adults can respond to language and sound, this study offers the first look at how and when the change in brain function occurs. The team found the blind children s occipital cortex response to stories reached adult levels by age 4. Because spoken language had colonized the brain s visual region so early in the children s development, the team realized the brain adaptation had nothing to do with a child s proficiency in Braille. Scientists had previously guessed that brain plasticity for spoken language in blind people had something to do with Braille. Blind children s occipital reaction to the other sounds, music and foreign speech, did increase as they aged. Bedny believes her findings could one day lead to improved therapies for people with brain damage. If someone had a damaged part of the brain, she said it could be possible to train another part of the brain do the damaged part s work.  Early in development, the human cortex can take on a strikingly wide range of functions,  Bedny said.  We should think of the brain like a computer, with a hard drive ready to be programmed and reprogrammed to do what we want.  Johns Hopkins Medicine Bedney M, Richardon H, Saxe R.

The lab-grown brain, about the size of a pencil eraser, has an identifiable structure and contains 99 percent of the genes present in the human fetal brain. Such a system will enable ethical and more rapid and accurate testing of experimental drugs before the clinical trial stage and advance studies of genetic and environmental causes of central nervous system disorders.  It not only looks like the developing brain, its diverse cell types express nearly all genes like a brain,  Anand said.  We ve struggled for a long time trying to solve complex brain disease problems that cause tremendous pain and suffering. The power of this brain model bodes very well for human health because it gives us better and more relevant options to test and develop therapeutics other than rodents.  Anand reported on his lab-grown brain Tuesday August 18 at the 2015 Military Health System Research Symposium in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Anand, who studies the association between nicotinic receptors and central nervous system disorders, was inspired to pursue a model of human neural biology after encountering disappointing results in a rodent study of an experimental autism drug. Taking a chance with a shoestring budget compared to other researchers doing similar projects, he added stem-cell engineering to his research program. Four years later, he had built himself a replica of the human brain. The main thing missing in this model is a vascular system. What is there   a spinal cord, all major regions of the brain, multiple cell types, signaling circuitry and even a retina   has the potential to dramatically accelerate the pace of neuroscience research, said Anand, also a professor of neuroscience.  In central nervous system diseases, this will enable studies of either underlying genetic susceptibility or purely environmental influences, or a combination,  he said.  Genomic science infers there are up to 600 genes that give rise to autism, but we are stuck there. Mathematical correlations and statistical methods are insufficient to in themselves identify causation. You need an experimental system   you need a human brain.  Converting adult skin cells into pluripotent cells   immature stem cells that can be programmed to become any tissue in the body   is a rapidly developing area of science that earned the researcher who discovered the technique, Shinya Yamanaka, a Nobel Prize in 2012.  Once a cell is in that pluripotent state, it can become any organ   if you know what to do to support it to become that organ,  Anand said.  The brain has been the holy grail because of its enormous complexity compared to any other organ. Other groups are attempting to do this as well.  Anand s method is proprietary and he has filed an invention disclosure with the university. He said he used techniques to differentiate pluripotent stem cells into cells that are designed to become neural tissue, components of the central nervous system or other brain regions.  We provide the best possible environment and conditions that replicate what s going on in utero to support the brain,  he said of the work he completed with colleague Susan McKay, a research associate in biological chemistry and pharmacology. High-resolution imaging of the organoid identifies functioning neurons and their signal-carrying extensions   axons and dendrites   as well as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. The model also activates markers for cells that have the classic excitatory and inhibitory functions in the brain, and that enable chemical signals to travel throughout the structure. It takes about 15 weeks to build a model system developed to match the 5-week-old fetal human brain. Anand and McKay have let the model continue to grow to the 12-week point, observing expected maturation changes along the way.  If we let it go to 16 or 20 weeks, that might complete it, filling in that 1 percent of missing genes. We don t know yet,  he said. He and McKay have already used the platform to launch their own projects, creating brain organoid models of Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases and autism in a dish. They hope that with further development and the addition of a pumping blood supply, the model could be used for stroke therapy studies. For military purposes, the system offers a new platform for the study of Gulf War illness, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Anand hopes his brain model could be incorporated into the Microphysiological Systems program, a platform the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is developing by using engineered human tissue to mimic human physiological systems. Support for the work came from the Marci and Bill Ingram Research Fund for Autism Spectrum Disorders and the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Research Fund. Anand and McKay are co-founders of a Columbus-based start-up company, NeurXstem, to commercialize the brain organoid platform, and have applied for funding from the federal Small Business Technology Transfer program to accelerate its drug discovery applications.

6,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-pathways-for-diabetes-research-202854,New Pathways for Diabetes Research A new Florida State University study is changing how scientists look at diabetes research and the drugs used to treat the disease  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Associate Professor of Chemistry Brian Miller and post-doctoral researcher Carl Whittington have reported that a key enzyme involved in the body s response to glucose can essentially be corrupted by a new mechanism that scientists have not seen before. This discovery shifts the current understanding of how this enzyme participates in certain diseases, including hyperinsulinemia and diabetes.  In principle, our findings could open the door for a new approach to treat diseases of glucose homeostasis, such as diabetes,  Miller said. The enzyme is called glucokinase and serves as the body s primary glucose sensor as it relays signals in the pancreas and liver telling other areas of the body to take up and process glucose. When that enzyme function is impaired, a person often suffers from diabetes, or other glucose-related illnesses.Because of its role in the cell, glucokinase has received considerable attention by pharmaceutical companies as a potential therapeutic target. More than a decade ago, researchers uncovered drugs that activate the enzyme, which offered hope for treating type 2 diabetes. The focus, however, was on only one way that the enzyme was activated. Miller and Whittington s research showed there is actually another avenue for activation. The work showed that this new activation mechanism is operational in clinically characterized disease forms of the enzyme. Activation of glucokinase is a known cause of hyperinsulinemia, a disease characterized by over secretion of insulin even in the absence of glucose, often leading to insulin resistance.  Glucokinase-associated hyperinsulinemia varies in severity depending upon the level of activation of the enzyme,  Whittington said.  Our study is important because it sheds new light onto how the functional properties of the enzyme can manifest in disease.  In addition to the direct medical implications, the new study also shifts a fundamental principle of biochemistry known as allostery. Allostery is one way in which the function of proteins in the cell are controlled and regulated. Previously, scientists believed that allosteric regulation of glucokinase depended on strict structural transitions of the biomolecule. But, the new research indicates, that regulation of the enzyme relies not only on its structure, but also on its inherent flexibility and how the enzyme moves over different periods of time. In collaboration with Professor Rafael Br schweiler of The Ohio State University, the FSU researchers used a method known as nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR, to probe the functional dynamics of the glucokinase in great detail. This research built upon another paper Miller and Br schweiler wrote in Angwandte Chemie last month that quantified the structural dynamics of both normal and disease-variant forms of glucokinase.   We can see which parts of the enzyme move at what rate and speed,  Br schweiler said,  and thereby directly interfere with the catalytic process, giving rise to this enzyme s complex response to changes in glucose levels that is essential for its proper function in the human body.  This discovery will stimulate additional research by the Miller and Br schweiler team in an attempt to fully understand the new activation process. It may also generate renewed interest in glucokinase from the pharmaceutical arena. According to the American Diabetes Association, 29.1 million Americans have diabetes and case numbers are expected to rise. There have been some complications with diabetes drugs that activate glucokinase.  As a result, some companies have started looking at other options to treat the disease, and the new findings might aid this process.","Published: August 19, 2015"

HIV is most commonly transmitted between individuals in semen, the male reproductive fluid, which contains deposits of protein fragments called amyloid fibrils. These fibrils can increase the transmission of HIV by helping the virus attach to the membrane surrounding human cells. The scientists surmise that therapies that reduce the levels of amyloid fibrils in semen might be able to reduce the transmission of HIV. Senior author James Shorter, PhD, an associate professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, notes the first paper describes how the investigators repurposed a yeast heat shock protein called Hsp104 to attack amyloid fibrils. First, Hsp104 and an enhanced engineered variant directly remodeled fibrils into non-amyloid forms. They also made inactive Hsp104 scaffolds that reorganized fibrils into larger, innocuous assemblies. And finally, they modified Hsp104 to interact with a chambered enzyme to irreversibly degrade fibrils from semen. Each strategy diminished the ability of amyloid to promote HIV infection, so this approach has potential as a therapeutic,  Shorter said. The work was a team effort driven by lead author Laura Castellano, PhD, who obtained her doctoral degree in the Shorter lab, and coauthor Drew Weissman, MD, PhD, a professor of Medicine in the division of Infectious Diseases. Another paper by Shorter, Castellano and their collaborators at Ulm University Medical Center, Germany, including Jan M nch and Edina Lump, describes a second approach   a small molecule that also disrupts amyloids in semen that promote HIV infection. However, this molecule, called CLR01, also attacks the virus itself. Tweezers-shaped CLR01 can both disrupt fibril formation and disassemble fibrils that have already formed. CLR01 prevents HIV particles from interacting with fibrils by disrupting the membranes that surround the virus particles and can displace the virus particles that have already bound to the fibrils. In the presence of CLR01, human cells exposed to semen that contained HIV were at least 100-fold less likely to become infected with the virus. CLR01 was also effective at directly disrupting other enveloped viruses, including hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus, but was ineffective against the non-enveloped human adenovirus type 5. CLR01 may also be effective against many other enveloped viruses including flu and Ebola. Amyloid fibrils formed by different proteins in the brain are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson s disease, and CLR01 could also be useful for these disorders, say the authors. The Breakthrough Treatment for Degenerative Diseases is a collaborative, international team pursuing CLR01 for these disorders.  CLR01 has considerable potential to be used as a therapy for reducing the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted viral diseases,  said Shorter.  Remarkably, CLR01 does not affect cell membranes, which suggests it could be safely incorporated into a vaginal or anal gel to prevent HIV infection   without the risk of side effects.  The next step could be to assess safety and efficacy in non-human primates.  We think that CLR01 could be more effective than other microbicides that are in development because of its dual action, its safety in terms of side effects and its potential broad application,  Shorter said.","Published: August 19, 2015"

Evidence increasingly suggests that there is an association between the microbiota in the gut   bacteria, fungi and viruses   and the development of autoimmune disorders. Findings from this study suggest how that association may be made and therefore have implications about the origins of autoimmune diseases not only in the eye, but also elsewhere in the body, said Rachel R. Caspi, Ph.D., a senior investigator at NEI whose lab led the study. Autoimmune uveitis accounts for more than 10 percent of severe visual disability in the United States. Corticosteroids provide a blanket approach to the disorder by quelling inflammation, but their long-term use can lead to adverse side effects.Understanding what spurs autoimmune uveitis is fundamental to the development of safer long-term therapies and possibly even strategies for preventing it, said Reiko Horai, Ph.D., a staff scientist at NEI and a lead author of the study, published in the journal Immunity. Carlos R. Zarate-Blades, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at NEI, is the other lead author. The eye is one of the places in the body that has immune privilege meaning it is protected by a blood-tissue barrier that physically separates it from the rest of the body and minimizes the exchange of substances and blood-borne cells going in and out of the eye. In the case of autoimmune uveitis, immune cells (T cells) are thought to penetrate through this blood-ocular barrier. But first, they must become activated, which occurs when they come in contact with the protein that they are pre-programmed to recognize. This is how T cells fight an infection and some types of cancer   by targeting proteins on bacteria, viruses and cells. And herein lies a paradox that s been puzzling uveitis researchers. The proteins believed to be targeted in autoimmune uveitis are sequestered in the eye; they don t exist elsewhere in the body. So what activates the T cells and allows them to cross the blood-ocular barrier? The researchers asked this question by studying mice genetically engineered to develop autoimmune uveitis, due to a high level of retina-reactive T cells in their bodies. Before the mice had developed signs of the disease, the team searched their bodies for activated T cells and made an interesting discovery. Levels of activated T cells were not elevated in the lymph nodes (the glands that tend to swell during infections), but they were abundant in the intestines. What s more, the T cells in the gut produced a protein shown in previous studies by Dr. Caspi s team to augment the damage in autoimmune uveitis.  These discoveries support the idea that activation of T cells in the gut may actually precede the first signs of the disease,  she said. To test that idea, the researchers gave the mice an antibiotic cocktail designed to wipe out a broad spectrum of bacteria in the gut and by rearing them in a germ-free environment. They found that mice without gut bacteria developed autoimmune uveitis much later, and with less severity, compared to control mice with normal gut flora. There was a similar delay in uveitis and decline in its severity when the uveitis-prone mice were raised in an environment free of bacteria and other germs. But when the same mice were later moved into normal housing, where they acquired normal gut bacteria, the uveitis roared in at full strength. So how do bacteria in the gut activate T cells against cells in the eye? The researchers theorize that bacteria in the gut produce a molecule that, to T cells, looks similar to a protein in the retina. This gives the T cells marching orders to look for that retinal protein and attack it. Consistent with this idea, the researchers found that they could activate retina-specific T cells by exposing them to a soup of bacterial proteins extracted from mouse intestines. When those activated T cells were injected into normal mice (not prone to uveitis), the mice developed uveitis.  Given the huge variety of bacteria in our intestines, if they can mimic a retinal protein, it is conceivable that they could also mimic other self-proteins in the body. So we believe that normally harmless bacteria in the gut could be involved in promoting other autoimmune diseases as well,  Dr. Caspi said. The results don t have immediate implications for patients, but will help inform further research to understand the disease and help to develop new therapies, Dr. Caspi said. Eliminating bacteria from our bodies isn t a treatment option, and a bacteria-free state would not be feasible. However, if scientists could one day identify the bacteria specifically involved in promoting autoimmune uveitis, it might be possible to target only those of interest.","Published: August 19, 2015"

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/jumping-genes-unusually-active-in-many-gi-cancers-199000, Jumping Genes  Unusually Active In Many GI Cancers Rogue gene insertions could one day speed diagnosis  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Results of a trio of studies done on human cancer tissue biopsies have added to growing evidence that a so-called jumping gene called LINE-1 is active during the development of many gastrointestinal cancers. The Johns Hopkins scientists who conducted the studies caution there is no proof that the numerous new ""insertions"" of these rogue genetic elements in the human genome actually cause cancers, but they say their experiments do suggest that these elements, formally known as transposons, might one day serve as a marker for early cancer diagnosis. Collectively, the studies focus on insertions of a stretch of DNA -- the LINE-1 transposon -- that, as its name suggestions, can produce copies of itself that hop into new areas of the genome and may interrupt normal DNA sequences. This particular genetic interloper, the investigators say, has been in the human genome for so long that an estimated 17 percent of it is made up of LINE-1 copies, the vast majority of which are now ""rusty hulks"" of their former selves, unable to move at all. A few, however, are still mobile.  Researchers previously reported cases in which new LINE-1 insertions disabled cancer-fighting genes inside tumors, but no one knew how common it was for jumping genes to play a role in cancer development, says Haig Kazazian, M.D. , professor of molecular biology and genetics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine's McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, who participated in two of the studies. ""A challenge we had to overcome to begin to answer that question was detecting new copies of LINE-1 when the human genome already contains so many -- it was like finding a needle in a haystack,"" he adds. After Kazazian and then-graduate student Adam Ewing devised a method to find LINE-1 insertions using powerful genetic sequencing technology, the two worked with research fellow Szilvia Solyom, Ph.D., and other colleagues to analyze the insertions in several types and stages of gastrointestinal cancer tissues biopsies. They compared the DNA insertions they found in colon, pancreatic and gastric cancer to those in healthy tissue from the same people. Results showed that new insertions of the still-mobile LINE-1 transposons tended to occur early in cancer development, Solyom says. For example, she says, a total of 29 new insertions were found in colon polyps, and 24 new insertions were found in samples from seven patients with pancreatic cancer. Of those, 13 were found in both the primary cancer and metastasized cancer cells, indicating that they had occurred before the tumor metastasized.  Researchers led by Kathleen Burns, M.D., Ph.D. , an associate professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins, homed in on LINE-1 insertions in pancreatic cancers. Using tissues from autopsies of 22 people with pancreatic cancer, they compared insertions in normal tissues, primary tumors and metastases. Of these, 21 of the cancers had LINE-1 insertions that were not present in the patients' healthy tissue, Burns says, and there tended to be more insertions in the metastasized tumors than in the primary tumors, indicating that the insertions are occurring concurrently with cancer progression. In the third study, graduate student Tara Doucet in Kazazian's laboratory and others examined LINE-1 insertions in esophageal cancer and a condition known as Barrett's esophagus that is sometimes a precursor to cancer. They found new insertions in some, but not all of both patients whose Barrett's esophagus had not progressed to cancer after 15 or more years, and patients with both Barrett's esophagus and cancer. ""The key question is whether these insertions are driving cancer development or whether they are just a byproduct of cancer,"" says Kazazian. To help answer that question, his group hopes to analyze the genomes of individual cells to see whether most insertions seen in cancer cells also crop up in normal cells.

What spurs this response is a mystery, but now a study on mice suggests that bacteria in the gut may provide a kind of training ground for immune cells to attack the eye. The study was conducted by researchers at the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health. Evidence increasingly suggests that there is an association between the microbiota in the gut - bacteria, fungi and viruses - and the development of autoimmune disorders. Findings from this study suggest how that association may be made and therefore have implications about the origins of autoimmune diseases not only in the eye, but also elsewhere in the body, said Rachel R. Caspi, Ph.D., a senior investigator at NEI whose lab led the study. Autoimmune uveitis accounts for more than 10 percent of severe visual disability in the United States. Corticosteroids provide a blanket approach to the disorder by quelling inflammation, but their long-term use can lead to adverse side effects. Understanding what spurs autoimmune uveitis is fundamental to the development of safer long-term therapies and possibly even strategies for preventing it, said Reiko Horai, Ph.D., a staff scientist at NEI and a lead author of the study, published in the journal Immunity. Carlos R. Zarate-Blades, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at NEI, is the other lead author. The eye is one of the places in the body that has immune privilege meaning it is protected by a blood-tissue barrier that physically separates it from the rest of the body and minimizes the exchange of substances and blood-borne cells going in and out of the eye. In the case of autoimmune uveitis, immune cells (T cells) are thought to penetrate through this blood-ocular barrier. But first, they must become activated, which occurs when they come in contact with the protein that they are pre-programmed to recognize. This is how T cells fight an infection and some types of cancer - by targeting proteins on bacteria, viruses and cells. And herein lies a paradox that s been puzzling uveitis researchers. The proteins believed to be targeted in autoimmune uveitis are sequestered in the eye; they don t exist elsewhere in the body. So what activates the T cells and allows them to cross the blood-ocular barrier? The researchers asked this question by studying mice genetically engineered to develop autoimmune uveitis, due to a high level of retina-reactive T cells in their bodies. Before the mice had developed signs of the disease, the team searched their bodies for activated T cells and made an interesting discovery. Levels of activated T cells were not elevated in the lymph nodes (the glands that tend to swell during infections), but they were abundant in the intestines. What s more, the T cells in the gut produced a protein shown in previous studies by Dr. Caspi s team to augment the damage in autoimmune uveitis.  These discoveries support the idea that activation of T cells in the gut may actually precede the first signs of the disease,  she said. To test that idea, the researchers gave the mice an antibiotic cocktail designed to wipe out a broad spectrum of bacteria in the gut and by rearing them in a germ-free environment. They found that mice without gut bacteria developed autoimmune uveitis much later, and with less severity, compared to control mice with normal gut flora. There was a similar delay in uveitis and decline in its severity when the uveitis-prone mice were raised in an environment free of bacteria and other germs. But when the same mice were later moved into normal housing, where they acquired normal gut bacteria, the uveitis roared in at full strength. So how do bacteria in the gut activate T cells against cells in the eye? The researchers theorize that bacteria in the gut produce a molecule that, to T cells, looks similar to a protein in the retina. This gives the T cells marching orders to look for that retinal protein and attack it. Consistent with this idea, the researchers found that they could activate retina-specific T cells by exposing them to a soup of bacterial proteins extracted from mouse intestines. When those activated T cells were injected into normal mice (not prone to uveitis), the mice developed uveitis.  Given the huge variety of bacteria in our intestines, if they can mimic a retinal protein, it is conceivable that they could also mimic other self-proteins in the body. So we believe that normally harmless bacteria in the gut could be involved in promoting other autoimmune diseases as well,  Dr. Caspi said. The results don t have immediate implications for patients, but will help inform further research to understand the disease and help to develop new therapies, Dr. Caspi said. Eliminating bacteria from our bodies isn t a treatment option, and a bacteria-free state would not be feasible. However, if scientists could one day identify the bacteria specifically involved in promoting autoimmune uveitis, it might be possible to target only those of interest.","Published: August 19, 2015"

The goal of the project is to provide a basis for the development of precision medicine, or more individually tailored therapies for ALS.  We want to bring genomics right to the point of care in ALS where instead of focusing on retrospective DNA samples with limited clinical information, we focus on patients who are under active clinical management,  said ALS Association Chief Scientist Lucie Bruijn, Ph.D., M.B.A.  By focusing on patients seen by participating ALS clinics, this project will allow investigators to ask how different genetic causes of ALS translate into different clinical consequences.  An explicit aim of the collaboration is to set the stage for a nationwide effort to ensure the genomic characterization of all patients with ALS.   We know that ALS is not just one disease,  explained Tim Harris, senior vice president, Precision Medicine at Biogen.  This study will help in developing a detailed understanding of how different genes contribute to different clinical forms of ALS. This will in turn help us design better, more focused clinical trials for the development of more effective treatments. This kind of  precision medicine,  in which a treatment is tailored to a person s unique genetic make-up, is already being used in the cancer field. It is an approach we feel is ready for ALS too.   Until recently, most large-scale genomics studies used archived DNA samples, so the findings had minimal impact on patient care,  said David B. Goldstein, Ph.D., professor of genetics and development and director of the Institute for Genomic Medicine at CUMC.  ""This project reflects our commitment to using ALS genomic studies to benefit patients directly through diagnoses and to set the stage for genetically stratified clinical trials.   This project will provide a clinical deliverable to the 1500 patients that participate in the study.  We will use our extensive database of ALS genomes and exomes to carefully identify definitive genetic risk factors for ALS and these risk factors will be communicated back to participating clinics. The database we create will allow for an unprecedented investigation of the clinical correlates of the genetic causes of ALS.  said Dr. Matthew Harms, M.D., who will lead the project and be joining CUMC in the fall as an assistant professor of neurology. Patient blood cells will be stored at the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, a facility supported by the ALS Association, at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute. This cell bank will allow researchers to create cell lines for further study, based on leads provided by genome sequencing.  The ability to create patient iPS cells from such a genetically well-annotated ALS blood repository will allow us to model causes of motor neuron degeneration in ALS at a scale that has never been possible,  said Dhruv Sareen, Ph.D., who leads the Cedars-Sinai iPSC Core. Clinical data will be collected and curated through the NeuroBank system at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and cell lines will be developed at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. Currently, participating clinical sites in this effort include the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, Duke Medical Center, Houston Methodist, the Scotland ALS clinic network, University of Minnesota and Hennepin County Medical Center, University of Utah, University of Washington, and Washington University in St. Louis. The project is being funded through Biogen s $30 million strategic alliance with CUMC and $3.5 million from The ALS Association.

The bread, known as sourdough because it s been fermented with lactic acid bacteria, will have a savoury taste. Its other taste compounds, including bitter, sweet and sour, will harmonize nicely.  Therefore, if you take the salt away, you still have a well-balanced taste,  said G nzle. In fact, his team found it s possible to reduce salt levels from two to one per cent without harming the taste or texture of the bread. Sourdough has long been considered the gold standard by bakers and consumers for fine-tasting and textured bread, although different bakers use different bacteria. What this research did was pinpoint exactly which bacteria produce glutamate that gives bread a savoury taste. By comparing two strains of Lactobacillus reuteri that differ only with respect to glutamate accumulation, G nzle and fellow researchers Wendy Wismer, an expert in sensory and consumer science, and Cindy Zhao, a PhD candidate in food microbiology, made the link that had been long suspected but not proven: the product of bacterial fermentation that produces savoury taste is glutamate. The team s second breakthrough on salt reduction occurred because they asked untrained tasters to describe the differences between bread with glutamates and without.  What consumers told us is that there is a difference when there s glutamate present, and if the glutamate is present they thought the intensity of the salty taste is higher,  said G nzle.  That confused us, because glutamate is a savoury taste, not a salty one.  So Zhao went to Switzerland and worked with a panel of trained tasters who can discriminate and measure minute differences in taste. They discovered that sourdough with the same salt levels as regular bread actually tasted saltier.  So it means that the sourdough bread with glutamates does enhance the salty, because it tasted saltier,  said Zhao. Therefore, reducing the salt would not unduly affect the taste. As for the texture, it was maintained because the sourdough can decrease the pH and also produce the sugar residues that contribute to the texture. For consumers, the research means they can have healthier bread without sacrificing taste or texture. A bread industry firm in Europe is now testing the L. reuteri bacteria for that purpose. Meanwhile, Zhao is conducting more research on L .reuteri and the ability of sourdough bacteria to produce taste-active peptides, including recently discovered peptides with taste-enhancing properties called  kokumi.  Its properties may allow her to bake bread with further improved taste.  The work on peptides will help us to better understand how to make tasty bread without adding too much salt or sugar,  she said.","Published: August 19, 2015"

Results showed that its proprietary metabolomics platform enhances the interpretation of genetic data and has the potential to improve disease prevention and diagnosis in patient care. The study was conducted with Baylor College of Medicine, and results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Metabolon analyzed blood plasma samples collected by Baylor from 80 healthy adults, with no serious diseases reported or known at the time. Investigators also obtained a detailed medical history and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data for each volunteer. Metabolon s platform profiled about 600 metabolites covering 72 biochemical pathways and identified medical findings in nearly 25 percent of the subjects. Metabolic abnormalities pointed to potential damaging genetic mutations that were previously unidentified. Additionally, early signs of diabetes, liver dysfunction and disruption of gut microbiome were identified among the volunteers. Metabolic responses to medications in some subjects also showed sensitivity to toxicity.  We successfully spotted underlying health issues that were previously undetected or not highlighted in the genetic data,  said John Ryals, Ph.D., president and CEO of Metabolon.  Whether used for routine health assessment or in conjunction with genetic sequencing, metabolomics should be considered an important tool in precision medicine.  There is growing appreciation that complex illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. Metabolomics integrates the influences of genes, diet, lifestyle, environment and xenobiotics to aid in understanding gene function, how diseases originate, and biomarkers for health assessment and customized drug therapy.  This study combines the functional measurement of metabolomics with the DNA gene variant sequences in an individual, moving us toward greater precision in genetic diagnosis interpretation,  said Dr. Thomas Caskey, lead investigator and professor at the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine.  The impact of genetic and non-genetic factors needs to be taken into account for clinicians to make an informed diagnosis,  continued Ryals.  Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful technology for precision medicine by dissecting underlying disease processes. This has set the stage for new ways to diagnose, monitor and provide guidance for treatment. ","Published: August 19, 2015"

Neurons themselves make amyloid- , and for reasons that aren t fully understood, its accumulation ultimately contributes to the memory loss, personality changes, and other symptoms that patients with this degenerative disease often suffer from. New research by Rockefeller University scientists and their colleagues have identified a series of naturally occurring molecular steps known as a pathway that can dampen the production of amyloid- . These results, reported in Nature Medicine, suggest a new route in the search for Alzheimer s therapies.  Our discovery centers on a protein called WAVE1, which we found to be important in the production of amyloid- . The reduction of WAVE1 appears to have a protective effect against the disease,  says study author Paul Greengard, Vincent Astor Professor, head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, and director of The Fisher Center for Alzheimer s Research. When levels of amyloid-  rise, there is an accompanying increase in another molecule, AICD, which reduces the expression of WAVE1. This has the effect of reducing the production of amyloid- .  By targeting steps within this newly discovered pathway,  he adds,  it may be possible to develop drugs to reduce amyloid-  that potentially could be used to either treat or prevent Alzheimer s disease.  WAVE1 is known to help to build filaments of a protein called actin that serve as basic components of cellular structures. In the current study, the team, including first author Ilaria Ceglia, who conducted this work while a research associate in the lab, examined the levels of WAVE1 in mouse and cellular models of Alzheimer s disease and found that they were unusually low. Research done by a collaborator at Columbia University found this was also true for the brains of human patients with the disease. To take a closer look at the relationship between amyloid-  and WAVE1, the researchers tested the brains and memories of mice genetically altered to produce high levels of amyloid-  and varying levels of WAVE1. They found a dose-dependent response: Mice brains with low WAVE1 levels produced less amyloid- , and these animals performed better on memory tests. Next, the researchers wanted to know how WAVE1 affects the production of amyloid- . The precursor to this Alzheimer s protein is not harmful by itself, and does not normally yield brain-damaging products. However, sometimes the precursor is processed in such a way that it produces disease-promoting amyloid- . The team found high levels of both the amyloid precursor protein and WAVE1 in a compartment within the cell known as the Golgi, which acts as a sort of shipping department. Here proteins are packaged before they are sent out to various destinations within the cell. In the case of the amyloid precursor protein, the first destination is the cell s outer membrane. From there, it travels into the compartments within the cell, where it is processed to produce amyloid- . Because the formation of structural filaments is critical to the process by which cargo buds off and leaves the Golgi, the researchers suspected a role for WAVE1. Their experiments showed an interaction between WAVE1 and the amyloid precursor protein, and confirmed that WAVE1 mediates the formation of cargo vesicles containing amyloid precursor protein.  The result is a negative feedback loop,  says corresponding author Yong Kim, a research assistant professor in the lab.  More amyloid-  means more AICD. Our experiments reveal that AICD travels into the nucleus where it reduces the expression of WAVE1. Less WAVE1 means less precursor protein in cargo traveling to the membrane for conversion into amyloid- . In Alzheimer s disease, this negative feedback appears to lose its protective effect, and the next step for us is to figure out how.  The Rockefeller University   press release Kim Y et al.

To date, it has been assumed that that dominance is not determined by the physical structure of a given language. However, the biopsychologists have demonstrated that both hemispheres are equally involved in the perception of whistled Turkish. Onur G nt rk n, Monika G nt rk n and Constanze Hahn report in the journal  Current Biology . The perception of all spoken languages   including those with clicks  , written texts and even sign language involves the left brain hemisphere more strongly than the right one. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, processes acoustic information via slow frequencies, pitch and melody. According to the currently commonly held opinion, the asymmetry in language processing is not determined by the physical properties of a given language.  The theory can be easily verified by analyzing a language which possesses the full range of physical properties in the perception of which the right brain hemisphere is specialized,  says Onur G nt rk n.  We can count ourselves lucky that such a language exists   namely whistled Turkish.  The Bochum team tested 31 inhabitants of Ku?k y, a village in Turkey, who speak Turkish and whistle it as well. Via headphones, they were presented either whistled or spoken Turkish syllables. In some test runs, they heard different syllables in both ears, in other runs the same syllables. They were asked to state which syllable they had perceived. The left brain hemisphere processes information from the right ear, the right hemisphere from the left ear. For spoken Turkish, a clear asymmetry emerged: If the participants heard different syllables, they perceived the syllables from the right ear much more frequently   a dominance of the left brain hemisphere. That asymmetry did not exist in whistled Turkish.  The results have shown that brain asymmetries occur at a very early signal processing stage,  concludes the researcher from Bochum. Whistled Turkish contains the same vocabulary and follows the same grammatical rules as Turkish.  It is simply a different format, in the same way as written and spoken Turkish are,  describes Onur G nt rk n. A small group of people in the mountainous north-eastern part of Turkey use whistled language which can be heard over distances of several kilometres.  Even though I am Turkish, I had, strangely enough, never heard of whistled Turkish. I encountered it in Australia for the first time, when a colleague told me about it,  explains the biopsychologist.  I knew instantly that nature had thus provided the perfect method for verifying the theory regarding asymmetry of language perception.

The cause of ALS is poorly understood. Diet is highly modifiable but previous studies have not identified a consistent nutrient that modifies susceptibility to ALS and contradictory results exist for the association with fat intake. Jan H. Veldink, M.D., Ph.D., of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands, and colleagues used a 199-item food frequency questionnaire to study premorbid (pre-illness) dietary intake and the risk of ALS. The study was conducted from 2006 to September 2011 and included all patients with a new diagnosis of ALS. The final analysis included 674 patients and 2,093 control patients without ALS. The authors found presymptomatic total calorie intake in patients was higher compared with those individuals in the control group (average 2,258 vs. 2,119 kcal/day) and presymptomatic BMI was lower in patients (25.7 vs. 26). The study analysis also suggests that higher premorbid intake of total fat, saturated fat, trans-fatty acids and cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of ALS, while higher alcohol intake was associated with a decreased risk. No significant associations were found between dietary intake and survival. The authors note limitations in their study that include the use of a questionnaire, which is prone to recall bias by participants. ""The combination of independent positive associations of a low premorbid body mass index and a high fat intake together with prior evidence from ALS mouse models ... and earlier reports on premorbid body mass index support a role for increased resting energy expenditure before clinical onset of ALS,"" the study concludes.

The University of Bristol study, published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, could have important implications for treating symptoms of brain disorders. Many of our everyday cognitive functions such as learning and memory rely on normal communication between the two regions of the brain - the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. While previous studies have identified disruption to communication channels in these two areas of the brain contribute to symptoms in psychiatric disorders, the mechanisms that lead to these disturbances have been largely unknown, until now. In this study, led by Professor Zafar Bashir from Bristol's School of Physiology and Pharmacology, the researchers studied the neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine, which work together in controlling normal transmission between these brain regions by communicating chemical information throughout our brain and are disrupted in schizophrenics. The team found that subtle changes in the interplay of these transmitters completely altered the flow of information from the hippocampus to prefrontal cortex. Over-activation of the D2 class of dopamine receptors led to suppression of the function of NMDA receptors, which are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, at the synaptic connection between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This in turn leads to a marked disruption of communication between these brain regions. Dr Paul Banks, one of the researchers, said: ""Our findings demonstrate a mechanism for how dopamine neurotransmission can influence NMDA receptor function at a connection in the brain needed for complex mental tasks which are disrupted in schizophrenic patients. It has been known for some time that dopamine and NMDA receptor function are altered in schizophrenic patients - our data mirror the direction of these changes and therefore might give insight into how these changes come about mechanistically.""

They mapped the 3-D atomic structure of a two-part protein complex that controls the release of neurotransmitter signaling chemicals from brain cells. Understanding how cells release those signals in less than one-thousandth of a second could help launch a new wave of research on drugs for treating brain disorders. The experiments, at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray laser at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, build upon decades of previous research at Stanford University, Stanford School of Medicine and SLAC. Researchers reported their latest findings in the journal Nature. ""This is a very important, exciting advance that may open up possibilities for targeting new drugs to control neurotransmitter release. Many mental disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and anxiety, affect neurotransmitter systems,"" said Axel Brunger, the study's principal investigator. He is a professor at Stanford School of Medicine and SLAC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. ""Both parts of this protein complex are essential,"" Brunger said, ""but until now it was unclear how its two pieces fit and work together."" The two protein parts are known as neuronal SNAREs and synaptotagmin-1. Earlier X-ray studies, including experiments at SLAC's Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) nearly two decades ago, shed light on the structure of the SNARE complex, a helical protein bundle found in yeasts and mammals. SNAREs play a key role in the brain's chemical signaling by joining, or ""fusing,"" little packets of neurotransmitters to the outer edges of neurons, where they are released and then dock with chemical receptors in another neuron to trigger a response. In this latest research, the scientists found that when the SNAREs and synaptotagmin-1 join up, they act as an amplifier for a slight increase in calcium concentration, triggering a gunshot-like release of neurotransmitters from one neuron to another. They also learned that the proteins join together before they arrive at a neuron's membrane, which helps to explain how they trigger brain signaling so rapidly. ""The neuron is not building the 'gun' as it sits there on the membrane -- it's already there,"" Brunger said. The team speculates that several of the joined protein complexes may group together and simultaneously interact with the same vesicle to efficiently trigger neurotransmitter release, an exciting area for further studies. ""The structure of the SNARE-synaptotagmin-1 complex is a milestone that the field has awaited for a long time, and it sets the framework for a better understanding of the system,"" said James Rothman, a professor at Yale University who discovered the SNARE proteins and shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Thomas C. S dhof, a professor at the Stanford School of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator who shared that 2013 Nobel Prize with Rothman, discovered synaptotagmin-1 and showed that it plays an important role as a calcium sensor and calcium-dependent trigger for neurotransmitter release. ""The new structure has identified unanticipated interfaces between synaptotagmin-1 and the neuronal SNARE complex that change how we think about their interaction by revealing, in atomic detail, exactly where they bind together,"" S dhof said. ""This is a new concept that goes much beyond previous general models of how synaptotagmin-1 functions."" To study the joined protein structure, researchers in Brunger's laboratory at the Stanford School of Medicine found a way to grow crystals of the complex. They used a robotic system developed at SSRL to study the crystals at SLAC's LCLS, an X-ray laser that is one of the brightest sources of X-rays on the planet. SSRL and LCLS are DOE Office of Science User Facilities. The researchers combined and analyzed hundreds of X-ray images from about 150 protein crystals to reveal the atomic-scale details of the joined structure. SSRL's Aina Cohen, who oversaw the development of the highly automated platform used for the neuroscience experiment, said, ""This experiment was the first to use this robotic platform at LCLS to determine a previously unsolved structure of a large, challenging multi-protein complex."" The study was also supported by X-ray experiments at SSRL and at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source. ""This is a good example of how advanced tools, instruments and X-ray methods are providing us new insights into what are truly complex mechanisms,"" Cohen said. Brunger said future studies will explore other protein interactions relevant to neurotransmitter release. ""What we studied is only a subset,"" he said. ""There are many other factors interacting with this system and we want to know what these look like. This by no means is the end of the story.""

Tracking such changes may provide new measures of risk for, and progression of the disease, according to a literature review published online in the journal Schizophrenia Research: Cognition, authored by researchers at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai and Rutgers University. Individuals with schizophrenia have trouble with social interactions and in recognizing what is real. Past research has suggested that, in schizophrenia, abnormalities in the way the brain processes visual information contribute to these problems by making it harder to track moving objects, perceive depth, draw contrast between light and dark or different colors, organize visual elements into shapes, and recognize facial expressions. Surprisingly though, there has been very little prior work investigating whether differences in the retina or other eye structures contribute to these disturbances. ""Our analysis of many studies suggests that measuring retinal changes may help doctors in the future to adjust schizophrenia treatment for each patient,"" said study co-author Richard B. Rosen, MD, Director of Ophthalmology Research, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, and Professor of Ophthalmology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""More studies are needed to drive the understanding of the contribution of retinal and other ocular pathology to disturbances seen in these patients, and our results will help guide future research."" The link between vision problems and schizophrenia is well established, with as many as 62 percent of adult patients with schizophrenia experience visual distortions involving form, motion, or color. One past study found that poorer visual acuity at four years of age predicted a diagnosis of schizophrenia in adulthood, and another that children who later develop schizophrenia have elevated rates of strabismus, or misalignment of the eyes, compared to the general population. Dr. Rosen and Steven M. Silverstein, PhD, Director of the Division of Schizophrenia Research at Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care, were the lead authors of the analysis, which examined the results of approximately 170 existing studies and grouped the findings into multiple categories, including changes in the retina vs. other parts of the eye, and changes related to dopamine vs. other neurotransmitters, key brain chemicals associated with the disease. The newly published review found multiple, replicated, indicators of eye abnormalities in schizophrenia. One of these involves widening of small blood vessels in the eyes of schizophrenia patients, and in young people at high risk for the disorder, perhaps caused by chronic low oxygen supply to the brain. This could explain several key vision changes and serve as a marker of disease risk and worsening. Also important in this regard was thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in schizophrenia, which is known to be related to the onset of hallucinations and visual acuity problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. In addition, abnormal electrical responses by retinal cells exposed to light (as measured by electroretinography) suggest cellular-level differences in the eyes of schizophrenia patients, and may represents a third useful measure of disease progression, according to the authors. In addition, the review highlighted the potentially detrimental effects of dopamine receptor-blocking medications on visual function in schizophrenia (secondary to their retinal effects), and the need for further research on effects of excessive retinal glutamate on visual disturbances in the disorder. Interestingly, the analysis found that there are no reports of people with schizophrenia who were born blind, suggesting that congenital blindness may completely or partially protect against the development of schizophrenia. Because congenitally blind people tend to have cognitive abilities in certain domains (e.g., attention) that are superior to those of healthy individuals, understanding brain re-organization after blindness may have implications for designing cognitive remediation interventions for people with schizophrenia. ""The retina develops from the same tissue as the brain,"" said Dr. Rosen. ""Thus retinal changes may parallel or mirror the integrity of brain structure and function. When present in children, these changes may suggest an increased risk for schizophrenia in later life. Additional research is needed to clarify these relationships, with the goals of better predicting emergence of schizophrenia, and of predicting relapse and treatment response and people diagnosed with the condition."" Dr. Silverstein points out that, to date, vision has been understudied in schizophrenia, and studies of the retina and other ocular structures in the disorder are in their infancy. However, he added, ""because it is much faster and less expensive to obtain data on retinal structure and function, compared to brain structure and function, measures of retinal and ocular structure and function may have an important role in both future research studies and the routine clinical care of people with schizophrenia.""

Scientists have shown that the passage of molecules through the nucleus of a star-shaped brain cell, called an astrocyte, may play a critical role in health and disease. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Unexpectedly we may have discovered a hidden pathway to understanding how astrocytes respond to injury and control brain processes. The pathway may be common to many brain diseases and we re just starting to follow it,  said Katerina Akassoglou, Ph.D., a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, and a senior author of the study. Some neurological disorders are associated with higher than normal brain levels of the growth factor TGF-beta, including Alzheimer's disease and brain injury. Previous studies found that after brain injury, astrocytes produce greater amounts of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a protein that helps cells detect growth factors. The cells also react to TGF-beta by changing their shapes and secreting proteins that alter neuronal activity. Dr. Akassoglou s lab showed that eliminating the p75NTR gene prevented hydrocephalus in mice genetically engineered to have astrocytes that produce higher levels of TGF-beta. Hydrocephalus is a disorder that fills the brain with excess cerebral spinal fluid. Eliminating the p75NTR gene also prevented astrocytes in the brains of the mice from forming scars after injuries and restored gamma oscillations, which are patterns of neuronal activity associated with learning and memory. The cell nucleus is a ball of chromosomes wrapped in a protective fatty membrane. In this study, the researchers discovered that treating astrocytes with TGF-beta freed a small piece of the p75NTR protein to bind to nucleoporins, a group of proteins that regulates the passage of molecules in and out of the nucleus. Their results suggest that binding enhances the flow of certain critical molecules into the nucleus and enables astrocytes to enter a reactive state.  This research highlights the importance of the nuclear pore complex in the brain and raises the possibility that it may be a target for treating a wide range of neurological disorders,  said Jill Morris, Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The scientists used high-resolution microscopes to watch the astrocyte nucleus in action. Nuclear pores that did not have the p75NTR gene were slightly larger than normal. When the scientists treated astrocytes with TGF-beta, they saw p75NTR proteins bind to nucleoporins and open the pores. This allowed transport into the nucleus of a protein called Smad2, which is essential for TGF-beta to exert its effects on astrocytes. In other experiments, the scientists showed that eliminating p75NTR from astrocytes blocked the transport of Smad2 into the nucleus.  Nuclear pores are gatekeepers and p75NTR appears to be the key to unlocking particular gates,  said Dr. Akassoglou.  We discovered novel roles for both players and will continue to study how the nuclear pore complex controls neuronal development and disease.

The basal ganglia sits at the base of the brain and is responsible for, among other things, coordinating movement. It is made up of four interconnected, deep brain structures that imaging techniques have previously been unable to visualize. For the first time, Carnegie Mellon University BrainHub scientists have used a non-invasive brain-imaging tool to detect the pathways that connect the parts of the basal ganglia. Published in NeuroImage, the research provides a better understanding of this area's circuitry, which could potentially lead to technologies to help track disease progression for Parkinson's and Huntington's disease and other neurological disorders. ""Clinically, it is difficult to see the pathways within the basal ganglia with neuroimaging techniques, like the ever popular MRI, because many of the fiber bundles that make up key parts of this circuit are very small and buried within dense cell bodies,"" said Patrick Beukema, the lead author and a graduate student in the Center for Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh (CNUP) and the joint Pitt and CMU Center for the Basis of Neural Cognition (CNBC). ""For reasons that are not fully understood, the pathways that connect the basal ganglia's regions are highly susceptible to damage. Because they are important for motor control, this damage can result in substantial motor deficits, so it is highly desirable to discover more about this area,"" Beukema said. Diffusion MRI measures the movement of water molecules to create a visual representation of the brain's axons. In this study, the research team used two types of diffusion imaging to visualize the major pathways that connect the internal circuitry of the basal ganglia. Sixty healthy adults had their brains scanned using diffusion spectrum imaging, which provided a picture of the orientation of moving water molecules. And, multi-shell imaging was used on 78 healthy adults to get similar images using different imaging parameters. The results from both imaging techniques showed that it is possible to detect the small but important fiber connections in the brain. The researchers also found that by looking at the general patterns of water movement in the basal ganglia, they could automatically distinguish one small brain region from the other. ""The pathways that Patrick has been able to visualize are critical to so many functions, yet we haven't been able to see them in the living human brain before. This opens the door to so many research and clinical opportunities,"" said Timothy J. Verstynen, assistant professor of psychology in CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and CNBC faculty member. This is not the first brain research breakthrough to happen at Carnegie Mellon. CMU is the birthplace of artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology and has been a leader in the study of brain and behavior for more than 50 years. The university has created some of the first cognitive tutors, helped to develop the Jeopardy-winning Watson, founded a groundbreaking doctoral program in neural computation, and completed cutting-edge work in understanding the genetics of autism.

But for the one in 10 Australians who have asthma and other respiratory diseases, research into inhalable medications to help them breathe more easily could change their lives. Pharmaceutical scientist Dr Mehra Haghi hopes to develop a platform that will allow a range of drugs to be delivered by inhalation. They include antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis and anti-inflammatory drugs for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many respiratory treatments are injected or taken as pills because we have not been able to formulate them as suitable inhalable products, says Dr Haghi, a lecturer in the Graduate School of Health at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).  Formulating treatment for inhalation is more challenging because the formulated micro-particles need to be the right size to travel all the way down to the lung without causing sensitivity,  she says. Dr Haghi has just embarked on a prestigious Humboldt Research Fellowship in Germany where she will spend four months exploring a unique testing model. Typically, new drugs are tested on commercially produced cell lines but Dr Haghi has arranged to isolate cells from respiratory patients.  It s unique because we can test on cells that have the pathological characteristics of the patient,  she says.  No research has been done previously that studies at cellular level what happens to respiratory formulations after inhalation by the patient.  Dr Haghi isolates several types of lung cells from patients, culturing them separately, then combining them, in the same order and ratio they grow in the lung, to create a 3D model.  It s the closest thing we can get in the laboratory to replicating the condition we are treating,  she says. Her work could potentially lead to new and more effective treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.  The main treatment for asthma is inhaled steroids, and that hasn t really changed for the past 50 years or so,  says Associate Professor Greg King, a respiratory physician at Royal North Shore Hospital and clinician researcher at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research. In collaboration with the Woolcock Institute, Dr Haghi has developed an inhalable version of the asthma drug theophylline which is now taken orally but it can have problematic side effects. Dr King says that while modern asthma treatments are safe and effective for most patients, it is remarkably common for them to be ineffective in people with severe asthma. He estimates that 15 to 20 per cent of asthmatics experience steroid insensitivity, making treatment difficult.  In respiratory disease treatment, the preference is always to give an inhaler because that bypasses all the systemic side effects,  he says.  But there are a lot of challenges to get a preparation you can successfully put it into a puffer.  You have to be able to prove it s safe to inhale, as concentrating a formula straight onto lung tissue could irritate or damage the tissue.  In another project, Dr Haghi has developed a stable, high-performance aerosol version of the drug tranexamic acid, which is used to reduce bleeding in surgery and after birth, and as an oral treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.  Coughing blood is a significant symptom that needs to be investigated but once you find a cause, the management is relatively limited,  says Dr King.  An inhalable form of tranexamic acid to stop bleeding in the lung would make a real difference to patients. ","Published: August 18, 2015"

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease, which for the patients leads to a life-long dependence of daily injections of insulin. In Sweden approximately 2 new cases of the disease are diagnosed every day. Insulin is a hormone, which is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin is required to prevent a harmful rise in the blood glucose level.  The exact cause of T1D is not yet known, however, it is considered as an autoimmune disease. A condition that occurs when our own immune system by mistake attack and destroy healthy cells. In T1D, an infection and/or unknown factors probably triggers the immune cell attack, which ultimately leads to an insufficient insulin production. In the new study, Kailash Singh, a PhD student in professor Stellan Sandler s research group at the Department of Medical Cell Biology at Uppsala University, studied so-called immune regulatory T cells  actions in T1D mouse models. The study shows that the immune regulatory T cells alter their function by producing pro-inflammatory destructive proteins instead of protective anti-inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-35 (IL-35) under T1D conditions.   This suggests that the good guys have gone bad in early development of Type 1 diabetes and therefore our immune cells destroy the beta cell , says Dr. Kailash Singh.  Furthermore, the concentration of IL-35 was lower in T1D patients compared to healthy individuals. These findings may suggest that IL-35 could play a crucial role in human T1D. In addition, the researchers have found a novel mechanism that explains how the immune regulatory T cells are changing their destiny under a T1D condition.  Professor Sandler s research team tested whether or not IL-35 could also suppress development of T1D and reverse established T1D. To induce T1D in mice they injected a chemical compound called streptozotocin. These mice developed signs of TID and increasing blood glucose levels similar as in human T1D. IL-35 injections given after disease induction prevented from development of T1D. Strikingly, IL-35 injections to mice, which were diabetic for two consecutive days, normalized blood glucose concentrations.  The research team also successfully investigated IL-35 in another model of T1D called non-obese diabetic mouse (NOD). The interruption of IL-35 treatment did not result in return of diabetes in any of the mouse models.  The findings encourage further research on the use of IL-35 for treatment of T1D and offer new clues as to why immune regulatory T cells fail in counteracting T1D.   To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that IL-35 can reverse established Type 1 diabetes in two different mouse models and that the concentration of the particular cytokine is lower in Type 1 diabetes patients than in healthy individuals. Also, we are providing an insight into a novel mechanism: how immune regulatory T cells change their fate under autoimmune conditions , says Kailash Singh.","Published: August 18, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/process-optimization-in-cells-205973,Process Optimization In Cells Clever feedback system regulates immune responses  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. A newly discovered feedback mechanism in the body is responsible for keeping immune responses from getting out of hand. It works at the level of certain genes, linking the inactivation of those genes to the progress made in transcribing them: This clever mechanism was discovered as part of an Austrian Science Fund FWF project. The discovery offers a completely new approach for future therapies aimed at controlling the immune system. When microorganisms invade the body, cytokines (proteins that are important in cell signaling) are released that immediately trigger further defence measures. These include the activation and transcription of certain genes, and thus the production of defensive proteins. However, it is important that the body does not produce too many of these proteins, as doing so would result in harm to itself. The protein production is thus curbed in good time. It has long been known that this happens. How it happens, however, was only recently determined   thanks to the work of a team led by the immunobiologist Pavel Kovarik. In a project carried out at the Max. F. Perutz Laboratories and supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF, the researchers were able to show how this curbing occurs. INHIBITED To better understand this newly recognized mechanism, it is important to know that cytokines act on the so-called STAT family of proteins, which act as transcription factors   that is, factors that initiate gene transcription of DNA, and thus the production of proteins. To fulfil this function, the STATs must bind to special DNA sequences, and it is precisely this binding that cytokines promote. In their work, Pavel Kovarik and his team initially focused on the cytokine interferon, which is produced in response to viral infections, and on the regulation of STAT1 activity. Their investigations led to the discovery of a new and surprisingly effective mechanism. The team was able to show that, as the STAT1-induced gene transcription progresses, STAT1 is increasingly unbound from the DNA. Kovarik comments: ""This previously unknown feedback mechanism begins very early on in the process of producing defensive proteins and thus permits rapid regulation of an immune response."" The project team subsequently observed the same regulation process for STAT2 and STAT3, as well, which is an indication that this mechanism spread early on in the course of evolution. CLEAR RESULTS Kovarik was subsequently also able to show that another   already known   STAT1 inactivation process is not crucial to regulating the immune response. This other process is based on a chemical modification of the STAT proteins whereby phosphate groups are removed, resulting in the inactivation of STAT1. ""Although this inactivation does, in fact, prevent additional production of defensive proteins, the dissociation of the STAT proteins from the DNA that we discovered is the substantially more effective and thus decisive regulation step"", says Kovarik, explaining the findings of his project. STRUCTURAL CHANGE Although it is currently not known how the information regarding the progression of DNA transcription is communicated to the DNA-bound STAT1   and thus how the unbinding is triggered   Kovarik has a clear idea of how this might occur: ""Model calculations and findings from other projects suggest that the progression of the gene transcription affects the DNA structure. This structural change can cause STAT1 to unbind from the DNA."" POINT OF ATTACK The newly discovered mechanism for regulating immune responses also opens up completely new possibilities for therapeutic interventions. After all, both immune systems that react too weakly and those that overreact can cause problems   possibly resulting in severe infections or autoimmune diseases. Targeted interventions in the mechanism discovered in the context of this FWF project could hinder this, making optimum use of the body's natural immune response.","Published: August 18, 2015"

Her research has important implications for human health. While antibiotic drugs have reduced the number of illnesses and deaths associated with bacterial infections, the overuse of these drugs also has led some infectious agents to adapt to antibiotics, making the medications less effective. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die as a direct result of these infections.Palmer's research has attracted the attention of the National Institutes of Health, which recently awarded her a $1.9 million, five-year grant to study acquired antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus bacteria, the culprits responsible for some hospital-acquired infections. Dr. Michael Q. Zhang, director of the Center for Systems Biology and the Cecil H. and Ida Green Chair of Systems Biology Science at UT Dallas, is a collaborator on the grant. ""Many of our antibiotics derive from natural products,"" Palmer said. ""Microbes in the soil produce compounds that have an antibiotic action on other microbes around them. ""One of the prevailing theories for why bacteria make these antibiotic compounds is to fight off competition. But the bacteria that make the antibiotics have to be resistant to those antibiotics. Therefore, many encode antibiotic resistance genes against their own products."" Random genetic mutation is one way bacteria become antibiotic resistant, but another way is by exchanging antibiotic resistance genes with one another in close quarters, such as in human wounds or on hospital surfaces. In a recent study Palmer and her colleagues shed light on a gene-swapping process called conjugation, which, she tells her students, is like bacterial sex. ""Bacteria can exchange antibiotic resistance genes through conjugation, which requires them to meet up and come into physical contact,"" Palmer said. ""The focus of this study was trying to understand how a bacterium called Enterococcus faecalis discriminates its own genetic material from 'other' genetic material trying to enter the cell during conjugation. How do they tell self from non-self, and what defense mechanisms are used to try to shut down the invasion?"" The process of discriminating ""me"" versus ""not me"" in the bacterium Escherichia coli is fairly well understood, but what was happening in E. faecalis has been a big question mark, Palmer said. Using advanced gene-sequencing technology, she and her colleagues determined that the two kinds of bacteria use the same biochemical system to discern self from non-self. ""These bacteria utilize an enzyme to chemically scan genetic material within each cell, and at a specific sequence of bases, or 'letters,' in the DNA, they add a chemical component called a methyl group, essentially 'tagging' that material,"" Palmer said. ""The methyl group becomes a signal for 'me'."" Another enzyme patrols the bacterial cell, and when it finds an untagged DNA sequence that doesn't belong, the enzyme destroys it. ""It's not a perfect line of defense, and it's those dynamics that I'm interested in,"" Palmer said. ""Understanding how these organisms know, at a base level, what is 'self' will hopefully provide scientists with information to make more effective treatments."" One potential application of Palmer's work is phage therapy, which is the use of viruses to treat bacterial infections. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration approved spray mixtures of such viruses that can be safely applied to meat and poultry products to combat strains of Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause a serious infection in humans called listeriosis. ""A phage is a virus that infects only bacteria. They don't affect humans, animals or plants, which is an important consideration,"" Palmer said. While no phage therapy has been approved in the United States to treat humans for bacterial infections, Palmer said if antibiotic resistance trends continue, the approach might provide lifesaving alternatives. ""Phage therapy relies upon a virus injecting its DNA into a bacterial cell,"" she said. ""If we understand better how enterococci and other bacteria discriminate their own DNA from that of an invader, and how they try to defend against invasion, that might help us learn to get around those defenses and develop more effective phage therapies for the future.""","Published: August 18, 2015"

Drs Christophe Demaille and Agn s Anne from CNRS work in the Laboratoire d'Electrochimie Mol culaire at the Universit  Paris Diderot as Group Leaders of a research team aiming to probe electron transport and communication in nanometric biostructures. Their studies are performed at the single nano-object scale using combined atomic force (AFM)-Electrochemical (SECM) microscopy. In this combined microscopy technique, the tip acts as both force sensor and microelectrode. Correlated topography and tip current images can thus be simultaneously acquired. The Group produces their own hybrid AFM-SECM tips from gold microwires. Dr Demaille says that their approach is unique in that they are using a particular AFM-SECM configuration, they labeled Mt (Molecule touching) AFM-SECM, where the tip comes in direct physical contact with the nano-object to be electrochemically interrogated. Their aim is to localize individual redox active biomacromolecules and probing their activity. This involves redox labelling of the structures of interest and requires both a nanometer range spatial resolution and the ability to measure very low electrochemical currents (in the few tens of femto Ampere range). The team has previously applied this approach to characterize artificial constructs, like DNA strands on a synthetic support to help understanding the transduction mechanism of DNA electrochemical biosensors. But more recently in a collaborative work with the team of Thierry Michon from INRA, this approach has been successfully used to characterize nanometer sized biological objects such as viruses. The use of redox-immunomarking (redox labeled antibody targeting specific viral proteins) allows selective detection of the sought viral proteins since only the immunomarked proteins are seen in the tip current image. The virus topography is obtained simultaneously so that the location of the viral proteins can be resolved with respect to the virus external architecture. In terms of the future, this type of work can be extended to the evaluation of bioactive nanometric devices mimicking what may be found in plasma membranes or living cells. For instance, viruses may be used as scaffolds to specifically bind redox enzymes. Talking about their choice of system, Dr Demaille says  We believe our NanoWizard-based AFM-SECM microscope is a promising tool for viral nanotechnology since it uniquely allows the functional characterization of modified viruses. Historically, we started working on early model of commercial AFM which we modified to enable electrochemical measurements. Then we purchased the JPK NanoWizard  II system to specifically work on the ""virus"" project with a budget from an ANR grant application. The JPK AFM is much easier to handle and to modify, especially with respect to the open access (to the cell) which is not possible with other tools from the competition. We have basically kept the prism and added a wire connected to a home-designed bipotentiostat. The new setup has been implemented in the software. What is also unique with the JPK setup is the presence of a real reference electrode which is the key requirement for this type of measurement. ","Published: August 18, 2015"

The report from a team led by a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center investigator is being published soon.   The traditional approach has been to test most women with suspected hereditary risk for breast and/or ovarian cancer for BRCA1/2 alone,  explains senior author Leif Ellisen, MD, PhD, program director for Breast Medical Oncology at the MGH Cancer Center.  The concern about broader testing has been that the results really wouldn t change what we told women about their risk and management   either because the risk associated with the other genes are not as high as for BRCA1/2 or because the clinical practice guidelines associated with other genes are less specific. Our study shows that, even under current practice guidelines, finding mutations in these other genes is likely to change the clinical management recommendations both for patients and for family members who also carry the associated mutations.  The study examined whether use of currently available multigene panels to test for mutations in breast or ovarian cancer risk genes other than BRCA1/2 would change recommendations for women carrying those mutations. Investigators enrolled 1,069 patients who had been referred for genetic counseling for breast or ovarian cancer risk at MGH, Stanford University School of Medicine or Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and who did not carry BRCA1/2 mutations. For most participants, testing utilized one of two commercially available multigene panels   one a 25-gene panel, the other a 29-gene panel   screening genes associated with increased risk for breast and/or ovarian cancer and sometimes for other tumors.  Of all the screened patients, 63 were found to carry risk-associated mutations, most of which were consistent with their personal and family cancer histories. The 3.8 percent prevalence of these mutations among 1,046 patients tested with the two multigene panels   compared with 9 percent usually reported for BRCA1/2 mutations   is similar to what has been seen in previous studies. In almost one-third of these patients (20 of 63), the identified mutations were considered high-risk   including mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases risk of colorectal, ovarian and other cancers. In each case, established guidelines for patients with those mutations would call for additional screenings and possibly preventive surgery that would not have been recommended on the basis of personal/family history alone.  Among those found to carry mutations conferring a low or moderate increase in cancer risk, current guidelines would have called for enhanced screening or preventive surgery for 10 patients with breast cancer risk genes and additional screening for 3 patients with mutations associated with pancreas cancer risk. Overall, 52 percent of patients in whom a mutation was identified would be recommended for additional screening or preventive measures above and beyond what would be called for by personal and family history. In addition, the presence of the identified mutations would lead to recommendations that close female relatives of 72 percent of the patients also be screened for the mutations, which if present would change their recommended clinical management as well.   These results suggest that multi-gene testing can provide important additional information to guide recommendations for screening and prevention of future cancers,  Ellisen explains.  For example, results that point to a higher risk of breast cancer than would be predicted by history alone might call for breast MRI in addition to mammograms. The Lynch syndrome mutations signify a need for increased colorectal cancer screening and in some cases preventive hysterectomy or ovariectomy. But it s important to note that multigene genetic testing is not appropriate for everyone and is most useful where personal and family histories suggest hereditary cancer, which is not the case for most patients with breast or ovarian cancer.  A professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Ellisen adds that the next step will be to examine whether recommendations based on multigene testing lead to better prevention, early detection and improved patient survival, a project that will take many years.  These future studies will help us refine and modify gene-based management recommendations over time. We ve been testing for BRCA1/2 for more than 15 years, and outcome studies and guideline modifications are still ongoing. Genetic testing and its interpretation are getting more complex, so now more than ever, it makes sense for patients to seek out trained genetic counselors and practitioners to help them decide whether to be tested and how to interpret the test results.

Scientists have shown that the passage of molecules through the nucleus of a star-shaped brain cell, called an astrocyte, may play a critical role in health and disease. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Unexpectedly we may have discovered a hidden pathway to understanding how astrocytes respond to injury and control brain processes. The pathway may be common to many brain diseases and we re just starting to follow it,  said Katerina Akassoglou, Ph.D., a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, and a senior author of the study. Some neurological disorders are associated with higher than normal brain levels of the growth factor TGF-beta, including Alzheimer's disease and brain injury. Previous studies found that after brain injury, astrocytes produce greater amounts of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a protein that helps cells detect growth factors. The cells also react to TGF-beta by changing their shapes and secreting proteins that alter neuronal activity. Dr. Akassoglou s lab showed that eliminating the p75NTR gene prevented hydrocephalus in mice genetically engineered to have astrocytes that produce higher levels of TGF-beta. Hydrocephalus is a disorder that fills the brain with excess cerebral spinal fluid. Eliminating the p75NTR gene also prevented astrocytes in the brains of the mice from forming scars after injuries and restored gamma oscillations, which are patterns of neuronal activity associated with learning and memory. The cell nucleus is a ball of chromosomes wrapped in a protective fatty membrane. In this study, the researchers discovered that treating astrocytes with TGF-beta freed a small piece of the p75NTR protein to bind to nucleoporins, a group of proteins that regulates the passage of molecules in and out of the nucleus. Their results suggest that binding enhances the flow of certain critical molecules into the nucleus and enables astrocytes to enter a reactive state.  This research highlights the importance of the nuclear pore complex in the brain and raises the possibility that it may be a target for treating a wide range of neurological disorders,  said Jill Morris, Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The scientists used high-resolution microscopes to watch the astrocyte nucleus in action. Nuclear pores that did not have the p75NTR gene were slightly larger than normal. When the scientists treated astrocytes with TGF-beta, they saw p75NTR proteins bind to nucleoporins and open the pores. This allowed transport into the nucleus of a protein called Smad2, which is essential for TGF-beta to exert its effects on astrocytes. In other experiments, the scientists showed that eliminating p75NTR from astrocytes blocked the transport of Smad2 into the nucleus.  Nuclear pores are gatekeepers and p75NTR appears to be the key to unlocking particular gates,  said Dr. Akassoglou.  We discovered novel roles for both players and will continue to study how the nuclear pore complex controls neuronal development and disease. ","Published: August 18, 2015"

From there, the researchers simultaneously tested multiple therapies in the tumor models. Treatments that were effective in the models could then be given to patients.   By prescreening, we can determine which medication works, providing a much higher chance the patient will benefit,  said first author Chong-Xian Pan, a genitourinary oncologist.  This can reduce toxicity, increase efficiency and lower costs.  In theory, finding a tumor s mutations should outline a clear treatment plan, as targeted drugs are matched with genetic anomalies. However, although genomic tools can find mutations, they don t always identify which ones drive a patient s cancer. Look at how many mutations a cancer can have   from only a few in pediatric cancers to dozens or hundreds in adult cancers,  said Pan.  Lung cancer probably has hundreds of mutations and only a few of those are important. But at this point we can t always figure out which mutations are important and which are unimportant.  Without knowing which mutations are crucial to cancer growth, oncologists must opt for one therapy over another. If the choice is wrong, time and toxicity can make it difficult to backtrack and try a different treatment.  The patient gets a biopsy and we send the tissue off for genomic analysis, which will show us abnormalities that can be treated,  said Ralph de Vere White, distinguished professor of urology and director of the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Let s say there are four of them. Now we have to guess which one is driving the cancer, and the success rate is about 12 percent. That s putting the patient through a lot for just 12 percent.  Though Pan s study was small, the grafts showed remarkable genetic fidelity to the original patient tumors   between 92 and 97 percent   even after several months. This outcome proved vastly more effective than growing cell lines in a dish, which deviate from the mother tumor in just a few days. The new model also provided information that would be impossible to obtain in patients, the researchers said. Because tumors develop more rapidly in mice, they could quickly determine which therapies were effective. They could also conduct multiple biopsies to follow tumor evolution, identify escape mutations and test therapeutic countermoves. Most importantly, the grafts provided insights into which drugs could help patients.   In one case, the drug cisplatin didn t work and gemcitabine barely worked, but the combination really knocked the tumor out in the mouse,  said Pan.  And that s exactly what happened in the patient.  The researchers said that while grafting patient tumors for further study holds a great deal of promise, the ultimate goal is to use computers to help select effective treatments.  We re not saying the mouse model is the answer,  said de Vere White,  but we have a high failure rate with the standard of care, and we re trying to figure out if the mouse can helps us do better. In time, we d like to be able to biopsy the patient, sequence the tumor, feed that information into the computer and have the computer tell us which therapy will work. ","Published: August 18, 2015"

The company, called Helix, is based in the San Francisco Bay Area and received financing commitments in excess of $100 million. Jay Flatley, CEO of Illumina, will serve as Chairman of the Board. Helix will enable individuals to acquire an unprecedented amount of genetic information by providing affordable sequencing and database services for consumer samples brought through third party partners, driving the creation of an ecosystem of consumer applications. After being sequenced, individuals will be able to manage their data and explore an open marketplace of on-demand applications, provided by Helix's partners, to gain additional insights into the genomic data that has already been acquired. By converting genetic information to digital data stored in the cloud, Helix enables its partners to develop and deliver premium genomic products to consumers without the burden of developing their own assay, laboratory, or database infrastructure. ""Genomics is reaching an inflection point in cost, volumes, and knowledge, creating a significant opportunity to unlock information that is currently not widely accessible to individuals,"" said Flatley. ""Helix and its founding investors are committed to creating a neutral platform at the highest quality standard that will work with partners to accelerate consumer adoption of genomics."" Helix also announced two collaborations with major partners. First, the Center for Individualized Medicine at Mayo Clinic is collaborating with Helix to develop applications initially focused on consumer education and health-related queries. As part of the collaboration, Mayo Clinic also made a strategic investment in Helix. Second, Laboratory Corporation of America  Holdings (LabCorp ) will develop and offer innovative analysis and interpretation services, initially focused on medically actionable genetic conditions, to consumers through Helix's platform. Helix expects that other partners will develop applications focused on areas such as genealogy, fitness or wellness, and inherited traits to enable insights related to an individual's genetics. ""We are thrilled to partner with Illumina to transform how consumers interact with their own DNA,"" said Noah Knauf, Managing Director, Healthcare at Warburg Pincus. ""We believe that the digitization of the genome will unleash entrepreneurs and developers to create new applications for consumers in a way never before possible."" To support its partners, Helix will establish one of the world's largest next-generation sequencing labs and a secure and protected database, all designed in accordance with CLIA, CAP, and HIPAA guidelines. Individuals will be able to control how their data is accessed through a robust and granular consent process. The company will also ensure that information is communicated to consumers in a responsible and ethical way. More information will be available at www.helix.com. Illumina expects to consolidate the entity in the company's financial statements. The pro-rata impact of this deal was contemplated in the 2015 financial guidance provided by Illumina on July 21, 2015. In 2016, Helix is expected to be approximately $0.10 dilutive to Illumina's non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. The impact on 2016 GAAP earnings per share cannot be determined at this time due to the on-going analysis of accounting measurements.

The latest study, Effect of Vitamin D3 Treatment on Endothelial Function in Obese Adolescents, appears online.  After three months of having vitamin D boosted into the normal range with supplements, these teenagers showed no changes in body weight, body mass index, waistline, blood pressure or blood flow,  says Dr. Kumar.  We re not saying the links between vitamin D deficiency and chronic diseases don t exist for children we just haven t found any yet.  One in five American adolescents is obese, and more than a third are overweight. Several observational studies also have noted links between vitamin D deficiency and a host of weight-related medical complications, including cardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance. As a result, caregivers and providers often start high-dose supplementation in an attempt to slow or reverse some of the clinical complications associated with obesity.  I have been surprised that we haven't found more health benefit,"" says Dr. Kumar. ""We re not saying it s bad to take vitamin D supplements at reasonable doses, and we know most obese teens are vitamin D deficient. We re just saying the jury is still out on how useful it is for improving overall health in adolescents.  This is the first of Dr. Kumar s studies to report increased cholesterol and triglycerides during vitamin D supplementation, a finding she says might be attributed to the smaller number of children who participated in the study and the relatively short timeframe. She calls for larger, placebo-controlled studies to examine the long-term effects of vitamin D supplementation on teens and children. Parents and providers often put obese adolescent children on vitamin D regimens   sometimes at more than 5-to-10 times the recommended daily intake   because some studies have shown a link between vitamin D in the blood and improved vascular function, says Dr. Kumar. She opted to study vitamin D in overweight teens because this population is at increased risk for chronic disease, and because of the compound s increasing popularity as a homeopathic or complementary treatment for obesity. Dr. Kumar notes that it is possible to ingest too much vitamin D, a condition called vitamin D toxicity or hypervitaminosis, which can result in poor appetite, nausea, vomiting and kidney complications.","Published: August 18, 2015"

Computer scientists Risto Miikkulainen and Joel Lehman co-authored the study which describes how simulations of mass extinctions promote novel features and abilities in surviving lineages.  Focused destruction can lead to surprising outcomes,  said Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at UT Austin.  Sometimes you have to develop something that seems objectively worse in order to develop the tools you need to get better.  In biology, mass extinctions are known for being highly destructive, erasing a lot of genetic material from the tree of life. But some evolutionary biologists hypothesize that extinction events actually accelerate evolution by promoting those lineages that are the most evolvable, meaning ones that can quickly create useful new features and abilities.Miikkulainen and Lehman found that, at least with robots, this is the case. For years, computer scientists have used computer algorithms inspired by evolution to train simulated robot brains, called neural networks, to improve at a task from one generation to the next. The UT Austin team s innovation in the latest research was in examining how mass destruction could aid in computational evolution. In computer simulations, they connected neural networks to simulated robotic legs with the goal of evolving a robot that could walk smoothly and stably. As with real evolution, random mutations were introduced through the computational evolution process. The scientists created many different niches so that a wide range of novel features and abilities would come about. After hundreds of generations, a wide range of robotic behaviors had evolved to fill these niches, many of which were not directly useful for walking. Then the researchers randomly killed off the robots in 90 percent of the niches, mimicking a mass extinction. After several such cycles of evolution and extinction, they discovered that the lineages that survived were the most evolvable and, therefore, had the greatest potential to produce new behaviors. Not only that, but overall, better solutions to the task of walking were evolved in simulations with mass extinctions, compared with simulations without them. Practical applications of the research could include the development of robots that can better overcome obstacles (such as robots searching for survivors in earthquake rubble, exploring Mars or navigating a minefield) and human-like game agents.  This is a good example of how evolution produces great things in indirect, meandering ways,  explains Lehman, a former postdoctoral researcher in Miikkulainen's lab, now at the IT University of Copenhagen. He and a former student of Miikkulainen s at UT Austin, Kenneth Stanley, recently published a popular science book about evolutionary meandering,  The Myth of the Objective: Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned.   Even destruction can be leveraged for evolutionary creativity. ","Published: August 18, 2015"

This hypothesis proposes that an imbalance of certain brain chemicals is the key cause of depression. Research has investigated whether and to what degree the ""reward and pleasure"" chemical dopamine and, more recently, the ""happiness"" chemical serotonin, could be the neurotransmitters involved in the malady. However, the monoamine hypothesis does not seem to fully explain the complexity of human depression.  Proteinaceous infectious particles, also known as prions, are proteins in which the complex molecular three-dimensional folding process has simply gone astray. For reasons not yet understood, the misfolding nature of prions is associated to their ability to sequester their normal counterparts and induce them to misfold as well. The ever-growing crowd of misfolded proteins form the aggregates seen in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Patients with these disorders manifest progressive neurological deterioration and clinical depression, among other symptoms. Although the misfolded counterparts have historically received all the attention, the spotlight is now on the native protein, namely the prion protein, which is the one that has not undergone misfolding. What role do the native proteins play? An interesting hypothesis is that these particles serve as a hub where some cellular components assemble. For instance, it has already been shown that the prion protein participates in events such as cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Now a team led by Dr. Rafael Linden from the Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, proposes that the prion protein plays a role in depression. In an article entitled ""Prion protein modulates monoaminergic systems and depressive-like behavior in mice"" the group shows that mice lacking normal prions show a depressive-like behavior similar to depression symptoms found in patients with Alzheimer's and prion diseases, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), Gerstmann-Str ussler-Scheinker syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia and kuru. Human prion diseases frequently show clinical symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and hallucinations, and the monoamine hypothesis has been called to explain such deficits. The research conducted by the group shows that mice with no prion protein have increased levels of the receptors that bind to serotonin. Additionally, the levels of the enzyme that makes dopamine, and dopamine itself, are also higher in mice deprived of the prion protein. Interestingly, the study shows that although these animals have high levels of dopamine, they do not show the normal response that should occur when dopamine binds to its receptor, despite the fact that the levels of the receptor for dopamine are normal in these animals. According to Danielle Beckman, the first author of the paper ""it is possible that the lack of interaction between dopamine and its receptor results from a desensitization of the receptor precisely because there is too much dopamine"". Another important observation made by the group, and which supports the hypothesis that prions have a role in depression, is the fact that the prion protein is found in the same places in the cell as the dopamine and serotonin receptors. Additionally, the authors observed that the prion protein might bind to the dopamine receptor. The group believes that in normal individuals, the prion protein works as a scaffold for multiple molecular interactions. When prion protein molecules are sequestered by their misfolded counterparts, they can no longer work as a scaffold for all these molecular interactions, which impairs the mechanisms evoked by the brain chemicals important for mood. These findings open the door for future research considering the prion protein as a potential target in the development of treatments for major depression and related disorders.","Published: August 18, 2015"

The Phase 2b study will examine BL-8040 as part of a second stage treatment, termed consolidation therapy, to improve outcomes for AML patients who have achieved remission after the standard initial treatment regimen, known as induction therapy. The consolidation therapy is aimed at eliminating the minimal residual disease left in the bone marrow after induction therapy that can lead to relapse. This study is the first of three clinical studies in additional indications for BL-8040 which BioLineRx plans to commence during 2015, thus significantly expanding its unique BL-8040 oncology platform. Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx, stated,  The majority of high-risk AML patients achieving first complete remission relapse within one year, despite the current standard consolidation therapy. Patients with AML relapse have a poor prognosis despite further therapy, and less than 10% of these patients are cured by conventional therapy. Leukemic stem cells that are dormant in the bone marrow are presumed to be a major reason for AML relapse. Based on the pre-clinical and clinical data accumulated to date, BL-8040 is anticipated to boost the efficacy of consolidation therapy due to its dual mechanism of action. Firstly, BL-8040 induces mobilization of leukemic cells from the bone marrow, which enhances the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, and secondly, it possesses anti-leukemic pro-apoptotic properties that help eliminate AML cells directly. Based on positive results from our ongoing phase 2 clinical trial for BL-8040, which show substantial mobilization of AML cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood, as well as robust induction of AML cell apoptosis, we believe BL-8040 will be a promising addition to consolidation therapy for AML patients.  Dr. Savitsky added,  In addition to initiation of the Phase 2b AML consolidation study, we are eagerly looking forward to the top-line results from our ongoing Phase 2 study of BL-8040 for treating relapsed and refractory AML patients, which we expect in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also look forward to the next stages of development for BL-8040 as a novel stem cell mobilization treatment, after its recent successful completion of a Phase 1 trial. Finally, we are also excited about the anticipated initiation of clinical studies for BL-8040 in two additional indications over the next few months, thus further expanding and enhancing the potential of our oncology platform.  The Phase 2b trial, which is conducted in collaboration with the University of Halle as sponsor and with the participation of two large leukemia study groups in Germany, is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study aimed at assessing the efficacy of BL-8040 in addition to standard consolidation therapy in AML patients. The primary endpoint of the study is to compare the relapse free survival (RFS) time in AML subjects in their first remission during a minimum follow-up time of 18 months after randomization. In addition, pharmacodynamic measurements will be conducted in order to assess the minimal residual disease, and biomarker analyses will be performed to identify predictors of BL-8040 response. The study will enroll up to 194 patients at up to 25 sites in Germany. AML patients between 18 and 75 years of age with documented first remission will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive high dose Cytarabine, either with BL-8040 or with a matching placebo, as consolidation therapy.","Published: August 18, 2015"

In this Q&A, McGirr talks about his results. How did you create intelligent mice? We identified a mutation in the gene that codes for an important protein in the brain, Phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B). Though our study is in mice, this protein is very important in the human brain as well. Mice with the mutation performed remarkably well on many memory and problem-solving tasks. For instance, they were able to remember where they had already been in a maze, find a platform hidden under water, and they had better social memory, meaning they remembered meeting other mice. What was really interesting is that even when we made some tasks that are impossible for normal mice, the  brainy mice  continued to perform well. What can intelligent mice teach us about dementia? Understanding the function of PDE4B teaches us about how the brain encodes experience into memory. Cognitive impairment is a major clinical challenge and our work suggests a new target for medicines that may eventually help patients and their families.  Brainy mice  learned better and their brains changed in ways that are relevant to treating dementia. We found that these mice had more new neurons being born, and that neurons in memory centres made more connections with other neurons, suggesting that the network was more interconnected and perhaps more robust. Though a long way from being directly relevant to human dementia, this is a promising new target for developing medicines to help cognitive impairment. What surprises did you come across? Our PDE4B mice showed many signs of being better learners than normal mice, but when we tested them for fear memory after 24 hours, as is typical, they performed no better than normal mice. Yet, despite this intact ability to learn fearful associations, something peculiar happened when we tested them after a week: they didn t seem to remember the fearful event. We did a number of different tests and ultimately found that the brainy mice were also less anxious. Our research suggests that medicines affecting PDE4B might be useful after traumatic events. In humans, traumatic events can result in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and result in severe impairment. Our findings point to a potentially novel way of thinking about preventing the development of PTSD. It is worth noting another surprising finding, however. Our PDE4B mice didn t seem to be afraid of cat urine, which normal mice are understandably avoidant of. It suggests that caution is needed in developing medicines to target PDE4B for humans.","Published: August 18, 2015"

The pathway may be common to many brain diseases and we re just starting to follow it,  said Katerina Akassoglou, Ph.D., a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, and a senior author of the study. Some neurological disorders are associated with higher than normal brain levels of the growth factor TGF-beta, including Alzheimer's disease and brain injury. Previous studies found that after brain injury, astrocytes produce greater amounts of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a protein that helps cells detect growth factors. The cells also react to TGF-beta by changing their shapes and secreting proteins that alter neuronal activity.Dr. Akassoglou s lab showed that eliminating the p75NTR gene prevented hydrocephalus in mice genetically engineered to have astrocytes that produce higher levels of TGF-beta. Hydrocephalus is a disorder that fills the brain with excess cerebral spinal fluid. Eliminating the p75NTR gene also prevented astrocytes in the brains of the mice from forming scars after injuries and restored gamma oscillations, which are patterns of neuronal activity associated with learning and memory. The cell nucleus is a ball of chromosomes wrapped in a protective fatty membrane. In this study, the researchers discovered that treating astrocytes with TGF-beta freed a small piece of the p75NTR protein to bind to nucleoporins, a group of proteins that regulates the passage of molecules in and out of the nucleus. Their results suggest that binding enhances the flow of certain critical molecules into the nucleus and enables astrocytes to enter a reactive state.  This research highlights the importance of the nuclear pore complex in the brain and raises the possibility that it may be a target for treating a wide range of neurological disorders,  said Jill Morris, Ph.D., program director at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The scientists used high-resolution microscopes to watch the astrocyte nucleus in action. Nuclear pores that did not have the p75NTR gene were slightly larger than normal. When the scientists treated astrocytes with TGF-beta, they saw p75NTR proteins bind to nucleoporins and open the pores. This allowed transport into the nucleus of a protein called Smad2, which is essential for TGF-beta to exert its effects on astrocytes. In other experiments, the scientists showed that eliminating p75NTR from astrocytes blocked the transport of Smad2 into the nucleus.  Nuclear pores are gatekeepers and p75NTR appears to be the key to unlocking particular gates,  said Dr. Akassoglou.  We discovered novel roles for both players and will continue to study how the nuclear pore complex controls neuronal development and disease. ","Published: August 18, 2015"

It is estimated that one in two people have got it, though most won t ever experience any problems. Even so, it is considered one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide and a leading cause of dyspepsia, peptic ulceration and gastric cancer.  Through unique evolutionary adaptations, H. pylori is able to evade the antiseptic effect of our stomach acid by hiding within the thick acid-resistant layer of mucus that coats the stomach wall. Once within the mucus layer, the bacterium latches onto sugars naturally found on the stomach wall using its adhesion proteins. This attachment is so effective that the bacterium can resist attempts by the body to  flush  it away, allowing the pathogen to colonise with impunity. But the game could be up for H. pylori. Researchers in the School of Pharmacy, at The University of Nottingham and AstraZeneca R&D have identified the molecular mechanism that the bacterium s best-known adhesion protein uses to attach to stomach sugars. Powerful x-rays reveal special  groove  Naim Hage, the postgraduate researcher who worked on this project as part of his doctoral thesis, said:  Although it s still very early, the insight we ve gained from this study is already very exciting news for patients.  Using extremely powerful x-rays, the scientists were able to study the interactions between the H. pylori adhesion protein BabA and Lewisb sugars of the gastric mucosa at the atomic level. They found that, right at its tip, BabA possesses a specific groove that enables it to securely attach to Lewisb using a network of hydrogen bonds (the same kind of interactions that keep water molecules together).  First exciting step The research team also found that this network is finely tuned   if a few of the hydrogen bonds are disrupted, the network doesn t function and binding can no longer occur. This insight into the molecular interactions required for adhesion is a promising lead for the development of new strategies for the treatment of H. pylori infections. This study now forms the foundation for future research between The University of Nottingham and AstraZeneca R&D into  anti-adhesion strategies  that would work by clearing H. pylori out of the stomach through dislodging the bacterium off the stomach wall using BabA:Lewisb inhibitors. Such novel strategies are needed to help treat H. pylori infections, which are globally gaining resistance to conventional antibiotic therapies.  Naim said:  Because BabA is unique to H. pylori, we can specifically target, and hopefully eradicate, this bacterium without affecting the other good bacteria in our normal flora. If successful, this therapeutic strategy will also be extremely useful for treating H. pylori infections that are already resistant to antibiotics.  More research to be done The principal investigator behind the project, Dr Franco Falcone, said:  While this study answers long-standing questions about how H. pylori colonises the stomach, it represents the very first step in the development of novel therapies. The next few years of laboratory-based research will be crucial to determine if an anti-BabA adhesion approach is viable and can progress to clinical development. A similar approach is already showing promising results for the treatment of urinary tract infections in preclinical models. Looking forward, we are excited to continue working closely with AstraZeneca R&D who have provided a tremendous amount of support to achieve this discovery.  Naim Hage was awarded The Andrew Hendry Postgraduate Scholarship in May this year for his outstanding research progress and contribution to the postgraduate community. His research was supervised by Dr Franco Falcone,Dr Snow Stolnik and Dr Sebastiaan Winkler, all from the School of Pharmacy, and is sponsored by the EPSRC/AstraZeneca Centre for Doctoral Training in Targeted Therapeutics.","Published: August 18, 2015"

Under the terms of the agreement, AVEO will receive an upfront payment of $15 million and will be eligible to receive reimbursement, clinical, sales and regulatory-based milestone payments totaling$311 million assuming successful advancement of the Product. AVEO will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on product sales ranging from high single digits to a low double-digit. Novartis will be responsible for all clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization activities and costs associated with the Product.  AV-380 holds great promise as a potential treatment for cachexia secondary to multiple disease states, including cancer, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  said Michael Bailey, AVEO s president and chief executive officer.  Novartis brings resources and expertise to bear on advancing this program, which we believe provides the optimal path forward toward realizing its full potential.  About Cachexia and GDF15 Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with malnutrition and severe involuntary weight loss due to the loss of muscle and fat tissue, as well as the clinical manifestation of anemia, inflammation and suppression of immune functions. Cachexia is a serious and common complication in patients with advanced cancer and other chronic diseases. It affects some five million individuals in the United States . GDF15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose elevated circulating levels have been correlated with cachexia in cachectic cancer patients and several animal models of cancer cachexia. Current evidence suggests that a pro-inflammatory state may be responsible for many of the symptoms associated with cachexia. Preclinical data show that inhibition of GDF15 results in a switch from catabolism to anabolism, suggesting that GDF15 inhibition with AV-380 may reverse the effects of cachexia.","Published: August 18, 2015"

Scientists at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) now reveal a new function for E-Cad, one that contrasts with its accepted role in impeding cell movement. The researchers have published an article in which they report that this protein is crucial for the coordinated movement of diverse cell types. This new function of E-Cad may explain why tumours that express intermediary levels of this protein have a poorer prognosis.Coordinated cell movement E-Cad facilitates the movement of heterogeneous groups of cells understanding as heterogeneity cells that exert a range of activities because they have different genes activated: some may divide many times, others trigger certain hormones, while others interact with the membrane, etc... Thanks to E-Cad, this group of diverse cells moves in a coordinated manner to its destination. Once there, the cells distribute where they are needed; their moderate levels of E-Cad keep them bound but not immobile during this migration. IRB Barcelona researchers Kyra Campbell and Jordi Casanova have addressed this phenomenon in the development of the embryonic digestive system of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, a model that allows them to study cell migration in a growing organism. ""Cell migration is a common and necessary process for an embryo and also for the correct function of the adult organism. What has been most surprising is the observation that E-Cad is a key component in cell movement, when its role was previously assumed to be that of keeping cells static,"" explains Jordi Casanova, head of the Development and Morphogenesis in Drosophila Lab  at IRB Barcelona and CSIC research professor. Cell migration is also of great biomedical relevance, and research into this phenomenon sheds light on how, for example, cancer metastasis and other processes such as wound healing and inflammation arise. Cell migration and metastasis According to Casanova, intermediary levels of E-Cad are often associated with aggressive tumours, precisely those which are capable of metastasising. He also reveals that, ""the more we learn about metastases, the more evidence emerges that they are formed by groups of cells and not by individual ones"". E-Cad would facilitate highly diverse heterogeneous groups of cells to migrate together from the original tumour. ""A cell that migrates alone is much easier to eliminate that a group of cells with different functions,"" explains the researcher. ""Our results in Drosophila are clinically relevant because they offer an explanation of the role that may be played by E-Cad in tumours with metastasis,"" says Casanova. The study has involved the participation of researchers from Advanced Digital Microscopy Core Facility at IRB Barcelona, headed by Julien Colombelli. S bastien Tosi, Senior Research Officer with this facility, set up the programmes to monitor cells in vivo during their migration.","Published: August 18, 2015"

Andersen, a lead author of the new study. At least 5,000 people die each year from Lassa fever. The virus is spread through contact with urine and droppings from infected Mastomys natalensis rodents (which are a natural  reservoir  of the virus) and the disease can spread from human to human. In the new study the team whose senior members included Pardis Sabeti and Joshua Levin of Harvard University and the Broad Institute, Robert F. Garry of Tulane University and Christian Happi of Nigeria s Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital and Sierra Leone s Kenema Government Hospital used a technique called next-generation sequencing to analyze genomes of Lassa virus samples taken from wild Mastomys natalensis and human patients in Nigeria and Sierra Leone.The genomic data showed that far-flung strains of Lassa virus share a common ancestor that can be traced back more than 1,000 years to an area today known as Nigeria. This surprised the researchers, as Lassa fever was first described in Nigeria in 1969.  The virus has very ancient roots,  said Andersen. The researchers found that the virus spread out of Nigeria about 400 years ago and over the past couple of hundred years moved into Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone the same part of the world where the largest outbreak of Ebola virus has been raging since 2013. As Lassa virus spread, the virus mutated and seemed to better adapt to mammalian hosts. The new data also show that most Lassa fever cases are caused by frequent  spillover  infections from the wild rodent reservoir to humans, rather than spreading from human to human.  The reason Lassa hasn t yet grown into this huge epidemic is because there is limited transmission between humans,  said Andersen.  That s a major difference between Lassa virus and Ebola virus.  Andersen noted that local scientists in West Africa were key for this new study and will be crucial for future studies in the region. He views the next step in this research as understanding how the virus mutates within individual hosts as it confronts the immune system.","Published: August 18, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/the-autismgi-link-211477,The Autism GI Link Inflammatory bowel disease found more prevalent in ASD patients  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Reports from parents and a growing number of studies over the past 10 to 15 years suggest that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially more severe ASD, are prone to gastrointestinal disorders. Researchers have attributed the association to altered GI microbiota, abnormal intestinal physiology, immune alterations and other mechanisms. Some speculate that the connection results from unusual eating patterns in children with ASD. A 2012 study led by bioinformatician Isaac Kohane, inaugural chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and the Lawrence J. Henderson Professor of Pediatrics at Boston Children s Hospital, grouped patients with autism according to the gene expression patterns in their blood. One group had altered immunologic and inflammatory pathways. A more recent study from a different research team went a step further, finding similar gene expression profiles in the intestines of children with ASD and those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Looking at IBD, which includes Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis, set the bar a little higher, since it is uncommon in children and also unlikely to be caused by dietary factors (though it can certainly be aggravated by them). In a new study, Kohane and colleagues crunched three large databases to create what they believe is the largest ASD/IBD study to date. Specifically, they tapped:   Nationwide claims from an Aetna database. Subjects included 52,270 patients with ASD and more than 7 million controls.   Two children s hospitals: Boston Children s, with 7,201 ASD patients and nearly 600,000 controls, and Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, with 1,555 ASD patients and more than 200,000 controls.   The Simons Simplex Consortium, an ASD registry from 12 North American medical centers, with 2,728 ASD patients. All patients were born after 1970 and saw a health care provider on at least three occasions. Mean ages in this study ranged from 9 to 13  years, depending on the sample. A deeper dive into the Boston Children s data showed that children with both IBD and ASD had a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and asthma than those with ASD alone. There are a few things to keep in mind. Because IBD is uncommon in children, actual patient numbers were small: There were just seven expert-verified cases among 2,728 ASD patients in the Simons Simplex population and 16 of 7,201 Boston Children s ASD patients, a prevalence of 0.2-0.3 percent. The analyses relied mainly on ICD-9 diagnostic codes, rather than on detailed chart review. And the databases had limitations; for example, Aetna data were available for only 2009 to 2013, and Boston Children s is known for both ASD and IBD treatment, which may have skewed the numbers higher. Finally, the study says nothing about the reasons for the association between IBD and ASD. As the researchers state,  molecular and microbiome characterizations will be needed to determine whether IBD and ASD do indeed share common etiologies.  At a minimum, the study is expected to encourage more research exploring the gut-brain connection and different subtypes of autism.  For years, many parents have told us that their children with ASD have severe abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms,  said Kohane.  From these population studies, larger than any to date, we find solid and reproducible evidence that the parents were right as usual,  he said.  Based on the data I ve seen, I suspect we will soon be able to define several distinct subtypes of ASD-associated bowel diseases. ","Published: August 18, 2015"

There are a sizeable number of people whose visit to a dentist represents their sole interaction with the healthcare system, highlighting the significance of the dental visit as a key opportunity to identify substance use disorders,  said Carrigan Parish, DMD, associate research scientist in the Department of Sociomedical Sciences.  However, our findings underscore a significant barrier in dentists  attitudes that may limit the potential of the dental venue to play a role in screening for substance misuse.  The researchers led by Lisa Metsch, PhD, principal investigator and Stephen Smith Professor and chair of the Department of Sociomedical Sciences, sampled 1,802 U.S. dentists in general practice from a nationally representative survey by the American Dental Association Survey Center conducted from 2010 to 2011. The survey achieved a very high response rate of 71 percent, increasing the ability of the survey results to capture a complete picture of the U.S. dental workforce. According to Metsch,  There is an increasing recognition about the need to better integrate oral and systemic health,  and  questions remain about the feasibility of offering preventive screening and testing alongside dental care many of which are being answered in this study.  Those dentists who embraced substance misuse screening as part of their professional role were more likely to query about misuse with their patients (86 percent) compared with those who did not accept such screenings as their responsibility (68 percent). In general, both agreement with the purpose of and use of health history forms with substance misuse questions increased with the amount of prior training and knowledge regarding substance use. Older dentists were less likely to report that their health history form included questions about substance misuse than those who were younger. Dentists under the median age of 53 were also more apt to say that illicit drug use screening should be part of the dentist s role than their more senior counterparts (62 percent versus 47 percent). As with age, agreement with screening as part of dentists  role and health history form screening increases markedly with how recently the dentist graduated. Gender was also associated with dentists  attitudes toward screenings. More female dentists (61 percent) than their male counterparts (52 percent) agreed that illicit drug use screening should be the role of the dentist. Drug use can have a negative impact on dental health as well as overall health. Patterns of oral health pathology attributed to methamphetamine users, for example, include rampant tooth decay, accelerated tooth wear, unexplained advanced gum disease, missing multiple teeth, and overall detrimental dental effects that are rapid and severe. These patients also often seek cosmetic dental treatment, such as veneers and whitening, which give dentists another opportunity to discuss suspected substance misuse, provide referrals for treatment, and encourage cessation of drug misuse. Furthermore, dentists are the second-largest group of prescribers of opioid pain medication.  Because dental care routinely involves treating pain and emergencies, dentists may encounter substance-seeking patients who complain of pain more severe than anticipated based on the nature of their dental condition, who report lost prescriptions for opioid pain medications, or who only seek dental treatment sporadically,  noted Parish.  In order for substance misuse screening to be compatible with the dental setting, two-way communication between patient and dentist needs to occur more openly,  observed Parish.  While surveys have shown that patients are amenable to receiving medical screenings by dentists  chair-side  for such conditions as HIV, heart disease, and diabetes, further studies directly addressing patient attitudes on substance misuse screening are key in determining patients  acceptance of such services.  Dentists may also need additional education to increase their awareness, comfort, and knowledge of substance misuse, given that  dentists are well situated to make appropriate referrals to treatment centers if instilled with the proper training and supports.

Isobutanol is attractive because its energy density and octane values are much closer to gasoline and it is useful not only as a direct replacement for gasoline but also as a chemical feedstock for a variety of products. For example, isobutanol can be chemically upgraded into a hydrocarbon equivalent for jet fuel. While the earlier work by BESC researchers at DOE s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of California at Los Angeles was important from a proof-of-principle perspective, this new result represents a significant gain. When we reported our initial finding four years ago, we were using Clostridium celluloyticium, which is a less complex organism from a metabolic engineering perspective,  said co-author James Liao of UCLA s Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science.  With this paper, we have successfully engineered similar traits in the much higher yielding Clostridium thermocellum, and that has taken us to new levels of consolidated bioprocessing efficiency.  Consolidated bioprocessing refers to the bundling of several processes in a single microbe that can be used to extract sugar from a plant s cellulose and convert those sugars into a biofuel. This approach can be used to combine several steps   pretreatment, enzyme treatment and fermentation   to produce biofuel at a lower cost. The process also helps overcome the challenges of recalcitrance, or a plant s natural defenses to being chemically dismantled. Recalcitrance is one of the primary economic barriers to using lignocellulosic biomass such as corn stover and switchgrass as a feedstock for biofuels. While the previous genetically engineered microbe achieved conversion results of 0.6 gram of isobutanol per liter, Clostridium thermocellum has produced 5 to 6 grams per liter. Researchers accomplished this by inserting five genes into the microbe, enabling it to synthesize isobutanol. Scientists view this as a clear next-generation advance over strategies that use yeast to create biofuels from cellulose.  In addition to this development, which moves the BESC team closer to the production goal of more than 20 grams per liter, the prospects of commercial realization of this approach are greatly enabled by the fact that the microbe works at temperatures high enough to keep competing bugs from contaminating the microbial fermentation tanks and interfering with the conversion process,  said Paul Gilna, director of BESC.

These spatial locations play important roles in gene expression, DNA repair, genome stability, and other cellular activities. The study, by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, appeared August 13, 2015, in Cell. One of the fundamental properties of the genomes of higher organisms is the non-random arrangement of DNA in the cell nucleus. Researchers have long known that most genes occupy preferred 3D positions in the nucleus and that the location of genes matters for their function, but it has been difficult to determine the molecular players and mechanisms that determine the positions. Although genes can be visualized routinely and their positions determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, this mapping method has traditionally been limited to the analysis of a few samples at a time and cannot be used for large-scale genome mapping. NCI researchers, in close collaboration with NCI s High-Throughput Imaging Facility, which was established earlier this decade, have developed a method called HIPMap (High-throughput Imaging Position Mapping) that makes the large-scale determination of 3D gene positions possible. This method uses an optimized FISH detection protocol, fully automated microscopy, and combines it with sophisticated computational image analysis that delivers high-precision gene mapping information for thousands of samples in a single experiment. In the study, NCI researchers, led by Tom Misteli, Ph.D., associate director, NCI Center for Cancer Research, used HIPMap and a method known as RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown to screen nearly 700 proteins in the nucleus to identify those that are involved in the 3D positioning of several human genes. RNAi knockdown uses RNA molecules to block the production of specific proteins in cells. By collecting data continuously from automated microscopes for 27 days and then analyzing more than three million data points, the scientists were able to identify 50 cellular factors that determine the location of genes in the cell nucleus. This list provides the basis for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of genome organization.  The importance of HIPMap is that it is a starting point for numerous applications, including cancer biology,  said Misteli.  In addition to addressing basic questions about the mechanisms of how genomes are organized in intact cells, the ability to map gene positions in a large number of samples and cells has already been used to detect very rare chromosome translocation events in cancer and to ask what cellular factors determine where chromosomes break.  During translocations, chromosomes break and reattach, which can cause the fusion of otherwise unconnected genes, resulting in hybrid genes whose protein products may contribute to the development of cancer. As an example of the implications of HIPMap, Misteli pointed to a study from his lab published last month (Burman et al., Genes and Development. July 1, 2015). In that study researchers used a method derived from HIPMap to probe mechanisms that contribute to the susceptibility of chromosomes to break and form a cancer-causing translocation between the NPM1 gene and the ALK gene in a cancer known as anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Another possible application of HIPMap is in cancer diagnostics. The researchers have previously shown that some genes assume distinct positions in cancer. As a result, the 3D positions of genes could be used as diagnostic markers in diseases such as breast cancer and prostate cancer.  HIPMap will be a powerful tool in many ongoing efforts to map the genome in 3D space and to translate the findings from these studies to cancer biology,  Misteli concluded.","Published: August 18, 2015"

This estimate, from a National Institutes of Health research network, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is based on a study of more than 600 children and youth exposed to HIV in the womb.  Having a high level of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella is important not only for an individual s health, but also for preventing disease outbreaks in the larger community,  said the study s first author, George K. Siberry, M.D., Medical Officer in the Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease Branch of NIH s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).  Individuals infected with HIV at birth who did not have the benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy before they were vaccinated should speak with their physician about whether they need a repeated course of the vaccine.  The study was published online in Clinical Infectious Diseases. From 2007-2009, the researchers enrolled children ages 7 to 15 from 15 sites across the United States and Puerto Rico. Participants were part of the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS), an NIH-funded follow-up study of individuals exposed to HIV in the womb. The researchers checked serum specimens from the study volunteers for antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella. Antibodies are immune system proteins that help protect people against infections. The researchers tested samples from 428 children who became infected with HIV around the time of birth. The researchers referred to these individuals as the PHIV (perinatally HIV-infected) group. The study investigators also tested serum from 221 children whose mothers had HIV, but who did not become infected the HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) group. Many of the PHIV children were born before 1996, when the modern anti-HIV regimen, combined antiretroviral therapy, came into widespread use. Roughly 93 percent of both groups had received at least the recommended two doses of MMR, the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. According to the recommended schedule, the first MMR dose is given at 12-15 months, and the second at age 4-6 years. On average, the PHIV children were much less likely to have protective levels of antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella than did the HEU group. PHIV children who started combined antiretroviral therapy before receiving their MMR vaccine doses were more likely to have protective levels of antibodies against all three diseases, especially if they had higher levels of CD4+ cells at the time they were vaccinated. CD4+ cells are infection-fighting white blood cells, and tests of CD4+ levels are an important indicator of how well the immune system is functioning. The authors wrote that because the older children in the study are representative of the PHIV population in the U.S., it is possible that many other PHIV youth may also lack adequate immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. The study authors recommended that individuals who received their MMR vaccinations before the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy should ask their physicians if they need an additional two doses of the vaccine. The study results also indicate that PHIV children who began combined antiretroviral therapy before receiving their MMR vaccine doses likely have adequate levels of immunity.","Published: August 18, 2015"

The Chinese Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) has granted a patent relating to the tosylate salt of the compound. As this salt has been used in the clinical trials with 4SC-202, this patent provides a further building block in 4SC's global protection strategy for the drug candidate. The patents for 4SC-202 tosylate salt will provide additional protection against potential competitors and thus complements the composition of matter patents for 4SC-202, which so far have been granted in 61 countries, including patents in the major markets USA, Europe, China, Japan, Russia, and India. Enno Spillner, Chief Executive Officer of 4SC AG, said: ""Strengthening patent protection for our innovative anti-cancer compound 4SC-202 in the attractive upcoming growth market China underscores the development strategy for 4SC-202. We thus further strengthen our position as a leading biotech company in epigenetic cancer therapies."" Enno Spillner continued: ""Alongside our lead oncology compound resminostat, 4SC-202 is the second promising epigenetic anti-cancer agent in our clinical pipeline. We see strong standalone potential for 4SC-202 due to its unique mechanism of action. We are currently in talks with potential partners evaluating Phase II development options for 4SC-202. We look in particular at tumour indications, whose development and progression depend heavily on the therapeutically interesting Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways, which are epigenetically modulated by 4SC-202."" China, according to market intelligence experts, is the world's second-largest market for pharmaceuticals behind the USA. Analysts from IMS Health have forecast strong annual growth of between 10% and 13% for the sector in China for the upcoming years, expecting a total volume of USD 155-185 in 2018. The oncology market in Asia will see particularly strong growth and therefore become increasingly important for the development and marketing of innovative cancer drugs such as 4SC-202. Nearly half of all new cancer cases worldwide occur in Asia already.","Published: August 18, 2015"

Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the Orphan Drug Act, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. This favourable decision is based on in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence showing the synergy between inecalcitol and azacytidine or decitabine, two hypo-methylating anticancer drugs, to inhibit the growth of human AML cell lines in vitro and, in vivo, to prolong the survival of mice in two different experimental models of AML (cf. Hybrigenics  press releases of March 05 and June 20, 2014). The molecular basis of their synergy with inecalcitol, a vitamin D receptor agonist, has been elucidated: azacytidine or decitabine  unmask  the gene coding for vitamin D receptors (by reducing the methylation of its promoter region). As a consequence, more vitamin D receptors are expressed and available to be activated by inecalcitol, resulting in an improved efficacy to limit leukemia progression over the hypo-methylating agents alone. Azacytidine (Vidaza , Celgene) and decitabine (Dacogen , Janssen-Cilag) are two hypo-methylating agents already used for AML in older (>65 years old) or frail patients not eligible to standard induction chemotherapy. Inecalcitol alone has already been studied in a Phase II clinical trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an inhibitory effect has been shown in half of the treated patients. Another Phase II clinical study has recently been launched in combination with imatinib (Gleevec , Novartis) in chronic myeloid leukemia: enrolment is ongoing.  We are actively preparing an additional clinical Phase II study of inecalcitol in combination with either azacytidine or decitabine in older or frail Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients, in France as well as in the United States,  said Jean-Fran ois Dufour-Lamartinie, Hybrigenics  Head of Clinical R&D.  This Orphan Drug designation by the FDA will make the costs of clinical development of inecalcitol in the United States eligible to the so-called Orphan Drug tax credit. This incentive will substantially support our strategy to undertake a significant part of this Phase II clinical study in the United States, where the frequency of Acute Myeloid Leukemia seems to increase. This leukemia remains the blood cancer with the lowest 5-year survival rate: 25 per cent at best,  added Remi Delansorne, Hybrigenics  CEO.","Published: August 18, 2015"

As the second-largest global exporter, Rice is the most important agricultural commodity of Vietnam. A dramatic increase in rice production has taken place since the 1980s, due to the expansion of arable land and a shift in the crop s varieties from producing a single annual yield to two-three yields per year. With an impressive 3.3 per cent annual yield increase from 1987, Vietnamese rice production has benefited from the uptake of new rice varieties and improvements in genetics applied to advance crop breeding. However, there is an increasing threat to this vital crop from factors associated with climate change such as emerging pathogens and rising sea levels, where Vietnam's major rice growing areas are predominantly coastal, as well as the environmental pressures of rapid urban development. Developing the bioinformatics capacity in Vietnam will allow research Institutes to benefit from advancements in next generation genomics, applying their computational skills to rice breeding to help maintain productivity in the face of changing climates, and potentially develop new higher value rice varieties for the global market. In collaboration with the Agriculture Genetics Institute (AGI) in Hanoi (Vietnam), TGAC is working to characterize the genetic diversity of traditional rice varieties from Vietnam, aiming to develop genomic markers associated with traits of interest such as disease resistance and salt tolerance. With the initial research phase of this project exploring the genetic diversity of 36 local varieties, this project will provide funding for a further 48 varieties to be analyzed. With the aim to increase this number to 600 in the future. The generation of such large genomic datasets requires expertise in bioinformatics in order to analyze the data and develop molecular tools to aid precision breeding for improving rice. The international collaboration between TGAC and AGI will extend out to a wider group of researchers in Vietnam through training workshops to build bioinformatics capacity, using rice as a model. The programme involves the exchange of scientists from Vietnam to gain expertise in bioinformatics analysis, and from UK to learn about the field phenotyping activities in Vietnam. Scientists from TGAC, AGI and other participating Institutes will host  Train the Trainer' workshops in Norwich to train Vietnamese researchers in bioinformatics and genomic analysis to equip them with the skills to sustain training for researchers in Vietnam for the future. In order to make the data accessible, TGAC will set up a public database to host the variant data within the context of the latest genome assemblies and annotation. Project lead, Sarah Ayling, Crop Genomics and Diversity Group Leader at TGAC, said:  The Institutional Links funding provides an opportunity for us to train Vietnamese scientists in bioinformatics, and equip them with the skills to train others to help advance their understanding of next generation genomics.  These  Train the Trainer  activities will enable the flow of knowledge to other researchers in the region, providing more scientists with the skill-set required to make use of genomic data for rice breeding and improve the crop yield for current and future generations in Vietnam.  Our partnership will enable TGAC and the UK to provide guidance on best practices and, in collaboration with our Vietnamese colleagues, lead the development of innovative ways to share data and enhance the training and up-skilling of scientists in the areas of bioinformatics and genomics, globally.  Dr Le Huy Ham, Director General of AGI, added:  The project for the training of our scientists in bioinformatics is of extreme value; at our institute and in Vietnam in general, we have good rice breeders, including molecular breeders, but we do not have bioinformatics experts, who can use data from genomic sequencing for breeding purposes.  This project will help us with this, where due to our collaboration with TGAC, our scientists  dream about the application of genomic tools for rice breeding becomes a reality, following the first phase of our collaboration when we sequenced the first 36 genomes of local rice.   Following the Newton Fund agreement being signed between the MOST in Vietnam and the UK Embassy in Hanoi, I hope that this will bring new opportunities for further collaboration and genomic tools will become widely used for rice breeding in Vietnam.  The British Council s Newton Institutional Links fund addresses areas of research and innovation to support the economic development and social welfare of low and middle-income countries with poor and vulnerable populations.","Published: August 18, 2015"

Yet at the time of impact, these injuries are often invisible. To detect head trauma immediately, a team of researchers has developed a polymer-based material that changes colors depending on how hard it is hit. The goal is to someday incorporate this material into protective headgear, providing an obvious indication of injury. The team is describing their approach in one of more than 9,000 presentations at the 250th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world s largest scientific society, taking place in Boston, MA, USA until August 20. Recent research and media accounts have indicated that soldiers and professional athletes may suffer long-term complications   such as memory loss, headaches and dementia   stemming from past head trauma. In April 2015, a lawsuit filed by a group of National Football League players was settled, requiring the organization to pay retired players with head injuries. And several professional hockey players are now suing the National Hockey League over the same issue. But even children playing contact sports may be at risk. There is no easy way to tell if someone has just sustained a brain injury, so soldiers and athletes may unknowingly continue to do the very activity that caused the damage and potentially cause more harm. But a force-responsive, color-changing patch could prevent additional injury, says Shu Yang, Ph.D.  If the force was large enough, and you could easily tell that, then you could immediately seek medical attention,  she explains. Yang s team at the University of Pennsylvania used holographic lithography (HL) to create photonic crystals with carefully designed structures to give them a particular color, just like opals. Deforming the crystals with an applied force changes their internal structures, and thus the crystal s color. The material does not require power to detect forces and is lightweight, thus offering an attractive way for medical personnel to identify a damaging force on-site without the use of expensive tools. However, making these crystals is an expensive process that isn t suitable for the mass production, she says. So the team turned to self-assembly and polymer-based materials that are cheaper to produce over a large area than the earlier HL method. Younghyun Cho, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Yang s lab, will describe the team's development, which could offer a path to commercialization. The first step was to mold the polymer into a structure that worked just like the specialized photonic crystals. To make a mold, the researchers mixed up silica particles of various sizes and allowed them to self-assemble into crystals with the desired pattern. They heated the polymer, which infiltrated the mold, allowed it to solidify and then removed the silica mold, leaving behind the inversed polymer crystals. The researchers then applied varying amounts of force to the polymer crystal and recorded the color change. The results were encouraging.  We were able to change the color consistently with certain forces,  Yang says. For example, applying a 30 mN force   approximately the force of a sedan moving at 80 miles per hour crashing into a brick wall   caused the crystal to change from red to green. A force of 90 mN   the equivalent of a speeding truck hitting that same wall   turned the polymer purple, Cho adds.  This force is right in the range of a blast injury or a concussion,  Yang says. In future studies, Yang plans to develop materials that can indicate how quickly a force is applied, which affects how damaging a particular trauma is on the brain.

Untreated cases may trigger sepsis, which occurs when the immune system, in an attempt to fight off the infection, inadvertently activates body-wide inflammation that can cause blood clots and leaky blood vessels. Sepsis is a major killer and accounts for about half of the hospital deaths in the US by some estimates. Hospital patients often acquire urinary tract infections via infected catheters and so untreated infections are a huge problem faced by healthcare providers around the world. Early diagnosis could save lives and reduce healthcare costs. With this motivation in mind, a team of researchers in Germany and Ireland set out to speed up the detection process for bacteria that cause urinary tract infections.the team describes creating a Lab-on-a-Disc platform that combines microfluidics and Raman microscopy, a modern optical detection method. Their medical diagnostics device is designed to harness centrifugal force -- akin to the circular swing of a ""Chair-o-Plane"" carnival ride, in which a fast rotation creates a force that causes the seats to drift radially away from the ride's center -- to capture the tiny bacteria directly from patients' samples of bodily fluids...in this case, urine. The work involves extremely small sample sizes, on the scale of a small raindrop, so the device needed to be a microfluidic one. ""Our device works by loading a few microliters of a patient's urine sample into a tiny chip, which is then rotated with a high angular velocity so that any bacteria is guided by centrifugal force through microfluidic channels to a small chamber where 'V-cup capture units' collect it for optical investigation,"" explained Ulrich-Christian Schr der, a Ph.D. student at the Jena University Hospital and Leibniz Institute of Technology in Germany. The team's concept then adds Raman spectroscopy to its centrifugal microfluidic platform. ""Raman spectroscopy uses the way light interacts with matter to produce 'unique scattering,' the equivalent of a molecular fingerprint, which can then be used to identify the types of bacteria present,"" said Ute Neugebauer, group leader at the Jena University Hospital and Leibniz Institute of Technology. What exactly does the team's medical device detect? ""In our pilot study, we were able to identify Escherichia coli (more commonly known as E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis -- two species known to cause urinary tract infections -- within 70 minutes, directly from patients' urine samples,"" said Schr der. The speedy diagnosis marks a tremendous reduction in the wait time compared to the lengthy lag -- often 24 hours or more -- associated with methods routinely used to identify bacteria and diagnose urinary tract infections today, so the team's device shows great potential for improving the future of medical diagnostics. The team envisions general practitioners, a.k.a. family doctors, using the device to rapidly -- while a patient waits -- identify the bacteria causing an infection directly within the patient's bodily fluid so that they can prescribe the appropriate medication and treatment. ""Our pilot study brings us a step closer toward realizing this vision,"" said Neugebauer. The team will continue toward its goal of developing an easy-to-use spectroscopy-based point-of-care medical device for fast and reliable diagnostics. ""The next step will involve implementing antibiotic susceptibility testing and automating the sample pre-treatment steps,"" Neugebauer explained. ""Our ultimate vision is to apply the concepts behind our device to enable diagnostics devices for use with other bodily fluids.""","Published: August 17, 2015"

In practice, that means laser pulses in the femtosecond (10-15s) range. An example of such an application is pump-probe spectroscopy of photochemical relaxation processes.  When engineering light to travel in ultrashort pulses, it is important to understand its wave nature,  says Daniel Popa, head of the photonics group at the Cambridge Graphene Centre, and leader of its graphene-based laser research project.  For light to propagate as does a mechanical wave on a stretched cord, the shortest possible pulse is defined by a single wave oscillation.  Time resolution is limited by the length of the laser pulse used. The shorter the pulse, the higher the spectroscopic resolution, with the highest possible resolution defined by the cycle length of the particular light frequency employed. In the visible and near-infrared regimes, in which most ultrafast lasers operate, the ultimate pulse duration lies between 2 and 5 femtoseconds. Shorter pulses require shorter wavelengths.Theoretical limits aside, pulses as short as two cycles can be generated from laser cavities using a technique known as passive mode-locking. With titanium-sapphire lasers, common in photonics laboratories the world over, pulses of 5 femtosecond length can be produced at a wavelength of 800 nanometres, corresponding to less than two cycles. These pulses are not tuneable, however. Tuneable few-cycle pulses can be achieved by exploiting nonlinear effects in optical parametric amplifiers, but the practical arrangements tend to be complex and expensive. Fibre lasers are attractive platforms for ultrashort pulse generation, owing to their simple, compact and cost-effective designs, their efficient heat dissipation, and an alignment-free operation that does not require bulky optical setups. With fibre-based oscillators, ultrashort pulses can be generated by passive mode-locking, which requires a nonlinear component known as a saturable absorber. Graphene has the ideal physical properties to make such a saturable absorber. A graphene-based all-fibre laser for few-cycle light pulses Graphene-based mode-locked lasers have been demonstrated before, but it is the use of this novel two-dimensional material in a compact, all-fibre setup that marks the work of Popa and his colleagues.. With fibre lasers, femtosecond pulses are typically generated through soliton mode-locking. A soliton is a self-reinforcing solitary wave that maintains its shape without distortion as it travels at constant velocity along a waveguide such as an optical fibre. Solitons are the result of dispersive and nonlinear effects that cancel each other out in the waveguide medium, thereby allowing a stable pulse envelope to propagate. All-fibre formats are preferable in terms of cost, compactness and robustness, and the strategy here is to use a cavity based on alternating segments of positive and negative dispersion fibres that lead to periodic broadening and compression of the pulses. The key is to extract the pulse from such a cavity when its duration is at a minimum, and peak power thus at a maximum. Owing to the high peak power of the extracted pulse, new frequency components can be generated through nonlinear optical effects within an external length of fibre, and these are critical when it comes to further decreasing the pulse length. This is based on the mathematical relationship in waves between frequency and time domains known as a Fourier transform. To realise this transformation in physical form, the researchers engineered a dispersive delay line that folds the newly created frequency components into a single pulse. The Graphene Flagship researchers  setup was based only on standard telecommunications equipment, with a saturable absorber based on a composite of graphene and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fabricated by low-cost solution processing, with the graphene flakes exfoliated from bulk graphite by ultrasonic agitation of the solution. Evaporation leaves behind a 50 micron-thick graphene-PVA composite, which is then sandwiched between fibre connectors. With this setup, Purdie and his colleagues were able to generate 29 femtosecond pulses, which corresponds to fewer than six cycles at a wavelength of 1.5 microns. Compensating for higher-order nonlinear and dispersive effects should lead to a shorter pulse length, and the use of a higher power diode, or a double-pumped configuration, could result in higher bandwidth pulses as well as increased output power. Finally, the addition of photonic crystal fibres could in principle allow for the generation of similarly short laser pulses at other wavelengths.  What is truly remarkable about this project is the ease of combining graphene with off-the-shelf optical fibres in a highly compact format,  says Popa.  In this way, we can generate light pulses that last for only a few cycles, or a few millionths of a billionth of a second. ","Published: August 17, 2015"

Current spectroscopy methods require large laboratory machines to measure chemical reactions, but the new technique uses a nanoelectronic chip to do the same thing while the reactions are taking place   which previously was very difficult   with better accuracy, and while gathering a completely new set of data. Being able to analyze these reactions with increased accuracy, heightened sensitivity and greater cost-effectiveness will vastly improve scientists  understanding of nanocatalysts, which will enable the development of new environmentally friendly fuel cells that are more efficient, more durable and less expensive to produce. Eventually, those new fuel cells could be used to power vehicles that run on hydrogen, the 10th most abundant element on Earth, and give off water as exhaust.The work was led by Xianfeng Duan, a UCLA professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Yu Huang, a professor of materials science and engineering; Mengning Ding, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in materials science and engineering, was the first author of the study. Fuel cells and hydrogen batteries are already an important source of green energy, and they are becoming more widely used as they become more powerful and efficient. But further advances will require scientists and engineers to better understand how energy technologies work and to more accurately measure the chemical reactions that make them function. Of particular interest is gaining a better understanding of nanocatalysts, which facilitate electrochemical interactions with the materials on the devices  surfaces at the nano level. (One nanometer is equal in distance to one-billionth of a meter, or about one ten-thousandth the width of a human hair.)  Normally, spectroscopy is used for this kind of analysis,  Duan said.  But conventional techniques are difficult for in situ, or active, electrochemical studies. On-chip electrical transport measurements enable us to directly probe the electrochemical surfaces of metallic nanocatalysts while they are in action. This has allowed us to access a completely new set of information about electrocatalysts.  The device s tiny size is what enables scientists to study the reactions while they are taking place on the materials  surfaces. It has given the UCLA team an unprecedented look at how and why nanocatalysts work or fail under certain conditions, and it has enabled vastly more accurate measurements and new insights into various electrochemical reactions. The researchers hope the new data enables them to develop better nanocatalysts which, in turn, would lead to improved batteries and fuel cells.  Now a single chip can detect signals we were unaware of before,  Huang said.  If we know exactly what happens at the surface of these materials, we can develop more efficient materials. Fuel cells are becoming more widely recognized as a powerful future technology, and nanocatalysts are the most expensive component, inhibiting widespread adoption of the technology. This new technique will help us understand and develop better and cheaper catalysts, allowing the technology to reach its full potential.  Duan said the technique has many other potential uses. For example, the team already is using a similar approach to understand how certain microbes conduct electricity and efficiently convert chemical substrates into electrical energy.","Published: August 17, 2015"

When we buy meat or other products, we have a legal right to know that what we are buying is correctly labelled.  The technique, Stable Isotope Reference Analysis (SIRA), has a background in forensic science and archeology and uses laboratory analysis to test the declared origin of food virtually down to postal code level. The technology has been developed by Agroisolab UK, a subsidiary of Longhand Data in York, and has been eight years in the making. Alongside a German firm, Agroisolab GmbH, the new science will allow retailers to cost-effectively test the country of origin for a wide range of meat and grocery products, including all agricultural produce such as pork, beef, eggs, vegetables and fruit, which have either been grazed or grown on the land. The horse-gate food scandal, which rocked British supermarkets three years ago, focused the attention of retailers on being able to irrefutably confirm the nature of the products they buy. Longhand Data managing director, Roger Young, a biologist and former corporate farmer, said:  When we buy meat or other products, we have a legal right to know that what we are buying is correctly labelled.  To knowingly misrepresent or give false declaration of origin, can be a criminal offence.  Involving the law often means that the retailer and supplier end up in court which is hugely damaging to customer confidence and their brand values.  The  horse-gate  scandal showed that paperwork can be fooled. Laboratory analysis to authenticate the origin of food is accurate, hard to subvert, faster and more cost-effective than conventional traceability processes.  The new process is now being launched commercially in York with legal support from Harrowells Solicitors.  We already have major industry bodies such as The British Pig Executive (BPEX), part of the Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board (AHDB), signed up.  We also have a contract with Associated Beef Producers (ABP) and are well on the way to building the biggest UK beef database. We are contracted to two of the five major supermarkets.  Following the adoption of the European Union Food Information Regulation 1069/2011 (FIR), EU countries face more extensive mandatory country of origin labelling (COOL) requirements including, for meat products, the rearing period and place of slaughter and food processors and retailers can face significant fines for breaches.","Published: August 17, 2015"

Kirk commented,  Oxitec s technology demonstrates that engineered biology can solve some of mankind s most difficult problems   many that have eluded solutions for a very long time   while exercising tremendous respect for the environment. In particular, to be able to induce a population decline in a major disease vector and know your intervention does not propagate in the environment is an historic achievement. Oxitec and Intrexon share a vision for, and an overriding commitment to, a safer, healthier, and more sustainable planet, and because our technology platforms are so complementary, we believe this combination will allow us to address a wider range of threats to global health and food security in new, responsible and exciting ways. I am proud to welcome Oxitec and its accomplished people to the Intrexon team.   We are excited to be joining forces with Intrexon and see this partnership as key to developing sustainable solutions to some of the world s most intractable health and agriculture problems and making them available on a global basis,  stated Hadyn Parry, Chief Executive Officer of Oxitec.  We look forward to making a difference in people s lives that much sooner as part of Intrexon.  Utilizing advanced genetics and molecular biology, Oxitec has developed a new and innovative solution to controlling insect populations through the production of  sterile , self-limiting insects whose offspring do not survive. Unlike conventional approaches to insect control using insecticides that can affect the broader ecosystem, Oxitec programs are exquisitely directed at a single species. Intrexon intends to integrate its synthetic biology platform to advance Oxitec s existing initiatives to protect communities from diseases like dengue fever as well as against agricultural pests that impact food supply worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, dengue is the world s fastest growing mosquito-borne disease spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. A recent estimate indicates a potential 390 million dengue infections per year, of which 96 million manifest clinically. Dengue continues to grow in both prevalence and severity as current methods, relying mostly on insecticides, have not been adequate to control the spread of the mosquitoes. Open field trials with Oxitec s mosquitoes have taken place in Brazil,Panama, Grand Cayman and Malaysia, with over 90% reduction of the Aedes aegypti pest population reported in each efficacy trial. Brazil s National Technical Commission for Biosecurity (CTNBio) approved the safety of Oxitec s mosquitoes in 2014, an important step towards full commercialization of this groundbreaking, and potentially life-saving, technology. In addition to health programs, Intrexon will work on furthering Oxitec s technology applications in agriculture as an estimated 20% to 40% of food production is lost every year to insect pests despite widespread pesticide use. Oxitec s approach is ideal for use as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs, which many growers around the world are adopting to produce food in a more sustainable manner. Due to its species-specificity and low environmental impact, Oxitec solutions are ideal for use in IPM by making insect control more cost effective, safer, and applicable to a wider range of crops and pests.","Published: August 17, 2015"

The finding doubles the number of recognized virus genera   a biological classification one step up from species   and increases the number of sequenced virus genomes available for study almost tenfold. The research group studies viruses that infect microbes, and specifically bacteria and archaea, single-cell microorganisms similar to bacteria in size, but with a different evolutionary history.  Microbes are essential contributors to all life on the planet, and viruses have a variety of influences on microbial functions that remain largely misunderstood, said Matthew Sullivan, assistant professor of microbiology at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study. Sullivan partners with scientists studying microbes in the human gut and lung, as well as natural environments like soils and oceans.  Virus-bacteria and virus-archaea interactions are probably quite important to the dynamics of that microbe, so if researchers are studying a microbe in a specific environment, they ve been missing a big chunk of its interaction dynamics by ignoring the viruses,  Sullivan said.  This work will help researchers recognize the importance of viruses in a lot of different microbes.  In all of our studies, we re working with people who know the microbes well, and we help them decide how viruses might be helpful to the microbial system. The projects range from fundamental, basic science to applied medical science.  Finding a treasure trove of new virus genome sequences has opened the door to using those data to identify previously unknown microbial hosts, as well. These new possibilities are attributed to VirSorter, a computational tool developed by study lead author Simon Roux, a postdoctoral researcher in Sullivan s lab. The sorter scoured public databases of sequenced microbial genomes, looking for fragments of genomes that resembled virus genomes that had already been sequenced   for starters. VirSorter also  fished  for sequences by looking for genes known to help produce a protein shell that all viruses have, called a capsid.   The idea is that bacteria don t use capsids or produce them, so any capsid gene should come from a virus,  Roux said. The sorter then associated capsid genes with unfamiliar genes   those considered new, small or organized differently   that are unlikely to be produced by bacteria.  None of these genomic features is really a smoking gun per se, but combining them led to a robust detection of  new  viruses   viruses we did not have in the database, but can identify because they have capsid genes and a viral organization,  he said. Using microbial genomes as a data source meant researchers could link newly identified virus sequences to the proper microbial host. The scientists then tried a reverse maneuver on the data to see if virus sequences alone could be used to identify unknown hosts   and this way of analyzing the sequences could predict the host with up to 90 percent accuracy.  We can survey a lot of environments to find new viruses, but the challenge has been answering, who do they infect?  Sullivan said.  If we can use computational tricks to predict the host, we can explore that viral-host linkage. That s a really important part of the equation.  Though viruses are generally thought to take over whatever organism they invade, Sullivan s lab has identified a few viruses, called prophages, which coexist with their host microbes and even produce genes that help the host cells compete and survive.  Viruses can t survive without a host, and the most-studied viruses linked to disease are lytic in nature: They get inside a cell and make copies of themselves, destroying the cell in the process.  But the genome sequences revealed in this study suggest that there are many more prophage-like viruses that are different in one important respect: Their genome remains separate from their microbial hosts  genome.  The extrachromosomal form of this virus type appears quite widespread, and virtually nobody is studying these kinds of viruses,  said Sullivan, who also has an appointment in civil, environmental and geodetic engineering.  That is a really different and largely unexplored phenomenon, and it s important to understand those viruses  ability to interact and tie into the function of those cells.

Ovarian cancer has a high mortality rate because it often has metastasized into the abdominal cavity before it s discovered. Toxicity and cancer-cell resistance can also compromise the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy that s often used as a follow-up to surgery. The new approach being developed by researchers from the OSU College of Pharmacy and the University of Nebraska takes existing approaches to photodynamic therapy and makes them significantly more effective by adding compounds that make cancer cells vulnerable to reactive oxygen species, and also reducing the natural defenses of those cells. Surgery and chemotherapy are the traditional approaches to ovarian cancer, but it s very difficult to identify all of the places where a tumor has spread, and in some cases almost impossible to remove all of them,  said Oleh Taratula, an assistant professor in the Oregon State University/Oregon Health & Science University College of Pharmacy.  Photodynamic therapy is a different approach that can be used as an adjunct to surgery right during the operation, and appears to be very safe and nontoxic,  Taratula said.  In the past its effectiveness has been limited, but our new findings may make this technology far more effective than it s ever been before.  Using the new approach, a patient is first given a photosensitizing compound called phthalocyanine, which produces reactive oxygen species that can kill cells when they are exposed to near-infrared light. In addition, a gene therapy is administered that lowers the cellular defense against reactive oxygen species. Both the phthalocyanine and genetic therapy, composed of  small, interfering RNA,  are attached to what researchers call  dendrimer-based nanoplatforms,  a nanotechnology approach developed by OSU researchers. It delivers the compounds selectively into cancer cells, but not healthy cells. Compared to existing photodynamic therapies, this approach allows the near-infrared light to penetrate much deeper into abdominal tissues, and dramatically increases the effectiveness of the procedure in killing cancer cells. Using photodynamic therapy alone, some tumors in laboratory animals began to regrow after two weeks. But with the addition of the combinatorial genetic therapy to weaken the cancer cell defenses, there was no evidence of cancer recurrence. During the procedures, mice receiving the gene therapy also continued to grow and gain weight, indicating a lack of side effects.  Cancer cells are very smart,  Taratula said.  They overexpress certain proteins, including one called DJ1, that help them survive attack by reactive oxygen species that otherwise might kill them. We believe a key to the success of this therapy is that it takes away those defensive mechanisms.  The overexpression of DJ1, researchers said in their study, is associated with invasion, metastasis, resistance to cancer therapies, and overall cancer cell survival. That excess of DJ1 is silenced by the genetic therapy composed of siRNA. The findings of this research, Taratula said, could also build upon some other recent advances in photodynamic therapy, in which a different compound called naphthalocyanine could be administered prior to surgery, causing the cancer cells to  glow  and fluoresce when exposed to near-infrared light. This provides a literal road map for surgeons to follow, showing which tissue is cancerous and which is not. There s no reason that approach couldn t be combined with the newest advance, Taratula said, providing multiple mechanisms to improve surgical success and, with minimal side effects, help eradicate any remaining cancer cells that were not completely removed.  Our study established a prospective therapeutic approach against ovarian cancer,  the researchers wrote in their conclusion.  The tumors exposed to a single dose of a combinatorial therapy were completely eradicated from the mice. ","Published: August 17, 2015"

Now researchers at Stanford have genetically engineered yeast to make painkilling medicines, a breakthrough that heralds a faster and potentially less expensive way to produce many different types of plant-based medicines. The Stanford engineers have described how they reprogrammed the genetic machinery of baker's yeast so that these fast-growing cells could convert sugar into hydrocodone in just three to five days. Hydrocodone and its chemical relatives such as morphine and oxycodone are opioids, members of a family of painkilling drugs sourced from the opium poppy. It can take more than a year to produce a batch of medicine, starting from the farms in Australia, Europe and elsewhere that are licensed to grow opium poppies. Plant material must then be harvested, processed and shipped to pharmaceutical factories in the United States, where the active drug molecules are extracted and refined into medicines.""When we started work a decade ago, many experts thought it would be impossible to engineer yeast to replace the entire farm-to-factory process,"" said senior author Christina Smolke, an associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford. Now, though the output is small   it would take 4,400 gallons of bioengineered yeast to produce a single dose of pain relief   the experiment proves that bioengineered yeast can make complex plant-based medicines. ""This is only the beginning,"" Smolke said. ""The techniques we developed and demonstrate for opioid pain relievers can be adapted to produce many plant-derived compounds to fight cancers, infectious diseases and chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and arthritis."" From plant to test tubes Many medicines are derived from plants, which our ancestors chewed or brewed into teas, or later refined into pills using chemical processes to extract and concentrate their active ingredients. Smolke's team is modernizing the process by inserting precisely engineered snippets of DNA into cells, such as yeast, to reprogram the cells into custom chemical assembly lines to produce medicinal compounds. An important predecessor to the Stanford work has been the use of genetically engineered yeast to produce the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Traditionally artemisinin has been sourced from the sweet wormwood tree in similar fashion to how opiates are refined from poppy. Over the last decade, as yeast-based artemisinin production has become possible, about one third of the world's supply has shifted to bioreactors. The artemisinin experiments proved that yeast biosynthesis was possible, but involved adding only six genes. The Stanford team had to engineer 23 genes into yeast to create their cellular assembly line for hydrocodone. ""This is the most complicated chemical synthesis ever engineered in yeast,"" Smolke said. Her team found and fine-tuned snippets of DNA from other plants, bacteria and even rats. These genes equipped the yeast to produce all the enzymes necessary for the cells to convert sugar into hydrocodone, a compound that deactivates pain receptors in the brain. ""Enzymes make and break molecules,"" said Stephanie Galanie, a PhD student in chemistry and a member of Smolke's team. ""They're the action heroes of biology."" To get the yeast assembly line going, the Stanford team had to fill in a missing link in the basic science of plant-based medicines. Many plants, including opium poppies, produce (S)-reticuline, a molecule that is a precursor to active ingredients with medicinal properties. In the opium poppy, (S)-reticuline is naturally reconfigured into a variant called (R)-reticuline, a molecule that starts the plant down a path toward the production of molecules that can relieve pain. Smolke's team and two other labs recently independently discovered which enzyme reconfigures reticuline, but even after the Stanford bioengineers added this enzyme into their microbial factory, the yeast didn't create enough of the opioid compound. So they genetically tweaked the next enzyme in the process to boost production. Down the line they went, adding enzymes, including six from rats, in order to craft a molecule that emerged ready to plug pain receptors in the brain. Engineered with a purpose The Stanford authors acknowledged that a new process to make opioid painkillers could increase concerns about the potential for opioid abuse. ""We want there to be an open deliberative process to bring researchers and policymakers together,"" Smolke said. ""We need options to help ensure that the bio-based production of medicinal compounds is developed in the most responsible way."" Smolke said that in the United States, where opioid medicines are already widely available, the focus is on potential misuse. But the World Health Organization estimates that 5.5 billion people have little or no access to pain medications. ""Biotech production could lower costs and, with proper controls against abuse, allow bioreactors to be located where they are needed,"" she said. In addition to bioengineering yeast to convert sugar into hydrocodone, the Stanford team developed a second strain that can process sugar into thebaine, a precursor to other opioid compounds. Bio-produced thebaine would still need to be refined through sophisticated processes in pharmaceutical factories, but it would eliminate the time delay of growing poppies. ""The molecules we produced and the techniques we developed show that it is possible to make important medicines from scratch using only yeast,"" she said. ""If responsibly developed, we can make and fairly provide medicines to all who need.""","Published: August 17, 2015"

By modifying the oilseed biochemistry in camelina, the researchers have achieved very high levels of an oil with reduced viscosity and improved cold temperature characteristics. The goal of the research is to alter oilseeds to produce large amounts of modified oil that can be used as improved biofuels or even industrial and food-related applications.  ""Reducing our dependence on fossil fuel-derived carbon is always good,"" Durrett said. ""Using alternative sources of fuel is the obvious way to reduce our dependence. But even other applications, such as using it for lubricants or as feedstocks for the chemical industry, would help reduce our dependence on fossil-derived carbon.""Camelina can grow on poorer quality farmland, needs little irrigation or fertilizer, and produces seeds that can provide gallons of oil, Durrett said. It also can be rotated with wheat and could become a biofuel crop for semi-arid regions, including western Kansas and Colorado.  The camelina genome was recently sequenced, which has greatly helped Durrett and collaborators as they improve camelina's oil properties to produce low-viscosity oil   the kind of oil needed for biofuel. By modifying the oilseed biochemistry in camelina, the researchers were able to get very high levels of the modified oil, which are called acetyl-TAGS. In the best camelina lines, about 85 percent of the oil was comprised of the modified acetyl-TAGs. One of the team's goals is to make commercial products using oils from the engineered plants. The researchers are analyzing these oils because their acetyl-TAGs possess unusual structures and have high value-added properties. ""The basic problem is that most of our oilseed crops   such as canola or soybean   produce just a few fatty acids because we use them for nutritional needs,"" Durrett said. ""That's great for a source of food, but makes doing any sort of chemistry more complicated."" The researchers think that camelina producing acetyl-TAGs is a renewable resource with potential industrial uses, including plasticizers, biodegradable lubricants and food emulsifiers. ""The food industry uses similar compounds already,"" Durrett said. ""What we need to do is first of all see if our oil is safe and can match those specifications. Probably one of the most valuable parts of this research is that we can generate meaningful data sets because of the oil's properties and we can learn more about the oil itself and what it can do.""","Published: August 17, 2015"

Temperatures and carbon dioxide levels have risen, many rivers have been dammed worldwide and wastewater nutrients or agricultural fertilizers in various situations can cause problems in rivers, lakes and reservoirs. No testing for cyanobacteria is mandated by state or federal drinking water regulators, according to scientists from Oregon State University, nor is reporting required of disease outbreaks associated with algal blooms. But changes in climate and land use, and even increasing toxicity of the bacteria themselves, may force greater attention to this issue in the future, the researchers said. The researchers also noted that problems with these toxins reach their peak during the heat of summer   as they are doing right now. In 2015, drought and low snow pack throughout the West has led to large and toxic algal blooms earlier than in previous years. Toxic blooms have occurred for the second consecutive year in the Willamette River near Portland, Ore., and Upper Klamath Lake and most of the Klamath River have health warnings posted.In a related marine concern, all along the West Coast many shellfish harvests are closed because of an ongoing event of domoic acid shellfish poisoning, producing what is thought to be the largest algal bloom in recorded history. Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous around the world, and a 2007 national survey by the EPA found microcystin, a recognized liver toxin and potential liver carcinogen, in one out of every three lakes that were tested. Some of the toxic strains of cyanobacteria can also produce neurotoxins, while most can cause gastrointestinal illness and acute skin rashes. Exposure to cyanobacteria is often fatal to pets or wildlife that drink contaminated water, and there have been rare cases of human fatalities. Last year the drinking water supply was temporarily shut down in Toledo, Ohio, a city of 500,000 people, because of cyanobacterial contamination of water taken from Lake Erie.  The biggest health concern with cyanobacteria in sources of drinking water is that there s very little regulatory oversight, and it remains unclear what level of monitoring is being voluntarily conducted by drinking water utilities,  said Tim Otten, a postdoctoral scholar in the OSU Department of Microbiology, and lead author on the study.  At this point we only have toxicology data for a handful of these toxins, and even for those it remains unclear what are the effects of chronic, low-dose exposures over a lifetime,  Otten said.  We know some of the liver toxins such as microcystin are probable carcinogens, but we ve really scratched only the surface with regard to understanding what the health effects may be for the bioactive metabolites produced by these organisms.  Otten referred to the  precautionary principle  of protecting human health before damage is done.  In my mind, these bacteria should be considered guilty until proven innocent, and in drinking water treated as potential pathogens,  he said.  I think cyanobacteria should be approached with significant caution, and deserve better monitoring and regulation.  The issue is complex, because not all cyanobacteria are a problem, and in fact they play many positive roles as primary producers in oceans and fresh waters. They are among Earth s oldest life forms, and more than two billion years ago helped produce much of the oxygen that made much other life on Earth possible, including humans. But various strains of them have likely always been toxic. Scientists said a concern is that nutrient over-enrichment may select for the more toxic populations of these bacteria, creating a positive feedback loop that makes the problem even worse. Researchers said in their analysis that modern water treatment does a reasonably good job of making drinking water safe, but the lack of required or widespread monitoring remains a problem. No one should drink untreated surface water that may be contaminated by cyanobacteria, and another serious concern is recreational exposure through swimming or other water sports. Cyanobacteria-associated illnesses are not required to be reported under the Center for Disease Control and Prevention s guidelines, as most pathogens are. This makes accurate assessments of the incidence and severity of adverse health outcomes difficult to determine. A recent study identified 11 freshwater lake, algal-bloom associated disease outbreaks, and 61 illnesses from 2009-10, based on reports from New York, Ohio and Washington. The most common symptoms were skin rashes and gastroenteritis. There were no fatalities. Many large, eutrophic lakes such as Lake Erie are plagued each year by algal blooms so massive that they are visible from outer space. Dogs have died from drinking contaminated water, and sea otter deaths in Monterey Bay have been attributed to them eating shellfish contaminated with microcystin that came from an inland lake. Until better monitoring standards are in place, the researchers note, an unfortunate indicator of toxic algal bloom events will be illness or death among pets, livestock and wild animals that drink contaminated water. One cannot tell visually if an algal bloom will be toxic or not, Otten said, and traditional microscopic cell counting and other approaches to assess risk are too slow for making time-sensitive, public health decisions. But the future holds promise. New DNA-based techniques can be used by experts to estimate health risks faster and cheaper than traditional methods. Cyanobacterial toxins are not destroyed by boiling. However, individuals concerned about the safety of their drinking water may use regularly changed point-of-use carbon filtration devices that are effective in reducing these health risks. People should also develop an awareness of what cyanobacteria look like, in a natural setting appearing as green, paint-like surface scums. They should avoid water recreation on a lake or river that has these characteristics, researchers said.","Published: August 17, 2015"

The successful development of personalized cancer treatments will be driven by the accurate description of the genetic composition of a patient's cancerous tumor. Recent breakthroughs in cancer genomics research reveals cells within each malignant tumor are genetically heterogeneous, possessing new and evolving DNA mutations. Traditional one-size-fit-all approaches for treating cancer cannot eliminate all the subclones--the next generation of a mutant cell arising in a clone--within a tumor. After treatment, residual cells become resistant and repopulate a new tumor that becomes more challenging to treat. Consequently, it is important for cancer researchers to fully understand the subclonal genetics in a tumor so the disease can be attacked more effectively using combinations of drugs that target all the subclones. To do so, the first step is to determine which subclones are present and the various types of mutations the subclones possess. Using NGS data, Ji and his collaborators developed Bayesian feature allocation models to extrapolate the number and population frequencies of subclones in a tumor sample. They also established subclonal sequence and structural mutations as part of the inference results, both of which help physicians select targeted drugs based on the models' findings. ""By applying the powerful Bayesian feature allocation models to analyze NGS data, we believe we can understand the genetic and cellular heterogeneity within each tumor and thus facilitate precision cancer treatment decisions by a patient's attending physician,"" said Ji, concluding his presentation.

Jellyfish and other cnidarians are the oldest living venomous creatures, but research has been hampered by a lack of readily obtainable venom harvested in a reproducible manner,  he said.  More papers are published on snake venom in a single year than have ever been published on jellyfish venom. The reason is a lack of venom supply.  Without this raw material, life-saving anti venom cannot be developed, and we can t study how venom components can be developed into new drugs. Our method is a practical one that can be used in the field with high efficiency, so it removes a major bottleneck from jellyfish venom research.  Obtaining venom from these jellyfish has been challenging, and many methods have been used, with some taking more than two weeks while others yield only very tiny amounts of pure venom.  These previous methods also resulted in the venom being heavily contaminated with material such as mucus.  A sting from a box jellyfish can kill a human in minutes and the pain alone can cause the body to go into deadly shock. The new method uses ethanol to cause tentacle venom cells   nematocysts   to fire. Immediate firing of the nematocysts allows the researchers to collect venom from the box jellyfish. Professor Fry said the success of ethanol was ironic, as the substance would actually exacerbate the result of a sting if used as first-aid treatment.  It is very much a case of doing something that would be the wrong thing from a first-aid perspective, which ironically turns out to be an extremely simple field technique to obtain high-quality venom,  he said.  All aspects of this research come with unique difficulties, such as a handling a delicate animal which is impossible to keep or breed in captivity and is found only in cyclone-prone areas of northern Australia and the Indo-Pacific region, often in crocodile habitat.

The opportunity to bring a new treatment option to those battling the devastating illness of Huntington disease is an important first step and an indication of our profound commitment to improving the lives of patients with this and other debilitating movement disorders,  saidMichael Hayden, M.D., Ph.D., President of Global R&D and Chief Scientific Officer at Teva.  With this filing and an ongoing investment in HD research, Teva has further established itself as a leader in the development of treatments focusing on movement disorders.   Teva plans to commercialize SD-809 in the U.S. by drawing from vast experience in facilitating therapy initiation and patient support in other disease areas. Within Global Specialty Medicines, we have a rich history of demonstrating our commitment to the patient and bringing value to the neurology community,  said Rob Koremans, MD, President and CEO of Global Specialty Medicines at Teva.  People living with neurodegenerative disorders and those around them often need support and services beyond medications. We intend to meet these needs with our proven infrastructure and our focus on the patient.  The NDA filing is based on positive results from two Phase-III studies, FIRST-HD and ARC-HD. In the placebo-controlled, randomized FIRST-HD study, SD-809 reduced chorea in patients with HD. Positive top-line data from the Phase-III, open-label ARC-HD study demonstrated that patients were able to safely convert from tetrabenazine, currently the only approved HD treatment, to SD-809 overnight with continued control of chorea. SD-809 was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of HD by the FDA inNovember 2014 and became part of Teva s CNS portfolio with the acquisition of Auspex Pharmaceuticals in May 2015.","Published: August 17, 2015"

These cells   called M2 macrophages - repair tissue damage and build new blood vessels, a process that sometimes helps the tumour to grow again after treatment. But by treating mice with cancer with a drug* that stops these repair cells from working, the researchers markedly reduced the speed at which tumours grew back after chemotherapy. The lead scientist on the study, Professor Claire Lewis at the University of Sheffield s Department of Oncology, said:  Scientists already knew that the body s drive to heal itself can sometimes backfire when the immune system reacts to tissue damage. Our research shows that treating tumours with chemotherapy can activate this part of the immune system, and this then helps tumours re-grow afterwards. But combining chemotherapy with a drug that switches off this part of the body s repair system, slowed the growth of tumours after chemotherapy.  This could be particularly important for patients who can t have surgery and, therefore, need chemotherapy to help them live for as long as possible.  Clinical trials of patients are needed to confirm these early findings to see if the drug   already used in patients for other reasons, such as bone marrow transplants - could help cancer patients after chemotherapy. Dr  ine McCarthy, science communications officer at Cancer Research UK, said:  Chemotherapy is a cornerstone cancer treatment that saves thousands of lives, but sometimes tumours come back, reducing patients  chances of survival. We don t understand all the reasons why tumours do come back, but this study sheds new light on the role of the immune system in causing tumours to grow again and, importantly, identifies a drug that could block this happening if given at the same time as chemotherapy.  But this is early research carried out in mice and more work is needed to see if blocking M2 macrophages** can also slow down tumour re-growth in patients. ","Published: August 17, 2015"

Furthermore, it follows the recent announcement of coverage by Aetna for ThyGenX, Interpace Diagnostics' genetic mutation panel used to improve risk stratification and surgical decision-making when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis of thyroid cancer.  The combination of all plans, including Medicare coverage of ThyGenX, represents a total of 80 million covered lives for Interpace Diagnostics' molecular thyroid diagnostic tests. Coverage of PancraGen , Interpace Diagnostics' test for pancreatic cyst cancer risk stratification, was also recently extended to an additional 1.3 million lives by a contracted top national plan, bringing this plan's total covered lives for PancraGen to 10 million.  Additionally, one of the country's largest Blue Cross Blue Shield plans renewed PancraGen contract coverage for their 5.9 million lives. These plans recognize the value in identifying patients at risk of progression to pancreatic cancer and those at a lower risk with a high degree of accuracy, by ensuring their members have access to this technology.  The combination of all plans, including Medicare coverage of PancraGen, represents over 70 million covered lives for this molecular test. ""Coverage by these additional plans provides further validation of our tests' value to their members,"" said Nancy Lurker, CEO of PDI, Inc.  She adds, ""We continue to advance discussions with other plans to increase coverage for our tests, efforts which will both benefit patients and further accelerate the current growth taking place at Interpace Diagnostics, our molecular diagnostics business."" About Thyroid Nodules, ThyGenX and ThyraMIR Approximately 15% to 30% of the 525,000 thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed on an annual basis are indeterminate based on standard cytological evaluation and thus candidates for ThyGenX Thyroid Oncogene Panel.  Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) indicate that molecular diagnostic approaches may be useful in the evaluation of thyroid FNA samples that are indeterminate to assist in patient management, including identifying patients who are appropriate candidates for surgery and those for whom surveillance is the appropriate course of action. ThyGenX is used to improve risk stratification and surgical decision-making when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis of thyroid cancer. ThyGenX assists physicians in distinguishing between benign and malignant genotypes in indeterminate thyroid nodules by utilizing state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify more than 100 genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, the two most common forms of thyroid malignancies. The ThyGenX panel design is based on the miRInform  test, whose high predictive value has been validated in a recent prospective clinical study involving over 600 patients. Interpace Diagnostics acquired the miRInform test from Asuragen in 2014, and has now enhanced it by upgrading to an NGS platform, providing greater genomic insights and increased panel content. ThyraMIR Thyroid miRNA Classifier is the first and only microRNA gene expression classifier.  MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that bind to messenger RNA and regulate expression of genes involved in human cancers, including every subtype of thyroid cancer. ThyraMIR measures the expression of 10 microRNAs and, when used in combination with ThyGenX, yields high negative predictive value and high positive predictive value. This results in improved molecular classification of both benign and malignant thyroid nodules independent of thyroid cancer prevalence in the clinical setting.","Published: August 17, 2015"

However, building them into larger proteins, such as antibodies, can make them persist long enough to be useful. Now a team led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) has devised an improved method for accomplishing this protein-engineering feat. The new method mimics evolution by generating millions of possible junction segments between the inserted protein and its antibody host, selecting the rare ones that allow the inserted protein to fold and function normally. The technique should speed the development of drug and diagnostic compounds that would not have been possible otherwise including powerful hormone-based therapies.  Unlike prior approaches to this design problem, ours is a selection-based method and it s hard to beat this approach, with its ability to harness the power of very large numbers,  said senior investigator Richard A. Lerner, the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professor of Immunochemistry at TSRI. The technique is general enough so it could have many clinical and scientific applications, for example, determining why proteins fold as they do.  It effectively enables you to put a measuring device in the middle of a protein to determine if it s folded properly,  Lerner said. Making Leptin Last Longer Lerner s laboratory helped pioneer techniques for generating billions of different antibodies and screening these large  antibody libraries  to find those that perform a desired function. The new work is an extension of that technology. In one proof-of-principle demonstration, the team edited the genetic code of a standard human antibody to replace one of its target-grappling elements a structure that normally would bind to a virus, for example with the protein leptin. First identified by Friedman in 1994 as a satiety hormone that switches off hunger, leptin initially failed as an obesity therapy, as obese people tend to be insensitive to leptin rather than leptin-deficient. However, the hormone has drawn renewed interest in recent years as a possible basis for treating obesity in conjunction with leptin-sensitizing compounds and also diabetes. Leptin on its own and in an unmodified state isn t ideal as a therapy because it doesn t last long in the bloodstream.  The kidneys and other organs clear it very rapidly,  said Yingjie Peng, a staff scientist in the Lerner laboratory who was first author of the study with Wenwen Zeng of Friedman s lab at Rockefeller.  But it could last much longer if it were part of a larger structure such as an antibody.  The major challenge for Lerner, Peng and their colleagues was to design leptin into an antibody in such a way that it would fold up into a functional structure despite being bound to its host protein at either end. Designing simple, highly flexible  junction  segments to join leptin to an antibody could work a recent paper by a group including TSRI s Peter Schultz, Scripps Family Chair Professor of Chemistry, described such a feat. But Lerner s team reasoned that a selection-based design of these junctions would be a more general approach to making useful protein-in-protein molecules. The Power of Large Numbers Using their established techniques for generating large libraries of variant antibodies, the team made nearly 30 million versions of the leptin-in-antibody protein, each version having a different amino-acid sequence for its junction segments. To find the rare versions that enabled leptin to fold up and function properly, the researchers used a selection system that they had previously developed for finding therapeutic antibodies in large antibody libraries. First they employed viral vectors to insert the leptin-in-antibody DNA into test cells that contain leptin receptors. When one of the resulting leptin-in- antibody proteins successfully activated a leptin receptor in its test cell, the event was signaled by a highly sensitive set of fluorescent beacons. The cells whose beacon signals rose above a certain threshold were analyzed for the leptin-in-antibody DNA they contained, and this DNA was then inserted into new test cells and so on, for round after round of selection, until the process yielded the leptin-in-antibody protein that did best at activating the leptin receptor. This selected protein turned out to be several times more potent than leptin in terms of its ability to activate the leptin receptor in cultured cells. In tests in Friedman s laboratory, it had a more than a four-hour bloodstream half-life in mice a big improvement over natural leptin. As is often the case for antibodies, the leptin-in-antibody protein effectively could not cross from the bloodstream into the brain and thus could not hit all of leptin s neuronal targets and so its effects at reducing eating and weight in mice were less than optimal. But, in principle, antibodies can be modified to enable them to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily, and the team is working on that now. Broad Applications To highlight the general applicability of the new method, the researchers also used it to  selection-design  an antibody that incorporates the growth and reproductive hormone FSH which is structurally very different from leptin. The resulting FSH-in-antibody protein showed activity against the FSH receptor that was virtually the same as the natural hormone s. The team is now working to improve their FSH- and leptin-in-antibody proteins, and to design entirely new protein-in-antibody molecules.","Published: August 17, 2015"

Genmab reasons that dual-targeting may improve binding specificity and efficacy in inactivating disease targets. According to Genmab, bispecific antibodies generated through DuoBody may improve antibody therapy of cancer, autoimmune, and infectious and central nervous system diseases.  Today's agreement with Novo Nordisk is an example of how we can leverage access to our unique state-of-the art antibody expertise and collaborations to generate diverse revenue streams in areas beyond cancer,  Genmab CEO Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., said in a statement. Under their agreement, Novo Nordisk has agreed to pay Genmab $2 million upfront. After an initial period of exclusivity for the two target combinations, Novo Nordisk has the option to maintain that exclusivity or allow the licenses to become non-exclusive. Genmab will receive payments tied to potential development, regulatory and sales milestones of approximately $250 million for each exclusive license, or approximately $200 million for each non-exclusive license. Genmab will also be entitled to single-digit royalties on sales of any commercialized products. Genmab said it expected no material impact on its 2015 financial guidance as a result of its licensing agreement with Novo Nordisk. Genmab has projected 2015 operating income of between DKK 200 million ($29.9 million) and DKK 275 million ($41.1 million), on revenue expected to range between DKK 650 million ($97.1 million) and DKK 725 million ($108.3 million). Founded in 1999, Copenhagen-based Genmab has one marketed antibody, Arzerra  (ofatumumab) for the treatment of certain chronic lymphocytic leukemia indications, as well as clinical programs that include daratumumab for multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

When healthy liver cells are depleted by long-term exposure to toxic chemicals, the newly discovered cells, known as hybrid hepatocytes, generate new tissue more efficiently than normal liver cells. Importantly, they divide and grow without causing cancer, which tends to be a risk with rapid cell division.  This is the first time anyone has shown how liver cells safely regenerate,  said William Suk, Ph.D., director of the Superfund Research Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH. The researchers studied liver function in mice following long-term exposure to carbon tetrachloride, a chemical commonly associated with Superfund sites. The scientists were able to isolate the hybrid hepatocytes after observing how the tissue regenerated. They then exposed healthy mice to three known cancer-causing pathways and watched the hybrid hepatocytes closely. Liver cancer never originated from these cells.   The research team, led by Michael Karin, Ph.D., distinguished professor of pharmacology and pathology at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and a member of the prestigious National Academy of Medicine, conducted the research at the UCSD Superfund Research Center.  The entire program at UCSD is focused on the effects of toxicants on liver metabolism and functionality,  said Suk. One of the goals of the Superfund Research Program is to better understand how toxic chemicals affect human health. The liver plays an essential role in this process by helping to remove toxicants from the body.  Hybrid hepatocytes represent not only the most effective way to repair a diseased liver, but also the safest way to prevent fatal liver failure by cell transplantation,  noted Karin.","Published: August 17, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-details-rotten-egg-gas-role-in-autoimmune-disease-210526,Study Details  Rotten Egg  Gas  Role in Autoimmune Disease The finding unveils several new possible points for therapeutic intervention  with implications for autoimmune diseases as well as other conditions such as cancer and hypertension  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The immune system not only responds to infections and other potentially problematic abnormalities in the body, it also contains a built-in brake in the form of regulatory T cells, or Tregs. Tregs ensure that inflammatory responses don t get out of hand and do damage. In autoimmune diseases, sometimes these Treg cells don t act as they should. A new study led by Songtao Shi of the University of Pennsylvania has demonstrated how Tregs can themselves be regulated, by an unexpected source: hydrogen sulfide, a gas produced by the body s muscle cells and one often associated with the smell of rotten eggs. Shi is professor and chair of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology in Penn s School of Dental Medicine.  Traditionally, scientists have thought of signaling pathways as entailing a ligand binding to a receptor. But gases can also trigger signaling cascades in the body. The best known is nitric oxide, or NO, which regulates a host of functions, notably blood pressure. Carbon monoxide is another so-called  gasotransmitter. Though less is known about it, researchers have also come to understand that hydrogen sulfide gas plays a suite of important roles in the body as well. Reduced levels of H2S have been associated with immune disorders, cancer and hypertension.  H2S is very interesting,  Shi said.  High levels of it are toxic, but our body maintains it at a certain level and our cells produce it.  In an earlier study, Shi and colleagues had found that mesenchymal stem cells produce and rely on H2S for proper functioning. In the course of that study, they noticed that mice with reduced levels of H2S had problems consistent with autoimmune disease. To see if they could pinpoint the role of the gas in immune regulation, the research team examined Tregs in culture and found that they, too, produce H2S. Mice bred to produce reduced levels of H2S had abnormally low numbers of Tregs and, as a result, developed autoimmune disease that affected multiple organs. Giving these mice compounds that release H2S partially alleviated these effects, and the animals lived longer. Next, the team wanted to find out more about the mechanism by which H2S acted on the immune system. They had already observed that H2S-deficient T cells had lower levels of a Treg marker called Foxp3, but H2S did not seem to affect the actors of a known pathway by which Foxp3 is produced. So they hypothesized that H2S might act in another, as-yet-uncharacterized pathway to regulate Foxp3 expression. Through a series of experiments, they began to unravel the pathway. They observed that mice with reduced H2S production had large numbers of methyl groups on the Foxp3 gene, tags which repress the gene s expression. It was already known that demethylation of Foxp3 can occur through two enzymes called Tet1 and Tet2, which Shi describes as being the center of  a hot area of research right now.  Their work revealed that H2S regulates the expression of Tet1 and Tet2 by modifying a transcription factor called NFYB by adding a sulfur atom to it, a process called sulfhydration. Reducing H2S levels led to reduced expression of Tet1 and Tet2 in T cells and, consequently, impaired function and development of Tregs. Again, the researchers showed they could partially reverse these effects by adding back a source of H2S.  This is the first time anyone has connected sulfhydration with Tet and Tet with Foxp3,  Shi said.  It s becoming clear that H2S has a very important role to play in immune regulation.  Shi and his team are continuing to examine how H2S operates in the context of both stem cells and T cells and are looking, too, to see whether it plays critical roles in other cell types. They re also following up on the current work to identify ways to intervene when H2S levels fall in order to prevent autoimmune problems.  There are a lot of different ways to rescue this problem,  Shi said. ","Published: August 17, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/capturing-cell-growth-in-3d-189770,Capturing Cell Growth in   D Spinout s microfluidics device better models how cancer and other cells interact in the body  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Replicating how cancer and other cells interact in the body is somewhat difficult in the lab. Biologists generally culture one cell type in plastic plates, which doesn t represent the dynamic cell interactions within living organisms. Now MIT spinout AIM Biotech has developed a microfluidics device   based on years of research   that lets researchers co-culture multiple cell types in a 3-D hydrogel environment that mimics natural tissue.Among other things, the device can help researchers better study biological processes, such as cancer metastasis, and more accurately capture how cancer cells react to chemotherapy agents, says AIM Biotech co-founder Roger Kamm, the Cecil H. Green Distinguished Professor in MIT s departments of mechanical engineering and biological engineering.  If you want realistic models of these processes, you have to go to a 3-D matrix, with multiple cell types   to see cell-to-cell contact and let cells signal to each other,  Kamm says.  None of those processes can be reproduced realistically in the current cell-culture methods.  Designed originally for Kamm s lab, the new commercial device is a plastic chip with three chambers: a middle chamber for hydrogel and any cell type, such as cancer cells or endothelial cells (which line blood vessels), and two side channels for culturing additional cell types. The hydrogel chamber has openings along each side, so cells can interact with each other, as they would in the body. Cancer drugs or other therapeutics can then be added to better monitor how cells respond in a patient. Lab-fabricated devices have been used for various applications described in more than 40 research publications to date, including studies of cancer and stem cell research, neuroscience, and the circulatory system. This month, AIM Biotech will begin deploying the commercial devices to 47 research groups in 13 countries for user feedback. Other systems for 3-D cell culturing involve filling deep dishes with hydrogels. Because of the distance these dishes must be kept from the microscope, Kamm says, it s difficult to capture high-resolution images. AIM Biotech s devices, on the other hand, he says, can be put directly under the microscope like a traditional plate, which is beneficial for imaging.  Everything here happens within about 200 microns of the cover slip, so you can get really good high-resolution, real-time images and movies,  Kamm says.Lab to world In 2005 at MIT, Kamm s lab created a prototype of the microfluidics device to better study angiogenesis   the forming of new blood vessels. But there was a major issue: The hydrogel in the middle chamber would spread into the side channels before solidifying, which disturbed the cell cultures.   As a solution, the researchers lined the hydrogel chamber with minute posts. When injected, the hydrogel seeps out to the posts, but surface tension keeps it from leaking into the side channels, while still allowing the cells to enter.  That s the key,  Kamm says.  When you put liquid into a small space, surface tension drives where it goes, so we decided to use surface tension to our advantage.  Soon, Kamm was using the device in his lab: In a 2011 study, researchers in his group discovered that breast cancer cells can break free from tumors and travel against flows normally present inside the tissue; in a 2012 study, they found that macrophages   a type of white blood cells   were key in helping tumor cells break through blood vessels. And in a 2013 study, Kamm was able to capture high-resolution videos of how the cells escape through minute holes in endothelial walls and travel through the body.  People try to do this in vivo, but you can t possibly get the kind of resolution you can within a microfluidic system,  Kamm says. Researchers worldwide began taking notice of the device, which led to several collaborations with researchers locally and in Singapore: The device s development had been funded, in part, by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).  It became apparent that, if there s this much interest in these systems and that much need for them, we should set up a company to develop the technology and market it,  Kamm says. After securing seed funding from Draper Laboratory, the National Institutes of Health, and SMART, Kamm brought the idea for the device to Innovation Teams (i-Teams), where MIT students from across disciplines flesh out strategies for turning lab technologies into commercial products. Among other things, this experience helped Kamm home in on the product s target market.  At the time, [I was] trying to decide whether to go for researchers, go directly to pharmaceutical industry, or something that is useful in the clinic,  Kamm says.  One of the i-Teams  recommendations was to develop systems for researchers. It reinforced what we were heading toward, but it was nice to get that confirmation.  AIM Biotech launched in Singapore in 2012, under current CEO Kuan Chee Mun, who Kamm met through SMART. Fighting cancer A major application for the device, Kamm says, is studying cancer metastasis   as demonstrated with his own work   to develop better treatments. In the body, cells break loose from a tumor and migrate through tissue into the blood system, where they get stuck in the small blood vessels of a distant organ or adhere to vessel walls. Then they can escape from inside the vessel to form another tumor. AIM Biotech s microfluidics device produces a similar microenvironment: When endothelial cells are seeded into the side channels or the central gel region, they form a 3-D network of vessels in the hydrogel. Tumor cells can be introduced, flowing naturally or getting stuck in the vessels. Kamm says this environment could be useful in testing cancer drugs, as well as anti-angiogenesis compounds that prevent the development of blood vessels, effectively killing tumors by cutting off their blood supply. While many such treatments have shown limited success,  there s a lot of interest in screening for new ones,  Kamm says. In the future, Kamm adds, AIM Biotech may offer to more accurately screen cancer drugs for pharmaceutical companies. In fact, he says, AIM Biotech recently discovered that its devices revealed discrepancies in some clinically tested therapeutics. Researchers used Kamm's microfluidics technology to screen several drugs that aim to prevent tumors from breaking up and dispersing throughout the body. Results indicated that the level of drugs needed was often two orders of magnitude higher than predictions based on traditional assays.  So there s no way to effectively predict, from the 2-D assays, what the efficacy of a particular drug was,  Kamm says. If pharmaceutical companies were to winnow potential drugs from, say, 1,000 to 100 for testing, Kamm says,  We could test those drugs out in a more realistic setting. ","Published: August 17, 2015"

The clock s mechanism, it turns out, is much like a light switch. In a study of brain circadian neurons that govern the daily sleep-wake cycle s timing, Allada and his research team found that high sodium channel activity in these neurons during the day turn the cells on and ultimately awaken an animal, and high potassium channel activity at night turn them off, allowing the animal to sleep. Investigating further, the researchers were surprised to discover the same sleep-wake switch in both flies and mice. This suggests the underlying mechanism controlling our sleep-wake cycle is ancient,  said Allada, professor and chair of neurobiology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He is the senior author of the study.  This oscillation mechanism appears to be conserved across several hundred million years of evolution. And if it s in the mouse, it is likely in humans, too.  Better understanding of this mechanism could lead to new drug targets to address sleep-wake trouble related to jet lag, shift work and other clock-induced problems. Eventually, it might be possible to reset a person s internal clock to suit his or her situation. The researchers call this a  bicycle  mechanism: two pedals that go up and down across a 24-hour day, conveying important time information to the neurons. That the researchers found the two pedals -- a sodium current and potassium currents -- active in both the simple fruit fly and the more complex mouse was unexpected.  What is amazing is finding the same mechanism for sleep-wake cycle control in an insect and a mammal,  said Matthieu Flourakis, the lead author of the study.  Mice are nocturnal, and flies are diurnal, or active during the day, but their sleep-wake cycles are controlled in the same way.  When he joined Allada s team, Flourakis had wondered if the activity of the fruit fly s circadian neurons changed with the time of day. With the help of Indira M. Raman, the Bill and Gayle Cook Professor in the department of neurobiology, he found very strong rhythms: The neurons fired a lot in the morning and very little in the evening. The researchers next wanted to learn why. That s when they discovered that when sodium current is high, the neurons fire more, awakening the animal, and when potassium current is high, the neurons quiet down, causing the animal to slumber. The balance between sodium and potassium currents controls the animal s circadian rhythms. Flourakis, Allada and their colleagues then wondered if such a process was present in an animal closer to humans. They studied a small region of the mouse brain that controls the animal s circadian rhythms -- the suprachiasmatic nucleus, made up of 20,000 neurons -- and found the same mechanism there.  Our starting point for this research was mutant flies missing a sodium channel who walked in a halting manner and had poor circadian rhythms,  Allada said.

While those studies have provided information that may lead to improved techniques for monitoring the consciousness of patients receiving general anesthesia, until now they have been conducted in relatively young adult patients. Now a series of papers from MGH researchers is detailing the differences in the way common anesthetics affect the brains of older patients and children, findings that could lead to ways of improving monitoring technology and the safety of general anesthesia for such patients. ""Anesthesiologists know well that the management of patients age 60 or older requires different approaches than for younger patients,"" says Emery Brown, MD, PhD, of the MGH Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine. ""The doses required to achieve the same anesthetic state in older patients can be as little as half what is needed for younger patients. Explanations for that difference have focused on age-related declines in cardiovascular, respiratory, liver and kidney function, but the primary sites of anesthetic effects are the brain and central nervous system."" Patrick Purdon, PhD, also of the MGH Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, adds, ""We know even less about how anesthetic drugs influence brain activity in children, and the current standard of care for assessing the brain state of children under anesthesia calls only for monitoring vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure. This lack of knowledge is especially troubling, given recent studies suggesting an association between early childhood surgery requiring general anesthesia and later cognitive problems."" Brown and Purdon lead an MGH research team investigating the neural mechanisms of general anesthesia that in recent years has identified EEG signatures indicating when patients lose and regain consciousness and the EEG patterns - called oscillations - produced by specific drugs while patients are unconscious. In young adults, anesthesia-induced unconsciousness is associated with medium frequency (around 10 Hz) EEG oscillations called frontal alpha waves that are highly synchronized between the cerebral cortex and thalamus, a pattern that is believed to block communication between those brain structures. Two papers from the MGH team recently published in the British Journal of An sthesia are the first to take a detailed look at anesthesia-induced brain changes in older patients. Purdon and Brown are co-corresponding authors of one study that analyzed detailed EEG recordings of 155 patients aged 18 to 90 receiving either propofol or sevoflurane. That study found that the EEG oscillations of older patients were two to three times smaller than those of younger adults with reduced occurrence of frontal alpha waves. The synchronization between the cortex and thalamus occurred at slightly lower frequencies in older patients, who were more likely than younger patients to experience a state called burst suppression that reflects profoundly deep anesthesia at lower doses. The other BJA study, led by MGH anesthesiologist Ken Solt, MD, found that older animals took two to five times longer than younger animals to recover from equal anesthetic doses and observed similar age-related differences in EEG patterns as seen in the patients. Another study appearing in the same issue of BJA - co-corresponding authors Purdon and Oluwaseun Akeju, MD, MGH Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine - analyzed EEG patterns of 54 patients ranging from infancy through age 28 during anesthesia with sevoflurane. They found that anesthesia-induced EEG signals tripled in power from infancy until around age 6 and then dropped off to the typical young adult level at around age 20. Frontal alpha waves were not observed in children under the age of 1, suggesting that the brain circuits required for cortical/thalamic synchronization had not yet developed. Purdon and Brown were also co-authors of an eLife study led by Boston Children's Hospital investigators Laura Cornelissen, PhD, and Charles Berde, MD, PhD, that detailed the EEG activity of infants 6 months and younger, showing how their patterns evolved toward those more typical of adults over just a few months. ""It appears as though the structure of anesthesia-induced brain dynamics mirrors brain development in children, with different brain wave patterns 'turning on' at ages that coincide with known developmental milestones,"" says Purdon. ""In older patients we see a similar effect but in reverse, with certain brain waves decaying in a manner consistent with brain aging. It's been known that commercially available EEG-based anesthesia monitors were developed for young adults, and while they are limited for that population - reducing brain activity to a single number - they are even more inaccurate for children and the elderly. These studies illustrate why this is the case and suggest a new, age-specific monitoring paradigm that - along with monitors that track a broader range of EEG signals - could help avoid both anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in children and post-operative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients."" Brown adds, ""Understanding how the brain's responses to anesthesia change with age allows us to provide personalized, patient-specific strategies for monitoring the brain and dosing the anesthetics, thereby moving us closer to side-effect free anesthesia care.""

Grammar: Eventually the brain opts for the easy route Languages are constantly evolving   and grammar is no exception. The way in which the brain processes language triggers adjustments. If the brain has to exert itself too much to cope with difficult case constructions, it usually simplifies them over time, as linguists from the University of Zurich demonstrate in a study on languages all over the world.   New study reveals Tetris can block cravings Playing Tetris for as little as three minutes at a time can weaken cravings for drugs, food and activities such as sex and sleeping by approximately one fifth, according to new research. In the first test of its kind to study people in natural settings outside of a laboratory, participants were monitored for levels of craving and prompted to play the block-shifting puzzle game at random intervals during the day.   New research sheds light on the molecular origins of Parkinson s disease As Parkinson s disease progresses in patients, a puzzling dichotomy plays out in their brains. One set of neurons degenerates, while a similar population nearby is spared the same degree of damage. Why the difference? An answer to this question could clear the way for preventions and treatments for this disease. Using a new strategy they have devised to identify the molecular changes that drive the loss of neurons, researchers at The Rockefeller University and colleagues at Columbia University have identified two proteins they report may be important to Parkinson s.   Receptors in brain linked to schizophrenia, autism The loss of a critical receptor in a special class of inhibitory neurons in the brain may be responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and schizophrenia, according to new research by Salk Institute scientists. The importance of the receptor, called mGluR5, in other areas of the brain had been previously established. Until now, however, no one had studied their specific role in a cell type known as parvalbumin-positive interneurons, thought to be important in general cognition and generating certain types of oscillatory wave patterns in the brain.   Study suggests potential new pathway to target for treating ALS Cells are powered by tiny energy reactors called mitochondria. When damaged, they leak destructive molecules that can cause substantial harm and eventually kill brain cells. Scientists at the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke showed that a protein called PINK1 that is implicated in Parkinson s disease is critical for helping cells get rid of dysfunctional mitochondria. According to the new research, published in the journal Nature, PINK1 does this by triggering an intricate process called mitophagy that breaks down and removes damaged mitochondria from the cell.","Published: August 14, 2015"

The clock s mechanism, it turns out, is much like a light switch. In a study of brain circadian neurons that govern the daily sleep-wake cycle s timing, Allada and his research team found that high sodium channel activity in these neurons during the day turn the cells on and ultimately awaken an animal, and high potassium channel activity at night turn them off, allowing the animal to sleep. Investigating further, the researchers were surprised to discover the same sleep-wake switch in both flies and mice.  This suggests the underlying mechanism controlling our sleep-wake cycle is ancient,  said Allada, professor and chair of neurobiology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He is the senior author of the study.  This oscillation mechanism appears to be conserved across several hundred million years of evolution. And if it s in the mouse, it is likely in humans, too.  Better understanding of this mechanism could lead to new drug targets to address sleep-wake trouble related to jet lag, shift work and other clock-induced problems. Eventually, it might be possible to reset a person s internal clock to suit his or her situation. The researchers call this a  bicycle  mechanism: two pedals that go up and down across a 24-hour day, conveying important time information to the neurons. That the researchers found the two pedals -- a sodium current and potassium currents -- active in both the simple fruit fly and the more complex mouse was unexpected. The findings are published in the journal Cell.  What is amazing is finding the same mechanism for sleep-wake cycle control in an insect and a mammal,  said Matthieu Flourakis, the lead author of the study.  Mice are nocturnal, and flies are diurnal, or active during the day, but their sleep-wake cycles are controlled in the same way.  When he joined Allada s team, Flourakis had wondered if the activity of the fruit fly s circadian neurons changed with the time of day. With the help of Indira M. Raman, the Bill and Gayle Cook Professor in the department of neurobiology, he found very strong rhythms: The neurons fired a lot in the morning and very little in the evening. The researchers next wanted to learn why. That s when they discovered that when sodium current is high, the neurons fire more, awakening the animal, and when potassium current is high, the neurons quiet down, causing the animal to slumber. The balance between sodium and potassium currents controls the animal s circadian rhythms. Flourakis, Allada and their colleagues then wondered if such a process was present in an animal closer to humans. They studied a small region of the mouse brain that controls the animal s circadian rhythms -- the suprachiasmatic nucleus, made up of 20,000 neurons -- and found the same mechanism there.  Our starting point for this research was mutant flies missing a sodium channel who walked in a halting manner and had poor circadian rhythms,  Allada said.  It took a long time, but we were able to pull everything -- genomics, genetics, behavior studies and electrical measurements of neuron activity -- together in this paper, in a study of two species.  Now, of course, we have more questions about what s regulating this sleep-wake pathway, so there is more work to be done,  he said.

The study, led by the University of Leeds and Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, is published today in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.  It sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of learning and memory and could form the basis for research into new treatments for age-related cognitive decline, cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer s disease and schizophrenia, and other conditions. The researchers altered a gene in mice to inhibit the activity of an enzyme called phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B), which is present in many organs of the vertebrate body, including the brain. In behavioral tests, the PDE4B-inhibited mice showed enhanced cognitive abilities. They tended to learn faster, remember events longer and solve complex exercises better than ordinary mice. For example, the  brainy mice  showed a better ability than ordinary mice to recognize another mouse that they had been introduced to the day before. They were also quicker at learning the location of a hidden escape platform in a test called the Morris water maze. However, the PDE4B-inhibited mice also showed less recall of a fearful event after several days than ordinary mice. The published findings are limited to mice and have not been tested in humans, but PDE4B is present in humans. The diminished memory of fear among mice with inhibited PDE4B could be of interest to researchers looking for treatments for pathological fear, typified by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) The PDE4B-inhibited mice also showed less anxiety. They spent more time in open, brightly-lit spaces than ordinary mice, which preferred dark, enclosed spaces. Ordinary mice are naturally fearful of cats, but the PDE4B-inhibited mice showed a decreased fear response to cat urine, suggesting that one effect of inhibiting PDE4B could be an increase in risk-taking behavior. So, while the PDE4B-inhibited mice excelled at solving complex exercises, their low levels of anxiety could be counterproductive for a wild mouse. Dr Steve Clapcote, Lecturer in Pharmacology in the University of Leeds  School of Biomedical Sciences, led the study. He said:  Cognitive impairments are currently poorly treated, so I m excited that our work using mice has identified phosphodiesterase-4B as a promising target for potential new treatments . The researchers are now working on developing drugs that will specifically inhibit PDE4B. These drugs will be tested in animals to see whether any would be suitable for clinical trials in humans. Dr Alexander McGirr, a psychiatrist in training at the University of British Columbia, who co-led the study, said: """"In the future, medicines targeting PDE4B may potentially improve the lives of individuals with neurocognitive disorders and life-impairing anxiety, and they may have a time-limited role after traumatic events.  Dr Laura Phipps of Alzheimer s Research UK, who were not involved in the study, said:  This study highlights a potentially important role for the PDE4B gene in learning and memory in mice, but further studies will be needed to know whether the findings could have implications for Alzheimer s disease or other dementias. We d need to see how this gene could influence memory and thinking in people to get a better idea of whether it could hold potential as a target to treat Alzheimer s.  There is currently a lack of effective treatments for dementia and understanding the effect of genes can be a key early step on the road to developing new drugs. With so many people affected by dementia, it is important that there is research into a wide array of treatment approaches to have the best chance of helping people sooner.

These trespassers engage in fervent courtship and mating atop ripe fruits, and the sex is anything but casual. In particular, male flies are very precise in choosing whom to court--a complex and intuitive decision that has fascinated scientists for more than a century. Now, a team of Rockefeller University researchers has explored in detail how the wiring of the male fly brain enables him to assess the suitability of a potential partner and instinctively decide whether to pursue or abandon her. In a recent study, they traced the neural circuits that convey signals from a fly's sense organs into higher brain areas and make him able to integrate different features of a potential partner. The research published in Neuron offers new glimpses into the biological basis of decision making. Before an ardent male Drosophila starts courting a female, he taps her with his front leg. ""This allows him to taste the pheromones she carries on her waxy cuticle and thereby tell whether she's appropriate and likely to be receptive to his courtship advances,"" explains senior author Vanessa Ruta, Gabrielle H. Reem and Herbert J. Kayden Assistant Professor and head of the Laboratory of Neurophysiology and Behavior. If the female passes the test, the male starts trotting after her with one wing off to his side, and by vibrating the wing he sings her a courtship song. Soon after if the object of his serenade allows it he mounts her to couple. Earlier research has shown that a type of brain cell called a P1 neuron plays an important role in the male fly's courtship decision. Until now, however, scientists knew little about how this cell population receives different types of sensory information and integrates it to produce a behavioral switch. In their current study, the researchers show that P1 neurons receive input from at least three other nerve cell groups that transmit different--and sometimes contradictory--inputs. On the one hand, if the male tastes certain pheromones on the female, his arousal is triggered. On the other hand, he may simultaneously receive off-putting odor or taste signals from the female if she has mated before or belongs to a different species (or even if it turns out that the alleged female in fact is a male, which can happen). ""The beautiful thing about this system is that P1 neurons integrate all this different information, both taste and smell,"" Ruta says. ""Some information is exciting, some is suppressing, and his brain can combine it to form a behavioral choice."" In one set of experiments, the researchers introduced male Drosophila to different potential partners, and monitored the activation of their P1 neurons under the microscope. ""We brought in appropriate females as well as ones that had mated before, other males, and females of different Drosophila subspecies,"" says postdoctoral fellow Josie Clowney, the study's first author. ""He will only court virgin females of his own species, and it's very clear just from looking at the activity of the P1 neurons that he can tell who to mate with by both tasting and smelling the other fly."" The researchers observed that the P1 neurons get activated only when the male tastes and smells a female that carry the correct pheromones. They then mapped the neural pathways that bring taste and smell signals into the fly's brain, and found that these circuits come together and are integrated by P1 neurons themselves. Ruta notes that research into Drosophila courtship behavior can provide important clues about how the human brain functions. ""Though the Drosophila brain is a lot simpler than ours, there are basic similarities,"" she says. ""We are constantly making decisions after evaluating and weighing different sensory signals in the environment, some of them conflicting. The sign at a crosswalk on the corner says 'walk' but we see a cab barreling through--do we proceed or do we stay? ""By peering into the workings of the simpler fly brain,"" Ruta adds, ""we hope to better understand the basic architecture of neural circuits that integrate and assess different sensory information.""

In addition, the high potency of vitamin E-conjugated HDO results in a reduction of liver dysfunction. HDO technology was expected as basic technology of molecular targeted therapy.  Two major types of RNA targeting oligonucleotide drugs are currently being developed as therapeutic platforms for reduction of target gene expression; short interfering RNA (siRNA) and RNase H dependent antisense oligonucleotides (ASO).  says corresponding author Takanori Yokota, MD, PhD, professor of department of Neurology and Neurological Science at Tokyo Medical and Dental University.Like any medical drugs, despite progress in the design of oligonucleotides, methods which further increase potency of oligonucleotide drugs and improve safety and tolerability are highly desirable. The insufficient delivery, poor cellular uptake of oligonucleotides and their inefficient access to target RNA are major impediments to in vivo silencing. Then Yokota and colleagues developed a novel short DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO).  HDO has a structure different from double-stranded RNA used for siRNA and single-stranded DNA used for ASO, and different functional molecular mechanisms from siRNA or ASO in the cells.  says Yokota. HDO is composed of DNA/locked nucleic acid (LNA) gapmer as ASO and its complementary RNA (cRNA).  When  -tocopherol (vitamin E) as drug delivery moiety conjugated to ASO directly, its silencing effect is reduced because conjugated lipid interfers the mechanisms of ASO. On the other hand,  Yokota says,  When  -tocopherol is conjugated to cRNA of HDO, and  -tocopherol can improve delivery of HDO to the liver by five times, and making the gapmer DNA strand active by its release from HDO due to cleavage of cRNA by cellular nuclease (figure)  Toc-HDO is significantly more potent at reducing the target messenger RNA compared to the parent ASO. The first author, Dr. Nishina measured the Effective Dose 50 (ED50) which means the dose required 50% reduction of target gene, Toc-HDO targeting Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) mRNA (ED50, 0.038 mg/kg) was 22.2 times more potent than the parent ASO (ED50, 0.841 mg/kg) in liver. In addition to lowering ApoB mRNA the Toc-HDO can reduce serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the pharmacological effects lasted more than one month at a 0.75 mg/kg of Toc-HDO injection only, not at ASO injection.  A significant improvement in activity is also observed when targeting another gene in the liver. In addition,  Yokota says,  the Toc-HDO using another chemically modified nucleic acid instead of LNA in the wing portion of DNA strand also showed a similarly enhanced potency. HDO technique can applied to any ASO previously reported. Furthermore, the highly potent of the suppression of the target messenger RNA is observed not only rodent but also non-human primate.  Mipomersen, the first oligonucleotide drug, was approved by FDA, but not by EU due to liver toxicity.  The high potency of Toc-HDO results in a reduction of liver dysfunction observed in the parent ASO at same silencing effect.  Yokota says,  probably due to much less administered dose of nucleotide.  These results suggest that DNA/RNA heteroduplex can be the basic technology of the oligonucleotide drug, and opens up a new horizon for human gene therapy as a novel class of oligonucleotide drugs. Yokota says  Our team is currently investigating more detailed mechanisms of the HDO and application of ligand-conjugated HDO to another organs, including brain. ","Published: August 14, 2015"

They go through a multistage process to produce infectious particles. The viruses that are released from infected cells are initially in an immature state and are composed of an RNA genome surrounded by a coat of protein. Upon their release, the viruses undergo a maturation process that rearranges the viral proteins and activates the conversion of the RNA genome into DNA through a process called reverse transcription. The viral DNA then invades the host cell s genome. The infected cell is programmed to release multiple copies of the immature virus into the host s bloodstream. These newly released viruses must in turn mature before they can infect other cells. Not only do retroviruses cause life-long infections, but also in the complex process of reverse-transcribing RNA into DNA, many mutations can occur, making the retrovirus even more difficult to target. One strategy for preventing the spread of a retrovirus is to lock the viral particles in their immature, non-infectious state. Unfortunately, the complexity and size of the viral particle an irregular and incomplete hexagonal shell of close to 100 nanometers in size have prevented the experimental determination of the atomic-level structure of the particle.A number of studies have examined the structure of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), which affects birds and provides a good model for other retroviruses, but none have been able to provide a high-resolution look at the immature stage of the virus. Over a period of two years, researchers have been performing calculations and simulations in order to reveal the structural features of the virus. With the help of the Titan supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility in Tennessee and the Blue Waters supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at Illinois, the researchers were the first to provide the atomic-level structural model of the immature retroviral lattice of RSV. A five-microsecond simulation describing the motion of half a million atoms involves a hefty calculation that took five days using 30 percent of the Titan supercomputer, more than 5,000 computing nodes each node is equivalent to a high-end workstation.  We have had a pretty good understanding of the mature infectious particle at a level where we can make specific predictions about the local chemical interactions between the protein subunits in the virus,  said Rebecca Craven, professor of microbiology and immunology and at Penn State University and one of the study s authors.  But the field was really lacking similar high-resolution knowledge about the immature virus. This new model is the first to give us an atomic-level look at the immature state. With that knowledge we can try to understand the precise molecular mechanisms of virus maturation and help to elucidate how drugs can be designed to interfere with that.  According to Boon Chong Goh, a graduate student in physics at Illinois and lead author on the study, a six-helix bundle domain located on the inside surface of the immature protein shell could be a key to understanding and blocking the virus.  Recent advances in cryo-electron tomography allow us to model the majority of the immature retroviral lattice, except the six-helix bundle domain,  said Goh.  Experimentalists do not have a clear view of that domain because of its high flexibility. And that s where we come in. Using advanced computational techniques and supercomputers, we modeled and refined an all-atom model of the six-helix bundle.  The researchers believe that the six-helix bundle is amphipathic, a chemical property that possesses an affinity for both water and fat, and that it is enclosed by a ring of salt bridges, contributing to the stability of the bundle.  HIV is a close relative to RSV, and HIV is also known to have this domain, which has been a drug target for years. A drug named Bevirimat (BVM) was developed to target the six-helix bundle of immature HIV, but it did not pass the clinical trials,  said Goh.  The experience with BVM did show that inhibitors that target the six helix bundle domain can be very powerful HIV anti-retroviral drugs by preventing virus maturation,  said Craven.   The main idea is that you have two forms of the virus: the immature and the mature,  said Juan Perilla, postdoctoral researcher and co-first author of the study.  The immature is not infectious, so the idea is that ultimately you want to prevent it from becoming the mature form. The problem is that BVM targets the six-helix bundle domain, but no one really knows the structure of the immature lattice in HIV. There are a few models, but they are not high resolution, so we decided to work in this direction and we picked RSV because it s a good model to study the virus. Our next step is to go to HIV.   This result is an example of where computational methodology is really complementing medical lab experiments,  said Klaus Schulten, director of the TCBG and professor of physics. According to Schulten, computational experiments can help provide solutions to complex problems in the laboratory.  The living world is made of molecules and you need to know this world. Sometimes you just do it through trial and error in a chemical research lab and you see that a newly designed drug molecule has a certain effect that often you only understand later. But then there is, of course, a more systematic way of resolving the molecular world, namely the computational way taken in our RSV study, and one can derive medical treatments from the knowledge reached computationally,  Schulten explained.

The study, which was led by TSRI Professor Ben Shen, was recently released online ahead of print.   We found a novel mechanism to incorporate sulfur into natural products, which is unprecedented,  Shen said.  Until our study, we didn t really know how sulfur atoms are incorporated into a natural product now we have discovered a new family of enzymes and have a workable mechanism to account for sulfur incorporation into a larger class of natural products, known as polyketides, that include many drugs such as erythromycin (antibacterial) and lovastatin (cholesterol lowering).  Sulfur is critical not only to human life, but to plants and bacteria as well, and is one of the most abundant elements in the human body by weight. A number of compounds that contain sulfur have proven useful in the treatment of conditions ranging from acne and eczema to arthritis and cancer. The new study is focused on leinamycin (LNM), a sulfur-containing antitumor antibiotic produced by species of the soil-dwelling bacterium Streptomyces. The Shen laboratory has been studying the potential of this natural compound for development of anticancer drugs. They recently reported the discovery of LNM E1, an engineered analogue of LNM, as a  prodrug,  a medication converted through a metabolic process in the body to become an active therapy (see  Scripps Florida Scientists Show Antitumor Agent Can Be Activated by Natural Response to Cell Stress ).  With LNM, sulfur plays the critical role in its anticancer activity,  Shen said.  With many other natural products, sulfur could add other therapeutic properties. This is the beauty of fundamental research it lays the foundation to create novel technologies that enable innovative translational research with implications far beyond the original discovery.  The study links a family of enzymes molecules that act as biological catalysts known as polyketide synthases (PKS) directly to a complex series of chemical reactions that ultimately add sulfur to leinamycin, a member of the polyketide family of natural products.    The sulfur incorporation mechanism discovered in our study revealed the novel function of a polyketide synthase, greatly expanding our understanding of its chemistry,  said TSRI's Ming Ma, a co-first author of the study with Jeremy R. Lohman of TSRI and Tao Liu of the University of Wisconsin, current and former members of the Shen lab.  Since polyketide synthases are a large family of enzymes that have been proven amenable for polyketide structural diversity and drug discovery, it is particularly exciting that this new discovery now provides the possibilities of adding sulfur atoms to compounds similar to leinamycin or other polyketide natural products.  Because few sulfur-containing natural products are known, this particular enzyme and its gene could now be useful tools to probe ecological niches for the discovery of other sulfur-containing natural products.","Published: August 14, 2015"

The plan places emphasis on research support in areas including engineered biotechnology, biotherapeutics and environmental chemistry; leveraging massive datasets to accelerate development of new products; and work in advanced materials development and advanced manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing. The newly released 5-year strategic plan for NIST s Material Measurement Laboratory, says laboratory director Laurie Locascio, reflects the realities of today s research frontiers in chemistry, biology and materials science.  In both medicine and manufacturing, for example,  Locascio says,  we re seeing a growing importance in biologically derived materials such as custom designed proteins. Existing measurement technologies are inadequate for properly characterizing these materials or reliably controlling their manufacture.  Or consider the entire Materials Genome Initiative. The old trial-and-error methods for developing new materials for industry are giving way to a more rational, more efficient materials-by-design approach. But that depends critically on having good, reliable data and well-tested models.  The plan outlines a broad research agenda for measurement science in biology, chemistry and materials science, and new initiatives for NIST s widely used standard reference materials and standard data products, as well as organizational goals for internal management and strategic partnering. The document is principally aimed at the laboratory s research peers and stakeholders.

But according to a study at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, an unexpected discovery suggests intriguing new avenues both for basic biological research and for therapeutic interventions to fight asthma. The findings could also have important ramifications for research in other areas, notably cancer, where the same kinds of cells play a major role.Until now, scientists thought that epithelial cells   which line not only the lung s airways but major cavities of the body and most organs   just sat there motionless, like tiles covering a floor or cars jammed in traffic, said Jeffrey Fredberg, professor of bioengineering and physiology at the Harvard Chan School and one of the senior authors of the study. But the study showed that, in asthma, the opposite is true. The physics of biology The researchers decided to look at the detailed shape and movement of cells from the asthmatic airway because, according to Fredberg, a growing body of research is showing that physical forces change how cells form, grow, and behave. Given this knowledge   and the fact that no one knows what causes asthma, which afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide   it made sense to look at the shape and movement of epithelial cells, which many scientists think play a key role in the disease. The study included lead authors Jin-Ah Park and Jae Hun Kim, research scientists in the Department of Environmental Health who study asthma, andJeffrey M. Drazen, a pulmonologist and professor in the department, who studies  mechanotransduction  in asthma   how the bronchial constriction of asthma might trigger cell changes in the epithelium. The study also included mathematical physicists James Butler, senior lecturer on physiology in the Department of Environmental Health, and M. Lisa Manning and Max Bi at Syracuse University, as well as colleagues from the Harvard Chan School and other Harvard institutions. Asthma cells on the move To analyze cell movement, the researchers took time-lapse images of epithelial cells. They also produced videos that show quite vividly the differences between normal cells and asthmatic cells. The videos show that the normal cells are nearly pentagon-shaped and are jammed   they hardly move at all   while the asthmatic cells become more spindle-shaped and constantly move and swirl without jamming. To analyze the mechanical forces at work, the researchers placed layers of epithelial cells   from either normal airways or asthmatic airways   on a soft gel surface that simulated the degree of stiffness of the lung. As the cells moved, their push-pull motion caused the gel to move as well. This gel s movement enabled the researchers to infer the mechanical forces at work among the cells. Next steps Now that it s known that epithelial cells in asthmatic airways are oddly shaped and not jammed, scientists have to figure out why it s happening   whether asthma causes the cells to unjam, or the unjamming of the cells causes asthma.  It s a very big question to figure out why this particular cell shape and movement is happening,  said Park.  We know that asthma is related to genes, environment, and the interaction between the two, but asthma remains poorly understood.  Whatever the reason, knowing more about how these cells jam and unjam is important, said Fredberg, because epithelial cells play a prominent role not just in asthma, but in all processes involving cell growth and movement, including organ development, wound healing, and, importantly, cancer. The findings open the door to new possibilities for developing drugs to fight asthma as well as other diseases   and to new research questions.  Trying to define how cells behave, how they exert forces on each other, and how that changes what they do are big open questions,  said Fredberg.  Researchers all over the world are looking more and more at these questions. It s very exciting. ","Published: August 14, 2015"

It is most commonly associated with handling cat feaces and is a particular threat to pregnant women and immune-compromised individuals, such as HIV/AIDS patients It may even be implicated in mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and depression. Toxoplasma has an unusual ability infect any warm-blooded animal cell, from immune cells to brain and muscle cells.A study led by researchers at the University of Melbourne s Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute has shown, for the first time, the extraordinary capacity of Toxoplasma to infect and grow within these cells, is due to its very broad culinary tastes Scavenging nutrients, such as glucose, from the host cell is one of the biggest challenges that microbial pathogens face. Lead author Martin Blume and colleagues demonstrated that Toxoplasma is able to steal and utilize a range of energy-rich nutrients from the host cell, allowing it to adapt to different host cell niches.  Unlike other pathogens that tend to only use one nutrient at a time, Toxoplasma gondii, can use multiple nutrients at the same time. This may give these parasites enormous flexibility as well as the ability to grow in a range of different host cell types,  explains Professor Malcolm McConville, senior author and Director, Bio21 Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. While being adaptable is good, it comes at the cost of having to make all of the enzymes need to metabolise these nutrients all of the time, an apparently wasteful exercise. However, the researchers have shown that Toxoplasma has repurposed some of these enzymes so that they improve nutrient catabolism regardless of the nutrient being used. Toxoplasma has managed to tweak its metabolism in a way that allows it to be both more adaptable and more efficient, allowing it to colonize a new animal or human host and grow very rapidly. This survival advantage may also turn out to be its Achilles  Heel. The researchers show that at least one of the enzymes that is switched on all of the time, TgFBP2, is also needed all of the time even when parasites are using nutrients that are not normally catabolized by the enzyme. When the function of TgFBP2 is blocked, Toxoplasma is no longer infective. This new insight makes it possible to develop drugs that specifically target and block TgFBP2 and prevent acute Toxoplasma infection.  ","Published: August 14, 2015"

Therefore, there is concern that the emissions of carbon dioxide from streams and rivers may increase due to climate change, accelerating the growth of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Where the carbon dioxide comes from has been a source of debate among researchers over the past decade. Small streams receive water from the surrounding land, and the most accepted idea has been that the carbon dioxide emitted from streams is exported from the land adjacent to the stream. Now a research team from Ume  University, in collaboration with researchers at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and in the US (at the University of Wyoming and University of Washington), has shown that a significant part comes from the respiration of organisms living in the streams and rivers. Even fungi and bacteria have to breathe, and when they do, through the degradation of terrestrial organic carbon, they release carbon dioxide, which makes up about 30 percent of all carbon dioxide released from streams and rivers , explains Erin Hotchkiss, a researcher at the Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Ume  University. The research team has estimated how much of the carbon dioxide is released by respiration, from the smallest creeks to the Mississippi River in the continental United States. They show that respiration supports carbon dioxide emissions in even the smallest streams, but also that the role of respiration increases with stream and river size. That significant amounts come from respiratory processes means that the decomposition of terrestrial organic carbon in running waters may be higher than previously thought.  Streams and rivers are not only passive conduits of water and terrestrial carbon dioxide, but also function as reactors that generate and release carbon dioxide during transport downstream , said Erin Hotchkiss. To understand the mechanisms behind the production of carbon dioxide in running waters is essential. It increases the ability to predict how changes in land use or climate warming could affect the sources and global concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  It is very important to know the sources of carbon dioxide in running waters as well as the processes controlling respiration and emissions if we are to understand what happens when the environment changes , says Erin Hotchkiss, researcher at Ume  University.","Published: August 14, 2015"

McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and principal investigator of the work. The article reported the first general C-O cross-coupling reaction, which connects ring-shaped molecules, called aromatics, to alcohol-containing molecules, using a dual nickel-photoredox catalyst system. Extending nickel s reach to C-O coupling reactions has great potential given the tremendous impact nickel chemistry has had on analogous C-C coupling reactions. For the most part, these C-O cross-coupling reactions have been unattainable by traditional nickel catalysis. That s because the final bonding-forming step called reductive elimination in which nickel excises itself to leave behind a C-O bond, is fundamentally unfavorable. By introducing a photocatalyst, the research team was able to remove a single electron from the key nickel intermediate to access an elusive oxidation state of nickel that can readily form the desired bond.Using a photocatalyst to effectively expand the possible oxidation states of nickel has significant implications beyond this specific transformation.  We assume that it s not just nickel chemistry that you can dramatically change, but other metals as well,  MacMillan said.  That s very exciting position to be in.  To confirm their understanding of how the catalysts worked together to promote the reaction, Valerie Shurtleff, a graduate student in the MacMillan lab and co-author on the paper, performed a series of mechanistic experiments. Shurtleff synthesized a model nickel complex that mimicked the key bond-forming intermediate, a nickel compound bridging the two coupling partners. She found that without the presence of both light and photocatalyst, the complex was unable to form the product. Further electrochemical experiments confirmed that the model nickel complex was well within the range of molecules with which the photocatalyst could theoretically interact. The new nickel-photocatalyst combination also offers a mild alternative to similar existing methods that employ palladium or copper catalysts and can access complementary coupling partners. The MacMillan group has made many major contributions in the area of photoredox catalysis, but has only recently begun discovering the possibilities that arise from combining photoredox with other forms of catalysis, such as nickel.  There are so many different avenues to explore,  Shurtleff said,  we re really just getting started. ","Published: August 14, 2015"

And many of the common reagents they use sit for months or years on shelves in laboratories, where they can react with oxygen and water in the atmosphere, rendering them useless.  Researchers at MIT describe a technique that could help avoid this costly waste, and greatly reduce the number of steps a chemist must perform to prepare common compounds for use in a wide range of chemical transformations. Aaron C. Sather, the lead author of the paper, is a postdoc in the lab of Stephen Buchwald, the Camille Dreyfus Professor in Chemistry. He and his colleagues have harnessed the power of a small, simple technology that could transform the benchtop practice of organic chemistry: the capsule. Some labs use what is known as a  glove box,  an inert container that permits researchers to manipulate reagents in a controlled environment, isolated from the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water in ambient air. But many laboratories in industry and academia don t have glove boxes because they re expensive to maintain, and take up precious space, Sather says. As a result, many chemists avoid performing certain useful, but complicated, reactions because they require a glove box. Many reagents and catalysts aren t used simply because of this inconvenience. What s more, for a bench chemist working in materials science or pharmaceuticals, performing the complex sequence of steps to prepare certain compounds may be unfamiliar and onerous.    If you can grab the reagents off the shelf and get the reaction to work without that expertise or a glove box, it s much more accessible,  Sather says. Paraffin delivery vehicles Building on previous work by Douglass Taber at the University of Delaware, the researchers tried to disperse mixtures of reagents in molten paraffin wax, which has been demonstrated to protect oxygen- and water-sensitive compounds for long periods of time. But as the material cooled, certain dense reagents, such as cesium fluoride, would settle to the bottom. The scientists then decided to try making small capsules out of paraffin, enabling precise estimates of the contents for grab-and-go use.  We thought, if we could enclose multiple reagents [and] catalysts in some way and actually know how much we put in,  Sather says,  we could dramatically simplify chemical synthesis with these single-use capsules. Paraffin s physical properties make it ideal as a delivery vehicle for all kinds of chemical compounds.  We wanted something that was inert, a long-chain hydrocarbon,  Sather says,  that would have no competing side reactions with both catalyst and reagents. It s largely unreactive. Paraffin is insanely cheap, and nice and easy to work with. Paraffin doesn t pick up any water   it s just like grease.  Upon heating, the paraffin capsule melts/dissolves in the reaction solvent, releasing its contents. After the reaction is finished, the paraffin can then be removed through precipitation, filtration, and chromatography. Sather and co-authors Hong Geun Lee and James Colombe made the capsules by hand, using a glass stir rod to make the hollow shells. Then they filled them with dry reagents, and used a hot metal spatula to melt the wax and seal it off. The resulting capsules look like slightly bigger versions of the gelcaps sold over the counter at any drug store. The team applied the paraffin capsule technology to a variety of reactions, focusing on combinations that are of broad applicability and interest across different fields, from making sensors to making pharmaceuticals. As an example, the researchers combined an oxygen-sensitive catalyst with cesium fluoride in capsules. They performed the same reactions using these capsules, and then in a glove box, and achieved similar results for both approaches. A radically simplified process Ironically, in order to prepare this  glove box-free  system, the group had to use a glove box to actually make the capsules. But the whole production process could easily be mechanized, Sather says, creating a low-cost, widely accessible alternative to glove boxes. Companies could sell hollow capsules for chemists to load themselves, or sell them pre-measured and pre-loaded. Once they were made, the capsules dramatically simplified the benchtop chemistry.  Instead of weighing out multiple reagents and catalysts, you re adding a capsule and weighing out one or two compounds,  Sather points out.  It s really quick, especially for people who want to make a lot of molecules.  The capsules also proved to be durable. The researchers took capsules filled with cesium fluoride   which is very water-sensitive   and immersed them in water overnight. The next day they took them out, dried them off with a paper towel and used them in a reaction.  The result was the same,  Sather says.  It told us that they re completely sealed. In terms of protecting water-sensitive compounds inside these capsules, the potential is huge.  Sather says wider use of this technique could greatly extend the shelf life of common commodity chemicals. To demonstrate this, he and his colleagues prepared capsules containing multiple base-activated catalysts, along with strong bases, all mixed together in the solid state.  They were still good after eight months on the benchtop, mixed together inside the capsule,  Sather says.  There was no decomposition. And they weren t stored in any special way   just put in a plastic bin.  The researchers had similar success in an experiment conducted with a reagent that would degrade in hours if exposed to air; after more than a year of storage on the shelf in capsule form, there was no degradation. Sather is most excited by the potential for this technology to make the work of chemists more efficient, and to widen access to demanding but useful reactions by overcoming the inconvenience and tedium associated with glove boxes.  With all of the reactions we develop in this lab,  Sather says,  we keep the practitioner in mind. If it s really hard to do, no one s going to use it. We really want people to use the chemistry we work so hard to develop.  Phil Baran, a professor of chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute who was not involved in the study, compares the work to the breakthrough in the early 1800s that allowed the delivery of drugs in pill form. Baran observes that this development  opens up many new venues for both reactivity exploration in academic settings and in the many areas of industrial science that require rapid diversification and automation. Thus, as more catalysts and reagents become available as capsules, the influence of this approach will likely be seen in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and material industries. It may not be too unrealistic to predict that Buchwald s capsules will do for organic chemistry what   pills did for medicine. ","Published: August 14, 2015"

""This finding opens up exciting opportunities to potentially treat obesity without the need for invasive surgery.""The researchers used zebrafish and human cells to test the effect of the Endocannabinoid system (an active compound of cannabis which plays a role in appetite regulation and fat formation) and the Retinoic Acid Pathway (an active component of vitamin A) on reducing the deposit of fat. ""The complementary actions of the Endocannabinoid system and Retinoic Acid Pathway in reducing fat deposits have the potential to treat obesity in a safer and more effective way than if they were used independently,"" Dr Gibert said. ""This approach only focusses on fat, and avoids effects on the brain, which has been a concern in previous research involving cannabis.""

His research has found a way to potentially remove these side effects by using the two systems in combination, and at a lower dosage. While this study has demonstrated that these two pathways can work together during fat accumulation, the way this happens is unclear.

Pulmonary hypertension occurs when blood vessels in the lung constrict and become stiffer, putting a strain on the heart as it tries to pump blood through the lungs. It can be brought on at high altitudes due to a lack of oxygen in the air, but there are also more severe forms of the condition, including PAH, with around 6,500 people diagnosed with PAH in the UK in total. PAH is chronic and debilitating and leads to heart failure. PAH leaves sufferers feeling breathless and exhausted. Current treatments target only the symptoms and prognosis is very poor. Once diagnosed with PAH, a person has a 30 per cent chance of dying within three years. The research team, led by Professor Martin Wilkins and Dr Lan Zhao from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, have identified a gene that is switched on in the blood vessels of the lung in pulmonary hypertension. Disabling this gene helps protect against pulmonary hypertension in low oxygen conditions. The team believe this provides a clue for a new treatment approach to PAH. The gene was first identified in a type of rat that is resistant to developing pulmonary hypertension in a low oxygen atmosphere. It is responsible for producing a protein called ZIP12, which regulates zinc levels in cells. It is not active in normal lungs but is switched on in the lungs of people with PAH and other types of pulmonary hypertension. Specialists from the Medical Research Council's Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC) helped to generate the rats in which the important transporter ZIP12 was missing. This was critical in identifying the gene that was important, and is the first time that rats of this kind have been generated at Imperial College. Treatments currently available for PAH can offer some relief but they do not tackle the cause of the disease. By developing drugs that can act on the ZIP12 protein it may now be possible to reverse or delay the progression of the disease. These drugs may also provide protection against PAH in people at risk. Professor Martin Wilkins said:  Very little is known about the link between zinc transporters and cardiovascular disease. With this research we show that a gene involved in the way that zinc is transported within our cells is also involved in a chronic illness called pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our research provides a new opportunity to understand how pulmonary hypertension develops, and with this find new ways to treat this illness.  Dr Lan Zhao said: ""This finding has important implications for people and animals living at high altitude where oxygen levels are low. Over 140 million people live above 2500m. It will help us understand why some people are more likely than others to develop pulmonary hypertension, and to develop new ways to tackle the condition.  Professor Amanda Fisher, director of the CSC said: ""What is exciting about this work is that it clearly demonstrates how much can be achieved by working together on a scientific problem, and heralds the prospect of further collaborations of this kind between CSC specialists and teams from Imperial College."" Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the BHF, said:  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), though uncommon, leads to substantially reduced quality of life and reduced life expectancy.  It is currently incurable and new drugs are urgently needed to improve treatment.  Professor Wilkins  group has found completely unexpectedly that a gene regulating zinc uptake into cells controls the development of pulmonary hypertension when oxygen levels are low, that the same gene is switched on in the lungs of people suffering from PAH, and that blocking it can protect rats from the disease. These exciting findings hold out the hope of designing completely novel drugs to tackle this serious disease. ","Published: August 14, 2015"

The vaccine was conceived and initially tested in animals by a team of scientists at Italian biotechnology firm Okairos (now Reithera Srl), working with the UK s Pirbright Institute.  RSV kills around 200,000 people worldwide each year. Both the elderly and infants are especially vulnerable to developing severe disease with RSV. Two-thirds of babies are infected with RSV before their first birthday and in winter the virus causes annual epidemics resulting in up to 15 out of every 100 admissions to children s wards. In the world s poorer areas, RSV is second only to malaria as a killer of children aged under 12 months. Oxford University's Professor Andrew Pollard leads the Oxford Vaccine Group, which led the clinical trial of the vaccine. He said: 'RSV causes a lot of emergency admissions, especially in babies, and there is currently no way to prevent it. That means it is a priority for vaccine development.' Dr Christopher Green, the lead physician for the trial, added: 'The results of this trial are a positive signal that prevention of RSV is achievable and follows years of RSV vaccine research at Oxford University and by vaccine manufacturers. The important results of this trial should be dedicated to the members of the public who were willing to be the first to receive the vaccines.' The Oxford Vaccine Group, working with Reithera Srl, developed what is known as a 'prime-boost viral-vectored' RSV vaccine. The vaccine has two components: the first vaccine primes the immune system, while the second vaccine boosts it. Each component was created by modifying other viruses to carry proteins from RSV. These viral vectors are adapted so that the carrier virus (the vector) cannot replicate to cause disease, and the RSV element, while it triggers an immune response, cannot cause an RSV infection either. The vectors were a chimpanzee adenovirus called PanAd3, never used in humans before, and a pox virus called modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). Similar chimpanzee adenovirus vectors and MVA had already been tested as other viral vectored vaccines for other infectious diseases, including the new Ebola vaccines, and have been found to be safe. This initial trial checked whether the vaccine was safe and immunogenic   whether it caused an immune response. Forty-two healthy adult volunteers received the two components with varying intervals between each element. While the boost component was given as an injection, half of the volunteers received the prime element as an injection and half as a nasal spray. Professor Pollard said: 'Both components of the vaccine were found to be safe and to create an immune response. 'While I am delighted with these results, this was just a first trial. We need this vaccine for children and the elderly and that is where the efforts in vaccine development will now focus.' RSV and respiratory disease: RSV is a major cause of bronchiolitis, where the smallest airways in the lungs (the bronchioles) become inflamed. The inflammation reduces the amount of air entering the lungs, making it more difficult to breathe. In the UK, most cases improve within two to three weeks without specific treatment. However, some children have severe symptoms and need treatment in hospital. Bronchiolitis causes around 18% of winter-time admissions to paediatric wards. In around 80% of those admitted, RSV will be the cause of the disease.","Published: August 14, 2015"

However, such special foods may cause harm in some patients when their use is not carefully monitored and managed, according to a research team led by scientists at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), part of the National Institutes of Health.  In two studies the researchers noted that medical foods, including those given to patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), are not subject to the same scrutiny as therapeutic drugs. A medical food, as defined in the Orphan Drug Act, is regulated as a food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and intended to be used under medical supervision. The researchers based their conclusions on more than 10 years of observational studies with large patient groups involving two inborn errors of metabolism. The two IEMs studied are rare genetic disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy. In the first of these, known as isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), mutations in any one of four genes can impede enzyme activity that is necessary for  the proper breakdown of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins (specifically the amino acids valine, isoleucine, methionine and threonine). In the other, cobalamin C (cblC) type combined MMA and hyper-homocysteinemia, failure to properly process vitamin B12 results in a different form of MMA that clinically looks different and requires different management. MMA, one of the most common disorders of organic acid metabolism, results from a deficiency of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. About 1 in 50,000 to 150,000 newborns in the United States each year is born with MMA, which is now detected by routine newborn screening. Despite current treatments, the disorder can cause recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis (when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body), feeding difficulties, poor growth, enlarged liver, kidney disease, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), intellectual disability and early death. Many infants and children with the cblC-deficiency form of the disease also experience vision loss, as well as neurological and cognitive problems.  Decades ago, the survival for children with methylmalonic acidemia was markedly reduced, with many succumbing in the first decade of life,  said Charles Venditti, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator and head of the Organic Acid Research Section in the Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch at NHGRI, and one of the coauthors of the new studies. Even today, when a newborn screening test indicates that a baby has MMA  it is a medical emergency,  Dr. Venditti said.  If you cannot get in touch with the family, you may need to ask the police to help bring the baby to the emergency room, because the newborns can rapidly become very sick and even perish without immediate treatment.  In the MMA study, led by Irini Manoli, M.D., Ph.D., a clinical and biochemical geneticist in NHGRI s Organic Acid Research Section, 61 patients enrolled from metabolic treatment centers across the United States and abroad were evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center between 2004 and 2014. The research team closely monitored their treatments and responses. Most of the patients received part or all of their nutrition from a special mix of natural protein and MMA medical foods delivered through feeding tubes. Medical foods for MMA do not contain intact protein.  They contain free amino acids with the exception of the four  toxic  amino acids that MMA patients cannot metabolize. These amino acids are essential; the body cannot make them, but people must consume a certain amount to support body and brain growth and function. As others have observed in patients with MMA, growth outcomes were disappointing. In most patients, height, weight and head circumference were lower than average, while body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage were higher. Analyzing the patients  dietary records and lab results, the NHGRI researchers found that when patients on restricted protein diets were given medical foods used to manage MMA, especially in large amounts, the relationships between certain essential amino acids were disturbed. In particular, the patients ended up with four or five times the recommended amounts of leucine. Leucine is a branched chain amino acid essential to liver, muscle and adipose (fat-retaining) tissue but, when given in excess, it causes a depletion of the other branched chain amino acids, valine and isoleucine. This might have untoward effects on growth and brain development. Further observational studies led by Dr. Manoli, and conducted with a treatment team from the University of Iowa in Iowa City, showed that reducing the intake of medical foods resolved amino acid deficiencies without having to increase the protein intake. The researchers cautioned that they have not proven a cause-and-effect relationship between the amino acid deficiencies and the poor growth outcomes observed in the patient group. A large prospective clinical trial would be needed for that. In addition to Dr. Manoli, other co-authors of the isolated MMA study included Jennifer Myles, M.S., R.D., of the NIH Nutrition Department; Jennifer Sloan, Ph.D., M.S., and Dr. Venditti, of NHGRI; and Oleg Shchelochkov, M.D., of the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. In the cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency study, which is the focus of the second article, the researchers made clear that they believe cblC patients should never be given current-day medical foods designed for patients with isolated MMA. CblC patients   who also have high levels of methymalonic acid and homocysteine in their blood and urine   cannot adequately synthesize the amino acid methionine, a reaction that depends on vitamin B12. As a result, management of cblC includes taking intramuscular vitamin B12 injections and betaine, a substance that among other functions helps the body metabolize the amino acid homocysteine and increases methionine synthesis. The medical foods designed for patients with isolated MMA contain no methionine and are restricting the exact amino acid that needs to be increased in cblC patients. In addition, these medical foods  relatively high leucine content may block methionine and other amino acid transport into the brain, where they are needed for growth. The authors worked in collaboration with Kevin Strauss, M.D., and Holmes Morton, M.D., of the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, to help model brain uptake of amino acids to support their observations. The NHGRI researchers enrolled 28 cblC patient participants in this study, ranging in age from 2 to 27 years. A subset of nine participants received medical foods while another six followed protein-restricted diets. Both groups had lower growth rates, including decreased head circumference, than other patients who were on natural diets that provided the recommended daily allowance of protein. Another case scenario was provided by the treatment team from Tulane University. It showed that increasing natural protein intake and discontinuing methionine-restricted medical foods helped improve head growth and blood amino acid concentrations in an infant with cblC.  There is no theoretical rationale or experimental support for the practice of administering medical foods to patients with cblC deficiency,  the researchers wrote in their article. Authors of the cblC study were: Drs. Venditti, Manoli and Sloan; Ms. Myles; Nuria Carrillo-Carrasco, M.D., of NIH s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; Eva Morava, M.D., Ph.D., of Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans; and Drs. Strauss and Morton. The late Harvey S. Mudd, M.D., a physician and NIH researcher in metabolic disorders, was also instrumental in this work. MMA is one of about 30 inborn errors of metabolism for which newborns are routinely screened in the United States. The new findings  highlight the paucity of experimental and clinical trial support underlying dietary management practices commonly used to treat patients with varied forms of methylmalonic acidemia and underscore the community need for a more rigorous clinical study of medical foods in the treatment of patients with IEMs,  the researchers wrote.","Published: August 14, 2015"

The research was conducted at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.   Compared to the reduced-fat diet, the reduced-carb diet was particularly effective at lowering insulin secretion and increasing fat burning, resulting in significant body fat loss,  said Kevin Hall, Ph.D., NIDDK senior investigator and lead study author.  But interestingly, study participants lost even more body fat during the fat-restricted diet, as it resulted in a greater imbalance between the fat eaten and fat burned. These findings counter the theory that body fat loss necessarily requires decreasing insulin, thereby increasing the release of stored fat from fat tissue and increasing the amount of fat burned by the body.  The researchers studied 19 non-diabetic men and women with obesity in the Metabolic Clinical Research Unit at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Participants stayed in the unit 24 hours per day for two extended visits, eating the same food and doing the same activities. For the first five days of each visit they ate a baseline balanced diet. Then for six days, they were fed diets containing 30 percent fewer calories, achieved by cutting either only total carbs or total fat from the baseline diet, while eating the same amount of protein. They switched diets during the second visit. The researchers had previously simulated the study with a math model of human metabolism, whose body fat predictions matched the data later collected in the study. When simulating what might happen over longer periods, the model predicted relatively small differences in body fat loss with widely varying ratios of carbs to fat. Those results suggest the body may eventually minimize differences in body fat loss when diets have the same number of calories. More research is needed to assess the physiological effects of fat and carb reduction in the long term.  This NIH study provides invaluable evidence on how different types of calories affect metabolism and body composition,  said NIDDK Director Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D.  The more we learn about the complicated topic of weight loss, the better we can find ways to help people manage their health. More than two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent complications related to overweight and obesity such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death.  Our data tell us that when it comes to body fat loss, not all diet calories are exactly equal,  Hall said.  But the real world is more complicated than a research lab, and if you have obesity and want to lose weight, it may be more important to consider which type of diet you ll be most likely to stick to over time.

But new findings could help figure out what s going on   causing one in 10 cases of high blood pressure, and affecting one in every 50 adults. And further research could improve diagnosis and treatment. Left unchecked, the high pressures caused by the extra amounts of the hormone called aldosterone can harm the heart, kidneys and much more. In fact, this form of hypertension can inflict even more damage than other forms of high blood pressure.   The new University of Michigan research could aid the search for tools to precisely target the condition, called primary aldosteronism or PA. Right now, many people with PA never get an accurate diagnosis or proper treatment. The new findings actually suggest that many of us have small clusters of cells in our adrenal glands that have mutations that could lead to PA, even though we don t have the condition. As many as one in five of us could have elevated aldosterone as a result. By studying the adrenal glands of healthy kidney donors, the team from the U-M Medical School found mutations that allow clusters of cells to make aldosterone -- outside of the normal process that tightly controls its production to regulate blood pressure. This will help them zero in on the origins of PA, and figure out what factors allow it to arise out of clusters of cells called APCCs.  Our findings suggest that most of us have these origins of PA in our adrenals already, in the form of cell-level mutations that cause dysregulation of hormone production but aren t severe enough to lead to disease,  says William Rainey, Ph.D., senior author and professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine.  We believe they are the first step toward full-blown disease, and are more common in women than in men. Adrenal disease legacy It s fitting that a U-M team made this new contribution to understanding PA, since the condition was first diagnosed by a U-M physician, Jerome Conn, M.D., and is sometimes called Conn s syndrome. That tradition of studying the adrenal gland continues at U-M today, says Rainey. A broad-based team of scientists and physicians, one of the largest in the world, cooperates to study adrenal function and disease from many angles, from the most basic laboratory research to clinical trials. The new research relied on that expertise and on next-generation genetic sequencing, which allows researchers to rapidly pinpoint genetic differences in different tissues.   Next stop: biomarkers and precision medicine for PA Rainey and his colleagues have already started additional research to look at genetic mutations and aldosterone production in more healthy adrenal glands, including ones obtained with permission from autopsy tissue and from people donating kidneys through the U-M Transplant Center. They will also look at adrenal glands that have developed tumors called adenomas, which can arise in just one adrenal and cause a specific form of PA. The team also hopes to launch a study to define the prevalence of subclinical aldosterone elevation in the general population and the potential effects of higher levels of the hormone.  At the same time, U-M scientists are looking for biomarkers for primary aldosteronism, and for adrenal cancer, a rare but deadly disease in which adrenal cells turn malignant. The team s biomarker work will be funded by the National Institutes of Health and by donors to the UMHS Discovery Fund. More awareness needed Even as PA research continues, there remains a clear need for better screening of people with hypertension to see if their condition is caused by a form of PA.  Right now, less than 3 percent of people with PA in the United States are ever tested for it,  says Rainey.  It s a complicated workup, requiring multiple visits, so many doctors don t check for PA. New diagnostic methods such as biomarkers are needed, and with further research that we ve just received funding for, we hope to find specific markers to be developed into diagnostic tools.  He notes that patients who are currently taking four or more blood pressure drugs and still don t have their pressure under control may want to ask their doctors about getting tested for PA, especially if they also have low potassium levels in their blood. People under the age of 40 with hypertension, and those who have a close relative with PA, should also consider getting tested.  Fortunately, the mutations we re seeing as common in many cases of PA appear related to the calcium channels on cell surfaces, and we do have good medications available to block those,  says Rainey.  Current drugs used to treat PA patients don t address the overproduction of hormone.  Further research on PA could help determine which patients with any kind of high blood pressure would be most likely to benefit from calcium-channel blocker drugs.","Published: August 14, 2015"

They have been closely followed by Linear Diagnostics Ltd who are developing a rapid diagnostic platform technology, and Serascience Ltd who have recently commercially launched  Seralite   FLC , a rapid diagnostic device for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma. Both technologies came out of successful research projects at the University of Birmingham. With the aim of commercializing medical diagnostic products, the companies have taken five benches and five desk spaces between them at the fully equipped site in a move which guarantees room for expansion in the future. Dr Matt Hicks, Linear Diagnostics Chief Technology Officer, leads a team which is developing diagnostic products for medical and veterinary applications, and is currently working on a diagnostic device which will be used in agriculture to help farmers reduce the amount of wastage in their potato crops. He explains:  Potatoes coming in to storage facilities are either shipped off to supermarkets straightway, processed into chips and crisps, or stored. The stock left in storage is then vulnerable to the bacteria living on them and can lead to rot and spoilage. This is where our invention comes in to play.  Current practice involves sending samples to a laboratory for analysis, this is often time consuming and not viable when a quick decision is required. We are developing a hand-held device which can be used to sample potatoes on-site and provide a diagnostic result within minutes. These results will tell a farmer whether their potatoes have high or medium levels of bacteria (not harmful to humans) and therefore make the decision on how best to make use of their supply. It s not only economically viable, but helps them to reduce wastage.  The common theme for all these companies is the development and commercialization of rapid diagnostic tests for use by healthcare professionals. These types of diagnostic tools have positive implications not only for the developed world, by providing faster diagnosis and thereby improving patient outcomes, but also for medics working in developing countries where access to centralized laboratories and clinics is challenging. Dr Chris Hand, CEO of BSVL sees a whole host of merits in having their companies based at the new BioHub:  BSVL being located at The BioHub Birmingham allows us access to a dynamic and collaborative science community to further enhance current projects, establish new partnerships and exploit novel technology. Our vision is to further develop our diagnostic technologies and laboratory services and the BioHub certainly creates an environment in which to do so.  The  7 million BioHub biomedical laboratory is a new facility set to bring a thriving concentration of science entrepreneurs and start-up companies to the region who are looking for affordable space where they can research, complete proof of concept work and progress medical ideas to market.  The name says it all,  says CEO of the Birmingham Research Park, James Wilkie.  It s a hub for bringing life and buzz to Birmingham. A place for bio-medical start-ups to grow into something brilliant.  Other biotech incubators in the UK don t have a shared lab like ours. With 24 bench spaces available, plus specialist labs too, The BioHub is a venue, it s going to be a great community of science innovation; people sparking off each other, sharing ideas, and working in a state-of-the art equipped environment.  BioHub tenants also have the advantage of access to the diverse network of businesses, research scientists and clinicians based at other adjacent life science venues.

No unexpected safety signals were reported for venetoclax.  Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia have the 17p deletion that makes their disease difficult to treat,  said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. Horning continued,  Venetoclax may help restore the natural process that allows these leukemic cells to self destruct, representing a potential new way of helping people with this form of CLL who typically have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.  Venetoclax was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of previously treated CLL with the 17p deletion. This designation is designed to expedite the development and review of medicines intended to treat serious diseases.

This research was conducted post the recent CPhI China 2015 event and provides a holistic overview of opinion from a survey conducted amongst Chinese manufacturers and international companies operating in China. The overall picture reveals an extremely positive outlook for growth in Chinese pharma, with the domestic market emerging as the driving force. Sitting as the world s second largest pharmaceutical economy, China will remain a rapidly expanding market, but unlike pharma manufacturing in the West, China s growth is not dependent on exports and regulatory standards being met - the domestic economic case and cost advantages from large scale API batches are simply too strong to be resisted. Unsurprisingly, these favourable economic factors have not gone unnoticed by international companies, including Western manufacturers, who are now looking to alter their business strategies in order to capitalize. On average, domestic respondents predict a near doubling in their sales over the next five years, indicating growth in this sector remains strong for the immediate future - almost 70% of companies surveyed said they are focusing chiefly on investing in APIs and generics. In addition, IMS Health research showed that growth is not uniform across the market and  emerging cities  have the highest growth potential, which is where domestic manufacturers are now looking to target their business efforts. In the longer term, CPhI forecasts that the market may begin to develop higher margin, lower volume finished formulation drugs once a critical demand is reached from China s increasingly aware middle-class population. However, there is little belief that such changes will be instrumented for at least 10-years, and it is thought that China s growing API and generics domination could, in fact, be hindering the development of China s evolution into exports and finished formulations. This is particularly significant when looking at exporting to the West, where there is a more complex regulatory framework, particularly for clinical trial and commercial products. In contrast, the majority of manufacturing facilities operating in China at present are large scale and designed to produce high volumes of generic APIs. Thus, if the market s focus does start to shift away from APIs, new pilot and scale-up plants will be required. Of the surveyed international companies operating within the Chinese market, CPhI observed that 100% of them are looking for distribution partners throughout the country in order to increase sales across China s diverse regions - distribution is a well-known problem for market entry. In fact, the chief difficulty for foreign companies working within China remains selecting the right Chinese companies to work alongside. Interestingly,  trust in Chinese partners  continues to be a key issue for many Western companies operating in the region, with respondents reporting concerns about  supply chain and distribution integrity ,  patent protection  and, perhaps more surprisingly, the  knowledge base within regional manufacturers . However, despite these potential hurdles, 85% of the foreign companies surveyed predict an increase in turnover of 50-100% over the next five years, indicating that this market remains highly lucrative for companies able to navigate complex business relationships. When asked if they would invest further should they have access to increased market protection in the future, 100% of foreign companies said yes. However, in direct contrast to the majority of other large pharmaceutical export markets, the USA did not emerge as the main pharma economy target   less than half of respondents wanted to instigate or further business in this market. Instead, the majority of Chinese ingredients manufacturers are looking to deepen ties with European (62.8%) and Indian (74.4%) markets. Again, this could be indicative of a lack of trust and/or FDA approved facilities within the Chinese market, and over the short term, manufacturers clearly feel there are quicker wins to be made selling to European and Indian manufacturers.  The continued expansion of China s domestic market makes it an incredibly exciting time for all manufacturers right now, both domestic and international. It is unusual for a major pharma economy s future growth to be driven predominately by domestic sales, rather than from exports, and clearly international companies must now act to get a foothold in this region. The crucial factor for success is local partners and local knowledge, which is why attendance at CPhI China has proved so vital for successful companies in the region. As with other markets that have moved up the value chain, we believe China will see increased contract manufacturing and a continued growth in biologics over the next five years. The view on the ground, is that, rather than move towards complex finished formulations we will first see China s manufacturers diversify into biologics and new low cost, high growth regions like South America.

Scientists at University College London and the University of Oxford say, ""despite calls for her to publish these claims in the peer reviewed scientific literature, where clinical researchers can check how well they are supported by evidence, this has not happened, and the claims have largely been aired in the media."" They say there is currently no evidence from neuroscience studies that typical internet use harms the adolescent brain - and they are concerned that Greenfield's claims ""are not based on a fair scientific appraisal of the evidence, often confuse correlation for causation, give undue weight to anecdote and poor quality studies, and are misleading to parents and the public at large."" Greenfield claims that social networking sites could negatively affect social interaction, interpersonal empathy, and personal identity. However, the authors say ""the bulk of research does not support this characterisation."" For example, they point out that adolescents' use of social networking sites ""has been found to enhance existing friendships and the quality of relationships, although some individuals benefit more than others."" And ""in terms of affecting personal identity, evidence from Facebook suggests that people generally portray their identity accurately."" Greenfield has also speculated that online interaction might be a ""trigger"" for autism or ""autistic-like traits."" This claim ""has no basis in scientific evidence and is entirely implausible in light of what we know of autism as a neurodevelopmental condition that can be first diagnosed in the preschool years,"" argue the authors. ""Her claims are misleading to the public, unhelpful to parents, and potentially stigmatizing to people with autism,"" they add. Another of Greenfield's claims is that intense use of computer games could lead to impulsiveness, a shorter attention span, and aggression. Yet studies on video gaming give a much more nuanced conclusion, the authors say. Another claim made by Greenfield is that reliance on search engines and surfing the internet could result in superficial mental processing at the expense of deep knowledge and understanding. But the authors point out that this effect applies to many situations and is not restricted to the use of technology. They acknowledge that valid concerns exist about digital technology, but say these ""are in danger of being overshadowed by the current debate."" And rather than technology affecting children's capacities, they suggest the displacement of other activities seems to be an important source of negative effects. For example, low levels of physical activity associated with the passive use of digital technology have been linked to obesity and diabetes, while for video games, the displacement of academic activities, rather than altered cognitive function, has been found to account for reduced school performance. Online safety is another important concern and needs to be tackled at the individual, community, industry, and policy levels, they add. ""Nevertheless, we need to recognize that use of the internet and digital technology has cognitive and social benefits and to balance these against any risks,"" they write. ""Accurate, informed information from sound scientific studies is essential to inform this process, and we think that it is unfortunate that Greenfield's media profile means her claims have an exaggerated impact on public debate given their limited evidence base.

In the first test of its kind to study people in natural settings outside of a laboratory, participants were monitored for levels of craving and prompted to play the block-shifting puzzle game at random intervals during the day. Psychologists from Plymouth University and Queensland University of Technology, Australia, found that playing Tetris interfered with desires not only for food, but also for drugs, including cigarettes, alcohol and coffee, and other activities. The benefits of playing Tetris were maintained over the seven-day study period. In a report published in the international journal Addictive Behaviors, the authors say playing the game could help people to manage their cravings, and they have recommended further research, including testing people dependent on drugs. Professor Jackie Andrade, from the School of Psychology and the Cognition Institute at Plymouth University, said: ""Playing Tetris decreased craving strength for drugs, food, and activities from 70% to 56%. This is the first demonstration that cognitive interference can be used outside the lab to reduce cravings for substances and activities other than eating. ""We think the Tetris effect happens because craving involves imagining the experience of consuming a particular substance or indulging in a particular activity. Playing a visually interesting game like Tetris occupies the mental processes that support that imagery; it is hard to imagine something vividly and play Tetris at the same time."" During the experiment, 31 undergraduates, aged 18-27, were prompted seven times a day via text message to report on any cravings they were feeling. They were also encouraged to report cravings proactively, independently of the prompts. Fifteen members of the group were required to play Tetris on an iPod for three minutes, before reporting their craving levels again. Craving was recorded in 30% of occasions, most commonly for food and non-alcoholic drinks, which were reported on nearly two-thirds of those occasions. Twenty-one percent of cravings were for substances categorised as drugs, including coffee, cigarettes, wine and beer, and 16% were for miscellaneous activities such as sleeping, playing videogames, socialising with friends, and sexual intercourse. Food cravings tended to be slightly weaker than those in the other categories. ""The impact of Tetris on craving was consistent across the week and on all craving types,"" said Professor Jon May, also of Plymouth University. ""People played the game 40 times on average but the effect did not seem to wear off. This finding is potentially important because an intervention that worked solely because it was novel and unusual would have diminishing benefits over time as participants became familiar with it."" ""As a support tool, Tetris could help people manage their cravings in their daily lives and over extended time periods,"" added Professor Andrade. Plymouth University   press release May J et al.

Now, new research from Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) has identified a novel learning and memory brain network that processes incoming information based on whether it s something we ve experienced previously or is deemed to be altogether new and unknown, helping us recognize, for instance, whether the face before us is that of a familiar friend or a complete stranger. Forthcoming in the September issue of the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, the study pulls together evidence from multiple neuroimaging studies and methods to demonstrate the existence of previously unknown and distinct functional brain network, one that appears to have broad involvement in human memory processing.  Activity in this network tells us if you re looking at something that you perceive to be novel or familiar,  said Adrian Gilmore, first author of the study and a fifth-year psychology doctoral student in Arts & Sciences at Washington University.  When an individual sees a novel stimulus, this network shows a marked decrease in activity. When an individual sees a familiar stimulus, this network shows a marked increase in activity.  Study co-authors are Kathleen B. McDermott, PhD, professor of psychology in Arts & Sciences and of radiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis; and Steven Nelson, PhD, a graduate of the neuroscience doctoral program at Washington University. Nelson is now the neuroimaging core chief at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 17 Center of Excellence for Research on Returning War Veterans in Waco, Texas. McDermott is principal investigator and director of Washington University s Memory and Cognition Lab. Described by study authors as the Parietal Memory Network (PMN), the new memory and learning network shows consistent patterns of activation and deactivation in three distinct regions of the parietal cortex in the brain s left hemisphere   the precuneus, the mid-cingulate cortex and the dorsal angular gyrus. Activity within the PMN during the processing of incoming information (encoding) can be used to predict how well that information will be stored in memory and later made available for successful retrieval. The PMN exhibits opposite patterns of activity depending on whether the information being retrieved is recognized as new or familiar   the more familiar the information, the more activity in the PMN, the study found. Researchers identified interesting characteristics of the PMN by analyzing data from a range of previously published neuroimaging studies. Using converging bits of evidence from dozens of fMRI brain experiments, their study shows how activity in the PMN changes during the completion of specific mental tasks and how the regions interact during resting states when the brain is involved in no particular activity or mental challenge. This study builds on research by Marcus Raichle, MD, the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor of Medicine, and other neuroscience researchers at Washington University, which established the existence of another functional brain network that remains surprisingly active when the brain is not involved in a specific activity, a system known as the Default Mode Network. Like the Default Mode Network, key regions of the PMN were shown to hum in a similar unison while the brain is in relative periods of rest. And while key regions of the PMN are located close to the Default Mode Network, the PMN appears to be its own distinct and separate functional network, preliminary findings suggest. Another characteristic that sets the PMN apart from other functional networks is that its activity patterns remains consistent regardless of the type of mental challenge it is processing. Many regions of the cortex jump into action only during the processing of a very specific task, such as learning a list of words, but remain relatively inactive during very similar tasks, such as learning a group of faces, The PMN, on the other hand, exhibits activity across a wide range of mental tasks, with levels rising and falling based on how much a task s novelty or familiarity captures our attention.  It seems like the amount of change relies heavily on how much a given stimulus captures our attention,  Gilmore said.  If something really stands out as old or new, you see much larger changes in the network s activity than if it doesn t stand out as much.  The consistency of these patterns across various types of processing tasks suggests that the PMN plays a broad role in many different learning and recall processes, the research team suggests.  A really cool feature of the PMN is that it seems to show its response patterns regardless of what you re doing,  Gilmore said.  The PMN doesn t seem to care what it is that you re trying to do. It deactivates when we encounter something new, and activates when we encounter something that we ve seen before. This makes it a really promising target for future research in areas such as education or Alzheimer s research, where we want to foster or improve memory performance broadly, rather than focusing on specific tasks.

The way in which the brain processes language triggers adjustments. If the brain has to exert itself too much to cope with difficult case constructions, it usually simplifies them over time, as linguists from the University of Zurich (UZH) demonstrate in a study on languages all over the world. The grammar of languages keeps reorganizing itself. A prime example of this is the omission of case endings in the transition from Latin to Italian. And in some instances, case systems are remodeled entirely   such as in the transition from Sanskrit to Hindi, which has completely new grammatical cases.  An international team of researchers headed by linguist Balthasar Bickel from the University of Zurich conducted statistical analyses of the case systems in more than 600 languages and recorded the changes over time. They then tested these adaptations experimentally in test subjects, measuring the brain flows that become active during language comprehension. The scientists were therefore able to demonstrate that the brain activity is stronger for complex case constructions than for simple ones. ""Certain case constructions tax the brain more, which is why they are eventually omitted from languages all over the world   independently of the structural properties of the languages or socio-historical factors,"" explains Bickel, a professor of general linguistics at the University of Zurich. In other words, biological processes are also instrumental in grammatical changes.

The research is published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  The inclusion/exclusion criteria for AETs have narrowed over the past five years, thereby suggesting that AETs may be even less generalizable than they were previously,  said Zimmerman, director of outpatient psychiatry and the partial hospital program at Rhode Island Hospital and director of the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, a study that integrated researchers  assessment tools and procedures into a hospital-affiliated outpatient practice.  More than a decade ago, our clinical research group raised concerns about the generalizability of AETs and suggested that the majority of patients seen in routine clinical practice would not qualify for an AET,  Zimmerman added.  These results were replicated multiple times. We therefore wondered if drug companies changed how they recruited patients into studies. In fact, they have, but in an unexpected way. The more recent AETs are even less generalizable than the prior studies, which themselves excluded most depressed patients from drug company-sponsored treatment studies.  Zimmerman examined 170 placebo-controlled AETs published during the past 20 years, 56 of which were published during the past five years. The more recent studies were significantly more likely to: 1) exclude patients with comorbid Axis I disorders and personality disorders; 2) exclude patients because the episode duration was too long or too short; and 3) exclude patients who met diagnostic criteria for major depression but did not score high enough on a rating scale.  For severely ill patients, such as those who express suicidal thoughts, it makes ethical sense to exclude them from a study where they may receive placebos,  said Zimmerman.  However, excluding patients with co-morbid psychiatric disorders has become more frequent, and patients with any comorbid Axis I disorder are twice as likely to be excluded in recent studies. This is important because the majority of depressed patients have another psychiatric diagnosis. The exclusion of depressed patients who score too low on rating scales is the most concerning. This would exclude approximately half of the patients seen in clinical practice. In addition, studies have shown that antidepressants do not work as well for less severely depressed patients. Thus, drug companies seem to be stacking the deck to demonstrate that their products work, even though they might work only for a narrow segment of depressed patients.

Many brain disorders vary between the sexes, but how biology and culture contribute to these differences has been unclear. Now Northwestern neuroscientists have found an intrinsic biological difference between males and females in the molecular regulation of synapses in the hippocampus. This provides a scientific reason to believe that female and male brains may respond differently to drugs targeting certain synaptic pathways.   The importance of studying sex differences in the brain is about making biology and medicine relevant to everyone, to both men and women,  said Catherine S. Woolley, senior author of the study.  It is not about things such as who is better at reading a map or why more men than women choose to enter certain professions.  Among their findings, the scientists found that a drug called URB-597, which regulates a molecule important in neurotransmitter release, had an effect in females that it did not have in males. While the study was done in rats, it has broad implications for humans because this drug and others like it are currently being tested in clinical trials in humans.  Our study starts to put some specifics on what types of molecular differences there are in male and female brains,  Woolley said.  Woolley is the William Deering Chair in Biological Sciences, professor of neurobiology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Women s Health Research Institute at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The study of inhibitory synapses and endocannabinoids, which regulate neurotransmitters, was published in the Journal of Neuroscience. It is the first study to detail where males and females differ in a key molecular pathway in the brain.   We don t know whether this finding will translate to humans or not,  Woolley said,  but right now people who are investigating endocannabinoids in humans probably are not aware that manipulating these molecules could have different effects in males and females.  Specifically, Woolley and her research team found that in female brains the drug URB-597 increased the inhibitory effect of a key endocannabinoid in the brain, called anandamide, causing a decrease in the release of neurotransmitters. In male brains, the drug had no effect. (The difference is not related to circulating reproductive hormones.) The subject of many clinical trials, endocannabinoids are molecules that help regulate the amount of certain neurotransmitters released at synapses, the gap between neurons. These molecules are involved in a variety of physiological processes including memory, motivational state, appetite and pain as well as in epilepsy, a neurological disorder. (Their name comes from the fact that endocannabinoids activate the same neural receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana.) Understanding what controls the synthesis, release and breakdown of endocannabinoids has broad implications both for normal and pathological brain function, Woolley said. This study contributes an important piece of knowledge. For 20 years, Woolley actively avoided studying sex differences in the brain until her own data showed her that differences between females and males were real. Her discovery, reported in 2012, that estrogens decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brains of female rats but not in males, changed her thinking.   Being a scientist is about changing your mind in the face of new evidence,  Woolley said.  I had to change my mind in the face of this evidence.  Building on these earlier findings, Woolley and her team used a series of electrophysiological and biochemical studies to pinpoint what causes this effect. The researchers found the difference between males and females lies in the interaction between the molecules ERalpha and mGluR1. Details of the molecular pathway are reported in the new study. To find out what is the same and what is different between males and females, scientists need to study both sexes, Woolley maintains. Currently, about 85 percent of basic neuroscience studies are done in male animals, tissues or cells.   We are not doing women -- and specifically women s health -- any favors by pretending that things are the same if they are not,  Woolley said.  If the results of research would be different in female animals, tissues and cells, then we need to know. This is essential so that we can find appropriate diagnoses, treatments and, ultimately, cures for disease in both sexes.

8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/identifying-defective-heart-genes-197583,Identifying Defective Heart Genes A new technique could eventually enable doctors to diagnose genetic heart diseases by rapidly scanning more than    genes known to cause cardiac anomalies  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. For the subset of heart patients whose illness isn t caused by a lifetime of cigarettes, trans fats or high glycemic foods, a new genetic test developed at the Stanford University School of Medicine may be able to accurately pinpoint the likely genetic causes of their conditions in just a couple of days. In work that could advance precision health, Kitchener Wilson, MD, PhD, instructor of pathology, and Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, professor of cardiovascular medicine and of radiology, teamed up with a group of genome-sequencing specialists to develop the new technique: a better way to test cardiac patients for any genes that might be causing their problems.  Wilson and Wu said that the gold standard of genome sequencing involves thousands of genes, costs $1,000 or more and can take weeks or months to get results. For a patient with a heart condition that s difficult to diagnose, it makes no sense to sequence the entire 22,000-gene genome, since fewer than 200 genes are known to affect the heart, they said. Moreover, whole-genome sequencing typically contains mistakes, so key mutations might be missed. To meet this challenge, Wilson and Wu s team designed a streamlined assay, or test, that looks at just the 88 genes known to carry mutations that cause heart problems. Materials for the new test cost about $100, and results are back within three days.  This approach   surveying a small subgroup of relevant genes instead of the whole genome   is already used to test for other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. But cystic fibrosis involves only one gene, albeit with hundreds of variants.  By comparison, the heart diseases are more challenging just because there are so many genes to sequence,  said Wilson.  To do that accurately has been difficult and, until now, too expensive for most labs.  Simple genetic probes Such testing isn t for the typical, older cardiac patient who comes in with chest pain, the result of a lifetime of poor diet and little exercise.  Those patients can be treated with standard treatments, such as surgical interventions. But what if a 30-year-old woman comes in with chest pain and her doctors can t find any obvious reason why she should be having heart problems at such a young age?  said Wu, who is also the director of Stanford s Cardiovascular Institute.  That could be the moment for doctors to break out the complementary long padlock probes for inherited heart disease. Complementary long padlock probes, or cLPPs, were developed at the Stanford Genome Technology Center. These simple probes accurately target specific parts of the genome and can be made in large batches at low cost. Because of their simplicity, they are easily customized to target different genes. Wilson and Wu spearheaded the effort to put cLPPs to work diagnosing cardiac diseases. A preliminary test of the assay on blood samples and some skin samples from 29 participants from families with inherited heart disease validated the cLPP approach, the researchers said. The heart disease cLPP assay was cheaper, faster and more accurate than whole-genome assaid. The Stanford team next plans to test the technique on a group of 200-300 patients. In the meantime, Wilson and Wu are offering the test free to any research lab that wants to try it.  They can just email me,  said Wilson,  and we ll send them the assay, and then they can do it in their own lab   as long as they have some experience with next-generation sequencing.  The assay will shorten the time it takes to diagnose difficult or unusual heart disease cases, Wu said.  Suppose you have a 60-year-old patient who comes in with heart failure,  he said.  We do the angiogram and we find he has no history of heart attack or other issues, and yet the heart is not performing well. We also find that several of his family members have similar heart conditions. So if we run the new genetic test and find the man s illness has a genetic cause, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, we now have both a cause and a diagnosis, and we can initiate treatment right away.  Avoiding a  fishing expedition   Not having that result delays diagnosis and increases costs because you re going through a whole bunch of tests   sometimes it becomes a fishing expedition, which can be frustrating to both the physician and the patient,  Wu added.  But perhaps the most important benefit is that you can give the patient accurate answers about his or her disease.  Wilson and Wu said the genome technology group has been working on the cLPP technique for a long time.  Our goal is to make genetic testing more accessible to more people,  Wilson said.  We want to democratize it. For now, we re going to release it free of charge: Researchers can get samples of the assay so they can run it themselves. We re also releasing all of the technical data for the probes so researchers can recreate and modify the probes themselves. In some ways it s making genetic testing open source.  The development of the new test is an example of Stanford Medicine s focus on precision health, which aims to enable researchers and physicians to better predict individual risks for specific diseases, develop approaches to early detection and prevention, and help clinicians make real-time decisions about the best way to care for patients.","Published: August 13, 2015"

This could be used to release painkillers whenever a patient with arthritic knees goes for a walk, or to release antibacterial drugs gradually as people move around over the course of a day,  says Zhen Gu, co-senior author of a paper describing the work and an assistant professor in the joint biomedical engineering program at NC State and UNC-Chapel Hill. The technology consists of an elastic film that is studded with biocompatible microcapsules. These microcapsules, in turn, are packed with nanoparticles that can be filled with drugs.Here s how it works: The microcapsules stick halfway out of the film, on the side of the film that touches a patient s skin. The drugs leak slowly out of the nanoparticles and are stored in the microcapsules. When the elastic film is stretched, it also stretches the microcapsules   enlarging the surface area of the microcapsule and effectively squeezing some of the stored drug out onto the patient s skin, where it can be absorbed.  When the microcapsule is stretched from left to right, it is also compressed from bottom to top,  says Yong Zhu, co-senior author of the paper and an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at NC State.  That compression helps push the drug out of the microcapsule.  After being stretched, the microcapsule is  re-charged  by the drugs that continue to leak out of the nanoparticles.  This can be used to apply drugs directly to sites on the skin, such as applying anti-cancer medications to melanomas or applying growth factors and antibiotics for wound healing,  says Jin Di, co-lead author and a Ph.D student in Gu s lab. The researchers also incorporated microneedles into the system, applying them on top of the microcapsules. In this configuration, the drugs can be squeezed through the microneedles. The microneedles are small enough to be painless, but large enough to allow drugs to diffuse into the bloodstream through tiny capillaries underneath the skin.  This expands the range of drugs that can be applied using the technology,  says Shanshan Yao, co-lead author and a Ph.D student in Zhu s lab.  We re now exploring how this tool can be used to apply drugs efficiently and effectively to burn patients, and we plan to look at how this could be used for pain relief as well,  Gu says.  The materials are relatively inexpensive, and the manufacturing process is fairly straightforward, so we re optimistic that this could be scaled up in a cost-effective way,  Zhu says.","Published: August 13, 2015"

There is an urgent need to develop either a vaccine or effective antiviral therapy to prevent future outbreaks.   We know very little about the basic biology of these diseases,  said Lijun Rong, UIC professor in microbiology and immunology and principal investigator on the new study.  Rong and his colleagues found that Ebola and Marburg viruses both use gateways called G protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs, to enter a cell after attaching to its surface. Blocking entry with a drug that ties up the receptor may prove to be an effective therapy.  These G protein-coupled receptors are a big family of closely related molecules in humans   altogether, probably more than a thousand,  said Rong. Because GPCRs are involved in many human diseases, he said, a host of drugs have already been developed that target them.   In the history of therapeutics, about half of our drugs were developed to target GPCRs. For example, a number of antihistamines used as allergy medications are GPCR receptor antagonists,  he said.  Rong and his coworkers screened  approximately a thousand compounds using a NIH-funded high-throughput screening facility. They found 20 GPCR antagonists, or molecules that block GPCR receptors, were able to block Ebola and Marburg viruses from entering cells.  Learning how the two viruses infect cells and how they can be blocked offers the hope of finding therapeutics to combat both deadly diseases, Rong said.   There are a lot of drugs and compounds that work through this mechanism   acting as antagonists to GPCR receptors,  he said.  This gives us a huge repertoire that can be tested against Ebola/Marburg.

Recent studies show that at least 60% of people with the disease die because of cardiovascular complications. Why diabetes takes such a toll on heart health has long remained a mystery. Now the Otago researchers have identified harmful molecular changes in the cells of diabetic hearts that begin before cardiovascular symptoms even appear. Using the type-2 diabetic mouse model, the researchers found that a normal cell process called autophagy is deregulated in diabetic hearts. A marked increase in autophagy then triggers activation of pro-cell death proteins, which leads to progressive loss of cardiac cells. As more cells die, cardiac dysfunction develops and heart failure ensues. Lead researcher Dr Rajesh Katare says the team sought to confirm their laboratory-based results by collaborating with cardiothoracic surgeons at Dunedin Hospital to collect and study heart tissue samples from coronary bypass patients. The researchers matched around 35 such diabetic patients to comparable non-diabetic ones. Analysis revealed markedly increased autophagy in the diabetic patients  heart tissues compared to the non-diabetic ones. They also identified that diabetes increases autophagy through activation of the protein (Beclin-1), which Dr Katare says presents  an extremely promising target for new treatments of diabetes-related cardiac disease .  We found that these molecular alterations begin in the diabetic heart from an early stage of the disease before any clinically identifiable symptoms so blocking them could be useful in combating cardiovascular complications in diabetes.  When the researchers lowered the gene expression of Beclin-1 in rat heart cells exposed to high glucose, excessive autophagy and cell death rates were much reduced, he says.  Given that the growing diabetes epidemic is set to create major global economic and social costs in coming decades, it is very exciting to have opened up a new research avenue that could greatly decrease the disease s burden,  Dr Katare says.","Published: August 13, 2015"

Glioma has a median survival of about 15 months and a two-year survival rate of 30 per cent because it is difficult to completely remove cancer cells without compromising brain functions and chemotherapy and radiotherapy do not prevent the regrowth of remaining cancer cells. With this new research, the team reveals an alternative route to rein in the glioma cancer cells. The cancerous cells mingle with astrocytes, a type of cell that regulates the environment in the brain to create favourable conditions for brain functions. The research team found that glioma cells can reprogram the astrocytes with little pieces of genetic code (microRNAs). Those codes act as master switches, turning specific sets of genes on and off. This is the first evidence that microRNA can go from glioma cells into astrocytes and reprogram them to provide an altered environment that stimulates tumor growth and invasion,  said Naus, a professor in the Department of Cellular & Physiological Sciences in the Life Sciences Institute and an investigator with the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health.  We should consider the possibility of creating a treatment that would temporarily modify the healthy astrocytes around the tumor so the cancer cells can t hijack them,  said Sin, a research associate leading the glioma investigation in the Naus laboratory. The research was also highlighted in a recent interdisciplinary project,  Fashioning Cancer: A Correlation Between Destruction and Beauty , where images of brain cancer were used to highlight public awareness, as well as raise funds for cancer research.","Published: August 13, 2015"

It can also be polymerized with dicarboxylic acids to make polyamides (nylons) for use as engineering plastics, medical materials, and adhesives. Traditionally, 1,3-diaminopropane is derived from petroleum-based processes. In effort to address critical problems such as the depletion of petroleum and environmental issues inherent to the petroleum-based processes, the research team has developed an Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain capable of producing 1,3-diaminopropane. Using this technology, 1,3-diaminopropane can now be produced from renewable biomass instead of petroleum. E. coli as found in nature is unable to produce 1,3-diaminopropane. Metabolic engineering, a technology to transform microorganisms into highly efficient microbial cell factories capable of producing chemical compounds of interest, was utilized to engineer the E. coli strain. First, naturally existing metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of 1,3-diaminopropane were introduced into a virtual cell in silico to determine the most efficient metabolic pathway for the 1,3-diaminopropane production. The metabolic pathway selected was then introduced into an E. coli strain and successfully produced 1,3-diaminopropane for the first time in the world.The research team applied metabolic engineering additionally, and the production titer of 1,3-diaminopropane increased about 21 fold. The Fed-batch fermentation of the engineered E. coli strain produced 13 grams per liter of 1,3-diaminoproapne. With this technology, 1,3-diaminopropane can be produced using renewable biomass, and it will be the starting point for replacing the current petroleum-based processes with bio-based processes. Professor Lee said, ""Our study suggested a possibility to produce 1,3-diaminopropane based on biorefinery. Further study will be done to increase the titre and productivity of 1,3-diaminopropane.

Re-exposure boosts immunity to shingles, caused by the same virus, Varicella-zoster virus. Scientists from the Universities of Antwerp and Hasselt (Belgium) have predicted that the temporary effect of a rise in shingles cases dominates in 31 to 40-year-olds. This is younger than previously predicted and this age group is less at risk of developing the most serious shingles symptoms. Many countries have avoided introducing universal chickenpox vaccination in children because it was previously predicted that the reduction in chickenpox related disease would be outbalanced by the temporarily increase in shingles-related disease.A new model developed by the scientists also confounds previous findings on the length of time re-exposure chickenpox boosts immunity to shingles. The effect was thought to last for up to 20 years, but results of the current modeling study show it only lasts for two. The new model is the first based on real immunological and virological data from individuals.  We were surprised to find that re-exposure to chickenpox is beneficial for so few years and also that the most pronounced effect of vaccination on increasing cases of shingles is in younger adults,  says lead author Dr Benson Ogunjimi.  Our findings should allay some fears about implementing childhood chickenpox vaccination,  he says. Vaccination programmes are established in some countries including the US, Australia, Greece, Germany, Japan and Taiwan. However, as most   but not all - chickenpox cases are mild, whereas shingles causes a painful rash and can lead to complications such as prolonged pain (postherpetic neuralgia), policy makers in other countries have hesitated to introduce childhood vaccination. Shingles occurs most often in individuals with a declined immunological status, such as HIV or cancer patients. Ageing is also assumed to increase susceptibility. In previous studies, Ogunjimi and colleagues found that the impact of ageing is exacerbated by Cytomegalovirus infection, another virus in the herpes family. The current model combines data from individuals relating to all these factors, making it more accurate than previous models and easier to verify with future clinical studies.  Our new model relates to real biological functions, increasing its value for determining health policy,  says Dr Ogunjimi.","Published: August 13, 2015"

The findings lend support to emerging tests that better predict whether breast cancer will spread, which could spare women from invasive and unnecessary treatments, and could lead to new anti-cancer therapies. The research, conducted by investigators at the NCI-designated Albert Einstein Cancer Center (AECC) and Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care, utilized a mouse model of human breast cancer and mice implanted with human breast tissue.  John Condeelis, Ph.D.The Einstein-Montefiore researchers previously found that breast cancer spreads when three specific cells are in direct contact: an endothelial cell (a type of cell that lines the blood vessels), a perivascular macrophage (a type of immune cell found near blood vessels), and a tumor cell that produces high levels of Mena, a protein that enhances a cancer cell s ability to invade. The site where these three cells come in direct and stable contact called a tumor microenvironment of metastasis, or TMEM is where tumor cells enter blood vessels.  It has been known for some time that blood vessels in tumors are abnormally permeable. But what regulates that permeability hasn t been clear. Based on our latest imaging studies, we can now say that this phenomenon is regulated by TMEM macrophages,  said lead author Allison Harney, Ph.D., Bridge Postdoctoral Fellow in the Integrated Imaging Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This new research indicates that the TMEM macrophage releases a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which causes a local increase in blood vessel permeability. The effect is temporary but can last long enough to allow cancer cells to enter the blood stream escaping the primary tumor and traveling to distant metastatic sites. The researchers also observed for the first time that transient blood vessel permeability and tumor cell entry into the bloodstream occur simultaneously and exclusively at TMEM sites. The discovery was made using intravital high-resolution two-photon microscopy to image primary breast cancer tumors in mice and human xenografts (human breast cancer tissue grafted into mice).  The discovery of a unique doorway that allows tumor cells into the blood stream opens new opportunities for the development of anti-metastasis therapeutics  said study leader John  Condeelis, Ph.D., professor and co-chair of anatomy and structural biology, co-director of the Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center and the Integrated Imaging Program, and the Judith and Burton P.

Engineers from the University of Houston, working with physicians from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, describe the method   Time-lapse Imaging Microscopy in Nanowell Grids, or TIMING   and its ability to more accurately analyze large numbers of cells for use in the cancer therapy.They also demonstrated its potential in research evaluating how effective various types of T cells   a type of white blood cell key to fighting infection   are in killing cancer cells. This is a case of biologists, clinicians and computer scientists coming together toward a common purpose,  said Badri Roysam, chairman of the UH Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and lead author of the Bioinformatics paper. He and Navin Varadarajan, assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at UH, collaborated with M.D. Anderson s Laurence J.N. Cooper on the research, along with a number of other UH researchers. Clinical studies have reported life-saving results from cancer immunotherapy, a biological therapy which uses the immune system   or specific cells of the immune system   to fight cancer. But they don t work for everyone, not even everyone with one of the cancers for which the treatments have proven most successful.   TIMING could change that by allowing researchers to study many more interactions between immune cells and cancer cells, thanks to its ability to automatically analyze thousands of cell interactions at a time. Conventional analysis is done manually, the researchers said, making it impossible to study every combination. Most conventional methods assess a limited number of samples from a test   between 10 and 100, compared with the 10,000 or even 100,000 samples that can be assessed with the new method, according to the paper. That matters, the researchers wrote in Bioinformatics,  since many biologically significant cellular subpopulations like tumor stem cells, multi-killer immune cells and biotechnologically relevant protein secreting cells, are rare.  TIMING works like this: A nanowell grid   an expandable structure   allows discrete samples of immune cells and cancer cells to be confined and studied over time, via time-lapse video recording.  We ve developed a game-changing piece of software that can accurately analyze an entire grid of nanowell videos and make quantitative measurements,  Roysam said. It is essentially, he said,  the combination of a supermicroscope and a supercomputer to screen cell-cell interactions on a large scale.  ""The proposed algorithms dramatically improved the yield and accuracy of the automated analysis to a level at which the automatically generated cellular measurements can be utilized for biological studies directly, with little/no editing,  the researchers wrote. Varadarajan said the system allows  high-performing outliers  to be identified for further research. Several types of immune cells were used, including T cells, CAR cells   T cells modified with chimeric antigen receptors, which allow them to hone in on and kill cancer cells  and what are known as NK or  natural killer  cells, which can detect tumors without modification. Researchers used both leukemia cells and melanoma cells in their testing.  If you know the best cells (to fight a particular cancer), it just becomes a manufacturing problem,  Varadarajan said.  But right now, we don t always know which cells are the best.  Using the TIMING system, the researchers have deepened the scientific understanding of immunotherapy, including how different types of T cells function against cancer cells. As a result, they demonstrated for the first time at a single-cell level that CD4 T cells directly participate in the killing of multiple tumor cells. CD8 T cells are known for their tumor-fighting properties, but Varadarajan said the finding, published in Cancer Immunology Research, suggests that CD4 cells also would be effective. Research on this question is ongoing.","Published: August 13, 2015"

The findings shift understanding of how fractures heal and have implications for efforts to promote fracture repair. ""Many of the current pharmaceutical protocols are based on using fibrin to promote fracture healing,"" said Jonathan Schoenecker, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation. ""In certain instances it may help, but we've shown for sure that you don't need it. Bone biology does not require fibrin to heal a fracture."" Fibrin is involved in blood clotting; it forms a meshlike net that traps platelets to form a clot. When bones break, so do blood vessels, and clots form to stop the bleeding.""Most people don't realize that bone is the most vascular organ in our bodies,"" Schoenecker said. ""When you have a fracture, you have a huge disruption of that vascularity."" Since fibrin is the main protein at the site of a fracture, it was thought to promote repair by providing a scaffold for the initial phase of new bone formation. Schoenecker and colleagues found, however, that fracture repair was normal in mice missing the fibrin precursor fibrinogen. The investigators had previously reported the importance of vascular re-connection for bone fracture healing. Using imaging techniques they developed to simultaneously study angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth) and bone formation after fracture, they found that blood vessels grow first at the ends of the fracture, extend and reconnect. Then new bone forms. ""Therefore, any condition associated with vascular disease and thrombosis will impair fracture healing,"" Schoenecker said. It follows that if fibrin is not efficiently removed, it gets in the way, he said. In the new studies, the team demonstrated that mice missing the factor that clears fibrin had impaired vascularization and bone union. Genetic manipulations to deplete fibrinogen in these mice restored normal fracture repair. ""Fibrin puts a cog in the machine and you don't get the anastomosis (vessel reconnection),"" Schoenecker said. The findings may explain why obesity, diabetes, smoking and advanced age impair fracture repair. They are all associated with impaired fibrin clearance, he explained. The findings may also explain why children heal so quickly - because their fibrinogen levels are about half the levels in an adult. ""If we could lower fibrinogen levels - or increase the activity of enzymes that get rid of fibrin - we could make adult patients more like kids and improve healing,"" Schoenecker said. In the current studies, the investigators also found that mice unable to clear fibrin formed bone in muscle - a condition called heterotopic ossification that can complicate healing after trauma and orthopaedic surgery. ""It was totally unexpected that fibrin clearance is essential to prevent heterotopic ossification,"" Schoenecker said. Schoenecker and his team are working toward ""orthobiologics"" to reduce fibrin levels or enhance fibrin clearance and improve fracture healing. They are also working to improve the mechanical devices - such as rods and plates - used in orthopaedic surgeries, so that those devices don't disrupt the ability of blood vessels to grow and reconnect. ""The link between coagulation (clotting) and orthopaedics has been observed for more than a century, as such big injuries of an incredibly vascular structure inevitably require a clot in order not to bleed to death,"" Schoenecker said. ""But the understanding that the resolution of this clot has such an impact on the way a bone heals is completely new."" He points out that some of the medications developed for cardiovascular medicine - to prevent clotting - may find new purposes in enhancing tissue repair and regeneration.","Published: August 13, 2015"

To this end, a SISSA research group (in collaboration with Temple University in Philadelphia) has developed a new method for the computerized analysis of the internal dynamics of molecules, demonstrating its efficiency and versatility.  We can think of molecules as being composed of several parts that are free to move in relation to one another with a certain degree of freedom, a bit like meccano pieces that, while attached to each other, maintain the ability to move and rotate. Knowing how protein subunits move is important for understanding the function of the protein, which is why scientists  attention has recently focused on investigations of internal molecular dynamics. Often, however, whether experimental or derived from computer simulations, the data available to researchers are fragmentary.  It s a bit like having to reconstruct a story from only a few still images of a film , explains Luca Ponzoni, PhD student at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste and first author of the study.  Sometimes all we have are a few  shapshots  of a protein s internal dynamics and from those we have to reconstruct its function .  In their study, Ponzoni and colleagues developed a method called SPECTRUS, which allows researchers to identify the  quasi- rigid  subunits of proteins and reconstruct their movement starting from a limited amount of information.  By knowing the internal dynamics we can understand important things , explains Cristian Micheletti, the SISSA professor who coordinated the study.  Take an enzyme, for example: where two subunits join is usually where we can find the active sites that bind other molecules to the enzyme, which is therefore able to carry out its function as a catalyst .    The method we used proved to be efficient and reliable , continues Ponzoni.  For instance, it can correctly identify the mechanical modules of a protein starting from only a few frames   to use the same metaphor -  providing predictions consistent with those based on far more complex methods that require whole film. Besides, our results were also consistent with those of experimental observations .","Published: August 13, 2015"

Alligator Bioscience will complete that study, while Janssen will be responsible for all subsequent development of ADC-1013 including research, development, manufacturing, regulatory, and commercialization activities. In a separate transaction, Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC, J&J s venture capital arm, will subscribe for new shares of Alligator stock. ADC-1013 is an agonistic fully human monoclonal antibody that targets CD40, an immuno-stimulatory receptor found on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. The companies reason that stimulating that receptor begins a process that leads to an increase in T cells attacking a tumor. According to Alligator Bioscience, ADC-1013 was shown to overcome immune suppression, resulting in a strong anti-tumor response and eradication of the tumors in several tumor models. Mice cured from a certain tumor by ADC-1013 were subsequently resistant to the same tumor type even if no treatment was administered:  This confirms that ADC-1013 is able to evoke a long-term immunological memory that protects from new metastases for several months after treatment,  the company states on its website. Alligator Bioscience is recruiting patients for a first-in-humans Phase I clinical study of ADC-1013, the company posted in its most recent update June 15 on ClinicalTrials.gov. The study s purpose is to determine whether ADC-1013 is safe and tolerable when administered as repeated injections directly into the tumor tissue in patients with advanced solid tumors.  ADC-1013 is a great addition to our growing immuno-oncology portfolio, which includes a broad range of approaches in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies,  Peter F. Lebowitz, M.D., Ph.D., global oncology head, Janssen Research & Development, said in a statement.  We were very impressed with the properties of this antibody and we are excited to continue the development that will ultimately deliver it to patients.  Headquartered in Lund, Sweden, Alligator Bioscience is a privately held developer of antibody-based cancer immunotherapies. In addition to ADC-1013, Alligator s pipeline includes the preclinical bispecific immuno-oncology candidate ADC-1015, being developed for intratumoral administration; and the research-phase bispecific immuno-oncology candidate ADC-1016, which combines systemic administration with pharmacological effects are localized to tumors through the fusion of a tumor targeting antibody with an immune activating antibody. The closing of the agreement is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

We are excited about the potential of our immunologically active VLP platform in the field of immune-oncology and believe that Checkmate is well positioned to advance treatment options for patients with cancer,  Cytos Chairman and CEO Christian Itin, Ph.D., said in a Cytos statement. CYT003 is a first-in-class, immune modulator that had been in clinical development as a potential new treatment for asthma. Cytos believed that CYT003-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) would inhibit type 2 helper T (Th2) cells, which play a key role in the development of the most common form of the condition, allergic asthma. However, CYT003 failed a Phase IIb trial last year by missing several endpoints, pushing the company into layoffs and liquidation. The company eliminated its debt earlier this year through a restructuring in which the company converted all bonds held by investors into equity shares and settled claims with the bondholders. CYT003, a product derived from the cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) class of oligonucleotides, activates the immune system via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). According to Checkmate, the TLR9 agonist CpG DNA has been the strongest at activating anti-tumor Cytolytic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) thus far. Checkmate says it sees promise in fighting cancer through a combination of two mechanisms: CpG DNA to activate the CTL response and checkpoint inhibition to release the tumor s braking mechanism against the immune system. The company asserts that CYT003 has the potential to improve efficacy outcomes and broaden the size of the populations that can benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapies. CYT003 had demonstrated a good safety profile and evidence of immune activity in more than 700 patients treated to date, Checkmate noted. CpG DNA was discovered in 1994 by Arthur M. Krieg, M.D., who is Checkmate s founder and has been CEO since December 2014. Checkmate, a privately-held company based in Cambridge, MA, emerged from stealth mode today by announcing it has closed on $20 million in series A financing from Sofinnova Ventures and venBio. Checkmate has worked to validate an approach that will combine the ability of CpG DNA to activate an anti-tumor T cell response with checkpoint inhibition to overcome a tumor s ability to mute the immune response. Cytos  VLP platform is based on bacteriophage Q beta-derived (Qb) virus-like particles, with desired antigens capable via chemical linkers of being directionally conjugated to the VLP surface, and presented in a highly ordered fashion to B-cells.  Our data indicate that CYT003 and the VLP technology platform will enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, addressing a critical unmet therapeutic need in immuno-oncology and providing a better set of treatment options for patients with cancer,  Dr. Krieg said in a statement issued by Checkmate. Cytos said it may receive up to $90 million tied to achieving development milestones, as well as up to double-digit royalties on net sales from successfully developed products.","Published: August 13, 2015"
2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/better-estimates-of-worldwide-mercury-pollution-187983,Better Estimates of Worldwide Mercury Pollution New findings show Asia produces twice as much mercury emissions as previously thought  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Once mercury is emitted into the atmosphere from the smokestacks of power plants, the pollutant has a complicated trajectory; even after it settles onto land and sinks into oceans, mercury can be re-emitted back into the atmosphere repeatedly. This so-called  grasshopper effect  keeps the highly toxic substance circulating as  legacy emissions  that, combined with new smokestack emissions, can extend the environmental effects of mercury for decades. Now an international team led by MIT researchers has conducted a new analysis that provides more accurate estimates of sources of mercury emissions around the world. The analysis pairs measured air concentrations of mercury with a global simulation to calculate the fraction of mercury that is either re-emitted or that originates from power plants and other anthropogenic activities. The result of this work, researchers say, could improve estimates of mercury pollution, and help refine pollution-control strategies around the world. The new analysis shows that Asia now releases a surprisingly large amount of anthropogenic mercury. While its increased burning of coal was known to exacerbate mercury emissions and air pollution, the MIT team estimates that Asia produces more than double the mercury emissions previously estimated. Noelle Selin, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Associate Professor in MIT s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, says the new analysis can also give scientists a better idea of how long legacy emissions - mercury re-emitted by the land and ocean - stick around in the atmosphere. This is because the analysis can more accurately calculate the total amount emitted by land and ocean sources.  The timescale under which mercury circulates in the environment tells us about how fast we ll recover if we limit mercury emissions,  Selin says.  We can better quantify mercury cycling with this method.  Selin and Shaojie Song, a graduate student in EAPS, have published their results in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Top-down approachThe team s analysis improves on other models that take a bottom-up approach. Such models estimate mercury emissions for a region by considering factors such as the amount of coal burned in a power plant and the types of equipment in a plant used to control emissions. Models then often extrapolate data from a few sources to apply to an entire region. However, there are a number of uncertainties with such bottom-up modeling, and it s often difficult to obtain the required data from individual power plants. Instead, Selin and Song s analysis takes a top-down approach, combining bottom-up estimates with actual measurements of mercury emissions from monitoring stations around the world. In their analysis, the team took bottom-up estimates of mercury emissions from a 2010 emissions inventory by the United Nations - a frequently used source of estimated anthropogenic emissions around the world. The researchers plugged these emissions into a global mercury transport model called GEOS-Chem - a model originally developed by Selin that has since been used widely to track how mercury circulates through the land, ocean, and air. The GEOS-Chem model essentially divides the atmosphere into many small boxes. After plugging in bottom-up estimates of mercury emissions, the researchers ran the model to simulate the chemical and physical processes that act to circulate mercury within and between boxes. They then obtained actual measurements of mercury emissions taken from monitoring stations around the world. They compared each station s measurements with the model s estimates for the corresponding box in which the station was located.  We can definitely see some differences, which tells us the emissions may be wrong in some places,  Song says. Assessing policy levers to address mercuryFor locations where the measured and modeled emissions did not match up, the group used a Bayesian inversion method - a mathematical probability theory that combines observations with prior knowledge to model uncertainty. With this method, Selin and Song determined, for each station s location, the quantitative contribution of mercury sources that would make up the total measured concentrations. For example, a location in the middle of the ocean, far from any terrestrial sources, is more likely to see mercury emissions that are re-emitted from the ocean, rather than from terrestrial or anthropogenic sources. Then, in a first application of these techniques to global mercury concentrations, they used this quantitative approach to calculate what measured concentrations implied about their sources. By their calculations, the researchers estimated that, worldwide, Asia could produce up to 1,770 tons of mercury emissions per year - more than twice the amount estimated by bottom-up models.  It was higher than we expected,  Selin says.  Given the pollution in China and India and increased use of coal, it does make sense. It wasn t an out-of-the-ballpark result, but it does give you some pause to think about how much mercury could be coming out of Asia.  In related work published this spring, Selin s research group assessed how a new U.N. treaty could affect future mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants in Asia. They concluded that future emissions controls would have both global and domestic benefits. In their more recent top-down analysis, the team also found that fewer mercury emissions came from terrestrial sources, meaning the land re-emitted a smaller amount of legacy emissions than expected - a small silver lining in a world of continuing mercury pollution, according to Selin.  That means that legacy mercury is a smaller fraction of present-day mercury emissions than we thought, which means that the policy lever for addressing mercury pollution through controlling current emissions is slightly larger,  Selin says.  You still have to worry a lot about legacy emissions, but we could recover a bit more quickly because they are a smaller fraction of the total. ","Published: August 13, 2015"

Doing so might open therapeutic avenues to halt vision loss or even restore sight in people who have macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in people over 50.  Apte, the Paul Cibis Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the School of Medicine, has spent years studying the immune system in the eye to distinguish changes related to aging from those related to disease. In earlier work, he found that a cell-signaling molecule, called interleukin-10 (IL10), plays a role in the formation of blood vessels involved in the  wet  form of macular degeneration, which is more frequently linked to blindness than the  dry  form of the disease.Before vision loss occurs, IL10 levels increase in the eye, as do the number of specific immune cells, called M2 macrophages. These macrophages are known to contribute to the development of damaging blood vessel growth beneath the retina. Until now, though, how IL10 actually contributed to the proliferation of macrophages and damaging blood vessels wasn t well understood. So Apte and his colleagues engineered mice in which various cell-signaling pathways were disabled. Those experiments led them to discover that a specific signaling pathway involving a protein called STAT3 was activating and altering immune cells in the eye, and those cells then spurred the formation of harmful blood vessels. Further, they examined eye tissue from patients treated in the 1980s and 1990s, when surgery to remove abnormal blood vessels from underneath the retina was routinely performed on patients with the wet form of macular degeneration. There, too, the same STAT3 protein that was abundant and active in M2 macrophages in mice also was found in high levels in the human tissue. The findings suggest that the causes of damaging blood vessel growth in people are the same as what the researchers had observed in mouse models, Apte said. In both mice and in patients, abnormal blood vessel growth was linked to macrophages with high levels of the active form of STAT3. That a cause of significant vision loss appears to be the same in mice and people is good news, Apte explained, because some compounds can disrupt the actions of STAT3 in mice and keep the pathway from spurring blood vessel growth. Those same compounds may alter the course of macular degeneration in people with the condition.  Now that we have a better idea of how these macrophages are activated at the molecular level, we may be able to use those drugs to halt or reverse the disease process,  Apte said.","Published: August 13, 2015"

""Currently, there is no imaging technology in clinical use that can detect tumors or metastases smaller than 2 millimeters in diameter,"" said Zheng-Rong Lu, professor of biomedical engineering and leader of the research. ""This can detect them as small as 300 microns--a few hundred cells."" Metastasis is the most common cause of breast cancer deaths. Scientists believe early detection and treatment of primary and metastatic tumors increases the chances of survival.Lu spent a decade developing and testing imaging agents. He worked with Case Western Reserve University research associate Dr. Zhuxian Zhou, PhD students Mohammed Qutaish, Zheng Han, Rebecca Schur and Yiqiao Liu and fellow biomedical engineering professor David Wilson. The key to earlier detection is a small peptide gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent that binds to molecular markers, called fibrin-fibronectin complexes. The complexes are expressed in high-risk primary tumors and metastases. The small peptide is a chain of five amino acids. Called CERKA for short, the peptide doesn't attach to healthy tissues. But in metastatic tumors and aggressive primary tumors--especially those preparing to metastasize--more fibronectin is expressed and more image contrast generated, the researchers found. ""We not only detect the tumor, but detect it's aggressiveness,"" Lu said. The engineers tested the agent on mice bearing breast cancer metastases. Signals generated during a molecular MRI showed the agent was effective at delineating primary tumors and micrometastases in the lung, liver, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone and brain as small as 300 micrometers. The agent increased the signal output from metastases by 77 percent to 122 percent. The engineers confirmed the findings using Wilson's high-resolution fluorescence cryo-imaging system, which is sensitive enough to identify single cancer cells, but unusable on human patients. Lu and his colleagues plan to pursue tests proving the agent is safe and hope to begin clinical trials within three years. A biodistribution test previously done showed the agent clears the body in eight hours, about the same time as current clinical contrast agents. The researchers are also working to make the agent more tumor-specific, starting with tweaking the technology to detect prostate cancer.","Published: August 13, 2015"

If it cannot, the defective components pile up and the cell becomes sick and dies. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) have learned how a mutation in the gene for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which causes ALS, leads cells to accumulate damaged materials. The study suggests a potential target for treating this familial form of ALS. More than 12,000 Americans have ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig s disease, and roughly 5-10 percent of them inherited a genetic mutation from a parent. These cases of familial ALS are often caused by mutations in the gene that codes for SOD1, an important enzyme located in the neuron s mitochondria, the cell s energy-producing structures. This mutation causes the death of motor neurons that control the patient s muscles, resulting in progressive paralysis. About 90 percent of the energy in the brain is generated by mitochondria,  said Zu-Hang Sheng, Ph.D., an NINDS scientist and the study s senior author.  If the mitochondria aren t healthy, they produce energy less efficiently; they can also release harmful chemicals called reactive oxygen species that cause cell death. As a consequence, mitochondrial damage can cause neurodegeneration.  In healthy neurons, storage containers called late endosomes collect damaged mitochondria and various destructive chemicals. A motor protein called dynein then transports the endosomes to structures called lysosomes, which use the chemicals to break down the endosomes. Dr. Sheng s team discovered that this crucial process is faulty in nerve cells with SOD1 mutations because mutant SOD1 interferes with a critical molecule called snapin that hooks the endosome to the dynein motor protein.  Snapin functions as an adaptor to link the dynein protein to the endosome for transport,  Dr. Sheng said.  If you block snapin function, the endosome will be stuck and the lysosomes will lose their ability to destroy damaged mitochondria.  Dr. Sheng and his colleagues conducted their experiments in mice engineered to have an ALS mutation in their SOD1 genes. Using light and electron microscopes, the study s co-first author, Yuxiang Xie, Ph.D., observed a buildup of damaged mitochondria in the mutant animals  motor nerve fibers. This accumulation was present even in early stages of the disease before overt symptoms emerged.  Mutant SOD1 mice are the best-studied models we have for ALS,  Dr. Sheng said.  The effects are very similar to the symptoms found in human patients.  Snapin attaches dynein to the endosomes via a part of the protein called the dynein intermediate chain (DIC). In spinal cord motor neurons from the affected mice, Dr. Sheng s team found that the altered SOD1 binds to the DIC and prevents snapin from doing so. Increasing the amount of snapin in these neurons during the early, asymptomatic stage of the disease corrected the problem and reduced the buildup of defective mitochondria. This helped the motor neurons to survive longer and slightly increased the animals  lifespans. It also slowed down the loss of motor coordination, which worsens in animals with the SOD1 mutation as motor neurons die.  We provide a new mechanistic link that explains why mutant SOD1 impairs endosome transport,  Dr. Sheng said.  This can provide a cellular target for future development of early therapeutic interventions when motor neurons may still be salvageable.  Dr. Sheng s study was the first in the ALS research field to examine endosome transport in cultured motor neurons taken from adult mice models rather than from mouse embryos. The study s other first author, Bing Zhou, Ph.D., undertook this technically challenging innovation because adult motor neurons are a much better model for studying diseases like ALS in which symptoms develop in adulthood.  By using adult motor neurons from the mice models, we found this transport defect,  Dr. Sheng said.  This model may be useful not only for studying ALS but also other adult-onset diseases that cause neurodegeneration. ","Published: August 13, 2015"

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/diabetes-can-cause-immune-system-malfunction-192368,Diabetes Can Cause Immune System Malfunction Case Western Reserve scientists show how sugar derived molecules can weaken infection fighting antimicrobial beta defensin peptides   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Case Western Reserve scientists may have uncovered a molecular mechanism that sets into motion dangerous infection in the feet and hands often occurring with uncontrolled diabetes. It appears that high blood sugar unleashes destructive molecules that interfere with the body s natural infection-control defenses. The harmful molecules   dicarbonyls   are breakdown products of glucose that interfere with infection-controlling antimicrobial peptides known as beta-defensins. The Case Western Reserve team discovered how two dicarbonyls   methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO)   alter the structure of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) peptides, hobbling their ability to fight inflammation and infection. Their laboratory in vitro findings could ultimately contribute important insights into developing and enhancing antimicrobial peptide drugs for people with diabetes who have hard-to-control infections and wounds that are slow to heal.  If our findings hold up in future in vivo animal experiments and in human tissues, we will have solid evidence for how this dicarbonyl mechanism works in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes to weaken hBD-2 function, and that of other beta-defensins,  said senior author Wesley M. Williams, PhD, who conducted the research in the Department of Biological Sciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine.  First author Janna Kiselar, PhD, concurs.  Our in vitro findings alone could have a significant impact on development of more effective antimicrobial treatment strategies for patients with uncontrolled diabetes,  said Kiselar, the assistant director and instructor at the Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.  The findings also emphasize the importance of lowering high blood sugar and keeping it under control.  Critical to the research was the mass spectral analysis (LCMSMS) and the in vitro, petri dish experiments at the lab bench. Mass spectral analysis involves interpreting a pattern in the distribution of ions by a body of matter, known as mass, and then individual molecules are identified within a range (or segment) of the mass, known as mass spectra. Kiselar and Williams collaborated on experiments that compared the mass spectra, the bacterial-killing potential and the immune cell-attracting ability of dicarbonyl-treated hBD-2 with untreated hBD-2. This beta-defensin was initially exposed to the activities of two key dicarbonyls   MGO and GO, both of which are known to increase in humans with high blood sugar. Mass spectral analysis showed that MGO was the more reactive of the two dicarbonyls, so subsequent bacteria-killing and chemotactic experiments were performed by exposing hBD-2 to MGO. First the investigators compared the mass spectra for the dicarbonyl-exposed hBD-2 with untreated hBD-2. In the dicarbonyl-exposed hBD-2, they found that in addition to binding to several other amino acid residues, the dicarbonyl irreversibly binds to two positively charged arginine amino acids located near the surface of the hBD-2 peptide. The importance of positive or negative charges in a protein is that they can significantly influence the protein s function.  The effect of these arginine charges is substantial because they may influence how that protein interacts with other compounds and with cells, including bacteria. Increasing or decreasing the positive charge or negative charge in a protein could alter the function of that protein, depending on where those charges are located within the protein. Next, the investigators compared dicarbonyl-treated hBD-2 to untreated hBD-2 in their ability to kill gram-negative bacteria. The untreated hBD-2 is quite effective in killing gram-negative bacteria, while dicarbonyl-exposed hBD-2 greatly impaired this defensin s ability to stop the onslaught of bacteria.  In the petri dish of hBD-2 treated with dicarbonyl, we saw a roughly 50 percent reduction in the ability of hBD-2 to inhibit growth or kill the bacteria,  Williams said.  It was a significant loss of function, and we saw this effect quite visually. Experiments were repeated multiple times using several bacterial strains, and we found a loss of function in all cases. It establishes that the antimicrobial function was being significantly impeded by the MGO dicarbonyl.  Finally, investigators examined the effects of MGO on hBD-2 s critical role in an early-stage immune system response. Defensins such as hBD-2 not only inhibit entry into the body of microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, but they also post an alert to the immune system about the invader. The adaptive and innate features of the immune system can then identify the microbe for destruction now and into the future. Defensins work, in part, through chemoattraction of specific immune cells in order to activate the next stage of the immune response, called adaptive immunity. To test the chemoattraction effect, Kiselar and Williams, in collaboration with George Dubyak, PhD, professor of physiology and biophysics, examined the effects of dicarbonyl on the chemoattraction capabilities of hBD-2. Usually, specific human immune cells are responsive and attracted by hBD-2. In the cells exposed to the MGO-treated hBD-2, the beta-defensin lost much of its ability to initiate chemoattraction. As for next steps in the research, studies in animal models or human tissues will be needed to verify the in vitro findings about the harmful effects of dicarbonyl on the beta-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides, particularly among people with diabetes who have uncontrolled high blood sugar, commonly known as hyperglycemia. Additionally, human antimicrobial peptides other than the beta-defensins may also be affected negatively by a dicarbonyl attack, thus reducing both their antimicrobial and chemoattractive functions.  The body does have defense mechanisms against molecules such as dicarbonyl, but with a chronic disease such as diabetes, the effectiveness of these defense mechanisms responsible for keeping dicarbonyl levels under control may be overwhelmed,  Williams said.  The result may be dicarbonyl accumulation that could eventually overwhelm the ability of beta-defensins to effectively control inflammation and infection.  For now, control of blood sugar through diet and medicine can hold the dicarbonyl-beta defensins dynamic at bay. The need is great for the development of effective antimicrobial peptides and antihyperglycemia drugs and medications with fewer or more tolerable side effects that would help to neutralize the dicarbonyl pathway.  Approximately 29.1 million Americans   9.3 percent   have diabetes,  Williams said.  These are individuals who might benefit from improved efficacy of beta-defensin function. Exactly how this will be done remains ill defined at present, but blood sugar control, either through life-style changes (exercise and diet) or medication, would be a logical approach to minimizing infection in diabetes. We hope our findings will contribute to a solution. ","Published: August 13, 2015"

Chemicals from pipe bowls and stems which had been excavated from Shakespeare' garden and adjacent areas were identified and quantified during the forensic study. The artefacts for the study were on loan from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. The gas technique is very sensitive to residues that can be preserved in pipes even if they had been smoked 400 years ago. What were they smoking There were several kinds of tobacco in the 17th century, including the North American Nicotiana (from which we get nicotine), and cocaine (Erythroxylum), which is obtained from Peruvian coca leaves. It has been claimed that Sir Francis Drake may have brought coca leaves to England after his visit to Peru, just as Sir Walter Raleigh had brought  tobacco leaves  (Nicotiana) from Virginia in North America. In a recent issue of a magazine called Country Life, Mark Griffiths has stimulated great interest in John Gerard s Herbal, published in 1597 as a botanical book which includes engraved images of several people in the frontispiece. One of them (cited as  The Fourth Man ) is identified by Griffiths as William Shakespeare, but this identification is questionable. Possibly, the engraving represents Sir Francis Drake, who knew Gerard. Gerard s Herbal refers to various kinds of  tobacco  introduced to Europe by Drake and Raleigh in the days of Shakespeare in Elizabethan England. There certainly is a link between Drake and plants from the New World, notably corn, the potato and  tobacco . Furthermore, one can associate Raleigh with the introduction of  tobacco  to Europe from North America (notably in the context of the tobacco plant called Nicotiana, from Virginia and elsewhere). What we found There was unquestionable evidence for the smoking of coca leaves in early 17th century England, based on chemical evidence from two pipes in the Stratford-upon-Avon area. Neither of the pipes with cocaine came from Shakepeare s garden. But four of the pipes with cannabis did. Results of this study (including 24 pipe fragments) indicated cannabis in eight samples, nicotine in at least one sample, and in two samples definite evidence for Peruvian cocaine from coca leaves. Shakespeare may have been aware of the deleterious effects of cocaine as a strange compound. Possibly, he preferred cannabis as a weed with mind-stimulating properties. These suggestions are based on the following literary indications. In Sonnet 76, Shakespeare writes about  invention in a noted weed . This can be interpreted to mean that Shakespeare was willing to use  weed  (cannabis as a kind of tobacco) for creative writing ( invention ). In the same sonnet it appears that he would prefer not to be associated with  compounds strange , which can be interpreted, at least potentially, to mean  strange drugs  (possibly cocaine). Sonnet 76 may relate to complex wordplay relating in part to drugs (compounds and  weed ), and in part to a style of writing, associated with clothing ( weeds ) and literary compounds (words combined to form one, as in the case of the word  Philsides  from Philip Sidney). Was Shakespeare high? Chemical analyses of residues in early 17th-century clay  tobacco pipes  have confirmed that a diversity of plants was smoked in Europe. Literary analyses and chemical science can be mutually beneficial, bringing the arts and the sciences together in an effort to better understand Shakespeare and his contemporaries. This has also begged the question whether the plays of Shakespeare were performed in Elizabethan England in a smoke-filled haze? One can well imagine the scenario in which Shakespeare performed his plays in the court of Queen Elizabeth, in the company of Drake, Raleigh and others who smoked clay pipes filled with  tobacco .","Published: August 13, 2015"

Their approach detects micrometastases, breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body. The approach may offer an improved way to detect early recurrence of breast cancer in women and men. The work was completed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland and was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of the National Institutes of Health.  MRI has a wide array of diagnostic applications and shows promise in breast cancer detection and treatment monitoring,  said Richard Conroy, Ph.D., director of NIBIB Division of Applied Science and Technology.  The technique used by researchers in this study enables very early detection of metastatic spread, which would allow adaptation of treatment more quickly and hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future.  The study, published online in the Aug. 12, 2015, issue of Nature Communications, was led by Zheng-Rong Lu, Ph.D., CWRU M. Frank Rudy and Margaret Domiter Rudy Professor of biomedical engineering and an expert in molecular imaging for cancer and other diseases.  We showed with this technique that we can detect very tiny tumors of just a few hundred cells,  Lu said, adding that the study pushed imaging boundaries, revealing smaller cancers than can be detected with current clinical imaging modalities.  Our imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low-risk tumors. These are two things that potentially can make a big impact on clinical practice and also management of cancer.  One-third of patients diagnosed with breast cancer eventually develop metastases in distant organs, with an increased risk of death. Breast cancer has a high rate of metastasis to bone, lung, liver, lymph nodes, and the brain. Since small, early-stage cancers are the most responsive to drug treatments, screening is an important aspect of follow-up care for breast cancer patients, and early detection is critical in tailoring appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions. While multiple imaging techniques, including MRI, are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management, they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth. The earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases. As the name implies, they are often too small to be detected with standard screening. Dr. Lu s team used a biochemical approach combined with MRI to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases. To detect micrometastases, Lu and his team used MRI imaging - which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images   and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution. The contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein, or peptide, tagged with a minuscule magnet. They chose the peptide - a chain of just five amino acids - for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells, called fibrin-fibronectin complexes. More importantly, the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cell s transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth, migration and differentiation. Fibronectin is associated with high-risk breast cancer with poor prognosis. The researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors. Metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the MRI process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein.  The primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis,  Lu said.  By also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide, the biomarker is enhanced, generating enough signal for MRI detection of small, high-risk cancer and micrometastases.  The researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells. After a two-week waiting period, the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed MRI. The MRI imaging detected metastatic tumors, including micrometastases, in lung, liver, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone, and brains of the mice. Analysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes, producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue. Using a microscopic imaging approach, called cryo-imaging, and MRI, the researchers verified that the MRI technique could detect micrometastases, even observing bone micrometastases that were less than 0.5mm - the diameter of a very fine pencil lead. Prior to their study with this contrast agent, Lu s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging, which is essential for safe clinical use. Their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use.  The recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important,  said Lu, adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection.  We think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic. It could also become useful as a non-invasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress.  The team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years. They will then pursue human trials with this approach.","Published: August 13, 2015"

To rectify this, scientists are coming up with an objective test as an alternative to patient interviews. This test could help clinicians distinguish between the two -- and provide better treatment. One of the reasons bipolar disorder is commonly mistaken for major depressive disorder is because the condition often first becomes noticeable when the patient has a bout of depression. And, as bipolar disorder only affects about 1 percent of the population worldwide, clinicians sometimes forget to ask about hypomania, a euphoric, hyperactive state that also characterizes the condition. Current diagnostic techniques involve structured interviews with patients, but these can be subjective and misleading. An accurate diagnosis, however, is crucial to quickly getting patients the treatment they need. So researcher Peng Xie and colleagues set out to develop an objective way to tell the difference between major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The researchers combined a couple of techniques -- gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance -- to analyze urine metabolites in samples from patients who either had major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. From these results, they identified a panel of six biomarkers with an 89 to 91 percent chance of predicting each disorder.","Published: August 13, 2015"

When damaged, they leak destructive molecules that can cause substantial harm and eventually kill brain cells. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) showed that a protein called PINK1 that is implicated in Parkinson s disease is critical for helping cells get rid of dysfunctional mitochondria. According to the new research, published in the journal Nature, PINK1 does this by triggering an intricate process called mitophagy that breaks down and removes damaged mitochondria from the cell.  PINK1 is a flag of damaged mitochondria,  said Richard Youle, Ph.D., the head of the Biochemistry Section of NINDS and the study s senior author.  It identifies which mitochondria need to be eliminated to keep cells healthy. Mutations in PINK1 and its partner molecule Parkin cause hereditary forms of Parkinson s disease. Moreover, the inability to remove defective mitochondria from nerve cells has been linked to numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including the more common forms of Parkinson s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Scientists previously considered Parkin essential to destroying damaged mitochondria, but Dr. Youle s team discovered that PINK1 can initiate this process without Parkin.  This changes the model we had previously, and relegates Parkin to an amplifier that increases the mitophagy signal triggered by PINK1,  Dr. Youle said. The group learned that PINK1 recruits two proteins called Optineurin and NDP52 to the surface of mitochondria. These proteins, in turn, recruit a variety of other protein molecules that mark the mitochondria for degradation. Optineurin and NDP52 are members of a group of proteins called autophagy receptors. When the researchers created cells that contained no autophagy receptors, they found that the cells could not dispose of malfunctioning mitochondria. However, when the group restored the function of either Optineurin or NDP52, the cells regained this ability. Reinstating other autophagy receptors had little or no effect.  Knowing that Optineurin and NDP52 are the primary autophagy receptors involved in this process can inform us about the cause of different human diseases,  Dr. Youle said.  For example, Optineurin is mutated in ALS and also in certain forms of glaucoma, whereas NDP52 is known to be mutated in Crohn s disease. This suggests that problems with mitophagy may be involved in those diseases.  When PINK1 accumulates on the surface of defective mitochondria, it alters a molecule called ubiquitin. The modified ubiquitin then recruits autophagy receptors as well as Parkin. Parkin promotes mitophagy by bringing more ubiquitin to the mitochondria to form long chains that flag damaged mitochondria for removal. Since PINK1 is needed to start building these ubiquitin chains, Dr. Youle s work suggests a new avenue for creating drugs that treat disease by boosting the disposal of damaged mitochondria.  A number of companies are trying to develop drugs to activate this pathway,  Dr. Youle said.  Some of them are trying to find drugs that activate Parkin, but this new model might suggest a different strategy. It may not be so important to activate Parkin; it may be more important to activate PINK1.  This work was supported by the NINDS Division of Intramural Research.","Published: August 13, 2015"

When the switch is on, the loss of sight in one eye will be compensated by the other eye, but also by tactile input from the whiskers. When the switch is off, only the other eye will take over. These findings may help improve patient susceptibility to sensory prosthetics such as cochlear implants or bionic eyes.   Our brain adjusts to changes of all kind. This brain plasticity is useful for neural development and learning, but also comes into play when the nervous system is damaged. For instance, when we lose sight in one eye, our brain no longer receives sensory input from that eye, but it will compensate for that loss. Research in adult mice has revealed two types of neuroplasticity in response to vision loss.  When a mouse loses sight in one eye, the remaining eye starts sending additional signals to the area in the brain that used to be served by the lost eye,  biochemist Julie Nys from the KU Leuven Laboratory for Neuroplasticity and Neuroproteomics explains.  After a while, the whiskers of the mouse   its sense of touch   step in as well. After a couple of weeks, the  lost  area in the brain is entirely reclaimed and its brain activity is almost as high as it was before.  This phenomenon, whereby the brain responds to sensory loss by combining input from several sensory systems, is known as cross-modal neuroplasticity. The KU Leuven researchers discovered that cross-modal plasticity is age-dependent in an unexpected way:  In adult mice both the remaining eye and the whiskers compensate for the lack of vision in one eye. But in adolescent mice, only the functioning eye takes over. And yet, you would expect more plasticity in younger animals, because the brain undergoes major transformations during adolescence.  What is more, the study shows that the adolescent response can also be triggered in the brain of adult mice.  When you expose adult mice to darkness before removing their eye, they recover differently: their other senses take over to a smaller degree, similar to what happens in adolescent mice. The brain s response, in other words, rejuvenates when adult mice spend time in the dark.  The brain controls which senses compensate for the loss of sight in one eye, but the underlying process has always been a mystery   until now.  Adolescent and adult mice have the same brain structure, so that cannot explain their different responses to sensory loss. Instead, we discovered a molecular on-off switch that controls whether or not the whiskers take over.   After comparing different molecules with an impact on brain activity, we decided to manipulate neuroplasticity with indiplon, a sedative that affects the communication between brain cells and is thus similar to the activity-reducing neurotransmitter GABA. In adult mice, indiplon suppressed cross-modal plasticity: the lack of vision in one eye was compensated by the remaining eye, but not by the whiskers. You could say that we managed to  turn off  the whiskers.  In view of medical applications, the new insights into neuroplasticity   involving one or more senses   are crucial, Professor Lut Arckens explains:  Deaf or hard-of-hearing people can benefit from cochlear implants. In young patients who were treated in time, these work very well. In other patients, however, the treatment is no longer effective, as the auditory areas in their brain have already been taken over by other senses. This outcome is difficult to reverse, but we might be able to prevent it by suppressing cross-modal plasticity. In other cases, by contrast, we could support optimal recovery by boosting cross-modal plasticity. But these applications require a lot of further research. Our study paves the way by showing that we need to pay more attention to how sensory systems influence each other in the brain, for instance after surgery.  KU Leuven   press release Arckens L et al.

UBC research team Christian Naus, Wun Chey Sin and John Bechberger study glioma, the most aggressive form of adult brain cancer. Glioma has a median survival of about 15 months and a two-year survival rate of 30 per cent because it is difficult to completely remove cancer cells without compromising brain functions and chemotherapy and radiotherapy do not prevent the regrowth of remaining cancer cells. With this new research, the team reveals an alternative route to rein in the glioma cancer cells. The cancerous cells mingle with astrocytes, a type of cell that regulates the environment in the brain to create favorable conditions for brain functions. The research team found that glioma cells can reprogram the astrocytes with little pieces of genetic code (microRNAs). Those codes act as master switches, turning specific sets of genes on and off.  This is the first evidence that microRNA can go from glioma cells into astrocytes and reprogram them to provide an altered environment that stimulates tumor growth and invasion,  said Naus, a professor in the Department of Cellular & Physiological Sciences in the Life Sciences Institute and an investigator with the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health.The findings were recently published in three related papers in the journals Oncogene and Oncotarget. The research was also highlighted in a recent interdisciplinary project,  Fashioning Cancer: A Correlation Between Destruction and Beauty,  where images of brain cancer were used to highlight public awareness, as well as raise funds for cancer research.

The importance of the receptor, called mGluR5, in other areas of the brain had been previously established. Until now, however, no one had studied their specific role in a cell type known as parvalbumin-positive interneurons, thought to be important in general cognition and generating certain types of oscillatory wave patterns in the brain. ""We found that without this receptor in the parvalbumin cells, mice have many serious behavioral deficits,"" says Terrence Sejnowski, head of Salk's Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, which led the research published in Molecular Psychiatry. ""And a lot of them really mimic closely what we see in schizophrenia."" Scientists had previously discovered that when molecular signaling was disrupted in these cells during development, the brain's networks didn't form correctly. Separate studies have revealed that mGluR5 receptors, which transmit glutamate signaling in the brain, are linked to addiction disorders, anxiety and Fragile X Syndrome. But, in these cases, mGluR5 is affected in excitatory cells, not inhibitory cells like the parvalbumin-positive interneurons. The Salk team wondered what the role of mGluR5 was in the parvalbumin cells since the cells were deemed so important in brain development. They partnered with Athina Markou's team from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, to examine what happened when the receptor was selectively deleted from these cells after the brain's initial formation. Without the receptor in these cells, they found, mice had a host of developmental problems, including obsessive, repetitive grooming behavior and anti-social tendencies. Moreover, the patterns of activity in the animals' brains resembled those seen in humans suffering from schizophrenia. ""This discovery implies that changes after birth, not just before birth, are affecting the way the network is set up,"" says Margarita Behrens, corresponding author and Salk staff scientist. The results suggest that an alteration in mGluR5 receptors in these brain cells may be a critical step in the formation of some neurodevelopmental disorders, adds Sejnowski. It's good news, he says, because the molecular change is potentially reversible. ""The cells are still alive, and if we can figure out how to go in and change some of these molecular switches, we might actually be able to put the cells back into healthy, functioning states,"" he says. Behrens says the study also should be a signal of caution to the pharmaceutical industry to be wary of drugs that affect mGluR5 throughout the whole brain. ""There are a lot of clinical trials ongoing looking at modulating mGluR5 for anxiety and Fragile X Syndrome,"" she says. ""But our results suggest that if you affect parvalbumin neurons, you might get behavioral changes you weren't expecting."" More research is needed to show whether the parvalbumin cells' mGluR5 receptors are linked to disease in humans and, if so, what causes the loss or disruption to the receptors.

However, scientists have struggled to fabricate the material into ultra-narrow strips, called nanoribbons that could enable the use of graphene in high-performance semiconductor electronics.   Now, University of Wisconsin-Madison engineers have discovered a way to grow graphene nanoribbons with desirable semiconducting properties directly on a conventional germanium semiconductor wafer. This advance could allow manufacturers to easily use graphene nanoribbons in hybrid integrated circuits, which promise to significantly boost the performance of next-generation electronic devices. The technology could also have specific uses in industrial and military applications, such as sensors that detect specific chemical and biological species and photonic devices that manipulate light.Michael Arnold, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at UW-Madison, Ph.D. student Robert Jacobberger, and their collaborators describe their new approach to producing graphene nanoribbons. Importantly, their technique can easily be scaled for mass production and is compatible with the prevailing infrastructure used in semiconductor processing. ""Graphene nanoribbons that can be grown directly on the surface of a semiconductor like germanium are more compatible with planar processing that's used in the semiconductor industry, and so there would be less of a barrier to integrating these really excellent materials into electronics in the future,"" Arnold says. Graphene, a sheet of carbon atoms that is only one atom in thickness, conducts electricity and dissipates heat much more efficiently than silicon, the material most commonly found in today's computer chips. But to exploit graphene's remarkable electronic properties in semiconductor applications where current must be switched on and off, graphene nanoribbons need to be less than 10 nanometers wide, which is phenomenally narrow. In addition, the nanoribbons must have smooth, well-defined ""armchair"" edges in which the carbon-carbon bonds are parallel to the length of the ribbon. Researchers have typically fabricated nanoribbons by using lithographic techniques to cut larger sheets of graphene into ribbons. However, this ""top-down"" fabrication approach lacks precision and produces nanoribbons with very rough edges. Another strategy for making nanoribbons is to use a ""bottom-up"" approach such as surface-assisted organic synthesis, where molecular precursors react on a surface to polymerize nanoribbons. Arnold says surface-assisted synthesis can produce beautiful nanoribbons with precise, smooth edges, but this method only works on metal substrates and the resulting nanoribbons are thus far too short for use in electronics. To overcome these hurdles, the UW-Madison researchers pioneered a bottom-up technique in which they grow ultra-narrow nanoribbons with smooth, straight edges directly on germanium wafers using a process called chemical vapor deposition. In this process, the researchers start with methane, which adsorbs to the germanium surface and decomposes to form various hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons react with each other on the surface, where they form graphene. Arnold's team made its discovery when it explored dramatically slowing the growth rate of the graphene crystals by decreasing the amount of methane in the chemical vapor deposition chamber. They found that at a very slow growth rate, the graphene crystals naturally grow into long nanoribbons on a specific crystal facet of germanium. By simply controlling the growth rate and growth time, the researchers can easily tune the nanoribbon width be to less than 10 nanometers.   ""What we've discovered is that when graphene grows on germanium, it naturally forms nanoribbons with these very smooth, armchair edges,"" Arnold says. ""The widths can be very, very narrow and the lengths of the ribbons can be very long, so all the desirable features we want in graphene nanoribbons are happening automatically with this technique.""  The nanoribbons produced with this technique start nucleating, or growing, at seemingly random spots on the germanium and are oriented in two different directions on the surface. Arnold says the team's future work will include controlling where the ribbons start growing and aligning them all in the same direction.  The researchers are patenting their technology through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. The research was primarily supported by the Department of Energy's Basic Energy Sciences program.  The Arnold group worked closely with various collaborators, including Nathan Guisinger at Argonne National Laboratory, Mark C. Hersam of Northwestern University, Richard Martel of the University of Montreal, and Patrick Desjardins of Polytechnique Montreal in addition to the research groups of Paul Evans and Max Lagally in the UW-Madison Department of Materials Science and Engineering, each of whom conducted important studies to determine the structure of the nanoribbons.

By studying the weakened flu virus that is the basis for the nasal spray vaccine in cells from human nasal and sinus cavities, the researchers say they have determined that the virus can be weakened (for young children) or strengthened (in older people) enough to create an appropriate immune response in people of all ages.  We think we can use our molecular, rational design approaches to make a better flu vaccine for people who really need it,  says study leader Andrew Pekosz, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.  We can do it in a sophisticated and accurate way, not in a blind manner, which is how these vaccines are usually developed.  Pekosz says he is particularly excited about being able to produce a better vaccine for older people since flu vaccines are less effective in people as they age and because those over the age of 60 are more likely to get the flu and more likely to suffer serious complications. One reason vaccines using weakened flu virus are not used in the elderly is that they have been exposed to many strains of flu virus over the years and have more antibodies in the nasal tract, which can inhibit the weakened flu virus from infecting and stimulating the immune response necessary to protect against the virus.  We don t have a really good effective vaccine in the elderly,  Pekosz says.  Even the injectable version doesn t work as well in that population. And they re the ones who need it the most. We hope our research can get us closer to having effective flu vaccines for any age.  Children ages six months to two years can receive an injectable flu vaccine, but the nasal spray vaccine is recommended in children between the ages of two and eight because it is believed to give better protection than the shot. For their research, Pekosz and his team, using human nasal tract cells, studied the weakened strain of the flu virus that is used in the nasal spray vaccine and compared its behavior with that of the flu virus itself. Using these nasal tract cells allowed the researchers to determine that the weakened flu virus behaved differently than previous research had suggested. He says that at the end of the life cycle of the weakened virus, virus-infected cells send out harmless, non-infectious particles that immune cells pick up and attack to create antibodies against an actual flu virus that could attempt to infect the body later. This response, however, was not as robust as the researchers imagined. To create the weakened flu strain contained in FluMist, the brand name of the nasal spray vaccine, nine mutations in the flu virus were made. Researchers previously believed that only five of them were relevant to creating the spray s immune response, but Pekosz says his new research suggests that all nine may be important. By making adjustments to those mutations, he believes that a stronger vaccine can be made without an increase in side effects. He says that a weaker one can also be made   one that still protects from flu   for children under two. Currently, there is a flu shot available for the elderly that has twice the dose of a regular flu shot. While this vaccine is more effective in the elderly, Pekosz says there is certainly room for improvement and a need for different vaccine options. Pekosz says his team is currently collaborating with MedImmune, the makers of the FluMist, to help develop a better vaccine based on these findings. He says if all goes well, he believes there could be a new vaccine to test within six to 12 months for both the oldest and youngest.","Published: August 12, 2015"

As a hybrid, the instrument combines the disciplines of nanospectroscopy and nanomechanical microscopy.  Our microscope offers a non-invasive rapid method to explore materials simultaneously for their chemical and physical properties,  Passian said.  It allows researchers to study the surface and subsurface of synthetic and biological samples, which is a capability that until now didn t exist.  ORNL s instrument retains all of the advantages of an atomic force microscope while simultaneously offering the potential for discoveries through its high resolution and subsurface spectroscopic capabilities. The originality of the instrument and technique lies in its ability to provide information about a material s chemical composition in the broad infrared spectrum of the chemical composition while showing the morphology of a material s interior and exterior with nanoscale   a billionth of a meter   resolution,  Passian said. Researchers will be able to study samples ranging from engineered nanoparticles and nanostructures to naturally occurring biological polymers, tissues and plant cells. The first application as part of DOE s BioEnergy Science Center was in the examination of plant cell walls under several treatments to provide submicron characterization. The plant cell wall is a layered nanostructure of biopolymers such as cellulose. Scientists want to convert such biopolymers to free the useful sugars and release energy. An earlier instrument, also invented at ORNL, provided imaging of poplar cell wall structures that yielded unprecedented topological information, advancing fundamental research in sustainable biofuels. Because of this new instrument s impressive capabilities, the researcher team envisions broad applications.  An urgent need exists for new platforms that can tackle the challenges of subsurface and chemical characterization at the nanometer scale,  said co-author Rubye Farahi.  Hybrid approaches such as ours bring together multiple capabilities, in this case, spectroscopy and high-resolution microscopy.  Looking inside, the hybrid microscope consists of a photonic module that is incorporated into a mode-synthesizing atomic force microscope. The modular aspect of the system makes it possible to accommodate various radiation sources such as tunable lasers and non-coherent monochromatic or polychromatic sources.","Published: August 12, 2015"

Liposomes are microscopic spheres with walls arranged in the same way as in cell membranes. They were first synthesized in 1960s. In the1970s, scientists proposed using liposomes for the delivery of drugs, and a variety of drugs are currently used in liposome form for the treatment of many diseases, including influenza and various kinds of malignant tumors.Thousands of publications have been devoted to liposomes. They are actively studied in a number of laboratories worldwide and the new article contains the most detailed list of the major achievements in this field. In it, the authors discuss:   modern methods for synthesizing liposomes, the strong and weak points of the different technologies;   the main types of liposomes and the different wall structures, along with the various complementary molecules used for selective interaction with cells;   different methods of drug delivery within liposomes. These artificial microspheres can either circulate in an organism for a long while, slowly emitting a drug, or release a drug immediately after collision with certain cells. Liposomes are able to carry out targeted delivery of substances to a necessary destination in the body. The concept of ""targeted delivery"" includes almost every aspect of pharmacological development, which no coincidence as, for example, during chemotherapy of cancer, only targeted delivery can decrease the severity of side effects of rather toxic drugs. Besides the targeted delivery, liposomes also have other interesting applications. For example, with their help a new drug form for diclofenac, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is currently being developed. The same drug can be produced in different forms. A drug designed for a small child will most likely be developed in the form of a syrup rather than a tablet, while ointments, creams, and gels are applied locally. Each of these is a different form of the same drug. If diclofenac is placed in a liposome together with a substance that increases skin permeability, the resulting ointment with such microcapsules will be more effective in the treatment of local inflammatory reactions. Liposomes can be even be used for anesthetics such as lidocaine by the facilitation of its delivery towards nerve endings. Along with experimental drugs for cancer, liposomes can improve drugs known even to non-specialists. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSIAD) are the basis of the majority of widely used over-the-counter remedies against pain. They include aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol, and the already mentioned diclofenac being marketed under the brand name of Voltaren. All of these drugs work at the expense of the suppression of biochemical reactions that lead to the development of inflammation. However, they do not remove the cause and, therefore, do not eliminate the need to visit a doctor. Apart from the delivery of drugs, the authors of the new review briefly describe the uses of liposomes for other purposes. With their help, it is possible to deliver specific markers for both diagnostic and research tests to cells, while liposome gel (groups of microscopic beads) with special experimental molecules can be used for the chemical analysis of different substances. In Russia and Ukraine The main author of the new review, Vladimir Torchilin, is one of the founders of liposomal research in Russia, the 1982 laureate of the Lenin prize, author of more than four hundred scientific publications (Hirsh index over 70), and a recognized expert in the field. At the end of the 1970s, Soviet researchers began conducting practical research in the area of liposomal drug production and sometime later a selection of drugs was released in Kharkov by the Biolek company. Currently, lipodox, an anti-tumor drug (cytostatic - a substance that suppresses cell division, oxorubicin in liposomes), lipoflavon, ophthalmic drops (an anti-inflammatory agent) are produced on a large scale, while ten other potential drugs areundergoing different tests, including biological, laboratory and clinical. The mass production of liposomal drugs is presently being organized in the Moscow Region (Technology of Drugs, Vitaly Shevts, who is responsible for the development of liposomal research together with Vladimir Torchilin). One of the first practical applications of liposomal drugs was not in treatment but rather in disease diagnostics: diagnostic syphilis tests were created using liposomes. As Vladimir Chupin explained to the MIPT press service, these tests turned out to be more accurate than traditional ones. At MIPT Vladimir Chupin, Ph.D. in chemistry, head of the Biophysics Section at MIPT's Department of General and Applied Physics: ""I previously worked at the RAS Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry and before that I had graduated from the Lomonosov Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies and had conducted postgraduate study in the Netherlands.

One set of neurons degenerates, while a similar population nearby is spared the same degree of damage. Why the difference? An answer to this question could clear the way for preventions and treatments for this disease, which impairs movement. Using a new strategy they have devised to identify the molecular changes that drive the loss of neurons, researchers at The Rockefeller University and colleagues at Columbia University have identified two proteins they report may be important to Parkinson s. These two gene-regulating molecules appear to have a protective effect in the set of neurons most affected by the disease, and when their activity wanes, disease sets in. This discovery suggests new avenues by which the disease might be prevented or treated. Within a dying nerve cell, the levels of hundreds of proteins change,  says study author Paul Greengard, Vincent Astor Professor and head of Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience.  Some of these shifts are consequences, others are causes. We set out to find which cause cell death among neurons.   Using a new combination of techniques,  Greengard adds,  we identified two of these so-called master regulatory molecules   a discovery that offers an unexpected explanation as to why one population of neurons degenerates in Parkinson s, while similar neighbors do not suffer from the same degree of degeneration.  Parkinson s disease often first shows up as a slight tremor of the hands, and progresses to affect speech, facial muscles, and other movements. This deterioration is caused by the progressive loss of neurons located in a midbrain region called the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These neurons produce dopamine, a molecule that transmits signals between neurons, and it is the loss of dopamine that causes the loss of motor control associated with Parkinson s. Some deterioration also occurs in the dopamine-producing neurons of a neighboring brain region, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the VTA neurons are much less affected than those of the SNpc. Typically, when scientists want to look for molecular changes associated with a condition they use genetic sequencing to create a profile of variations in gene expression. But with conventional profiling approaches it is difficult to pick out the changes that occur in a particular type of cell, and distinguish those that are truly important. It is also very hard to tell which changes arise from the master regulator genes, which can act as control dials turning their target genes up or down. To overcome these issues, the team led by first author Lars Brichta, a senior research associate in Greengard s lab, adapted a technique previously developed in Greengard s and Nathaniel Heintz s labs, which involves genetically engineering mice to capture the genetic messages being translated into proteins in a specific population of cells. They then mapped the interactions of regulator genes with their target genes in the mouse brain, and used this new tool to interpret the changes they documented between normal mice and those suffering from Parkinson s-like degeneration. This led them to two molecules: the proteins SATB1 and ZDHHC2, which are more abundant in the dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc versus the VTA. When the researchers reduced the abundance of these molecules in the brains of normal mice, rapid degeneration like that seen in Parkinson s disease followed.  Conventional gene activity profiling approaches would not have been able to identify SATB1 and ZDHHC2 as key protective factors because the levels of these proteins  do not change. But even though they continue to be expressed within the neurons, it appears that their regulatory activity drops off and they no longer stimulate their target genes,  Brichta says.  We later found similar changes in activity in the brains of Parkinson s patients, particularly those in the early stages.  Their findings also challenge the prevailing thought as to the molecular origins of Parkinson s: that VTA neurons had some sort of factor protecting them against the kind of degeneration seen in the SNpc.  In an unexpected contradiction to current models, the proteins we found protect the SNpc. Because dopamine and its metabolites can be toxic, we can speculate that, in the course of evolution, SATB1 and ZDHHC2 arose to protect this particular set of sensitive neurons from cell death,  Greengard says.  The discovery of these two molecules  role in Parkinson s may assist in the development of treatments, because they are potential new targets for drugs.  The researchers believe their new strategy may also be useful in studies of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer s, spinal muscular atrophy, Huntington s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Published: August 12, 2015"

TruTags offer a unique solution for drug manufacturers, allowing a digital scan of a drug to confirm its authenticity and reveal provenance information such as manufacturing location, dosage, images of packaging, expiration date, supply chain data, and lot or batch number. WuXi and TruTag Technologies announced their alliance in 2014, including an investment by the WuXi Venture Fund in TruTag. TruTags have a number of benefits for pharmaceutical manufacturers that were confirmed in this joint testing:   TruTags can be applied to qualifying solid oral dosage form (SODF) products using a consistent, repeatable process.   No new manufacturing equipment and changes in manufacturing processes are needed.   After application on manufactured tablets, TruTags are successfully detected using TruTag's proprietary optical detection device.   Apart from this detection process, TruTags are covert and not visually identifiable and remain with the tablet for its entire life.   Once applied, the TruTag solution did not affect the stability or dissolution properties of API drugs in completed accelerated open and closed bottle testing.   Implementing the TruTag solution on existing drugs requires minimal regulatory reporting changes for drug manufacturers and complies with the physical-chemical identifier (PCID) guidance issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011. WuXi and TruTag will now begin further testing of TruTags on additional API products. They will also produce a technical white paper for the industry detailing the results of the application method and practice, the detection process and data collection, and outcomes of dissolution and stability testing. TruTag is already working with several multinational pharmaceutical companies in pilot testing for broad deployment of this technology in marketed SODF drugs and product candidates. ""We are very excited about these results,"" said Dr. Ge Li, Chairman and CEO of WuXi PharmaTech. ""At WuXi, we are always seeking cutting-edge solutions like TruTags to help support the development and protection of our customers' innovative products."" President of TruTag Technologies, commented, ""We are excited to confirm these results in testing conducted with our partner WuXi PharmaTech, an innovative company that values its customers' IP and patients' safety. We have demonstrated the ability of our technology to integrate an edible and safe identification code directly into an oral solid drug, thereby indelibly marking the product with an internal code for its lifetime. In the near term, this will allow drug manufacturers and distributors to have the ultimate audit of a drug's provenance and origin without reliance on packaging or laboratory chemical analysis."" ""One can think of TruTags as a form of edible PIATS, or Product Identification Authentication Tracking System, which can be embedded into a product like unique fingerprints,"" said Hank Wuh, MD, MPH, TruTag Technologies' Founder and Chairman. ""With our ability to securely identify individual goods without labels or packaging, we aim to dramatically improve the safety and traceability of critical products such as food and medicine and in the process to have a fundamental impact on big data.""","Published: August 12, 2015"

Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, according to the National Institutes of Health. miR-7, which is frequently decreased in gastric cancers, can stop the cancer cells from spreading to other tissues by inhibiting a particular growth factor receptor (called IGF1R). Whether miR-7 also suppresses earlier stages of gastric cancer is unknown, however, so researchers in China screened for new targets of the microRNA.Dai-Ming Fan and colleagues found that miR-7 directly targets the genes RELA and FOS, which encode proteins involved in the pro-oncogenic NF- B and AP-1 signaling pathways, respectively. In human gastric cancer samples, low miR-7 levels correlated with elevated levels of RELA and FOS proteins and poor patient survival. Increasing levels of miR-7 reduced RELA and FOS levels and inhibited tumor growth in mice. The researchers found that, as well as directly suppressing RELA expression, miR-7 could control the protein's activation by targeting its upstream kinase (IKK ) in the NF- B pathway. Yet, this same pathway was itself able to repress miR-7 expression, indicating that miR-7 would be unable to restrain RELA's activity if the NF- B pathway were strongly activated. Chronic H. pylori infection is a major risk factor for gastric cancer, in part because the bacterium can hyperactivate the NF- B pathway. Accordingly, Fan and colleagues found that culturing H. pylori with gastric cells activated IKK  and RELA, and reduced the expression of miR-7, a potentially key step in the transformation of healthy gastric cells into malignant ones.","Published: August 12, 2015"

It s a future in which diseases like muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis and many others are treated permanently through the science of genome engineering. Thanks to his latest work, Hubbard is bringing that future closer to reality. Hubbard s research demonstrates a new technology advancing the field of genome engineering. The method significantly improves the ability of scientists to target specific faulty genes and then  edit  them, replacing the damaged genetic code with healthy DNA.  There is a trend in the scientific community to develop therapeutics in a more rational fashion, rather than just relying on traditional chemical screens,  says Hubbard, an assistant professor of pharmacology in the University of Alberta s Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry.  We re moving towards a very logical type of treatment for genetic diseases, where we can actually say,  Your disease is caused by a mutation in gene X, and we re going to correct this mutation to treat it.   In theory, genome engineering will eventually allow us to permanently cure genetic diseases by editing the specific faulty genes.  Revolutionizing health care Genome engineering involves the targeted, specific modification of an organism s genetic information. Much like how a computer programmer edits computer code, scientists could one day replace a person s broken or unhealthy genes with healthy ones through the use of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins attached to DNA-editing tools. The field has made large strides over the last two decades and may one day revolutionize medical care. One of the obstacles still to be addressed in the field before it can see widespread use in humans is how to ensure the proteins only affect the specific target genes in need of repair. With current technologies, the proteins bind to and edit the correct genes the vast majority of the time, but more improvements are needed to ensure off-target genes aren t modified a result that could potentially cause serious health problems itself. Improving the specificity of DNA-binding proteins Through his research, undertaken as a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of David R. Liu at Harvard University, Hubbard has developed a way to reduce the off-target DNA binding of a class of gene editing proteins known as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). The new method allows researchers to rapidly evolve the proteins autonomously to make them more specific and targeted over time.    This technology allows you to systematically say,  I want to target this DNA sequence, and I don t want to target these others,  and it basically evolves a protein to do just that,  says Hubbard.  Using this system, we can produce gene editing tools that are 100 times more specific for their target sequence.  Future applications Much of the current research in genome engineering is focused on treating monogenic diseases diseases that involve a single gene because they re much easier for researchers to target successfully. Examples include diseases such as hemophilia, sickle-cell anemia, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. Though the field is still in its relative infancy, Hubbard says human clinical trials involving sequence-specific DNA-editing agents are already underway. If successful, he expects the first clinical applications could be seen in the next decade. He hopes his current work will play a role in helping genome engineering reach its full potential and plans to continue his research in the quickly expanding field.  Whereas traditional pharmaceutical drugs have a transient effect, gene editing could possibly provide a permanent cure for a lot of different diseases,  says Hubbard.  We still have to overcome many hurdles, but I think this technology definitely has the potential to be transformative in medicine. ","Published: August 12, 2015"

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-mathematics-advances-the-frontier-of-macromolecular-imaging-202740,New Mathematics Advances the Frontier of Macromolecular Imaging Berkeley Lab s M TIP solves the reconstruction problem for fluctuation X ray scattering    ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles.  A comprehensive understanding of complex nanostructures like proteins and viruses could lead to breakthroughs in some of the most challenging problems in biology and medicine. But because these objects are a thousand times smaller than the width of human hair, scientists can t directly see into them to determine their shape and function. In order to visualize the structure of proteins in their native environment, scientists can blast powerful X-ray beams at tiny volumes of proteins in solution. The resulting  diffraction patterns  can then be interpreted to determine, or reconstruct, information about the protein s molecular structure.  However, traditional solution scattering techniques are often limited by how much structural detail they can extract. As brighter and more powerful light sources come online, researchers are devising new ways to overcome these limitations.  In particular, an emerging technique known as fluctuation X-ray scattering (FXS) could provide orders of magnitude more detail than traditional solution scattering. Until now, a major limitation for FXS has been a lack of mathematical methods to efficiently interpret the data.Applied mathematicians Jeffrey Donatelli and James Sethian, and physical bioscientist Peter Zwart have introduced new mathematical theory and an algorithm, which they call  Multi-tiered iterative phasing (M-TIP),  to solve the reconstruction problem from FXS data. Their code can quickly determine general structure in only a few minutes on a desktop computer.  This approach is an important step in unlocking the door to new advances in biophysics and has the promise of ushering in new tools to help solve some of the most challenging problems in the life sciences.  These are exciting times,  says Zwart, who is a member of the Physical Biosciences Division at Berkeley Lab.  Although fluctuation scattering was first proposed 38 years ago, its routine practical realization has only now become feasible with the advent of modern X-ray light sources. This novel reconstruction method plays a central role in mapping out the strengths of fluctuation scattering as a routine biophysical technique.  Overcoming the Limitations of Traditional Imaging With advances in light source technology, diffraction can be done in a many different ways. If particles can be organized into sufficiently large crystals, their structure can be determined through crystallography, which involves shooting x-rays through a crystal. But, many important structures are too floppy to succumb to crystallization and may have a different structure in solution compared to what is determined from crystallography. As an alternative and complementary technique, structural biologists often gather diffraction patterns from particles in solution. However, in these so called small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) experiments, particles can rotate during imaging, which results in a loss of information and often leads to a poor reconstruction of the unknown structure. This is analogous to a photo of a child on a merry-go-round taken with an exposure time that is too long: the picture is blurred and details are lost. One solution to overcome the limitations of SAXS/WAXS is to build faster and brighter light sources that can  take a picture  far quicker than this rotational diffusion time. This is the promise of new DOE facilities relying on free electron lasers (FEL), such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at Stanford. Extracting additional angular correlation information through a technique known as fluctuation X-ray scattering (FXS) has been suggested in order to reconstruct more structural details of the imaged object. However, solving the inverse problem of using this type of information to determine molecular structure is challenging, and until now has been a major stumbling block. Deciphering FXS with M-TIP Part of the challenge of generating a model from fluctuation scattering data stems from the fact that, unlike in standard diffractive imaging which measures diffraction intensities and only requires recovering the missing complex phases, inverting FXS data requires the recovery of the three-dimensional intensity information as well. The team s new  M-TIP  algorithm alternatingly projects a model to agree with the FXS data along with any prior known constraints about the solution, such as density upper and lower bounds, size, and/or symmetry, and can simultaneously determine the intensities, complex phases, and molecular structure. In order to develop a robust and efficient FXS reconstruction algorithm, we had to solve a number of non-trivial mathematical problems,  says Donatelli of Berkeley Lab s Computing Sciences Division.  Deriving the relation between structure and FXS data involves a substantial amount of harmonic analysis and linear algebra and we also needed to develop several new computational tools, such as a fast and reliable polar Fourier transform.  Given that FXS is still a relatively new technique, there are no experimental data sets in the public domain. To compensate for the lack of such data, Donatelli, Sethian and Zwart tested their method on simulated FXS data on various test shapes, including a model of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC). Their  M-TIP  algorithm was able to quickly produced accurate, high-resolution reconstructions of these shapes from their corresponding FXS data. CAMERA:  Innovation through Cross-Disciplinary Science This work is part of a new project being undertaken by CAMERA (The Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications). CAMERA is a joint effort between DOE s Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Office of Basic Energy Sciences. Led by Sethian, CAMERA brings together mathematicians, experimental scientists, computer scientists, and software engineers to develop and deliver new mathematical tools and software to data and imaging challenges at the DOE facilities, including work at synchrotron light sources and nanoscience research centers.  DOE s light sources offer a rich environment for tackling wonderful math problems whose solutions can make a major impact on fast moving science  says Sethian.  Combining Zwart s insight into the problem with Donatelli s background in harmonic analysis and iterative phasing algorithms set the stage for a new way to think about reconstruction from FXS data.  The Future of FXS Beamtime at the LCLS was recently awarded to the authors as part of a large multi-institutional collaboration to collect FXS data from several different biological specimens. This will allow the researchers the opportunity to test and, if necessary, tune their reconstruction techniques on experimental data.  Ultimately, the goal is to provide the scientific community with a powerful new tool to determine the structure and dynamics of nano-sized particles in a routine, high throughput fashion,  says Zwart.  The full deployment of FXS as a new tool in the arsenal of the structural biologist will take some time, but this is an important breakthrough.  The researchers emphasize that FXS data may also be collected using an ultrabright synchrotron light source from particles cryogenically frozen in place. The National Institutes of Health recently awarded Zwart and coworkers a new detector for the development of this method on synchrotron light sources.  Recent advances in detectors, X-ray sources and optics bring fluctuation scattering of cryogenically frozen large macromolecular machines within practical reach of modern synchrotrons,  says Steven Kevan, Deputy Director for Science at the Berkeley Lab s Advanced Light Source (ALS).  We are looking forward to the development of this technique at the Advanced Light Source.   The researchers note that although the method they developed has been applied on problems specific to the life sciences, it can be extended to other applications in material and energy sciences as well. The work was supported by DOE s Office of Science (Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Office of Basic Energy Sciences) and by the National Institute of Health.

Ion channels, proteins that form pores in cell membranes, play central roles in organs in which conduction of electrical signals is vital, such as the brain and heart, but they are found in cells throughout the body. Although about 20 percent of FDA-approved medications target ion channels these proteins are considered especially  druggable  because of their location at the cell surface no channel blockers have been approved for cancer treatment. But as reported a drug that blocks channels that allow potassium ions to move out of cells was effective in slowing the growth of medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer, that had metastasized to the bones of the pelvis in a young patient. The drug in question, thioridazine, was originally developed to treat psychosis, but is now rarely used due to significant side effects.  We showed that blocking a specific ion channel in medulloblastoma can impede tumor cells from proliferating and spreading,  said Lily Jan, PhD, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator and professor of physiology at UCSF, and a senior scientist on the research team.  The development of a drug designed to act on this newly identified target more specifically and more powerfully, with fewer side effects, would have the potential to improve outcomes for many with this disease, which is a common cause of death in children.  The rationale for the unusual treatment had its roots in research begun about five years ago by former UCSF postdoctoral fellows Xi Huang, PhD, now at the University of Toronto s Hospital for Sick Children, and Ye He, PhD. In the Jan laboratory, Huang found that a subset of human medulloblastomas has a high abundance of an ion channel known as EAG2, which is the mammalian version of a fruit fly channel called ether-a-go-go. Initially found to be important for nervous system function in the 1960s, the fruit fly channel was given its whimsical name in keeping with that era, after scientists observed that mutations affecting the channel cause flies to do a dance-like twitching when exposed to ether. He, a member of the UCSF laboratory directed by Jan s husband and longtime research partner, Yuh Nung Jan, PhD, then joined the study, using fruit flies genetically manipulated to serve as models for brain tumors. Huang and He worked together to show that the fly channel protein, like the human protein, promotes brain tumor growth and metastasis. The UCSF team collaborated with scientists at the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto to show that both the fruit fly version of EAG2 and human EAG2 act in concert with another ion channel, called KCNT2, to promote tumor growth. Huang also discovered that changes in EAG2 abundance at the trailing edge of migrating tumor cells alter cell volume and shape, and enable tumor cells to more easily move and spread. When he transplanted EAG2-producing human medulloblastoma tissue into mice, he found that thioridazine inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Huang s presentations of this work at campus seminars led to the team s collaborations with medical colleagues and, eventually, to treatment of the patient at UCSF Medical Center. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, as well as experimental treatments, were no longer effective in arresting growth of widespread metastases in the patient, who had been originally diagnosed with medulloblastoma as a teenager. But after thioridazine treatment, UCSF physicians, including pediatric oncologist Sabine Mueller, MD, PhD, of the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Center, observed shrinkage of an EAG2-expressing metastatic tumor in the patient s pelvis. The patient could not tolerate thioridazine s side effects, however, and he succumbed to the disease several months after ending a two-month course of the drug. While the UCSF study is the first to demonstrate the potential impact of targeting ion channels in a patient with medulloblastoma, previous studies of other types of cancer cells suggest that similar ion channels, including a potassium channel known as EAG1, might also be promising targets for new cancer therapies.  Targeting of ion channels in cancer is a new frontier, and will be exciting to further explore as a way both to stop the growth of tumors and to limit their potential to spread,  Jan said.","Published: August 12, 2015"

However, the tissue must first be fixed to prepare it for this high magnification imaging method. This process causes the brain to shrink; as a result, microscope images can be distorted, e.g. showing neurons to be much closer than they actually are. EPFL scientists have now solved the problem by using a technique that rapidly freezes the brain, preserving its true structure. The shrinking brain Recent years have seen an upsurge of brain imaging, with renewed interest in techniques like electron microscopy, which allows us to observe and study the architecture of the brain in unprecedented detail. But at the same time, they have also revived old problems associated with how this delicate tissue is prepared before images can be collected. Typically, the brain is fixed with stabilizing agents, such as aldehydes, and then encased, or embedded, in a resin. However, it has been known since the mid-sixties that this preparation process causes the brain to shrink by at least 30 percent. This in turn, distorts our understanding of the brain s anatomy, e.g. the actual proximity of neurons, the structures of blood vessels etc. The freezing brain A study by Graham Knott at EPFL, led by Natalya Korogod and working with Carl Petersen, has successfully used an innovative method, called  cryofixation , to prevent brain shrinkage during the preparation for electron microscopy. The method, whose roots go back to 1965, uses jets of liquid nitrogen to  snap-freeze  brain tissue down to -90oC, within milliseconds. The brain tissue here was mouse cerebral cortex. The rapid freezing method is able to prevent the water in the tissue from forming crystals, as it would do in a regular freezer, by also applying very high pressures. Water crystals can severely damage the tissue by rupturing its cells. But in this high pressure freezing method, the water turns into a kind of glass, preserving the original structures and architecture of the tissue. The next step is to embed the frozen tissue in resin. This requires removing the glass-water and replacing it first with acetone, which is still a liquid at the low temperatures of cryofixation, and then, over a period of days, with resin; allowing it to slowly and gently push out the glassified water from the brain. The real brain After the brain was cryofixed and embedded, it was observed and photographed in using 3D electron microscopy. The researchers then compared the cryofixed brain images to those taken from a brain fixed with an  only chemical  method. The analysis showed that the chemically fixed brain was much smaller in volume, showing a significant loss of extracellular space   the space around neurons. In addition, supporting brain cells called  astrocytes , seemed to be less connected with neurons and even blood vessels in the brain. And finally, the connections between neurons, the synapses, seemed significantly weaker in the chemically-fixed brain compared to the cryofixed one. The researchers then compared their measurements of the brain to those calculated in functional studies   studies that measure the time it takes for a molecule to travel across that brain region. To the researchers  surprise, the data matched, adding even more evidence that cryofixation preserves the real anatomy of the brain.  All this shows us that high-pressure cryofixation is a very attractive method for brain imaging,  says Graham Knott.  At the same time, it challenges previous imaging efforts, which we might have to re-examine in light of new evidence.  His team is now aiming to use cryofixation on other parts of the brain and even other types of tissue.","Published: August 12, 2015"

However, they stay in no-growth and non-cancerous state because of a tumor suppressor protein called p15. The study   complete details of which have been published in the journal Cancer Discovery -- was conducted by the researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine, Penn University. It was long known that a mutation in the BRAF gene triggers moles to start growing, however, the researchers in the past were not sure what stopped moles from growing further. ""The BRAF mutation that stimulates the initial growth of moles also stimulates the production of a tumor suppressor protein, p15, which ultimately acts as a powerful brake on further cell division,"" said senior author Todd W. Ridky, in a statement. During the study, Ridky and his colleagues prepared skin grafts containing human mole cell deficit of the p15 suppressor protein. The graft had all other mutations that were known to be important for the development of melanoma. The research team transplanted the grafted tissue in mice and discovered that the depleted p15 cells develop into melanoma. ""The model tissues are medically relevant because they used the naturally occurring human mole cells in the 3-dimensional environment of living skin, which allows detailed functional studies - the field hasn't had an experimental system like this before,"" said Andrew McNeal, the lead study author. The mole cells used during the study were derived from the benign moles of the patients. The team compared the mole cells against the normal melanocytes and discovered that the former had 140 times more p15 than the normal melanocyte skin cells. The researchers thus concluded that p15 is essential to keep moles in benign condition and that the removal of the protein would lead to transition of benign moles to melanoma.","Published: August 12, 2015"

The RSV F Vaccine was well-tolerated and fulfilled the Company's expectations of the primary, secondary and exploratory objectives of the trial. ""It's increasingly appreciated that RSV causes an enormous amount of illness on an annual basis, particularly in the older population. An RSV infection can predispose older adults to developing secondary pneumonia and admission to the hospital,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, Professor of Preventive Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""Each year in the United States, approximately 14,000 people ages 65 or older die of RSV infections and approximately 900,000 have some sort of medical encounter with a doctor, or emergency room, or are hospitalized. Prevention remains the highest goal of medicine and those of us in preventative medicine and public health would like to prevent as many of these infections as possible."" The Novavax trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of 1,600 older adult participants conducted at 10 sites in the United States. The trial was designed to prospectively examine the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory illnesses associated with RSV, in community-living older adults who were treated with placebo. The trial also evaluated safety and immunogenicity of the unadjuvanted, 135 microgram dose of the RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo. Finally, the trial estimated the efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of respiratory illness due to RSV. The trial is the first to demonstrate efficacy of an active RSV immunization in any clinical trial population, and showed statistically significant vaccine efficacy in prevention of all symptomatic RSV disease (44%) and RSV disease with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (46%) in older adults. The observed efficacy was similar to or better than multiple recent effectiveness estimates for a number of licensed respiratory vaccines tested in older adults including pneumococcal and standard-dose seasonal influenza.1,2 The trial also established an attack rate for symptomatic RSV disease of 4.9% in older adults, 95% of which included lower respiratory track symptoms, and confirmed the significant burden of RSV disease in this population. In addition, statistically significant efficacy against more severe RSV illness, as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms associated with difficulty breathing, was 64% in several ad hoc analyses. Kaplan-Meier curves showed continued divergence of active vaccinees from placebo recipients over the nearly 6 months during which RSV was detected, demonstrating the durability of protection throughout the RSV season. As expected from the Company's prior trials, anti-F IgG and palivizumab-competing antibody (PCA) titers peaked rapidly at day 14, plateaued at day 28 and remained at elevated levels through day 56; the last time point currently analyzed. There were greater than four-fold increases in both anti-F IgG and PCA concentrations at trial days 14, 28 and 56, and serologic responses in over 90% of vaccinated subjects, indicating a robust immune response, similar to the findings from the Company's prior trial in older adults. Finally, the safety profile in vaccine recipients was nearly identical to that of placebo recipients with regard to both local and systemic events. ""These efficacy data represent a historic advance for the field,"" said Gregory Glenn, M.D., Senior Vice President, Research and Development. ""This is also an important confirmation of the burden of RSV disease in older adults and highlights the high rate of lower respiratory tract symptoms in those infected by RSV in a large, prospective trial. It is clear that our RSV F Vaccine provided statistically significant efficacy in older adults, a population that historically has been difficult to protect. The reduction in symptomatic RSV, RSV with lower respiratory tract illness and RSV associated with difficulty breathing are breakthrough results. We look forward to making details of these data public at an appropriate forum in the future."" ""The development of an RSV vaccine has been a decades-long challenge,"" said Stanley C. Erck, President and CEO. ""We are thrilled by the groundbreaking efficacy of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults. We are committed to pursuing an aggressive developmental timeline for this program which includes discussions with regulatory authorities and initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 trial as early as the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect to announce safety and immunogenicity data from the RSV F Vaccine Phase 2 trial to protect infants via maternal immunization later this quarter.""","Published: August 12, 2015"

Yet while more than 80 million genetic variants have been found in the human genome, we don t understand the role that most of these variants play in health or disease. Achieving the President s vision requires working collaboratively to ensure the accuracy of genetic tests in detecting and interpreting genetic variants. We are working towards that goal by developing an informatics community and supporting platform we call precisionFDA. Sophisticated, relatively inexpensive technology known as next generation sequencing (NGS) already exists to sequence a person s genome quickly. Developers and users of NGS tests must then comb these sequences to look for segments that suggest potentially meaningful differences and determine whether those differences provide useful and actionable information about the state of a person s health, and their future risk of disease, behavior, or treatment choices. Special features of this technology pose novel regulatory issues for FDA. Most diagnostic tests follow a one test-one disease paradigm that readily fits FDA s current device review approaches for evaluating a test s accuracy and clinical interpretation. Because NGS tests may be used in many ways in the clinic and can produce an unprecedented amount of data about a patient, we are working to evaluate whether a better option might simply be requiring each NGS test developer to show that the test meets certain standards for quality. Similarly, to demonstrate a test s clinical value, we are assessing whether it may be more efficient for developers to refer to evidence in well-curated, validated, and shared databases of mutations instead of independently generating data to support a mutation-disease association. To begin to realize this new vision, precisionFDA is designed as a crowd-sourced, cloud-based platform to advance the science needed to develop the necessary standards. PrecisionFDA will supply an environment where the community can test, pilot, and validate new approaches. For example, NGS test developers, researchers, and other members of the community can share and cross-validate their tests or results against crowd-sourced reference material in precisionFDA. Planned for beta release (work in progress) in December 2015, precisionFDA will offer community members access to secure and independent work areas where, at their discretion, their software code or data can either be kept private, or shared with the owner s choice of collaborators, FDA, or the public. Initially, precisionFDA s public space will offer a wiki and a set of open source or open access reference genomic data models and analysis tools developed and vetted by standards bodies, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (e.g.,Genome in a Bottle). We believe precisionFDA will help us advance the science around the accuracy and reproducibility of NGS-based tests, and in doing so, will advance consumer safety. We look forward to continuing to update the community on the development of these new tools.","Published: August 12, 2015"

The research team, headed by Professor Christina Mitchell from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, uncovered the gene, called proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, or PIPP. ""The discovery of the new tumour suppressor could have significant implications for the way we treat, manage and even potentially detect specific subsets of breast cancers that need targeted or specific treatments related to the gene expression profile in which PIPP expression is lost,"" Professor Mitchell said. Dr Lisa Ooms, the lead author of the paper, said PIPP plays a major role in the initiation and growth of the primary tumour. Together with another already-known oncogene, AKT1, it is implicated in the spread of the disease   the leading cause of breast cancer death, she explained. The research has three major implications. The first is that it may help identify a subset of patients that could be targeted with therapies aimed at PIPP and the oncogene pathway PIPP regulates. Secondly, it may assist in identifying patients at risk of developing secondary cancer, allowing clinicians to make better-informed decisions on whether to implement aggressive or targeted therapy. Thirdly, the findings could open the way to developing a potential drug that to target the primary cancer and prevent or slow its growth. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with around 42 Australians diagnosed each day. Once it has spread, chemotherapy is the only option for treatment, and the chances for a complete cure are reduced.","Published: August 12, 2015"

Using mice that have no immune system of their own, researchers will allow their immune systems to rebuild using immune cells from people with MS.  Current MS models used are limited as they are unable to imitate exactly how the human immune system responds in people with MS,  Associate Professor Greer said.  Creating a functional human immune system within this model will allow us to better understand what is happening in MS and how it develops.  Multiple sclerosis is caused when a person s immune system attacks a fatty material called myelin, which protects nerve fibres.It can affect the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, causing problems with vision, balance, muscle control and other basic body functions. The new model will also allow researchers to test potential drugs to gain a realistic idea of what treatments are more likely to work for people with MS.  This will fast-track the process for new treatments considerably,   Associate Professor Greer said. Associate Professor Greer was awarded a $25,000 incubator grant from MS Research Australia for her research. CEO of MS Research Australia Dr Matthew Miles said the research would improve scientists  ability to test new treatments for MS and provide outcomes for people with MS sooner.  MS Research Australia is very pleased to award this incubator grant to Judith Greer and her team,  he said. There are 23,000 people living with MS in Australia and this number is increasing.

The disease is transmitted via mosquito bites, with parasites forming in the liver before entering into the blood stream. The parasite that causes malaria has established resistance to most drugs used to treat the disease, so new drugs that act via new mechanisms are critically needed to treat patients and fight the spread of the disease. An international team of scientists previously identified a molecule, called DSM265, which targets malaria parasites in both the blood and liver and remains in the body for an extended period of time. This means that the drug not only has the potential to act as a treatment but also as a prevention for the disease.The team, led by researchers at the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, UT Southwestern Medical Center, the University of Washington, and the not-for-profit Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), identified a class of drugs that inhibit a key enzyme in the malaria parasite - dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). The DHODH enzyme enables the parasite to reproduce and spread. The DSM265 molecule targets DHODH, preventing the parasite from being able to synthesise the building blocks of DNA and RNA, which are needed for survival. DSM265 is the first DHODH inhibitor to reach clinical development for the treatment of malaria. Studies supporting the advancement of DSM265 into clinical development have recently been published.   DSM265 is an inhibitor of a key parasitic enzyme and in humans has been shown to be remain in the body for a long time after a single dose. It s a very exciting drug candidate,  said Dr Susan Charman, Professor at the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences.  The treatment has the potential to be effective after only a single dose, which is particularly important for regions of poverty where compliance is a huge issue. The single dose approach could also help eliminate issues caused when patients don t take the full course of medication, which contributes to the development of resistance,  Dr Charman said. The drug has long-lasting effects, and remains in the body for up to eight days, eliminating the need for daily dosing. To delay resistance, however, it would need to be administered in combination with another drug that acts against the parasite by a different mechanism. ""Clinical studies in malaria patients are currently underway and will provide further information regarding the drug s effectiveness and safety. We ve still got a long way to go but so far the results are very encouraging,  Dr Charman said. The clinical development is being conducted through a partnership between MMV, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company and the Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) fund.","Published: August 12, 2015"

The microgel can also release the drug in a more controlled manner, and for a longer period of time, than alternative delivery methods.  This could mean fewer uncomfortable hospital appointments for patients while increasing their chances of recovery. About 10,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer every year in the UK which affects mostly people aged 50 and over. With around 50%  of patients succumbing to the disease, bladder cancer is one of the more deadly forms. However there has been very little progress in bladder cancer therapy since the 1980s. Anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, are effective but there is an urgent need to make them more efficient. The location of the cancer means that much of the drug is lost through the washout effect with urine. Drugs such as doxorubicin have to be administered into the bladder via a catheter at hospital. Patients are then asked to not to pass urine for at least an hour after drug administration. This research, funded by the Leverhulme Trust focused on using materials with -SH chemical groups on their surface. These have a unique ability to stick to mucosal membranes in our body, resisting washout. Professor Vitaliy Khutoryanskiy and his team developed these materials in the form of microgels - swellable particles of sub-micron size - which could be loaded with a chemotherapeutic drug and delivered to the bladder using a catheter. Small molecules containing -SH groups in protected form were synthesised so they could be converted into particles. The protection of these -SH groups was then removed which resulted in microgels with free -SH groups. Professor Vitaliy Khutoryanskiy, from the Reading School of Pharmacy, said: ""Bladder cancer is a big killer in this country, especially amongst older people. But the development of new therapies has largely been ignored over the last 30 years. It's therefore vital we look at new ways of beating the disease, both through the development of new drugs and making existing drugs more effective. Our microgel has the potential to revolutionise the treatment of bladder cancer. ""This cancer is particularly difficult to treat - a big problem being the poor retention of the drug in the bladder after it's given. Our research demonstrated that doxorubicin can be easily loaded into these microgels and released in a controlled manner for a long period of time, about 24hrs. We also showed that the microgel particles stick to the mucosal lining of a pig bladder and can resist the washout effects with urine. This stickiness means more of the drug stays in the bladder - and for longer. The next stage in the research will be to test the delivery method  in vivo' and then hopefully in human trials. Professor Khutoryanskiy added: ""It's early days but this microgel may be a game-changer in the fight against bladder cancer. Patients could live for longer and in a less stressful manner, with more potentially surviving this terrible disease."" Mr Hugh Mostafid, Consultant Urological Surgeon from Royal Surrey County Hospital, commented: ""The current method of intravesical drug delivery has hardly changed since it was first described 50 years ago. Bladder cancer is characterised by frequent recurrences which makes it the most expensive cancer to treat. Professor Khutoryanskiy's work is an exciting and novel development in bladder cancer and opens the way for more effective drug treatments, which in turn would benefit patients through fewer recurrences and longer survival.""","Published: August 12, 2015"

To study the fine structure of the brain, including its connections between neurons, the synapses, scientists must use electron microscopes. However, the tissue must first be fixed to prepare it for this high magnification imaging method. This process causes the brain to shrink; as a result, microscope images can be distorted, for instance, showing neurons to be much closer than they actually are. EPFL scientists have now solved the problem by using a technique that rapidly freezes the brain, preserving its true structure. The work is published in eLife. Recent years have seen an upsurge of brain imaging, with renewed interest in techniques like electron microscopy, which allows us to observe and study the architecture of the brain in unprecedented detail. But at the same time, they have also revived old problems associated with how this delicate tissue is prepared before images can be collected. Typically, the brain is fixed with stabilizing agents, such as aldehydes, and then encased, or embedded, in a resin. However, it has been known since the mid-sixties that this preparation process causes the brain to shrink by at least 30 percent. This in turn, distorts our understanding of the brain s anatomy such as the actual proximity of neurons, the structures of blood vessels etc. A study by Graham Knott at EPFL, led by Natalya Korogod and working with Carl Petersen, has successfully used an innovative method, called  cryofixation , to prevent brain shrinkage during the preparation for electron microscopy. The method, whose roots go back to 1965, uses jets of liquid nitrogen to  snap-freeze  brain tissue down to -90oC, within milliseconds. The brain tissue here was mouse cerebral cortex. The rapid freezing method is able to prevent the water in the tissue from forming crystals, as it would do in a regular freezer, by also applying very high pressures. Water crystals can severely damage the tissue by rupturing its cells. But in this high pressure freezing method, the water turns into a kind of glass, preserving the original structures and architecture of the tissue. The next step is to embed the frozen tissue in resin. This requires removing the glass-water and replacing it first with acetone, which is still a liquid at the low temperatures of cryofixation, and then, over a period of days, with resin; allowing it to slowly and gently push out the glassified water from the brain. After the brain was cryofixed and embedded, it was observed and photographed in using 3D electron microscopy. The researchers then compared the cryofixed brain images to those taken from a brain fixed with an  only chemical  method. The analysis showed that the chemically fixed brain was much smaller in volume, showing a significant loss of extracellular space   the space around neurons. In addition, supporting brain cells called  astrocytes , seemed to be less connected with neurons and even blood vessels in the brain. And finally, the connections between neurons, the synapses, seemed significantly weaker in the chemically-fixed brain compared to the cryofixed one. The researchers then compared their measurements of the brain to those calculated in functional studies   studies that measure the time it takes for a molecule to travel across that brain region. To the researchers  surprise, the data matched, adding even more evidence that cryofixation preserves the real anatomy of the brain.  All this shows us that high-pressure cryofixation is a very attractive method for brain imaging,  says Graham Knott.  At the same time, it challenges previous imaging efforts, which we might have to re-examine in light of new evidence.  His team is now aiming to use cryofixation on other parts of the brain and even other types of tissue.  cole polytechnique f d rale de Lausanne   press release Korogod N, Peterson CCH, Knott GW.

Without sigma 1 receptor, the M ller cells that support the retina can't seem to control their own levels of destructive oxidative stress, and consequently can't properly support the millions of specialized neurons that enable us to transform light into images, scientists report in the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine. Without support, well-organized layers of retinal cells begin to disintegrate and vision is lost to diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, said Dr. Sylvia Smith, retinal cell biologist and Chairwoman of the Department of Cellular Biology and Anatomy at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Regents University The surprising finding makes the sigma 1 receptor a logical treatment target for these typically progressive and blinding retinal diseases, said Smith, the study's corresponding author. It has implications as well for other major diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as neurodegenerative disease, where oxidative stress plays a role. What most surprised the scientists was that simply removing sigma 1 receptor from M ller cells significantly increased levels of reactive oxygen species, or ROS, indicating the receptor's direct role in the oxidative stress response, Smith said. They expected it would take them giving an oxidative stressor to increase ROS levels. So they looked further at the sigma 1 receptor knockouts compared with normal mice, and found significantly decreased expression in the knockouts of several, well-known antioxidant genes and their proteins. Further examination showed a change in the usual stress response. These genes that make natural antioxidants contain antioxidant response element, or ARE which, in the face of oxidative stress, gets activated by NRF2, a transcription factor that usually stays in the fluid part of the cell, or cytoplasm. NRF2 is considered one of the most important regulators of the expression of antioxidant molecules. Normally the protein KEAP1 keeps it essentially inactive in the cytoplasm until needed, then it moves to the cell nucleus where it can help mount a defense. ""When you have oxidative stress, you want this,"" Smith said of the stress response, which works the same throughout the body. Deleting the sigma receptor in the M ller cells altered the desired response: NRF2 expression decreased while KEAP1 expression increased. The unhealthy bottom line was that ROS levels increased as well. The study is believed to provide the first evidence of the direct impact of the sigma 1 receptor on the levels of NRF2 and KEAP1, the researchers write. ""We think we are beginning to understand the mechanism by which sigma 1 receptor may work and it may work because of its action on releasing antioxidant genes,"" Smith said. While the ubiquitous receptor was known to help protect neurons in the brain and eye, its impact on M ller cell function was previously unknown. The significant impact the MCG scientists have now found helps explain the dramatic change they documented after using pentazocine, a narcotic already used for pain relief, in animal models of both retinitis pigmentosa and diabetic retinopathy. Pentazocine, which binds to and activates the sigma 1 receptor, seems to preserve functional vision in these disease models by enabling many of the well-stratified layers of photoreceptor cells to survive. Next steps include clarifying whether it's actually preservation or regeneration of the essential cell layers and how long the effect lasts. ""We do see some retention of function, that is clear and that I am very excited about,"" Smith said. M ller cells are major support cells for the retina, helping stabilize its complex, multi-layer structure, both horizontally and vertically; eliminating debris; and supporting the function and metabolism of its neurons and blood vessels. Typically bustling M ller cells can become even more activated when there is an insult to the eye, such as increased oxidative stress, and start forming scar tissue, which hinders rather than supports vision. Problems such as diabetes, can increase ROS levels. ROS are molecules produced through normal body function such as breathing and cells using energy. The body needs a limited amount of ROS to carry out additional functions, such as cell signaling. Problems, from eye disease to cancer, result when the body's natural system for eliminating excess ROS can't keep up and ROS start to do harm, such as cell destruction. Normally humans have about 125 million night-vision enabling rods intermingled with about 6 million cones that enable us to respond to light and see color.

One set of neurons degenerates, while a similar population nearby is spared the same degree of damage. Why the difference? An answer to this question could clear the way for preventions and treatments for this disease. Using a new strategy they have devised to identify the molecular changes that drive the loss of neurons, researchers at The Rockefeller University and colleagues at Columbia University have identified two proteins they report may be important to Parkinson s. These two gene-regulating molecules appear to have a protective effect in the set of neurons most affected by the disease, and when their activity wanes, disease sets in. This discovery, described online in Nature Neuroscience, suggests new avenues by which the disease might be prevented or treated.  Within a dying nerve cell, the levels of hundreds of proteins change,  says study author Paul Greengard, Vincent Astor Professor and head of Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience.  Some of these shifts are consequences, others are causes. We set out to find which cause cell death among neurons.   Using a new combination of techniques,  Greengard adds,  we identified two of these so-called master regulatory molecules   a discovery that offers an unexpected explanation as to why one population of neurons degenerates in Parkinson s, while similar neighbors do not suffer from the same degree of degeneration.  Parkinson s disease often first shows up as a slight tremor of the hands, and progresses to affect speech, facial muscles, and other movements. This deterioration is caused by the progressive loss of neurons located in the midbrain region the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These neurons produce dopamine and it is the loss of dopamine that causes the loss of motor control associated with Parkinson s. Some deterioration also occurs in the dopamine-producing neurons of a neighboring brain region, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the VTA neurons are much less affected than those of the SNpc. Typically, when scientists want to look for molecular changes associated with a condition they use genetic sequencing to create a profile of variations in gene expression. But with conventional profiling approaches it is difficult to pick out the changes that occur in a particular type of cell, and distinguish those that are truly important. It is also very hard to tell which changes arise from the master regulator genes, which can act as control dials turning their target genes up or down. To overcome these issues, the team led by first author Lars Brichta, a senior research associate in Greengard s lab, adapted a technique previously developed in Greengard s and Nathaniel Heintz s labs, which involves genetically engineering mice to capture the genetic messages being translated into proteins in a specific population of cells. They then mapped the interactions of regulator genes with their target genes in the mouse brain, and used this new tool to interpret the changes they documented between normal mice and those suffering from Parkinson s-like degeneration. This led them to two molecules: the proteins SATB1 and ZDHHC2, which are more abundant in the dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc versus the VTA. When the researchers reduced the abundance of these molecules in the brains of normal mice, rapid degeneration like that seen in Parkinson s disease followed.  Conventional gene activity profiling approaches would not have been able to identify SATB1 and ZDHHC2 as key protective factors because the levels of these proteins  do not change. But even though they continue to be expressed within the neurons, it appears that their regulatory activity drops off and they no longer stimulate their target genes,  Brichta says.  We later found similar changes in activity in the brains of Parkinson s patients, particularly those in the early stages.  Their findings also challenge the prevailing thought as to the molecular origins of Parkinson s: that VTA neurons had some sort of factor protecting them against the kind of degeneration seen in the SNpc.  In an unexpected contradiction to current models, the proteins we found protect the SNpc. Because dopamine and its metabolites can be toxic, we can speculate that, in the course of evolution, SATB1 and ZDHHC2 arose to protect this particular set of sensitive neurons from cell death,  Greengard says.  The discovery of these two molecules  role in Parkinson s may assist in the development of treatments, because they are potential new targets for drugs.  The researchers believe their new strategy may also be useful in studies of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer s, spinal muscular atrophy, Huntington s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Now scientists are experimenting with robo-whiskers, synthetic versions of the super-sensitive fibres, which may one day allow surgeons to perform extremely delicate procedures via keyhole surgery. Biomimetics   the imitation of living systems   is a branch of engineering that copies from or is inspired by nature. For example, tissue engineering uses scaffolds often designed to directly imitate the structure and properties of native tissues. When used in bone repair, these can be made from collagen or calcium phosphate, both found naturally in bones. While it makes sense to mimic nature for an implant that is going into the body, there are applications for external uses too, such as this bio-inspired whisker array. Probing sensitive subjects Animals with whiskers (technical term vibrissae) include various rodents, cats and sea mammals such as seals, which use whiskers to probe and sense the environment around them. Whiskers are larger than typical mammalian hairs, but similar in structure and composition. They do not contain nerves   but where the whiskers meet the skin is an extraordinarily sensitive mechanism that allows the animal to feel with the whiskers. At their base, the nerve endings can sense direct stimuli when they are bent through contact, and indirect stimuli, when the hairs deform or shift in response to air or fluid currents moving around them. The study by researchers in Singapore and the US takes a discount store approach by using common objects such as plastic drinking straws and Lego blocks to create a bio-inspired array of five artificial whiskers. The straws act as the whiskers, responding to air currents generated by a hair dryer. Strain sensors at the base of the plastic whiskers monitor their movement and shape change in response to the currents. This simple experimental set-up is linked to complex mathematical analysis capable of demonstrating whether the artificial whiskers faithfully capture various different airflow patterns from the hair dryer. Making whiskers active As is often the case in bio-inspired engineering, the true promise goes beyond what it might be imagined Lego, straws and hair-dryers could provide. By bringing together complex fluid mechanics, control theory and electronic signal processing, experiments with artificial whiskers could provide significant engineering advances. Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary research area   and experiments like this can bring together experts from different fields of inquiry that would normally operate independently. Although the authors deal only with passive whisker sensing, there s significantly more promise to an approach that uses robotics to create robo-whiskers, capable of responding to stimuli and passing information. These whiskers would be  biofidelic    able to mimic the natural system more closely. Whiskers as a surgeon s hands Even in a relatively simple form, the potential applications for synthetic whiskers arrays are far more interesting as they could demonstrate invaluable medical uses, such as in surgery. With traditional open surgery, surgeons use the tactile feedback provided by the extremely sensitive nerve endings in their own fingertips to guide their tools. The tactile feedback helps the surgeon, but infection and other risks are a problem. The other approach is minimally invasive, keyhole surgery, when the surgeon s hands do not enter the site of the operation. Instead the surgical tools are mounted on fibre-optic scopes or other sorts of remote instruments that are inserted into a far smaller hole. As doctors adopt this approach, the need to provide new ways of gaining a clearer sense of feeling, as when physically holding the instruments, has become more pressing. If the thought of cat (or rat, or even seal) whiskers inside your aorta makes you shudder, consider that it s entirely possible that your own future cardiac outpatient procedure some years from now may be quicker and more successful because of robotic tactile feedback mechanisms inspired by this whiskery experiment.","Published: August 11, 2015"

The research team reports finding mutations in a gene called DCHS1 in affected members of three families in which MVP is inherited.   This work provides insights into the pathways regulating valve growth and development and implicates a previously unrecognized basis for the long-term structural integrity of the mitral valve,  says senior author Susan A. Slaugenhaupt, PhD, scientific director of the MGH Research Institute, an investigator at the MGH Center for Human Genetic Research, a professor of Genetics (Neurology) at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and one of the lead scientists in the collaborative group that conducted the research.  Robert Levine, MD, of the MGH Corrigan Minehan Heart Center, co-senior author of the paper, says,  This finding can teach us how to prevent this inborn disease from manifesting as an illness in people who inherit mutated forms of this gene. Understanding how defects in this gene cause errors in early valve formation can point to ways we can prevent the progression of this condition to keep the valve and the heart healthy and help the patient avoid complications.  The other MGH co-senior author   David Milan, MD, of the MGH Cardiovascular Research Center   led studies of gene impact on the heart in zebrafish models. One of four valves controlling the flow of blood through the heart, the mitral valve lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle, which handle oxygenated blood returning from the lungs. The valve consists of two leaflets that open to let blood pass through and close to keep it from moving backwards. In MVP, the leaflets become thickened, elongated and floppy, preventing the valve from closing completely and allowing blood to leak backwards in a process called regurgitation. Patients with serious MVP can develop shortness of breath, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure or an infection of the heart valves; and MVP is the most common reason for mitral valve surgery.  While MVP can accompany connective tissue disorders such as Marfan Syndrome, most commonly it runs in families without such syndromes. A specific genetic cause of familial MVP had not previously been identified, and the MGH research team s first step was to link the occurrence of MVP in one large family to a genetic risk factor located on chromosome 11. That work depended on advanced diagnostics developed by Levine and colleagues in the MGH Cardiac Ultrasound Laboratory that relied on their discovery of the three-dimensional shape of the mitral valve.  In the current study, detailed DNA analysis of the affected members of that family identified two rare mutations in DCHS1, a chromosome 11 gene previously studied in fruitflies. Experiments in zebrafish by Milan and his team revealed that inactivation of an analogous gene led to significant defects in development of the heart at the site corresponding to the mitral valve, defects that could be prevented by the introduction of the normal copy of the human DCHS1 gene but not the mutated version.  Based on those findings, the MGH team sought to collaborate with other groups studying MVP in order to determine whether the same mutations had a role in other families with the condition. A major grant from the Leducq Foundation in Paris enabled the formation of a network consisting of 11 centers in the U.S. and four European countries, and analysis of DNA from those centers identified two French families in which MVP was caused by another DCHS1 mutation.  Further experiments in cells indicated that the MVP-associated mutations significantly reduced the expression of the DCHS1 protein, which helps organize how cells are patterned into tissues. Co-senior author Russell Norris, PhD, and his team at theMedical University of South Carolina analyzed the development of mice in which one copy of the DCHS1 gene was mutated, as it is in affected family members. Their findings revealed that the gene plays a critical role in the proper formation of the mitral valve, the first evidence for the gene s role in cardiac development, and that the mutation led to mitral valve changes resembling the human disease.   This discovery required the cooperation of multiple disciplines and teams   ranging from clinical cardiology and ultrasound diagnostics to classical genetics, screening of potential mutations in zebrafish and functional studies in our mouse models,  says Levine, who is a professor of Medicine at HMS.  Milan, an assistant professor of Medicine at HMS, adds,  As a follow up, this same international network has been seeking other genes that cause MVP across the population, which should point us to common pathways that could be targets of therapies designed to prevent progression into symptomatic disease.

Bacteria harm the body by releasing toxins   proteins that are exceptionally effective poisons. Always targeting essential molecules, toxins typically go after molecules that are either scarce or whose role is to send important signals. In both cases, only a small number of toxins is required to cause damage. In contrast, some toxins appear to deviate from these strategies by targeting highly abundant proteins. A new study shows that one toxin linked to cholera and other diseases, which hones in on a popular and plentiful protein target, also disables a scarce molecule   but in a deceptive way. The toxin turns the common protein into poison against the other essential and much less-abundant protein in a process that renders the immune cell useless. It s important to understand how toxins work because they are key to enabling bacteria to cause disease. With some of the most lethal toxins   those released by the bacteria that cause whooping cough and dysentery, for example   a single molecule of toxin can kill an entire cell.  It appears that this toxin followed some of the most sophisticated battlefield strategies long before they were invented by humans: It recognizes that to win the war, one doesn t need to kill all the soldiers. All that is needed is to send in a spy to recruit a few soldiers who will betray their own army and neutralize the officers,  said Dmitri Kudryashov, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at The Ohio State University and senior author of the study. This finding suggests that with other toxins that appear to act on highly abundant structures, it s likely that we don t actually know how they work.  In this case, the soldiers are the protein actin, which is produced in abundance by almost all human cells and is a very important player in the body s response to an infectious disease. In particular, actin is a molecular motor that enables immune cells to chase and eat invading bacteria. Being present in large concentrations, it is easy for invaders to find.  For all of these reasons, actin is a common target for many bacterial toxins,  Kudryashov said. One toxin known to have a particular affinity for actin is ACD (actin cross-linking domain). This toxin is released by different bacteria, including those that cause life-threatening conditions: cholera (Vibrio cholera), septicemia or gastroenteritis from eating infected raw oysters (Vibrio vulnificus) and gastric illnesses that threaten people with weakened immune systems (Aeromonas hydrophila). Previous research had shown that ACD chains together several actin molecules in a way that depletes their ability to properly function, restricting how the immune cells neutralize bacteria. But Kudryashov and colleagues noted that a significant amount of the toxin would be needed to achieve this result. Bacterial toxins are incredibly efficient killers for a good reason, he said. The human immune system is usually successful in fighting invaders by killing bacteria and neutralizing toxins, meaning bacteria often are not given a chance to produce and deliver much of a toxin to its target cells. Because bacteria are shrewd about hijacking the immune system, and knowing that a single molecule of the most deadly bacterial toxins can kill a cell, the researchers suspected a smaller amount of the ACD toxin might disable cells by targeting something less common than actin itself. In an exercise assuming that actin is the primary target, the researchers estimated that a single molecule of ACD introduced to a typical animal cell would take six months to disable half of the actin in the cell   suggesting either actin isn t the actual target or this toxin isn t effective in small doses. In cultures using intestinal-lining cells, the scientists found that the toxin poisoned the cells while only a small amount of actin was affected. That kind of power raised new questions about how ACD works. Actin is present in cells in two different forms: a monomer, or a single molecule, and a filament, which is a strand of those molecules strung together. Timely assembly and disassembly of these strands is key to how actin enables immune cells to chase and eat bacteria. ACD creates a chemical reaction that binds single molecules of actin together in an irregular cluster called an oligomer. These oligomers can t be used to create the strands of actin because their new shapes don t allow them to fit together anymore.  Essentially, ACD makes actin poisonous against its binding partners,  Kudryashov said. This is where a more precise target becomes apparent. A protein called formin has a specific job to assemble the actin filaments. Once ACD forms the actin oligomers, these oligomers bind to formin much more tightly than a single actin molecule, blocking formin s activity.  Therefore, ACD effectively hijacks formin by converting actin molecules into new potent poisons,  said co-corresponding author Elena Kudryashova, a research scientist in chemistry and biochemistry at Ohio State. Being blocked by oligomers, formin cannot assist in the assembly of actin strands. When these strands of actin aren t produced, the cell can t function properly anymore. The researchers confirmed the effect of ACD on formin in a variety of experiments.

However, one challenge is reducing the tissue/neuron damage associated with needle penetration, particularly for chronic insert experiment and future medical applications. A solution strategy is to use microscale-diameter needles (e.g., < 5  m) with flexible properties. However, such physically limited needles cannot penetrate the brain and other biological tissues because of needle buckling or fracturing on penetration. A research team in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Information Engineering and the Electronics-Inspired Interdisciplinary Research Institute (EIIRIS) at Toyohashi University of Technology has developed a methodology to temporarily enhance the stiffness of a long, high-aspect-ratio flexible microneedle (e.g., < 5  m in diameter and > 500  m in length), without affecting the needle diameter and flexibility in tissue. This has been accomplished by embedding a needle base in a film scaffold, which dissolves upon contact with biological tissue. Silk fibroin is used as the dissolvable film because it has high biocompatibility, and is a known biomaterial used in implantable devices.""We investigated preparation of a silk base scaffold for a microneedle, quantitatively analyzed needle stiffness, and evaluated the penetration capability by using mouse brains in vitro/in vivo. In addition, as an actual needle application, we demonstrated fluorescenctce particle depth injection into the brain in vivo,and confirm that by observing fluorescenctce confocal microscope"" explained the first author, master's degree student Satoshi Yagi, and co-author PhD candidate Shota Yamagiwa. The leader of the research team, Associate Professor Takeshi Kawano said: ""Preparation of the dissolvable base scaffold is very simple, but this methodology promises powerful tissue penetrations using numerous high-aspect-ratio flexible microneedles, including recording/stimulation electrodes, glass pipettes, and optogenetic fibers."" He added: ""This has the potential to reduce invasiveness drastically and provide safer tissue penetration than conventional approaches.""","Published: August 11, 2015"

The discovery could, they say, eventually help spur the growth of new hair, skin or other organ tissue in scarred victims of burns and other injuries. Our study  uncovers a novel role for a protein that works as a master regulator of regeneration in the skin,  says senior study author Luis A. Garza, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of dermatology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  Medications that turn on this protein have the powerful potential to decrease scarring as healing of wounds takes place, thereby promoting skin and hair follicle regeneration.  Garza says his team s work is based on the knowledge that damaged skin releases  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)   genetic information normally carried by some viruses   that is sensed by a protein called toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). TLR3, which in other contexts plays a fundamental role in recognizing some disease-causing organisms and activating the immune system, during wounding also activates the genes IL6 and STAT3 to promote hair follicle regeneration.TLR3 also activates other molecules involved in hair development, including the Wnt and Shh signaling pathways and a gene called EDAR, which makes the protein ectodysplasin and plays an important role in skin development. Developing embryos have all of the instructions they need to make organs and skin in genetic material within the cells, says Garza. Advanced knowledge about this pathway may lead to therapies that reactivate these early developmental signals to promote healing.  A lot of human disability is from scarring,  Garza says.  After a heart attack, we re really good at replacing the blood flow, but it s the scar on the heart afterward that s the real problem. We and others in the field of regenerative medicine are interested in how to enhance or trigger regeneration in such situations.  For the study, Garza and colleagues compared the protein expression of certain genes in healed wounds in two groups of mice. One group was genetically proficient in wound-induced hair neogenesis, a process in mice and rabbits in which skin and hair follicles regenerate after wounds. The other inbred group of mice was noted to lack this ability. Expression of TLR3 was three times higher in the mice that were better able to regenerate hair. In other experiments, the team found that the expression of TLR3 was five times higher in scratched human skin cell samples compared to healthy skin cell samples, that adding synthetic dsRNA to mouse skin wounds led to a greater number of regenerated follicles, that adding a substance that breaks up dsRNA decreased the number of regenerated follicles, and that regeneration was nearly abolished in mice deficient in TLR3. Garza notes that it has long been known that skin damage can trigger regeneration. Several cosmetic dermatological procedures, such as chemical peels, dermabrasion and laser treatments, have been used to do that for decades:  One implication from our work is that all of those different rejuvenation techniques are likely working through dsRNA pathways. It may also be that dsRNA could be directly used to stimulate rejuvenation in aging or hair follicle growth in burn patients to regain structures that have been lost.  The clinical translation of this work is promising because work has already started, says Garza. Drug companies are already developing products to activate TLR3 to trigger the immune system, and these same products could be tested to promote regeneration. But Garza cautions that clinical applications of the team s discoveries must await many more experiments and the development and testing of drugs that target the pathway they uncovered. He also made clear that the information might not be as applicable to conditions unrelated to scarring or to those whose hair follicles are lost from male pattern baldness.","Published: August 11, 2015"

The virus destroys CD4+ T cells, a type of white blood cell that s vital to fighting off infection. The number of these cells, known as a CD4+ count, is a key measure of immune system health. After people get infected with HIV, their immune system becomes progressively weaker from the HIV infection, their CD4+ count drops, and eventually they develop AIDS. AIDS is treated with antiretroviral drugs. These drugs suppress HIV but don t completely eliminate the virus from the body. Guidelines for when to start treatment differ around the world because the evidence for using antiretroviral drugs when CD4+ counts are higher wasn t definitive. Some experts felt it prudent to wait until the disease progressed to CD4+ levels at which there was a proven benefit. The START (Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment) study is a randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to more clearly define the optimal time for people with HIV to begin antiretroviral therapy. The study was funded in part by NIH s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and other NIH components. Researchers in 215 clinics across 35 countries enrolled 4,685 HIV-positive men and women ages 18 and older. All participants had CD4+ counts in the normal range (above 500 cells/mm3) at the time of enrollment and had never taken antiretroviral therapy. They were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The early-treatment group began taking antiretrovirals immediately. The deferral group delayed treatment until their CD4+ counts dropped to 350 cells/mm3 or until they developed AIDS or another condition that required antiretroviral treatment. The team tracked combinations of outcomes: serious AIDS events (such as AIDS-related cancers or death from AIDS) and serious non-AIDS events (such as cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, liver disease, and non-AIDS-related death). In May 2015, an independent panel reviewed interim results. They found that the benefits of early antiretroviral therapy far outweighed any risks. The findings were disseminated to study participants, and treatment was offered to everyone in the deferred group.  The scientists determined that the overall risk of developing serious AIDS-related events, serious non-AIDS events, or death was reduced by 57% among those in the early-treatment group compared to those in the deferred group. This reduction was seen regardless of age, sex, baseline CD4+ counts, geographic region, or country income level. Early antiretroviral treatment lowered the risk of serious AIDS-related events by 72%. Early treatment also lessened the risk of serious non-AIDS events by 39%. A limitation of the study, the researchers note, is that the participants were fairly young, with a median age of 36 years. In addition, they were only followed for 3 years, which is fairly short given that antiretroviral therapy is typically prescribed for a lifetime.  This study conclusively shows that the benefits of early therapy far outweigh any adverse outcomes, and reinforces recommendations to offer immediate antiretroviral therapy to all HIV patients,  says NIAID Director Dr. Anthony S. Fauci.","Published: August 11, 2015"

During strenuous exercise, the rate of energy use in skeletal muscles can increase by more than 100-fold almost instantly. To meet this energy demand, muscle cells contain mitochondria. These organelles, commonly referred to as the cell s  power plants,  convert nutrients into the molecule ATP, which stores energy. In this process known as cellular respiration or oxidative phosphorylation the mitochondria act like small cellular batteries, using an electrical voltage across their membranes as an intermediate energy source to produce ATP. Scientists have long believed that the energy produced by mitochondria is distributed through muscle cells by some type of diffusion mechanism. However, studies have shown that these diffusion pathways alone are not sufficient to support normal muscle contraction.A team led by Drs. Robert S. Balaban and Sriram Subramaniam from NIH s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and National Cancer Institute (NCI), respectively, hypothesized that some other faster, more efficient energy pathway must spread energy throughout muscle cells. Their research was conducted on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  The group analyzed high-resolution 3-D images of mouse skeletal muscle. They used an imaging technique known as focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). Dr. Subramaniam and his team have used this approach, which they developed, to determine the structure of many key proteins, including brain receptors and the virus that causes AIDS. The researchers traced the paths of mitochondria and found that they formed a network, or reticulum. They hypothesized that these organelles might form a vast, interconnected network in a way that resembles electrical transmission lines in a municipal power grid. To test the idea, they used specially designed optical probes to examine the electrical connections among mitochondria. They found that the mitochondrial  wires  were electrically conductive and that most of the mitochondria were in direct electrical communication through the interconnecting network. The mitochondria were electrically coupled and able to rapidly distribute the mitochondrial membrane voltage the primary energy for ATP production throughout the cell.  The discovery of this mechanism for rapid distribution of energy throughout the muscle cell will change the way scientists think about muscle function and will open up a whole new area to explore in health and disease,  Balaban says.","Published: August 11, 2015"

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health, the results may provide a guide for discovering new treatments for Huntington s disease and a roadmap for studying other neurological disorders.  Our hope is to find ways that we can slow or delay the onset of Huntington s devastating symptoms,  said James Gusella, Ph.D., director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston, and the corresponding author of the study published online in Cell.  This could be possible because we now have a list of clinically proven genetic factors that influence the disease.  Huntington s disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in a gene that encodes a protein called Huntingtin. Symptoms usually begin in midlife and include uncontrolled movements, emotional disturbances and, eventually, dementia. Although studies in humans and animals have discovered clues as to how the disorder works, there are no effective treatments. For this study, the scientists tried a slightly different approach. They employed a novel application of Genome Wide Association Study analysis, a technique that scientists typically use to search for single letter changes to the DNA code on patients  chromosomes, which may increase or decrease their chances of having the disease. Here, the scientists already knew the disease-causing gene and so they used the technique to search for other changes that determine when the disease starts. They found that at least three sites were associated with symptoms appearing earlier or later than expected, two on chromosome 15 and one on chromosome eight.  This approach could have a significant impact on Huntington s disease patients and researchers,  said Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D., program director, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of NIH.  It s an example of how precision medicine may be applied to neurological disorders.  The study was conducted by the Genetic Modifiers of Huntington s Disease Consortium, an international team of scientists devoted to finding treatments for the disorder. Starting more than three decades ago they collected DNA samples and clinical information from patients, mainly in the United States, Canada and Europe.  We thank the patients and their families for their commitment to research,  said Dr. Gusella.  It takes a dedicated global effort to meet the complex challenges presented by neurological disorders like Huntington s disease.  The scientists used the patients  DNA and clinical information to study the age when movement problems began. Located on chromosome four, the Huntingtin gene is characterized by three letter repeats in the DNA code, called CAG-repeats. Disease-causing versions of the Huntingtin gene contain more than 35 CAG-repeats, which is higher than the six to 34 repeats found in normal versions. The greater number of CAGs a patient has, the greater the chances that symptoms will appear earlier in life. Focusing on patients who had 40 to 55 CAGs, the scientists found that some developed the disease earlier than expected while others developed it later. The scientists then analyzed the patients  chromosomes using gene chips that contain sites known for having single letter changes to the DNA code in normal human populations. After multiple rounds of searching they found that two sites on chromosome 15 were strongly associated with disease onset. One site was associated with hastening the disease by, on average, just over six years; another site was associated with slowing the disease by about a year and a half. They also found that a site on chromosome eight was associated with earlier disease onset by nearly one and a half years. Although the scientists did not identify specific genes, they used several types of genome network analyses to show that disease onset may be controlled by genes that repair DNA, catalyze essential chemical reactions in cells, and assist with the division of mitochondria. In addition, they noted that a site within the code for MLH1, a DNA repair gene located on chromosome three, may be involved. Finally, the scientists showed that the sites on chromosomes 15 and eight may be associated with the beginning of psychiatric and cognitive problems caused by the disease.  These results are an important step toward developing new treatments for Huntington s disease. They help us understand how, through evolution, nature has learned to modify the disease-causing effects of Huntington s disease mutations,  said Dr. Gusella.  As we study more patients we hope the information we obtain will soon reduce their suffering. ","Published: August 11, 2015"

Recurrence happens 70 percent of the time and is invariably fatal.  In their report, Harvard Medical School researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital describe how a single injection of a modified version of Mullerian Inhibiting Substance, a protein critical to sexual development, suppressed the growth of chemotherapy-resistant ovarian tumors in a mouse model.  While not all the tested tumors, which were grown from cells grafted from patient tumors, were sensitive to this treatment, the investigators also outlined a noninvasive way to screen cancer cells in vitro for treatment responsiveness.  Our findings are important because there are currently no therapeutic options for recurrent, chemoresistant ovarian cancer,  said David P pin, HMS instructor in surgery at Mass General and lead author of the report.  This is also a proof of concept that gene therapies with the AAV9 vector can be used to deliver biologics for the treatment of ovarian cancer and represents the first time this approach has been tested in this type of ovarian cancer model.  Potential to treat cancer During embryonic development, Mullerian Inhibiting Substance is secreted by tissues in male embryos to prevent maturation of the Mullerian duct, which otherwise would give rise to female reproductive organs. The potential of MIS to treat ovarian cancer and other reproductive tumors has been studied for many years by Patricia Donahoe,  Marshall K. Bartlett Distinguished Professor of Surgery at HMS, director of Mass General s Pediatric Surgical Research Laboratories and senior author of the current study.  Previous investigations by Donahoe s team showed that MIS suppresses ovarian cancer growth, both in animals and in human cell lines, by targeting the cancer stem cells that survive chemotherapy. But previous methods of producing MIS were unable to generate sufficient quantities of high-quality protein for pre-clinical testing. The current study employed a modified form of the MIS gene, developed by P pin to generate proteins of greater purity and effectiveness, combined with the accepted viral vector AAV9 for delivery into the peritoneal cavity, a common site for the recurrence of ovarian cancer. The modified MIS/AAV9 construct was tested against tumor cells taken from ascites fluid that had accumulated within the abdomens of several patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.  Testing effectiveness Initial experiments confirmed that these cells expressed the MIS receptor protein, that they carried markers indicating their identity as cancer stem cells, and that their growth was inhibited in vitro by MIS. A single injection of the MIS/AAV9 construct into the peritoneal cavity of mice resulted in elevated expression of MIS by multiple tissues throughout the abdominal cavity and in adjacent muscles. The effectiveness of the MIS/AAV9 construct was tested in mice into which ovarian cancer cells were implanted. Those efforts revealed that treatment with MIS/AAV9 three weeks before tumor implantation significantly inhibited tumor growth.  In a more clinically relevant experiment, the therapy was applied to mice in which tumors already had been induced by implantation of cancer cells from five different patients. The therapy resulted in significant inhibition of further growth of tumors generated from the cells of three of the five patients.  Analysis of tumor samples from more than 200 patients revealed that 88 percent expressed some level of the MIS receptor, with 65 percent expressing moderate or high protein expression. Need for biomarkers  Since the response to MIS gene therapy is not the same for all patients, it will be important to first screen each patient s tumors to ensure they will respond  said P pin.  While we have not yet identified biomarkers of treatment response something we are currently searching for we have described a way to rapidly grow tumor cells from ascites to be evaluated for drug sensitivity. If further study confirms the susceptibility of chemoresistant tumors to this MIS gene therapy, the ability to inhibit tumor recurrence could significantly extend patient survival.  The MIS/AAV9 construct was prepared by Guangping Gao, director of the Gene Therapy Center at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.  The single, long-acting injection makes the use of this effective but complex protein both clinically feasible and patient friendly, Donahoe said.  All of the implanted tumor cells were from patients who failed all previous therapies, so a 60 percent response rate is quite significant for a single agent,  said Donahoe.  Our results provide proof of concept and predict a translation into patient care that was not previously possible. ","Published: August 11, 2015"

Dr Heather Mortiboys, Parkinson s UK Senior Research Fellow from the University of Sheffield, explained:  We demonstrated the beneficial effects of UDCA in the tissue of LRRK2 carriers with Parkinson s disease as well as currently asymptomatic LRRK2 carriers. In both cases, UDCA improved mitochondrial function as demonstrated by the increase in oxygen consumption and cellular energy levels.  Oliver Bandmann, Professor of Movement Disorders Neurology at the University of Sheffield and Honorary Consultant Neurologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, added:  Whilst we have been looking at Parkinson s patients who carry the LRRK2 mutation, mitochondrial defects are also present in other inherited and sporadic forms of Parkinson s, where we do not know the causes yet. Our hope is therefore, that UDCA might be beneficial for other types of Parkinson s disease and might also show benefits in other neurodegenerative diseases. The research is also the first to demonstrate beneficial effects of UDCA on dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells affected in Parkinson s disease, in a fly model of Parkinson s disease which carries the same genetic change as some patients with the condition. A mutation in the LRRK2 gene is the single most common inherited cause of Parkinson s disease. However, the precise mechanism that leads to Parkinson s is still unclear. Defects in mitochondria, and as a consequence reduced energy levels, are a factor in a number of diseases that affect the nervous system including Parkinson s and Motor Neuron Disease. Nerve cells have a particularly high energy demands, therefore defects in the cell s energy generators will crucially affect their survival. Professor Bandmann added:  Following on from the promising results of our in vitro drug screen, we were keen to further investigate and confirm the potential of UDCA in vivo   in a living organism.  UDCA has been in clinical use for decades and thus could be advanced to the clinic rapidly if it proves beneficial in clinical trials.  Collaborators Rebecca Furmston, White Rose PhD student, and Dr Chris Elliott, from the University of York s Department of Biology, demonstrated the beneficial effects of UDCA in vivo using the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). In fruit flies, the mitochondrial defects caused by the LRRK2 mutation to dopaminergic neurons can be monitored through the progressive loss of visual function. Flies carrying the mutation maintained their visual response when fed with UDCA. Dr Elliott said:  The treatment of fruit flies carrying the faulty LRRK2 gene with UDCA showed a profound rescue of dopaminergic signalling. Feeding the flies with UDCA partway through their life slows the rate at which the fly brain then degenerates. Thus, mitochondrial rescue agents may be a promising novel strategy for disease-modifying therapy in LRRK2-related Parkinson s.  Dr Arthur Roach, Director of Research and Development at Parkinson s UK, which part-funded the study, said:  There is a tremendous need for new treatments that can slow or stop Parkinson s.  Because of this urgency, the testing of drugs like UCDA, which are already approved for other uses, is extremely valuable. It can save years, and hundreds of millions of pounds.  It s particularly encouraging in this study that even at relatively low concentrations the liver drug still had an effect on Parkinson s cells grown in the lab.  This type of cutting-edge research is the best hope of finding better treatments for people with Parkinson s in years, not decades. ","Published: August 11, 2015"

Anticholinergics are already known to have side effects such as temporary cognitive impairment, dizziness and confusion. But their effects on people with pre-existing brain and spinal injuries have not been investigated until now. Medications with anti-cholinergic properties are often used on neuro-rehabilitation units frequently to manage symptoms from urinary incontinence to pain. The study, led by the University of East Anglia, of 52 patients with acquired brain or spinal injury at a neuro-rehabilitation unit showed that the average length of stay was longer in patients with a higher level of anticholinergic drugs in their system, known as the anticholinergic drug burden, or ACB. Professor Phyo Myint, Chair in Old Age Medicine at the University of Aberdeen, who has conducted a number of previous studies examining the effect of medications with anti-cholinergic properties, analysed the results alongside Dr Chris Fox, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the Norwich Medical School at UEA. They showed that the change in ACB correlated directly to the length of hospital stay. A higher ACB score on discharge, compared with on admission, was associated with a longer stay in hospital and a lower ACB on discharge saw on average a shorter stay. The team cautioned however that as an observational study, cause-and-effect relationship cannot be implied. Dr Fox, lead author on the paper, said:  The findings suggest there may be a statistically significant relationship between ACB score and length of stay in a neuro-rehabilitation unit following traumatic brain or spinal cord injury . He added:  This pilot study demonstrates the need for larger studies to confirm the results and need for further investigation into what long-term effects these common medications are having on the recovery of these patients.   While medications with ACB are often needed to treat common complications of brain or spinal cord injuries, cognitive impairment due to the medication may adversely affect a patient s ability to engage in the rehabilitation process, potentially increasing their length of stay in hospital.  Length of patient stay is used a performance indicator for hospitals, with financial incentives in place for units to discharge patients as soon as is safe. Prof Fox said:  Identifying factors which might adversely affect the length of a patient s stay can have important financial as well as quality of life implications. So the findings of this study could be directly useful to current health care settings if they can reduce the time patients spend in rehabilitation units, improving wider efficiency of care.  Professor Myint added:  Our previous work suggests that anti-cholinergic use is common and observed in about a third of patients in an acute hospital setting among those aged 75 years or older and even higher in those aged over 90 years.  The current study results reinforce the fact that increased care must be taken to avoid the inappropriate prescribing of anti-cholinergic drugs. This is especially important and relevant in older people due to the significant decrease in cholinergic neurons or receptors in the brain associated with ageing, increased permeability of the blood brain barrier to these drugs, compounded by the reduction in hepatic break down mechanism and excretion through kidneys.

Stratified medicine is an approach which subdivides patients with a shared disease into groups based on, for instance, their risk of the disease progressing or how they respond to treatment.  Identification of these different groups can help predict the most effective and safe intervention for individual patients. In addition, by understanding the underlying mechanisms that cause these differences, researchers can develop new interventions for those groups whose needs are currently not well met. Molecular pathology is a major tool in stratified medicine. Tiny samples of blood or tissue are taken from the patient   usually with minimal discomfort because of the small amount taken and the use of minimally-invasive methods of collection. The samples are then analysed for levels of large molecules (such as proteins and DNA).  Combining these results with other information, such as imaging and clinical data, enables the precise subdivision of patients. Last year, the MRC produced a report that warned that, while UK investment in stratified medicine has reached nearly  200 million in the last four years, the UK capacity for molecular pathology needed to be increased in order to capture the potential patient and economic benefits stratification offers. To support molecular pathology, the MRC and EPSRC have supported six nodes led by the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leicester, Manchester, Newcastle and Nottingham. Each node brings researchers, clinicians and industry together to develop molecular diagnostic tools, to enable stratification, in disease areas such as cancer, respiratory diseases, digestive disease, infections, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and lupus. (See below for more information on the nodes.) The six nodes are collaborating with 20 industrial partners, including leading diagnostic and instrumentation companies and innovative technology and data SMEs. Minister for Life Sciences George Freeman welcomed the initiative, saying:  Advances in medical genetics and the use of data are making it possible to design a new generation of 'Stratified' or 'Precision' medicines which work more effectively, with fewer side effects, in more targeted groups of patients. In cancer this is leading to personally-tailored therapies. As an integrated healthcare system underpinned by our  1billion per annum National Institute for Health Research expenditure, the NHS is perfectly placed to pioneer this field. This  16 million investment will enhance our UK-wide capability to deliver 21st Century diagnostics and complement initiatives such as the Precision Medicine Catapult Centre to make sure that ground-breaking medicines and technologies are adopted by the NHS and delivered to patients as quickly as possible.  Professor Sir John Savill, Chief Executive at the MRC, said:  These new tools are critical for selecting the right treatment for the right patient. Being able to precisely target a treatment means maximum benefit for the patient   they receive a treatment that works for them and with fewer unpleasant side-effects.  But it also delivers economic benefit because money and time are not wasted on ineffective treatments.  Professor Philip Nelson, EPSRC s Chief Executive, said:  These awards bring together multidisciplinary teams to support innovation and develop molecular diagnostics. Working in partnership with the MRC enables us to accelerate the translation of research towards application in a clinical setting, and builds on EPSRC s underpinning investment in analytical science.  Dr Suzy Lishman, President of The Royal College of Pathologists, said:  Molecular pathology will revolutionise the way we diagnose and treat disease, with patients receiving treatment tailored to their particular condition. This  16m award comes at crucial time and will help ensure that medicine and industry work together to develop molecular pathology tests for the benefit of patients with a wide range of conditions. Pathology has always been central to diagnosis but plays an even more vital role in stratified medicine. This investment will help ensure that the UK has the molecular pathology capacity that it needs to provide world-leading diagnostics and the best possible care for patients.  Doris-Ann Williams MBE, Chief Executive of The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association (BIVDA), said:  Improved access to diagnostics is absolutely fundamental for enhanced patient care of the 21st century, so I am delighted by the creation of the pathology nodes. These will play a significant role in fostering collaboration between industry, clinicians and academia. The Government s life science policy means the UK is leading the world in the support of diagnostics and the recognition of their intrinsic value to healthcare.  The six Molecular Pathology Nodes: University of Edinburgh Edinburgh-St Andrews Consortium for Molecular Pathology, Informatics and Genome Sciences -  2m The Edinburgh-St Andrews Consortium will bring molecular diagnostics into mainstream medicine by use of modern genome technologies and information across a range of diseases. The consortium will integrate state-of-the-art genomic and epigenomic methods for diagnosis of acutely ill children and will develop  liquid biopsies  for managing cancer through analysis of circulating tumour DNA. University of Glasgow Glasgow Molecular Pathology (GMP) Node -  3.4m The Glasgow node will build on the University s existing strengths in pathology by improving care of cancer and chronic diseases. Researchers will work with industry to build a multidisciplinary centre of excellence to develop new molecular diagnostic tests. University of Leicester East Midlands Breathomics Pathology Node (EMBER) - Institutions University of Leicester, Loughborough University and University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust -  2.5m The air we breathe out contains a cocktail of volatile organic compounds that give a snapshot of the biological processes taking place in the lung and beyond. The Leicester node will help develop breath analysis tests that use the same technology as that used to detect explosives in war zones.  It s hoped these could give an instant diagnosis and help doctors pick the best treatments for a range of conditions, including cancers, respiratory infections and diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. University of Manchester Manchester Molecular Pathology Innovation Centre -  2.9m Developing biomarker based molecular pathology tests will be a major focus of the Manchester node with the initial work aimed at creating tests to diagnose, pick the right treatment and asses the response to treatment for a range of inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and psoriasis. Newcastle University The Newcastle Proximity Laboratory -  2.7m The Newcastle node will focus on developing new lab tests for rare and chronic diseases and will also be involved in training the next generation of molecular pathologists who will be vital in the delivery of precision medicine. University of Nottingham Nottingham Molecular Pathology Node (NMPN) for Integrated Multi-platform Biomarker Research and Knowledge Transfer -  2.4m The Nottingham node will bring together informatics, computational modelling and molecular pathology to find new biomarkers for a range of diseases   particularly those affecting the digestive and respiratory systems and the liver. These new markers will help doctors pick the best treatments for their patients.","Published: August 11, 2015"

Prevention or control of low-grade inflammation therefore seems to be an attractive target effect for healthy food or food ingredients. In a recent article commissioned by the ILSI Europe Obesity and Diabetes Task Force, experts present new approaches to capture inflammatory status in humans and to help quantify how much diet can positively modulate inflammation.   Inflammation acts as both a friend and foe, being essential in metabolic regulation, with unresolved low-grade chronic inflammation being a pathological feature of a wide range of chronic conditions including the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases , commented Prof. Anne Marie Minihane, University of East Anglia (UK).  The nutrition status of the individual with for example a deficiency or excess of certain micronutrients (e.g. folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin 1, vitamin E, zinc) may lead to an ineffective or excessive inflammatory response. Studies have showed that high consumption of fat and glucose may induce post-prandial inflammation (manifesting itself after the consumption of a meal), which may have consequences for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The Western-style diet, rich in fat and simple sugars but often poor in specific micronutrients, is linked to the increased prevalence of diseases with strong immunogical and autoimmune components, including allergies, food allergies, atopic dermatitis and obesity.","Published: August 11, 2015"

""Understanding and identifying biomarkers is a vital step toward cancer research and care,"" said Michael Freeman, PhD, vice chair of research in the Cedars-Sinai Department of Surgery, and lead author of the study. ""New profiling strategies exemplified by this study will ultimately improve our ability to treat cancer patients."" The newly identified biomarker   diaphanous - related formin-3 or DIAPH3   participates in a protein interaction that makes cells rigid. The study found that when this biomarker is lost or lowered, cells become ""deformable,"" squeezing through tissue spaces, causing disease growth or progression. This phenomenon is known as an amoeboid phenotype. Researchers can utilize this knowledge to better identify patients who will respond to common chemotherapy drugs, called taxanes, which are typically given to patients with the most aggressive forms of cancer. Taxanes work by damaging protein structures in cancer cells. This is the first study to identify a targeting strategy for tumor cells that exhibit amoeboid properties. ""By identifying cancer biomarkers, then customizing treatment plans for individuals based on this genetic information, we can greatly improve the effectiveness of cancer therapies,"" said Shlomo Melmed, MD, senior vice president of Academic Affairs and director of the Burns and Allen Research Institute. ""This customized plan replaces a one-size-fits-all approach to cancer treatment.""

Yeasts are single-celled fungi that originated over 100 million years ago. The ability of these organisms to ferment carbohydrates is widely used for food and drink fermentation. Yeasts are also one of the most commonly used model organisms in research. For example, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is used to make bread, wine and beer, was the first eukaryotic organism to be sequenced (in 1996) and is a key model organism for studying molecular and cellular biology. Once the yeast genome sequences were available, researchers were able to determine that the yeast genome contains more than 50 repeated fragments. Since then, the scientific community has accepted the theory that yeast underwent a whole genome duplication, a phenomenon that is not isolated and can also be found in other species. For instance, we know that whole genome duplications were important in the early evolution of vertebrates and that it is a very common phenomenon in plants, especially cultivated ones.The CRG scientists Marina Marcet-Houben and Toni Gabald n (CRG group leader and ICREA Research Professor) have now studied the origins of the whole genome duplication in yeast to gain a more thorough understanding of this phenomenon, which is thought to have played a key role the evolution and adaption of the species. Unexpectedly, their results show that the appearance of duplicated genes was not caused by a simple duplication of the whole genome but rather by a hybridization of two different species. Their proposal, which is at odds with the currently most widely accepted theory in the scientific community, provides new insight into this key process during genome evolution and the origins of species. ""When we first saw the results of our study, we thought there had been some kind of mistake. Honestly, when the results are not what you expect and contradict what is established, the first thing you do is think that they were affected by some kind of problem. But once all the potential problems have been discarded, you begin to interpret the data objectively, without preconceived ideas, and to do real science. That s when we started to consider the different possible explanations and to work on a new idea,  explained Toni Gabald n, the lead investigator of the study and head of the Comparative Genomics Group. He added, ""It's one of those magical moments of research when, once you open your mind enough, you can surrender to the evidence in the data and discard what you had considered as a proven fact to adopt an entirely new paradigm, no matter how implausible it seems at first. Afterwards you reel in your new paradigm and see that it also explains other independent observations. Scientifically it has been a challenging and rewarding experience. "" Looking at the past to understand the present and predict the future Once genomics entered into evolutionary studies, scientists were able to show that the phenomenon of whole genome duplication is common to several species, which leads us to believe that it is one of the key mechanisms in the evolution and adaptability of species. Duplicating the genome would give an organism multiple copies of genes, so that it could vary some of these copies over time without loosing the original and thus produce new proteins with novel functions, which could give it an evolutionary advantage by permitting it to adapt more readily and to cope with different conditions. However, it would seem intuitively to make sense that incorporating something different through hybridization, rather than duplicating what is already present, would lead more rapidly to a higher degree of diversity and to better adaptation. The problems with this are that most hybrid crosses are not viable, and if viable, the resulting hybrids are sterile and therefore unable to pass on their new genetic information to their offspring. Because of this, and because of the similarities of the repeated genes, the idea of duplicating the whole genome previously seemed more plausible. The work of Marcet-Houben and Gabald n has now revealed that, for yeast, hybridization was indeed behind the duplication of some genes. The researchers analyzed genomic data with computational tool, based on cutting-edge computational methods, and designed by the Gabald n group, to study the phylogenetic trees of yeast families. This tool allowed the researchers to reconstruct gene duplications and to determine what happened in evolutionary time, making it a computational equivalent of carbon-14 dating for fossils. To their surprise, they found that the age of some duplicated genes seemed to be much greater than that predicted by the theory of whole genome duplication. Rather than supporting a genome duplication event at the time when yeast evolved to have twice the number of chromosomes, their data indicated that the duplicated genes had begun to diverge long before. This result suggested the possibility of hybridization between species. In this case, the genes that have been duplicated still differ from each other, so that their divergence preceded the duplication of the chromosome. The hybridization hypothesis has strong implications on how we interpret the origin and evolution of duplicated genomes. For instance, we no longer need to imagine that massive and rapid changes are necessary to generate new functions from duplicated genome regions, since hybridization combines the properties of the two parental lines from day one and opens the door to new ecological and evolutionary opportunities. The new proposal is strengthened when we see that the number of genome duplications is much higher in cultivated plants. ""We should consider whether genome duplications in other species also hide hybridizations since, for example, it seems clear that we could be facing a similar situation in cultivated plants. Traditionally, growing a plant and improving its production will lead to forced hybridizations"" commented Gabald n. Being able to  look  at 100 million-year-old eukaryotic genomes will now allow us to deepen our knowledge about genomes as well as about the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to diversifying and acquiring new function. This challenging and innovative work will have major implications on how we interpret the functional and evolutionary consequences of genome duplication. It also highlights the importance of basic research for understanding genomes, evolution and diversity.","Published: August 11, 2015"

Under the agreement, MedImmune will acquire exclusive rights to Inovio s INO-3112 immunotherapy, which targets cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18.  INO-3112, which is in phase I/II clinical trials for cervical and head and neck cancers, works by generating killer T-cell responses that are able to destroy HPV 16- and 18-driven tumours.  These HPV types are responsible for more than 70 per cent of cervical pre-cancers and cancers.   MedImmune intends to study INO-3112 in combination with selected immunotherapy molecules within its pipeline in HPV-driven cancers.  Emerging evidence suggests that the benefits from immuno-oncology molecules, such as those in MedImmune s portfolio, can be enhanced when they are used in combination with cancer vaccines that generate tumour-specific T-cells. Under the terms of the agreement, MedImmune will make an upfront payment of $27.5 million to Inovio as well as potential future payments upon reaching development and commercial milestones totaling up to $700 million.  MedImmune will fund all development costs. Inovio is entitled to receive up to double-digit tiered royalties on INO-3112 product sales. Within the broader collaboration, MedImmune and Inovio will develop up to two additional DNA-based cancer vaccine products not included in Inovio s current product pipeline, which MedImmune will have the exclusive rights to develop and commercialise. Inovio will receive development, regulatory and commercialisation milestone payments and will be eligible to receive royalties on worldwide net sales for these additional cancer vaccine products.  David Berman, Senior Vice President and Head of the Oncology Innovative Medicines unit, MedImmune, said:  Today s collaboration with Inovio leverages our deep internal expertise in the use of vaccines to drive antigen-specific T-cell responses.  The unique combination of our broad immuno-oncology portfolio with Inovio s T-cell-activating INO-3112, which enhances cancer specific killer T-cells, has the potential to deliver real clinical benefits for patients.  J. Joseph Kim, President and CEO, Inovio, said:  Our licensing partnership with MedImmune represents an important step in executing our immuno-oncology combination strategy and advancing Inovio s cancer vaccine R&D pipeline with a leading cancer immunotherapy company.  INO-3112 is progressing, with positive interim data generated in an Inovio-initiated phase I study.  We appreciate MedImmune s recognition of our ability to activate best-in-class killer T-cells in vivo and look forward to working with them on this collaboration.  Today s agreement builds on the existing partnership between Inovio and MedImmune on two research and development collaborations in the infectious disease area.  Both efforts are funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and support R&D focused on Ebola, influenza, and bacterial infections.  MedImmune has a strong heritage in infectious disease and vaccine innovation, having developed the first monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food & Drug Administration for the prevention of an infectious disease and the technology that led to the creation of an HPV vaccine.

After 65, the risk doubles every five years, and 40 percent or more of people 85 and older are estimated to be living with the devastating condition. The changes center on amyloid beta 42, a main ingredient of Alzheimer s brain plaques. The protein, a natural byproduct of brain activity, normally is cleared from the brain before it can clump together into plaques. Scientists long have suspected it is a primary driver of the disease. We found that people in their 30s typically take about four hours to clear half the amyloid beta 42 from the brain,  said senior author Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology.  In this new study, we show that at over 80 years old, it takes more than 10 hours.  The slowdown in clearance results in rising levels of amyloid beta 42 in the brain. Higher levels of the protein increase the chances that it will clump together to form Alzheimer s plaques. For the study, the researchers tested 100 volunteers ages 60 to 87. Half had clinical signs of Alzheimer s disease, such as memory problems. Plaques had begun to form in the brains of 62 participants. The subjects were given detailed mental and physical evaluations, including brain scans to check for the presence of plaques. The researchers also studied participants  cerebrospinal fluids using a technology developed by Bateman and co-author David Holtzman, MD, the Andrew B. and Gretchen P. Jones Professor and head of the Department of Neurology at Washington University. The technology   known as stable isotope-linked kinetics (SILK)  allowed the researchers to monitor the body s production and clearance of amyloid beta 42 and other proteins. In patients with evidence of plaques, the researchers observed that amyloid beta 42 appears to be more likely to drop out of the fluid that bathes the brain and clump together into plaques. Reduced clearance rates of amyloid beta 42, such as those seen in older participants, were associated with clinical symptoms of Alzheimer s disease, such as memory loss, dementia and personality changes. Scientists believe the brain disposes of amyloid beta in four ways: by moving it into the spine, pushing it across the blood-brain barrier, breaking it down or absorbing it with other proteins, or depositing it into plaques.  Through additional studies like this, we re hoping to identify which of the first three channels for amyloid beta disposal are slowing down as the brain ages,  Bateman said.  That may help us in our efforts to develop new treatments. ","Published: August 11, 2015"

Analyzing over 42,000 Ebola-related tweets over a seven-day period, Odlum and Yoon found that on July 24, 2014, 101 tweets and re-tweets from Nigeria were posted regarding the disease, reaching some 1.2 million people. Messages such as  #EbolaVirus 1st case discovered Lagos, pls spread the word.  and  Guys,#EbolaVirus is in Lagos. Be informed. Be careful.  came a full two days before the Nigerian Ministry of Health issued its first message officially announcing the possible case of the disease in the country. Two days later, 1,010 Ebola-related tweets and retweets had reached more than 58 million people. And on July 30, more than 120 million people had read tweets about Ebola in Nigeria. Content analysis revealed that the main topics of the tweets were risk factors for Ebola, prevention information, such as careful hand-washing, locations and spreading patterns of the disease, and compassion for the sufferers.A puzzle remains: Why were people on Twitter able to reveal the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria before it was announced publicly? Odlum, who has a background in public health surveillance, said there is no way to tell and that it could have started from a tip, a leak, or simply worry based on the fact that there were Ebola cases elsewhere in Africa at the time.  What s more important than how it started is that it started,  said Odlum.  With these results we can see that Twitter   and potentially other social media   can support and enhance existing early warning systems for contagious diseases.  Yoon has analyzed tweets for potential health application since 2010. Her doctoral dissertation(link is external) mined social networks including Twitter for sentiment on physical activity. One of her studies mined joggers  tweets for clues about what motivated them to run.  She found that about 40 percent of runners said guilt was the primary prompt, followed by a desire for personal well-being, rather than enjoyment.  Our Ebola findings, as well as the jogging results, suggest that social and mobile tools may be effective at encouraging positive behavior,  said Yoon.  People can motivate each other to do what s best for their health. Health and policy officials can build on this propensity and promote other aspects of healthy living. By mining tweets, officials can discern epidemic trends and gather information on attitudes, fears, and behaviors, helping shape education and eradication campaigns.  Odlum and Yoon did not start out with the intent to research Ebola tweets.  We were originally interested in Tweet surveillance of a range of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV,  says Odlum. In the early phase of their investigation, Associate Professor Jacqueline Merrill, PhD, suggested that they concentrate exclusively on tweets surrounding Ebola, which was just beginning to become a news topic. The collaboration between Odlum and Yoon shows no signs of abating. After publication of their Ebola study, they were contacted by a pharmaceutical journal asking them to apply their methodology to tweets regarding vaccinations.  There is resistance in many parts of the world to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, among others,  said Odlum.  We ll be examining tweets to determine locations of outbreaks among unvaccinated children as well as monitoring fears, concerns, and support for the vaccine, with a goal of providing information to underlie education and implementation campaigns.

To protect consumers from taking something without their knowledge, scientists have developed a technique to determine what secret ingredients could be lurking in these supplements. They report their approach, which helped them find the active Viagra ingredient and other synthetic designer compounds in various products.  Dietary supplements can appear to be a healthful option for treating certain health conditions. Their labels list herbs or other natural ingredients that consumers assume are safe to take. But over the past several years, regulators have detected prohibited substances in some of these products that aren't included on the labels. The drug sibutramine is one of these substances.

But a European team led by scientists from DESY - a German national research centre composed of a series of particle accelerators - have now used Diamond to develop a new type of sample holder in which several thousand microcrystals can be positioned on a single silicon chip at the same time and then be examined by crystallographic methods. Scientists crystallize biological molecules such as proteins or viruses, and then use X-ray crystallography to visualize their atomic structure allowing us to understand how they function. Many of these structures are essential to understanding biological processes and developing new types of drugs. However, obtaining crystals can be difficult and time consuming. At Diamond, crystals are exposed to intense light in the form of X-rays; this results in the diffraction patterns from which the atomic structure is determined. Recent developments in X-ray sources with increasing brilliance, such as Diamond, DESY s PETRA III, or the new generation of free electron lasers (FELs), have opened the door to examining ever smaller crystals. These microcrystals are considerably easier to  grow , but because of their small size they call for new approaches in preparing specimens. Researchers from DESY in Germany, the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and Diamond Light Source in the UK have developed a new type of sample holder for  serial protein crystallography . The holder consists of a single crystal of silicon with a regular array of pores. As the tiny crystals fall into the pores, the holder allows them to be positioned with great precision, while at the same time producing virtually no disruptive signal of its own during the X-ray diffraction experiment, something that is unavoidable using conventional methods. About 20,000 microcrystals fit on the two square millimetre silicon chip, all of which could be scanned in less than three minutes at a source such as the LCLS in California, making it an extremely effective mechanism for crystallography experiments. The team used Diamond s I24 beamline to test the effectiveness of the new chip. Armin Wagner, one of the paper s authors and principal beamline scientist for Diamond s Long-wavelength MX beamline, comments:  Chips provide an exciting new way for sample mounting, both at sources such as Diamond and at free electron lasers, and could help address many of the challenges associated with sample mounting in microcrystallography. This is a great example of how synchrotrons are assisting with technical advances for the new FELs, where experimental time is extremely precious. We ll be refining the chip technique further with experiments at LCLS in July using crystals supplied by the Division of Structural Biology (STRUBI) at the University of Oxford.  The chip can be used at microfocus beamlines of synchrotron light sources such as Diamond, as well as with X-ray free electron lasers such as the LCLS in Stanford and the forthcoming European XFEL in Hamburg. In contrast to the methods typically used so far, such as liquid jets, in which microcrystals are surrounded by a liquid or a gel and then analyzed using X-rays, the new sample holder positions the crystals in small holes in a membrane made from a single silicon crystal, just ten micrometres thick, which can then be scanned by an X-ray beam. This technique ensures that the crystals can be accurately located.  Our new sample holder allows us to characterize tiny microcrystals with a unique level of efficiency,  explains Alke Meents, the scientist at DESY who is in charge of the work. Philip Roedig, a scientist at DESY and the principal author of the study, continues:  You can think of the chip as being like a sieve. The silicon membrane consists of a matrix of many tiny holes which are slightly smaller than the crystals themselves. In order to prepare the specimen, a drop of the mother solution containing the microcrystals is placed on top of the chip, and then the solution is drawn off from below. The crystals are left sticking in the holes, like in a sieve, and can be scanned by the X-ray beam, crystal by crystal. ","Published: August 11, 2015"

Ion channels, proteins that form pores in cell membranes, play central roles in organs in which conduction of electrical signals is vital, such as the brain and heart, but they are found in cells throughout the body. Although about 20 percent of FDA-approved medications target ion channels these proteins are considered especially  druggable  because of their location at the cell surface no channel blockers have been approved for cancer treatment. But as reported online in Nature Neuroscience, a drug that blocks channels that allow potassium ions to move out of cells was effective in slowing the growth of medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer, that had metastasized to the bones of the pelvis in a young patient. The drug in question, thioridazine, was originally developed to treat psychosis, but is now rarely used due to significant side effects.  We showed that blocking a specific ion channel in medulloblastoma can impede tumor cells from proliferating and spreading,  said Lily Jan, PhD, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator and professor of physiology at UCSF, and a senior scientist on the research team.  The development of a drug designed to act on this newly identified target more specifically and more powerfully, with fewer side effects, would have the potential to improve outcomes for many with this disease, which is a common cause of death in children.  The rationale for the unusual treatment had its roots in research begun about five years ago by former UCSF postdoctoral fellows Xi Huang, PhD, now at the University of Toronto s Hospital for Sick Children, and Ye He, PhD. In the Jan laboratory, Huang found that a subset of human medulloblastomas has a high abundance of an ion channel known as EAG2, which is the mammalian version of a fruit fly channel called ether-a-go-go. Initially found to be important for nervous system function in the 1960s, the fruit fly channel was given its whimsical name in keeping with that era, after scientists observed that mutations affecting the channel cause flies to do a dance-like twitching when exposed to ether. He, a member of the UCSF laboratory directed by Jan s husband and longtime research partner, Yuh Nung Jan, PhD, then joined the study, using fruit flies genetically manipulated to serve as models for brain tumors. Huang and He worked together to show that the fly channel protein, like the human protein, promotes brain tumor growth and metastasis. The UCSF team collaborated with scientists at the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto to show that both the fruit fly version of EAG2 and human EAG2 act in concert with another ion channel, called KCNT2, to promote tumor growth. Huang also discovered that changes in EAG2 abundance at the trailing edge of migrating tumor cells alter cell volume and shape, and enable tumor cells to more easily move and spread. When he transplanted EAG2-producing human medulloblastoma tissue into mice, he found that thioridazine inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Huang s presentations of this work at campus seminars led to the team s collaborations with medical colleagues and, eventually, to treatment of the patient at UCSF Medical Center. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, as well as experimental treatments, were no longer effective in arresting growth of widespread metastases in the patient, who had been originally diagnosed with medulloblastoma as a teenager. But after thioridazine treatment, UCSF physicians, including pediatric oncologist Sabine Mueller, MD, PhD, of the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Center, observed shrinkage of an EAG2-expressing metastatic tumor in the patient s pelvis. The patient could not tolerate thioridazine s side effects, however, and he succumbed to the disease several months after ending a two-month course of the drug. While the UCSF study is the first to demonstrate the potential impact of targeting ion channels in a patient with medulloblastoma, previous studies of other types of cancer cells suggest that similar ion channels, including a potassium channel known as EAG1, might also be promising targets for new cancer therapies.  Targeting of ion channels in cancer is a new frontier, and will be exciting to further explore as a way both to stop the growth of tumors and to limit their potential to spread,  Jan said.

Prescribed for up to 50 per cent of older people, medications with anticholinergic properties are used to treat a broad range of common conditions including bladder problems, depression and insomnia. Anticholinergics are already known to have side effects such as temporary cognitive impairment, dizziness and confusion. But their effects on people with pre-existing brain and spinal injuries have not been investigated until now. Medications with anti-cholinergic properties are often used on neuro-rehabilitation units frequently to manage symptoms from urinary incontinence to pain. The study of 52 patients with acquired brain or spinal injury at a neuro-rehabilitation unit showed that the average length of stay was longer in patients with a higher level of anticholinergic drugs in their system, known as the anticholinergic drug burden, or ACB. Results showed that the change in ACB correlated directly to the length of hospital stay. A higher ACB score on discharge, compared with on admission, was associated with a longer stay in hospital and a lower ACB on discharge saw on average a shorter stay. The team cautioned however that as an observational study, cause-and-effect relationship cannot be implied. Dr Chris Fox, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the Norwich Medical School at UEA and lead author on the paper, said: ""The findings suggest there may be a statistically significant relationship between ACB score and length of stay in a neuro-rehabilitation unit following traumatic brain or spinal cord injury."" He added: ""This pilot study demonstrates the need for larger studies to confirm the results and need for further investigation into what long-term effects these common medications are having on the recovery of these patients."" ""While medications with ACB are often needed to treat common complications of brain or spinal cord injuries, cognitive impairment due to the medication may adversely affect a patient's ability to engage in the rehabilitation process, potentially increasing their length of stay in hospital."" Length of patient stay is used a performance indicator for hospitals, with financial incentives in place for units to discharge patients as soon as is safe. Dr Ian Maidment, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Pharmacy at Aston University said: ""This work adds to the evidence that anticholinergics should be avoided in a wide-range of populations, when possible. Regular medication review by a nurse, doctor or pharmacist may be a way of ensuring that medicines with anti-cholinergic effects are used appropriately."" Prof Fox said: ""Identifying factors which might adversely affect the length of a patient's stay can have important financial as well as quality of life implications. So the findings of this study could be directly useful to current health care settings if they can reduce the time patients spend in rehabilitation units, improving wider efficiency of care.""

However, one challenge is reducing the tissue/neuron damage associated with needle penetration, particularly for chronic insert experiment and future medical applications. A solution strategy is to use microscale-diameter needles (e.g., < 5  m) with flexible properties. However, such physically limited needles cannot penetrate the brain and other biological tissues because of needle buckling or fracturing on penetration. A research team in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Information Engineering and the Electronics-Inspired Interdisciplinary Research Institute (EIIRIS) at Toyohashi University of Technology has developed a methodology to temporarily enhance the stiffness of a long, high-aspect-ratio flexible microneedle (e.g., < 5  m in diameter and > 500  m in length), without affecting the needle diameter and flexibility in tissue. This has been accomplished by embedding a needle base in a film scaffold, which dissolves upon contact with biological tissue. Silk fibroin is used as the dissolvable film because it has high biocompatibility, and is a known biomaterial used in implantable devices. ""We investigated preparation of a silk base scaffold for a microneedle, quantitatively analyzed needle stiffness, and evaluated the penetration capability by using mouse brains in vitro/in vivo. In addition, as an actual needle application, we demonstrated fluorescence particle depth injection into the brain in vivo,and confirm[ed] that by observing [with a] fluorescence confocal microscope"" explained the first author, master's degree student Satoshi Yagi, and co-author PhD candidate Shota Yamagiwa.

But when scientists silenced the gene in mice, it resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in the amount of a specific kind of unhealthy  white fat    the kind associated with obesity, heart disease and diabetes. The fat reduction occurred despite the mice consuming the same amount of food. Mice that were bred to have higher levels of the 14-3-3zeta protein were noticeably bigger and rounder, having an average of 22 per cent more white fat when fed a high calorie diet. Earlier this year, a consortium of scientists found over 100 regions on the human genome that correlate with obesity, likely through regulating the brain s perception of hunger and the distribution of fat throughout the body. That study, however, did not identify the gene that encodes 14-3-3zeta, which controls the production of fat cells (known as adipogenesis) and the growth of those cells.Discovery of this direct link between a protein and fat production points the way to a possible drug therapy. Scientists theorize that by suppressing the gene or blocking the protein, they could prevent fat accumulation in people who are overweight, or are on their way to becoming so.  People gain fat in two ways   through the multiplication of their fat cells, and through the expansion of individual fat cells,  said Gareth Lim, a postdoctoral fellow in UBC s Life Sciences Institute.  This protein affects both the number of cells and how big they are, by playing a role in the growth cycle of these cells.  Lim and James Johnson, a professor of cellular and physiological sciences, began investigating the 14-3-3 family of proteins four years ago as it often shows up in the unhealthy fat tissue of obese people. This study not only identified zeta as the operative protein, but demonstrated a clear cause-and-effect between 14-3-3zeta and fat accumulation.  Until now, we didn t know how this gene affected obesity,  Johnson said.  This study shows how fundamental research can address major health problems and open up new avenues for drug discovery.  Obesity is linked to increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. Worldwide, obesity costs society $2 trillion each year. More than one in four Canadians are obese, and that number continues to grow, according to Statistics Canada. Alarmingly, the obesity rate is also increasing in children. We don t fully understand how fat cells are made, and its clear that this information would be useful in efforts to prevent obesity.","Published: August 10, 2015"

But fuel cells in which electrical energy is harnessed directly from live, self-sustaining chemical reactions promise cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels. To facilitate faster energy conversion in these cells, scientists disperse nanoparticles made from special metals called  noble  metals, for example gold, silver and platinum along the surface of an electrode. These metals are not as chemically responsive as other metals at the macroscale but their atoms become more responsive at the nanoscale. Nanoparticles made from these metals act as a catalyst, enhancing the rate of the necessary chemical reaction that liberates electrons from the fuel.  While the nanoparticles are being sputtered onto the electrode they squash together like putty, forming larger clusters.  This compacting tendency, called sintering, reduces the overall surface area available to molecules of the fuel to interact with the catalytic nanoparticles, thus preventing them from realizing their full potential in these fuel cells.Research by the Nanoparticles by Design Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), in collaboration with the SLAC National Laboratory in the USA and the Austrian Centre for Electron Microscopy and Nanoanalysis, has developed a way to prevent noble metal nanoparticles from compacting, by encapsulating them individually inside a porous shell made of a metal oxide. Their work has immediate applications in the field of nano-catalysis for the manufacturing of more efficient fuel cells. The OIST researchers designed a novel system. They encapsulated Palladium nanoparticles in a shell of Magnesium oxide. Then they dispersed this core-shell combination on an electrode and measured the immersed electrode s abilities in improving the rate of the electrochemical reaction that occurs in methanol fuel cells. They demonstrated that encapsulated Palladium nanoparticles give a significantly superior performance than bare Palladium nanoparticles. The OIST researchers had previously realized that Magnesium oxide nanoparticles could form porous shells around noble metal nanoparticles while studying Magnesium and Palladium nanoparticles separately.  The porosity of this added armor ensures it does not screen molecules of the fuel from reaching the encapsulated Palladium.  Electron microscopy images confirmed that the Magnesium oxide shell simply acts as a spacer between the Palladium cores as they try to stick to each other, letting each to realize its full reactive potential. The advanced nanoparticle deposition system at OIST allowed the researchers to fine tune the experimental parameters and vary the thickness of the encapsulating shell as well as the number of Palladium nanoparticles in the core with relative ease. Tuning sizes and structures of nanoparticles alters their physical and chemical properties for different applications.  More core-shell combinations can be tried using our technique, with metals cheaper than Palladium for instance, like Nickel or Iron.  Our results show enough promise to continue in this new direction,  said Vidyadhar Singh, the paper s first author, and postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Prof. Mukhles Sowwan, the director of OIST s Nanoparticles by Design Unit, who was also a corresponding author of the paper.","Published: August 10, 2015"

The discovery provides an opportunity to pursue the development of novel drug therapies to address obesity, type 2 diabetes and related metabolic diseases. The new findings show that a small molecule called N1-methylnicotinamide prevents metabolic complications caused by a high-fat diet. ""Our laboratory investigates the metabolic effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD+], a metabolite derived from a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide,"" explained senior author Pavlos Pissios, PhD, an investigator in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at BIDMC and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. NAD+ is central to intermediary metabolism, the intracellular process by which food is converted into cellular components in the body. ""Like reservatrol, which is found in red wine, NAD+ boosts the effects of the protein sirtuin 1 [Sirt1], which is known to provide many health benefits,"" said Pissios. ""Interest in the metabolic effects of NAD+ has spurred the production of several new dietary supplements to improve metabolic health and delay aging. While these results have yet to be demonstrated in humans, recent research has shown that boosting tissue levels of NAD+ can improve health and reduce metabolic complications in mice that have been fed a high-fat diet."" The liver plays a central role in all metabolic processes, including breaking down fats to produce energy. Because a number of different proteins are involved in the metabolic effects of NAD+, Pissios and his colleagues hypothesized that there might be an as-yet-unidentified vitamin B3 pathway that was directly regulating liver metabolism. ""We thought that, in addition to boosting NAD+, vitamin B3 might be positively impacting liver metabolism by acting directly on another pathway,"" he explained. To test this hypothesis, the researchers conducted a variety of experiments that assessed these proteins. Their results showed that nicotinamide N-methyltransfersase (NNMT), a ""clearance"" enzyme that helps the body excrete excess vitamin B3, also plays a more prominent metabolic role. ""Our lab had been gathering evidence that NNMT not only functions to clear nicotinamide from the liver, but is also involved in the regulation of liver metabolism,"" said Pissios. ""We confirmed this in our new study, which found that N1-methylnicotinamide, the product of nicotinamide methylation by NNMT, increases Sirt1 protein levels and improves metabolism."" In subsequent experiments, Pissios and colleagues found that NNMT correlated positively with Sirt1 and a healthy metabolic profile in mice, and also showed that humans with low cholesterol and low triglycerides exhibited high levels of NNMT and Sirt1 in their livers. ""Since N1-methylnicotinamide is a small molecule, we were able to feed it directly to mice to find out if it would prevent the metabolic complications caused by a high-fat diet,"" said Pissios. As predicted, N1-methylnicotinamide increased liver Sirt1 protein and suppressed triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis resulting in a healthier liver -- with fewer inflammatory markers, less liver fat and lower cholesterol compared to control groups. ""We have now identified a new vitamin B3 pathway that regulates liver metabolism and provides us with an opportunity to pursue development of novel treatments for metabolic diseases,"" said Pissios.","Published: August 10, 2015"

Currently, doctors try to identify CM defects using video-microscopy or indirectly via the examination of cilia ultrastructural defects using electron microscopy. This usually entails analysis of cilia movement in respiratory cells obtained from nasal passages, explained senior investigator Chakra Chennubhotla, Ph.D., assistant professor of computational and systems biology, Pitt School of Medicine.  Visual reviews like these can be subjective, time-consuming and error-prone,  he said.  In this project, our team used computational methods to objectively and reliably identify CM defects.  The researchers used two independent data sets   one from Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC (CHP) and the other from Children s National Medical Center (CNMC) in Washington, D.C.   from healthy individuals as well as patients already diagnosed with either congenital heart disease or primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) to identify the digital signatures of normal and abnormal movement, accounting for factors such as how frequently the cilia beat back and forth, the breadth and rotation of their beat pattern, and their synchronicity. The researchers then validated their technique by testing the patient samples in blind fashion, finding that the computational tool correctly identified more than 90 percent of PCD cases at CHP and all of the cases at CNMC. PCD is a rare condition in which the cilia are immotile or beat abnormally, leading to limitation of airway mucus clearance, compromised respiratory function and increased risk for lung infections and other bronchial problems.  We hope to start a clinical trial in which doctors from around the country can upload a video of their patient s nasal lining to a website for assessment of ciliary motion with this technique,  said co-investigator Cecilia Lo, Ph.D., Dr. F. Sargent Cheever Professor and chair of Developmental Biology, Pitt School of Medicine.  If successful, this approach may in the future serve as a rapid first-tier screen to identify at-risk patients.

The findings point to a target for potential treatments aimed at enhancing muscle regeneration. Muscle breakdown occurs in response to injury or inactivity -- during immobilization in a cast, for example -- and in several diseases such as diabetes and cancer. CD163 was known to scientists, mostly as a molecule involved in scavenging excess hemoglobin from the body, but its role in regulating muscle repair was not, says senior author Aloke Finn, MD, assistant professor of medicine (division of cardiology) at Emory University School of Medicine. Mice lacking CD163 showed increased blood flow and muscle repair, compared with controls, after an injury coming from a restriction of blood flow in one leg. Examining the mice lacking CD163, Finn and his colleagues were surprised to find that blood vessels and muscle fibers also grew substantially (roughly 10 percent) in the uninjured legs of the mice.  We were astonished,  Finn says.  Why would something we did, which caused an injury to one leg, help tissue in the other leg regenerate when it wasn t injured in the first place?  Researchers could try to achieve the effect of removing CD163 in humans by giving patients an antibody against CD163, but more research is needed to know how this might work. CD163 levels have been found to increase in aging humans. Finn and his colleagues found that macrophages, which are a type of white blood cell, appear to release a soluble form of CD163 in response to injury. In the blood, CD163 soaks up and counteracts another protein called TWEAK, which stimulates muscle cells to multiply. In CD163 s absence, TWEAK can have a greater effect, and can apparently stimulate muscle growth distant from the site of injury. When infused into normal mice, TWEAK does not have any effect on muscle growth, possibly because of circulating CD163. Scientists that study muscle cells have been interested in TWEAK for several years, but some studies have suggested that TWEAK negatively regulates muscle regeneration   the opposite of what Finn s team observed. To prove that TWEAK was needed for the extra repair seen in mice lacking CD163, the Emory researchers showed that if they injected an antibody against TWEAK, thus removing it from the blood, it eliminated the extra repair activity.  I think our results show a specific mechanism by which muscle regeneration takes place. TWEAK can be a pro-regenerative factor,  Finn says,  but its effects have to be transient and limited.  TWEAK is thought of as transmitting inflammatory signals because it activates a master regulator of inflammation called NF-kB. While chronic inflammation is bad for muscle growth, in the mice lacking CD163, the signals coming from increased TWEAK are helpful for regeneration.  Ischemic injury is a situation in which TWEAK can stimulate muscle progenitor cells to proliferate,  Finn says.  But if you have lots of TWEAK around all the time, the muscle cells don t know when it s time to differentiate and mature.   Finn says his team is currently investigating CD163 s effects on atherosclerosis. ","Published: August 10, 2015"

They have given access to medical and life histories, including diseases, health-related behaviors, cognitive status, psychological and physical well-being, and detailed geographical data showing where subjects have lived over the course of their lives. As new molecular assays have been developed, the WLS cohort has also contributed biological samples such as saliva, which can be genotyped.Now, with the advent of new high-throughput genetic sequencing technologies, a new frontier beckons: the microbiome. In our gut, each of us has a unique ecosystem composed of hundreds of species of microorganisms, acquired since birth from the environment, our food and the people closest to us. Together with their genes, this collection of microorganisms is known as the microbiome. Humans and other animals are utterly dependent on these microbial hitchhikers to do things like digest food, process nutrients, modulate the immune system and outcompete the pathogenic microbes that sometimes infect us. ""We know relatively little about the gut microbiome,"" explains Pamela Herd, a professor in the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Robert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs and the principal investigator of the WLS. ""But one of the things that is so interesting about it is its plasticity. The broader environment seems to influence its composition."" To date, studies of human gut microbiota have been limited. The largest study, conducted in 2012 and supported by the National Institutes of Health, sampled ""healthy"" human microbiomes from 256 people selected non-randomly from St. Louis and Houston. Researchers are also hamstrung by limited environmental information from their subjects. Things like diet, social interaction and where people live are known to influence the composition of the gut's resident colony of microbes. There is also little known about the microbial communities that colonize the elderly. It is known that gut microbiota in the elderly are more varied from person to person, and that those differences can be associated with health, including frailty, inflammation and obesity. To begin to address some of these limitations, Herd and her WLS colleagues have embarked on a novel collaboration with the lab of UW-Madison bacteriology Professor Federico Rey. With the help of the University of Wisconsin Survey Center, the WLS researchers have collected fecal samples from more than 400 participants in the WLS to begin to map out the health implications of the microbes that live in our gut as we grow old. ""This is not easy data to collect,"" notes Rey, who participated in a landmark study while at Washington University showing that the composition of the microbes in the gut can significantly influence metabolism and obesity. In that study, human microbiota samples were transplanted into germ-free mice to see, among other things, if the mouse recipients would mirror the metabolism or obesity of the human donor, which they in fact did. ""People who are obese have a different microbiome,"" says Rey, ""and we can colonize mice with human fecal samples to reflect aspects of that phenotype."" The new effort by WLS and the collaboration with Rey is a rare marriage of biology and social science. The fact that the subjects of the WLS have been intensively tracked for almost 60 years, means the information found in their microbiomes can be correlated with where they lived, who they lived with, their health and employment histories, and even their psychological well-being. Such things as where someone has lived, for example, may be reflected in the gut microbiome because the germs we accumulate in our gut can come from things like soil.  Observations drawn from WLS data can be tested in the context of the microbiome. For example, WLS data suggest that growing up poor can have a ""sustained influence on health and mortality across the life course."" In another context, being raised on a farm - as 20 percent of the WLS sample were - seems to have a significant positive influence on health and longevity.  ""We have decades of information on social relationships,"" says Herd, ""and we're wondering about things like how social relationships affect the microbiome. Every time we shake hands or kiss, we exchange microbes. Some studies have shown that people who are isolated are likely to die younger, but why?"" Exploring the microbiome in the context of the WLS data may help provide some answers because environment and social interaction seem to play such a large role in the composition and changes to the microbiome. And like genetic information, it may be possible in the future to predict health or prescribe medical interventions based on what your microbiome says about you, says Rey. ""Environment matters,"" he argues, ""and the things we are going to be looking at promise to take our understanding of that to an entirely new level.""","Published: August 10, 2015"

It can occur in various forms, differing not only by specific changes in the genetic material of the leukemia cells but also by their response to therapies. Now, an international team of scientists from Berlin, D sseldorf, Hannover, Heidelberg, Kiel, and Zurich have succeeded in decoding the molecular characteristics of an as yet incurable subtype of leukemia, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches.  Although intensive research over the last decade has significantly improved the survival rates of children suffering from ALL, a subset of patients remains resistant to treatment. One example is the very aggressive and incurable subtype associated with a t(17;19) chromosomal translocation, which occurs due to breakage and aberrant fusion of genetic material in the tumour cells, resulting in the formation of a new oncogenic protein encoded by the genes TCF3 and HLF (TCF3-HLF-positive leukemia cells). Until now, the molecular basis of this phenotype has remained elusive. An international group of clinicians and scientists from different universities and research institutions, with contributions from the Berlin-based company Alacris Theranostics GmbH, has conducted an in-depth analysis of the molecular features of the t(17;19) ALL subtype. The consortium team decoded the genome of the leukemic cells using sophisticated bioinformatics methods. The team found genetic aberrations in addition to the known translocation. ""We are glad that we could contribute to this important project with genomic data analysis of leukemia cells to unravel some of the molecular changes in this disease"", says Bodo Lange (CEO, Alacris Theranostics). With the aim of identifying therapeutic entry points for this incurable form of ALL, the transcriptome of the cancer cells was also analyzed in great detail, enabling identification of the genes active within the leukemic cell. The so-called expression profile of the cancer cells was deciphered by means of RNAseq, a focus of research in Marie-Laure Yaspo s group at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. The interplay between the fused TCF3-HLF oncogenic protein, additional DNA changes and altered gene expression program leads to a re-programming of leukemic cells to an early, stem-cell like developmental stage, although the phenotypic appearance of the cells remains similar.  This technique provides a quantitative read out of the actual genetic program occurring in the cancer cells, which allowed us to uncover relevant molecular mechanisms cooperating to  promote tumorigenesis, and to identify possible druggable targets. These findings could only be achieved through analysis of the messenger RNAs , says Marie-Laure Yaspo. In tandem, researchers from the team of Jean-Pierre Bourquin (University Children s Hospital, Z rich) transplanted the leukemic cells in mice and established a  humanised mouse model , an invaluable tool for testing therapeutic response. The consortium team demonstrated that the mouse engrafted and expanded cells retained most of the genetic features and expression profiles of the original leukemic cells. The cells thus behaved in a similar manner than in the patient, offering an attractive possibility for translational medicine. The Zurich Group tested close to hundred drugs, and demonstrated a very positive response of the mouse model TCF3- HLF-positive cells to Venetoclax, a drug targeting the protein BCL2, and which has already showed efficiency in other type of cancers. The results of this study show the strong potential of coordinated research between an international consortium and the use of new technologies for advancing cancer research. This project was made possible through the shared contribution of the research teams from JeanPierre Bourquin, University Children s Hospital Z rich, Martin Stanulla, Hannover Medical School, Arndt Borkhardt, Heinrich-Heine University, D sseldorf, Jan Korbel, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Andre Franke, Christian-AlbrechtsUniversity Kiel, and Marie-Laure Yaspo at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. Contributions to the genomic data analysis of leukemic cells came from the Berlin-based company Alacris Theranostics. The project was funded by the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection via the environmental research program of the German Federal Environment Ministry and by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF).","Published: August 10, 2015"

When a blood vessel becomes damaged, a protein called von Willebrand factor (vWF) helps stop bleeding by guiding clot-forming platelets to the injury. vWF serves as the  glue  that helps platelets stick to a wound. Approximately 1 percent of the general population lacks a sufficient quantity of fully functioning vWF[1]. This results in vW disease, which is characterized by excessive and often hard-to-treat bleeding. While some patients with vW disease have mild or no symptoms, others have a more severe form of the disease that can be difficult to treat. Until recently, bleeding episodes in individuals with severe vW disease were treated with an infusion of purified vWF, which circulates in combination with factor VIII (FVIII), another clotting protein. While this treatment approach is often effective, the major disadvantage is that vWF is purified from plasma, which has the potential to introduce patients to blood-borne contaminants. Seeking a more targeted vW disease treatment without the disadvantages associated with blood-derived products, investigators engineered a cell line that expresses the vWF gene to create a consistent, highly active recombinant vWF (rvWF). After preliminary studies, investigators enrolled 49 patients who had received vWF concentrate treatment for at least one severe vW disease-related bleed within the last 12 months in a Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rVWF. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms. In order to observe rvWF s activity at varying doses and in different treatment scenarios, investigators gave patients 50 IU/kg or 80 IU/kg body weight either alone or with engineered FVIII (rFVIII). The majority of patients in the study received as-needed treatment of 40-60 IU rvWF/kg for regular bleeding episodes and up to 80 IU/kg for major bleeds. Confirming the results of past studies, the activity of rvWF remained the same with and without rFVIII. Investigators observed that patients who received rvWF alone experienced a rapid increase in their naturally produced FVIII. In fact, within six hours after an infusion, patients had produced enough of the protein for proper clotting. This response was sustained through 72 hours post infusion, suggesting that patients who receive rvWF are not likely to require additional rFVIII infusions. vW disease specialists also rated the recombinant product s ability to control bleeds on a scale of  excellent  to  no response.  After 12 months, the specialists had treated 192 bleeding episodes in 22 patients with severe vW disease and rated rvWF as  excellent  (96.9%) or  good  (3.1%) in controlling bleeding. In addition, more than 80 percent of bleeds were resolved with a single rvWF infusion.  These efficacy and safety data of recombinant vWF represent a major advance in our quest to develop an optimal treatment for people living with vW disease,  said lead investigator Bruce Ewenstein, MD, PhD, of Baxalta, Inc.  As this product is specifically designed to be administered without factor VIII, it will allow physicians to dose vWF and FVIII separately and precisely based on the needs of each individual patient. This treatment strategy has the potential to become the standard of care for patients with severe von Willebrand disease. ","Published: August 10, 2015"

The test was developed by Amber Southwell, Michael Hayden, and Blair Leavitt of UBC s Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics and the Centre for Huntington Disease in collaboration with colleagues from Mayo Clinic.   This is an important breakthrough for several promising gene silencing therapies in Huntington s disease that are now moving from the bench to the bedside,  said Leavitt.  We can move forward with these clinical trials and accurately measure whether our treatments are working. Huntington s disease is a genetic disorder but symptoms generally don t appear until later in life. It affects the brain and gradually worsens, causing problems with coordination and movement, mental decline and psychiatric issues. The genetic mutation responsible for Huntington s produces a toxic form of a protein called huntingtin, which progressively injures brain cells. Reducing brain levels of this toxic protein should prevent or delay the onset of symptoms. Several huntingtin-lowering therapies have already shown great promise in animal models of Huntington s disease and are rapidly approaching trials in humans. The UBC research team found that they could accurately measure the levels of mutant huntingtin protein in the brain by collecting cerebrospinal fluid from a spinal tap. The ultrasensitive test detects small amounts of the toxic protein and can be used to follow changes in brain levels of the protein over time in response to new therapies. This study enables Leavitt to initiate a new clinical trial of a huntingtin gene-silencing therapy for patients at the Centre for Huntington Disease at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, a partnership between UBC and Vancouver Coastal Health. This trial will test the safety of a novel gene-silencing treatment in patients and is already in the process of screening patient candidates. The trial will be the first human study of a drug targeting mutant huntingtin.","Published: August 10, 2015"

And now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have shown that they can trick malaria-infected red blood cells into building up a volatile chemical stockpile that can be set off by luminol s glow. To achieve this, the scientists gave infected red blood cells an unusual amino acid and used luminol s glow to trigger the chemical, killing the parasite.  The light that luminol emits is enhanced by the antimalarial drug artemisinin,  said senior author Daniel Goldberg, MD, PhD, professor of medicine and molecular microbiology.  We think these agents could be combined to form an innovative treatment for malaria. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2013, malaria infected 198 million people and killed 584,000, the majority of whom were African children. The new therapy would have an advantage over current malaria treatments, which have become less effective as the parasite mutates. WHO recommends that artemisinin   the most commonly used antimalarial drug   only be used in combination with other treatments because the parasite is becoming resistant to it. The new approach targets proteins made by human red blood cells, which the parasite can t mutate. In the study, researchers led by first author Paul Sigala, PhD, a scientist in Goldberg s laboratory, worked with human red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite. They wanted to better understand how the parasite gets hold of heme, the deep red, nonprotein part of hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Heme is essential to the parasite s survival. The malaria parasite opens an unnatural channel on the surface of red blood cells. When scientists put an ingredient of heme   an amino acid   into the solution containing the cells, the amino acid entered the cells through the channel and started the heme-making process. The process led to a buildup of a molecule called protoporphyrin IX. When exposed to light, this molecule emits dangerous, chemically reactive compounds known as free radicals, killing the parasites. The research team plans to test the approach in animal studies.  All of these agents   the amino acid, the luminol and artemisinin   have been cleared for use in humans individually, so we are optimistic that they won t present any safety problems together,  said Goldberg, who is co-director of the Division of Infectious Diseases.  This could be a promising new treatment for a devastating disease. ","Published: August 10, 2015"

AstraZeneca will focus on exploring HTL-1071 and any additional compounds across a range of cancers, including in combination with its existing portfolio of immunotherapies. Tumour cells have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system, including through the production of a natural molecule called adenosine. By stimulating A2A receptors, adenosine stops T-cells within the immune system from proliferating and reduces their ability to destroy cancer cells. Blocking A2A receptors can therefore promote the anti-cancer response of T-cells within the tumour microenvironment. Under the terms of the agreement, Heptares will grant AstraZeneca an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialise HTL-1071. The companies will also collaborate to discover further A2A receptor-blocking compounds for development in cancer immunotherapy. Heptares will receive an upfront payment of $10 million and is eligible to receive additional, significant near term milestone payments based on agreed pre-clinical and/or clinical events. Subject to successful completion of development and commercialisation milestones, Heptares is also eligible to receive more than $500 million, as well as up to double-digit tiered royalties on net sales. Susan Galbraith, Vice President, Head of Oncology in AstraZeneca s Innovative Medicines and Early Development Unit said:  We are pleased to expand our successful collaboration with Heptares into the exciting area of immuno-oncology research.  By combining the pioneering A2A receptor programme with the strength of AstraZeneca s existing oncology portfolio, we hope to develop novel treatments with the potential to transform the lives of patients.  Malcolm Weir, Chief Executive Officer of Heptares said:  The A2A receptor programme at Heptares has been an outstanding example of our Structure Based Drug Design approach in action, resulting in a novel clinical candidate, HTL-1071, with a highly attractive profile. Heptares is targeting G-protein-coupled receptors that play a key role in cancer biology through the identification of both antibody and small molecule therapeutics.  We are delighted to be entering this expanding field by partnering with AstraZeneca, an innovative leader in the field of cancer immunotherapy. This agreement further builds on our successful existing research collaboration. ","Published: August 10, 2015"

Our research is in the early phase of drug development process, but the study tells us the enzyme has the right properties to eventually become a successful therapeutic,  said Kim Janda, the Ely R. Callaway Jr. Professor of Chemistry and member of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at TSRI. The new research offers a possible alternative to current smoking cessation aids, which are shown to fail in at least 80 to 90 percent of smokers. The idea behind an enzyme therapy would be to seek out and destroy nicotine before it reaches the brain depriving a person of the  reward  of nicotine that can trigger relapse into smoking.For more than 30 years, Janda and his colleagues have struggled to create such an enzyme in the lab, but they recently ran across a potential enzyme found in nature NicA2 from the bacteria known as Pseudomonas putida. It turns out this bacterium originally isolated from soil in a tobacco field consumes nicotine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen.  The bacterium is like a little Pac-Man,  said Janda.  It goes along and eats nicotine.  In the new study, the TSRI researchers characterized the bacterial enzyme responsible for nicotine degradation and tested its potential usefulness as a therapeutic. The researchers first combined serum (a component of blood) from mice with a dose of nicotine equivalent to one cigarette. When they added the enzyme, the nicotine s half-life dropped from two to three hours to just 9 to 15 minutes. Janda said a higher dose of the enzyme with a few chemical modifications could reduce the half-life of nicotine even further and keep it from ever reaching the brain. Next, the researchers subjected the enzyme to a barrage of tests to determine its practicality as a drug candidate.  It was a long shot,  said Janda.  If it didn t have the right metrics, it would be a bust.  The results were encouraging. The enzyme stayed stable in the lab for more than three weeks at 98 degrees Fahrenheit which Janda said was  pretty remarkable.  Importantly, the researchers detected no toxic metabolites produced when the enzyme degraded nicotine.  The enzyme is also relatively stable in serum, which is important for a therapeutic candidate,  said Song Xue, a TSRI graduate student and first author of the new study. Janda said the next step is to alter the enzyme s bacterial makeup, which will help mitigate potential immune liabilities and maximize its therapeutic potential.  Hopefully we can improve its serum stability with our future studies so that a single injection may last up to a month,  added Xue.","Published: August 10, 2015"
3,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/how-chronic-inflammation-can-lead-to-cancer-197202,How Chronic Inflammation Can Lead to Cancer Researchers discover how the immune system can create cancerous DNA mutations when fighting off infection  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Chronic inflammation caused by disease or exposure to dangerous chemicals has long been linked to cancer, but exactly how this process takes place has remained unclear. Now, a precise mechanism by which chronic inflammation can lead to cancer has been uncovered by researchers at MIT   a development that could lead to improved targets for preventing future tumors. The researchers have unveiled how one of a battery of chemical warfare agents used by the immune system to fight off infection can itself create DNA mutations that lead to cancer.As many as one in five cancers are believed to be caused or promoted by inflammation. These include mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer caused by inflammation following chronic exposure to asbestos, and colon cancer in people with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, says Bogdan Fedeles, a research associate in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT, and the paper s lead author. Innate immune response Inflammation is part of the body s innate response to invading pathogens or potentially harmful irritants. The immune system attacks the invader with a number of reactive molecules designed to neutralize it, including hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide and hypochlorous acid. However, these molecules can also cause collateral damage to healthy tissue around the infection site:  The presence of a foreign pathogen activates the immune response, which tries to fight off the bacteria, but in this process it also damages some of the normal cells,  Fedeles explains. Previous work by Peter Dedon, Steven Tannenbaum, Gerald Wogan, and James Fox   all professors of biological engineering at MIT   had identified the presence of a lesion, or site of damage in the structure of DNA, called 5-chlorocytosine (5ClC) in the inflamed tissues of mice infected with the pathogen Helicobacter hepaticus. This lesion, a damaged form of the normal DNA base cytosine, is caused by the reactive molecule hypochlorous acid   the main ingredient in household bleach   which is generated by the immune system. The lesion, 5ClC, was present in remarkably high levels within the tissue, says John Essigmann, the William R. (1956) and Betsy P. Leitch Professor in Residence Professor of Chemistry, Toxicology and Biological Engineering at MIT, who led the current research.  They found the lesions were very persistent in DNA, meaning we don t have a repair system to take them out,  Essigmann says.  In our field lesions that are persistent, if they are also mutagenic, are the kind of lesions that would initiate cancer,  he adds. DNA sequencing of a developing gastrointestinal tumor revealed two types of mutation: cytosine (C) bases changing to thymine (T) bases, and adenine (A) bases changing to guanine (G) bases. Since 5ClC had not yet been studied as a potentially carcinogenic mutagen, the researchers decided to investigate the lesion further, in a bid to uncover if it is indeed mutagenic. Using a technique previously developed in Essigmann s laboratory, the researchers first placed the 5ClC lesion at a specific site within the genome of a bacterial virus. They then replicated the virus within the cell. The researchers found that, rather than always pairing with a guanine base as a cytosine would, the 5ClC instead paired with an adenine base around 5 percent of the time   a medically relevant mutation frequency, according to Essigmann. Damaged DNA The findings suggest that the immune system, when triggered by infection, fires hypochlorous acid at the site, damaging cytosines in the DNA of the surrounding healthy tissue. This damage causes some of the cytosines to become 5ClC. In addition, the researchers hypothesize that the hypochlorous acid also damages cytosines in the nucleotide pool, which cells use as the reservoir of nucleotides that will become part of the DNA of replicating cells, Essigmann says.  So 5ClC forms first in genomic DNA, and secondly it can form in the nucleotide pool, meaning the nucleotides in the pool are mutagenic in themselves,  he explains.  This scenario would best explain the work of James Fox and his MIT colleagues on gastrointestinal cancer.  To confirm that 5ClC is mutagenic in human DNA, the researchers replicated the genome containing the lesion with a variety of different types of polymerase, the enzyme that assembles DNA, including human polymerases.  In all cases we found that 5ClC is mutagenic, and causes the same kind of mutations seen within cells,  Fedeles says.  That gave us confidence that this phenomenon would in fact happen in human cells containing high levels of 5ClC.  What s more, the C-to-T mutation characteristic of 5ClC is extremely common, and is present in more than 50 percent of mutagenic  signatures,  or patterns of DNA mutations, associated with cancerous tumors.  We believe that in the context of inflammation-induced damage of DNA, many of these C-to-T mutations may be caused by 5ClC, possibly in correlation with other types of mutations as part of these mutational signatures,  Fedeles says. Yinsheng Wang, a principal investigator in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Riverside who was not involved in the research, says the paper provides a novel mechanistic link between chronic inflammation and cancer development.  With a combination of biochemical, genetic, and structural biology approaches, the researchers have found that 5-chlorocytosine is intrinsically miscoding during DNA replication and it could give rise to significant frequencies of C-to-T mutation, a type of mutation that is frequently observed in human cancers,  Wang says.  Studies of tissue samples of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease have found significant levels of 5ClC, Fedeles adds. By comparing these levels with his team s findings on how mutagenic 5ClC is, the researchers predict that accumulation of the lesions would increase the mutation rate of a cell up to 30-fold, says Fedeles, who was honored with the prestigious Benjamin F. Trump award at the 2015 Aspen Cancer Conference for the research. The researchers now plan to carry out further studies to confirm their prediction, Fedeles says.","Published: August 10, 2015"

Now, UNC School of Medicine researchers are the first to show how one of these mutations disables a molecular switch in one of these genes and causes autism. The research shows that an enzyme called UBE3A can be switched off when a phosphate molecule is tacked onto UBE3A. In neurons and during normal brain development, this switch can be turned off and on, leading to tight regulation of UBE3A. But a research team led by Mark Zylka, PhD, associate professor of cell biology and physiology, found that an autism-linked mutation destroys this regulatory switch. Destruction of the switch creates an enzyme that cannot be turned off. As a result, UBE3A becomes hyperactive and drives abnormal brain development and autism.  Genetic studies are showing that there will be about 1,000 genes linked to autism. This means you could mutate any one of them and get the disorder. We found how one of these mutations works,  said Zylka, senior author of the Cell paper and member of the UNC Neuroscience Center. The work was done in human cell lines, as well as mouse models. Because this one autism-linked UBE3A mutation was part of the Simons Simplex Collection   and Zylka previously had been funded through a Simons Foundation grant   he had access to the cells that were used to find this one mutation. When Jason Yi, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Zylka s lab, sequenced the genes from the cell samples   including cells from the child s parents   he found that the parents had no hyperactive UBE3A but the child did. The child s regulatory switch was broken, causing UBE3A to be perpetually switched on.  When this child s mutation was introduced into an animal model, we saw all these dendritic spines form on the neurons,  said, Zylka, who is also a member of the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities.  We thought this was a big deal because too many dendritic spines have been linked to autism.  Their findings thus pointed to hyperactivation of UBE3A as the likely cause of this child s autism.  It was previously thought that too much UBE3A might cause autism because duplication of the 15q chromosome region   which encompasses UBE3A and several other genes   is one of the most commonly seen genetic alterations in people with autism. This is called Dup15q Syndrome. As part of their study, Zylka and Yi found that protein kinase A (PKA) is the enzyme that tacks the phosphate group onto UBE3A. This finding has therapeutic implications, particularly since drugs exist to control PKA.  We think it may be possible to tamp down UBE3A in Dup15q patients to restore normal levels of enzyme activity in the brain,  Zylka said.  In fact, we tested known compounds and showed that two of them substantially reduced UBE3A activity in neurons.  One of the drugs, rolipram, previously had been tested in clinical trials to treat depression but was discontinued due to side effects. One of the symptoms associated with Dup15q syndrome is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. In light of these life-threatening seizures, Zylka pointed out that it may be worth examining whether lower doses of rolipram, or other drugs that increase PKA activity, provide some symptom relief in Dup15q individuals.  The benefits might outweigh the risks,  he said. Future work with an animal model of Dup15q could be used to test this therapeutic approach. While the bulk of this project was focused on autism, this project began when Zylka and Yi noticed that a large number of Angelman syndrome-linked mutations were clustered in the same chromosome region where the phosphate group was tacked onto UBE3A. Angelman syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by developmental delay, seizures, balance problems, and lack of speech.  Zylka s team found that a number of the Angelman mutations disrupt the function or stability of UBE3A.  These mutations would essentially eliminate the enzyme in people with Angelman syndrome. This discovery could have implications for diagnosing people with this rare and often misdiagnosed disorder.","Published: August 10, 2015"

But because there has been no way to obtain live human serotonin neurons to study these diseases, most serotonin research has been done on lab animals. Now, University at Buffalo researchers have generated human serotonin neurons from human fibroblasts, the cells that give rise to connective tissue in the body.The researchers say that their findings are applicable to generating many other previously inaccessible human cell types, providing a boon to medical research and drug discovery.  Our work demonstrates that the precious serotonin neurons hidden deep inside the human brain can now be created in a petri dish,  said lead author Jian Feng, PhD, professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics in the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Feng also has an appointment at the Veterans Affairs Western New York Healthcare System in Buffalo. The work builds on previous studies showing that human fibroblasts can be converted to neurons, using specialized transcription factors that bind to genes, turning them on or off. Generating serotonin neurons The UB research demonstrates the first direct conversion of human fibroblasts into serotonergic neurons, Feng said. These  induced serotonergic neurons  behave like serotonin neurons in the human brain.  We know the cells were converted to serotonergic neurons because they express proteins that are only found in neurons that produce serotonin,  Feng explained.  They are electrophysiologically active and demonstrate both the controlled release and the selective uptake of serotonin.  The researchers found that they could produce induced serotonergic neurons from fibroblasts by introducing four genes that control the development of serotonin neurons.  These genes change how the human genome, which is like a computer hard drive, is read, so that the cell switches from a lung cell to a serotonin neuron,  said Feng.  With this new technology, scientists can generate serotonin neurons from patients who suffer from serotonin-related mental illnesses,  said Feng. While the paper focuses on converting lung fibroblasts to serotonin neurons, Feng s group at UB also has been working on generating serotonin neurons from human skin cells, which would be an even easier and less invasive process. A versatile technology Such induced serotonin neurons would be extremely beneficial since they can be generated from individual patients suffering from illnesses involving the neurotransmitter.  These patient-specific serotonin neurons will be very useful to the discovery of new drugs for diseases ranging from depression and anxiety to obsessive-compulsive disorder and many others,  said Feng.  They will not only allow researchers to study why certain individuals develop a disease but also to find out what can be done to treat it.  Feng is optimistic that the same technology is versatile enough that it can be used to generate other new cells and tissues:  This research shows that it is possible to convert one type of cell into other types that have been difficult to access, such as neurons or heart cells,  he said.  All we need to do is find out the combination of transcription factors that is necessary. Sooner or later, we will find out what those combinations are so that we can regenerate cells and eventually tissues that will mimic the real cells and tissues in the body.

The thymus begins to atrophy rapidly in very early adulthood, simultaneously losing its function,  said TSRI Professor Howard Petrie.  This new study shows for the first time a mechanism for the long-suspected connection between normal immune function and antioxidants.  Scientists have been hampered in their efforts to develop specific immune therapies for the elderly by a lack of knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of this process.To explore these mechanisms, Dr. Petrie and his team developed a computational approach for analyzing the activity of genes in two major thymic cell types stromal cells and lymphoid cells in mouse tissues, which are similar to human tissues in terms of function and age-related atrophy. The team found that stromal cells were specifically deficient in an antioxidant enzyme called catalase, which resulted in elevated levels of the reactive oxygen by-products of metabolism and, subsequently, accelerated metabolic damage. To confirm the central role of catalase, the scientists increased levels of this enzyme in genetically altered animal models, resulting in preservation of thymus size for a much longer period. In addition, animals that were given two common dietary antioxidants, including vitamin C, were also protected from the effects of aging on the thymus. Taken together, the findings provide support for the  free-radical theory  of aging, which proposes that reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide, produced during normal metabolism, cause cellular damage that contributes to aging and age-related diseases. While other studies have suggested that sex hormones, particularly androgens such as testosterone, play a major role in the aging process, they've failed to answer the key question why does the thymus atrophy so much more rapidly than other body tissues?  There s no question that the thymus is remarkably responsive to androgens,  Dr. Petrie noted,  but our study shows that the fundamental mechanism of aging in the thymus, namely accumulated metabolic damage, is the same as in other body tissues. However, the process is accelerated in the thymus by a deficiency in the essential protective effects of catalase, which is found at higher levels in almost all other body tissues.

In a specific regenerative process these injured cells must be replaced as soon as possible. In collaboration with colleagues from the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen, scientists at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) of Biochemistry have now, for the first time, gained detailed insights into the dynamic remodeling of the tissue during lung repair.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lung diseases are the third most common cause of death worldwide: toxic particles, infections, and chronic inflammatory responses pose a permanent threat to our lungs. To date, the regenerative mechanisms leading to healing of lung injury remain incompletely understood. Since few to no causal therapies are in place for most lung diseases, it is important to understand how these healing processes, which involve initial inflammation, fibrosis, and then resolution thereof, occur in the lung. Using novel mass spectrometry techniques, an interdisciplinary team of scientists led by Matthias Mann, Director at the MPI of Biochemistry, and Oliver Eickelberg, Chairman of the Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) at the Helmholtz Zentrum M nchen and University Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit t, has now succeeded, for the first time, to quantify and profile dynamic changes in the composition of the lung tissue throughout the different phases of lung regeneration. More than 8,000 proteins examined When the pulmonary alveoli are damaged, various proteins are secreted into the extracellular space, where they form the so-called extracellular matrix (ECM). These proteins are crucial for tissue healing by instructing various processes, including the activation of specific stem cell populations, ensuring that lung tissue can be restored to its original condition. Now, the scientists succeeded for the first time in identifying and quantifying the abundance and solubility of more than 8,000 proteins in the lung proteome throughout the multistage tissue repair processes.  The information we have gained about the dynamic changes in ECM composition and its interactions with various secreted growth factor proteins enables us to develop new hypotheses for the activation of stem cells in the lung,  explains Herbert Schiller, first author of the study. The findings of the research team will provide an important basis for further translational research on the development of pulmonary fibrosis* and chronic lung diseases in general, the scientists say.  These novel mass spectrometry techniques enable us to analyze variations in the type and abundance of proteins in patients with lung fibrosis and healthy individuals and will therefore likely lead to new approaches for the treatment of chronic lung diseases in general and lung fibrosis in particular,  Eickelberg predicts.","Published: August 10, 2015"

Now, working with mouse and human cells, Johns Hopkins researchers report they have discovered the normal role of TDP-43 in cells and why its abnormal accumulation may cause disease. In an article published in Science, the researchers say TDP-43 is normally responsible for keeping unwanted stretches of the genetic material RNA, called cryptic exons, from being used by nerve cells to make proteins. When TDP-43 bunches up inside those cells, it malfunctions, lifting the brakes on cryptic exons and causing a cascade of events that kills brain or spinal cord cells. ""TDP-43's role in both healthy and diseased cells has long been a mystery, and we hope that solving it will open new pathways toward preventing and treating ALS and FTD,"" says Philip Wong, Ph.D., a professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and senior author of the study. Almost a decade ago, Wong says, scientists first described the clumps of TDP-43 that commonly appear in the degenerated brain or nerve cells of those with FTD or ALS. But whether the clumps were a cause or an effect of the diseases, and exactly what they did, was unknown. ""Some people thought that the aggregates themselves were toxic,"" says Jonathan Ling, a graduate student in Wong's lab and first author of the new paper. ""Another theory is that the aggregates were just preventing TDP-43 from doing what it should be doing, and that was the problem."" To figure out which theory might be right, Ling deleted the gene for TDP-43 from both lab-grown mouse and human cells and detected abnormal processing of strands of RNA, genetic material responsible for coding and decoding DNA blueprint instructions for making proteins. Specifically, they found that cryptic exons -- segments of RNA usually blocked by cells from becoming part of the final RNA used to make a protein -- were in fact working as blueprints. With the cryptic exons included rather than blocked, proteins involved in key processes in the studied cells were abnormal. When the researchers studied brain autopsies from patients with ALS and FTD, they confirmed that not only were there buildups of TDP-43, but also cryptic exons in the degenerated brain cells. In the brains of healthy people, however, they saw no cryptic exons. This finding, the investigators say, suggests that when TDP-43 is clumped together, it no longer works, causing cells to function abnormally as though there's no TDP-43 at all. TDP-43 only recognizes one particular class of cryptic exon, but other proteins can block many types of exons, so Ling and Wong next tested what would happen when they added one of these blocking proteins to directly target cryptic exons in cells missing TDP-43. Indeed, adding this protein allowed cells to block cryptic exons and remain disease-free. ""What's thought provoking is that we may soon be able to fix this in patients who have lots of accumulated TDP-43,"" says Ling. Ling cautions that questions remain about the role of TDP-43 in ALS and FTD. ""We've explained what happens after TDP-43 is lost, but we still don't know why it aggregates in the first place,"" he says. Wong's group is planning studies that may answer these questions, as well as additional tests on how to treat TDP-43 pathology in humans. The ALS Association estimates that as many as 30,000 Americans are living with ALS at any given time, and more than 5,000 people are newly diagnosed each year. There is no cure for the disease, and most people live two to five years after diagnosis. Similarly, FTD -- thought to affect around 50,000 people in the U.S. -- has no treatment and shortens life span. Johns Hopkins Medicine   press release Wong PC et al.

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health, the results may provide a guide for discovering new treatments for Huntington's disease and a roadmap for studying other neurological disorders. ""Our hope is to find ways that we can slow or delay the onset of Huntington's devastating symptoms,"" said James Gusella, Ph.D., director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston, and the corresponding author of the study published online in Cell. ""This could be possible because we now have a list of clinically proven genetic factors that influence the disease."" Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in a gene that encodes the Huntingtin protein. Symptoms usually begin in midlife and include uncontrolled movements, emotional disturbances and, eventually, dementia. Although studies in humans and animals have discovered clues as to how the disorder works, there are no effective treatments. For this study, the scientists tried a slightly different approach. They employed a novel application of Genome Wide Association Study analysis, a technique that scientists typically use to search for single letter changes to the DNA code on patients' chromosomes, which may increase or decrease their chances of having the disease. Here, the scientists already knew the disease-causing gene and so they used the technique to search for other changes that determine when the disease starts. They found that at least three sites were associated with symptoms appearing earlier or later than expected, two on chromosome 15 and one on chromosome eight. ""This approach could have a significant impact on Huntington's disease patients and researchers,"" said Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D., program director, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of NIH. ""It's an example of how precision medicine may be applied to neurological disorders."" The study was conducted by the Genetic Modifiers of Huntington's Disease Consortium, an international team of scientists devoted to finding treatments for the disorder. Starting more than three decades ago they collected DNA samples and clinical information from patients, mainly in the United States, Canada and Europe. ""We thank the patients and their families for their commitment to research,"" said Dr. Gusella. ""It takes a dedicated global effort to meet the complex challenges presented by neurological disorders like Huntington's disease."" The scientists used the patients' DNA and clinical information to study the age when movement problems began. Located on chromosome four, the Huntingtin gene is characterized by three letter repeats in the DNA code, called CAG-repeats. Disease-causing versions of the Huntingtin gene contain more than 35 CAG-repeats, which is higher than the six to 34 repeats found in normal versions. The greater number of CAGs a patient has, the greater the chances that symptoms will appear earlier in life. Focusing on patients who had 40 to 55 CAGs, the scientists found that some developed the disease earlier than expected while others developed it later. The scientists then analyzed the patients' chromosomes using gene chips that contain sites known for having single letter changes to the DNA code in normal human populations. After multiple rounds of searching they found that two sites on chromosome 15 were strongly associated with disease onset. One site was associated with hastening the disease by, on average, just over six years; another site was associated with slowing the disease by about a year and a half. They also found that a site on chromosome eight was associated with earlier disease onset by nearly one and a half years. Although the scientists did not identify specific genes, they used several types of genome network analyses to show that disease onset may be controlled by genes that repair DNA, catalyze essential chemical reactions in cells, and assist with the division of mitochondria. In addition, they noted that a site within the code for MLH1, a DNA repair gene located on chromosome three, may be involved. Finally, the scientists showed that the sites on chromosomes 15 and eight may be associated with the beginning of psychiatric and cognitive problems caused by the disease. ""These results are an important step toward developing new treatments for Huntington's disease. They help us understand how, through evolution, nature has learned to modify the disease-causing effects of Huntington's disease mutations,"" said Dr. Gusella.

After 65, the risk doubles every five years, and 40 percent or more of people 85 and older are estimated to be living with the devastating condition. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified some of the key changes in the aging brain that lead to the increased risk. The changes center on amyloid beta 42, a main ingredient of Alzheimer s brain plaques. The protein, a natural byproduct of brain activity, normally is cleared from the brain before it can clump together into plaques. Scientists long have suspected it is a primary driver of the disease.  We found that people in their 30s typically take about four hours to clear half the amyloid beta 42 from the brain,  said senior author Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology.  In this new study, we show that at over 80 years old, it takes more than 10 hours.  The slowdown in clearance results in rising levels of amyloid beta 42 in the brain. Higher levels of the protein increase the chances that it will clump together to form Alzheimer s plaques. The results appear online in the Annals of Neurology. For the study, the researchers tested 100 volunteers ages 60 to 87. Half had clinical signs of Alzheimer s disease, such as memory problems. Plaques had begun to form in the brains of 62 participants. The subjects were given detailed mental and physical evaluations, including brain scans to check for the presence of plaques. The researchers also studied participants  cerebrospinal fluids using a technology developed by Bateman and co-author David Holtzman?, MD, the Andrew B. and Gretchen P. Jones Professor and head of the Department of Neurology at Washington University. The technology   known as stable isotope-linked kinetics (SILK)   allowed the researchers to monitor the body s production and clearance of amyloid beta 42 and other proteins. In patients with evidence of plaques, the researchers observed that amyloid beta 42 appears to be more likely to drop out of the fluid that bathes the brain and clump together into plaques. Reduced clearance rates of amyloid beta 42, such as those seen in older participants, were associated with clinical symptoms of Alzheimer s disease, such as memory loss, dementia and personality changes. Scientists believe the brain disposes of amyloid beta in four ways: by moving it into the spine, pushing it across the blood-brain barrier, breaking it down or absorbing it with other proteins, or depositing it into plaques.  Through additional studies like this, we re hoping to identify which of the first three channels for amyloid beta disposal are slowing down as the brain ages,  Bateman said.  That may help us in our efforts to develop new treatments.  Washington University in St. Louis   Original reporting by: Michael C Purdy Bateman RJ et al.

Now, University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine researchers are the first to show how one of these mutations disables a molecular switch in one of these genes and causes autism. Published in the journal Cell, the research shows that an enzyme called UBE3A can be switched off when a phosphate molecule is tacked onto UBE3A. In neurons and during normal brain development, this switch can be turned off and on, leading to tight regulation of UBE3A. But a research team led by Mark Zylka, PhD, associate professor of cell biology and physiology, found that an autism-linked mutation destroys this regulatory switch. Destruction of the switch creates an enzyme that cannot be turned off. As a result, UBE3A becomes hyperactive and drives abnormal brain development and autism. ""Genetic studies are showing that there will be about 1,000 genes linked to autism. This means you could mutate any one of them and get the disorder. We found how one of these mutations works,"" said Zylka, senior author of the Cell paper and member of the UNC Neuroscience Center. The work was done in human cell lines, as well as mouse models. Because this one autism-linked UBE3A mutation was part of the Simons Simplex Collection -- and Zylka previously had been funded through a Simons Foundation grant -- he had access to the cells that were used to find this one mutation. When Jason Yi, PhD, a UNC postdoctoral fellow and Cell paper first author, sequenced the genes from the cell samples -- including cells from the child's parents -- he found that the parents had no hyperactive UBE3A but the child did. The child's regulatory switch was broken, causing UBE3A to be perpetually switched on. ""When this child's mutation was introduced into an animal model, we saw all these dendritic spines form on the neurons,"" said, Zylka, who is also a member of the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. ""We thought this was a big deal because too many dendritic spines have been linked to autism."" Their findings thus pointed to hyperactivation of UBE3A as the likely cause of this child's autism. It was previously thought that too much UBE3A might cause autism because duplication of the 15q chromosome region -- which encompasses UBE3A and several other genes -- is one of the most commonly seen genetic alterations in people with autism. This is called Dup15q Syndrome. As part of their study, Zylka and Yi found that protein kinase A (PKA) is the enzyme that tacks the phosphate group onto UBE3A. This finding has therapeutic implications, particularly since drugs exist to control PKA. ""We think it may be possible to tamp down UBE3A in Dup15q patients to restore normal levels of enzyme activity in the brain,"" Zylka said. ""In fact, we tested known compounds and showed that two of them substantially reduced UBE3A activity in neurons."" One of the drugs, rolipram, previously had been tested in clinical trials to treat depression but was discontinued due to side effects. One of the symptoms associated with Dup15q syndrome is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. In light of these life-threatening seizures, Zylka pointed out that it may be worth examining whether lower doses of rolipram, or other drugs that increase PKA activity, provide some symptom relief in Dup15q individuals. ""The benefits might outweigh the risks,"" he said. Future work with an animal model of Dup15q could be used to test this therapeutic approach. While the bulk of this project was focused on autism, this project began when Zylka and Yi noticed that a large number of Angelman syndrome-linked mutations were clustered in the same chromosome region where the phosphate group was tacked onto UBE3A. Angelman syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by developmental delay, seizures, balance problems, and lack of speech. Zylka's team found that a number of the Angelman mutations disrupt the function or stability of UBE3A. These mutations would essentially eliminate the enzyme in people with Angelman syndrome. This discovery could have implications for diagnosing people with this rare and often misdiagnosed disorder. University of North Carolina School of Medicine   press release Zylka MJ et al.

In 1965, the first commercial SEM called Stereoscan was built by Cambridge Instrument Company, a UK based predecessor company of Carl Zeiss Microscopy Ltd. To mark the anniversary of this very first SEM sale 50 years ago, and celebrate the contributions to scientific research across so many fields and industries made possible through scanning electron microscopy, ZEISS hosted a celebratory event in Cambridge. During a morning of talks, lunch, and a museum tour, customers and specialists from many disciplines had the chance to meet scientists who worked on the development of the first commercial SEMs. With 50 years of continuous growth and development, the SEM has become ever more versatile, and is now firmly established as an indispensable tool for advanced research across many scientific disciplines. With new industrial applications emerging every year, the SEM is also a vital part of research & development, and quality control & analysis across an extensive range of industries around the globe. From its early home in materials science, the SEM established itself in the disciplines of electronics, forensics and archaeology. Over the years it has evolved into a key tool for food technologists, biologists, geologists and petrologists in the natural resources industries, adapting subtly to fulfill the discrete requirements of these individual applications. Use of SEMs for process control and failure analysis is now widespread, with routine analysis on SEMs an integral part of the semiconductor and automotive industries, and manufacture more broadly. Development still goes on: A direct descendant of the first microscopes produced in Cambridge in 1965 is the ZEISS EVO family. First launched in 2004, and widely accepted as the industry leading analytical platform, there are some developments soon to be unveiled for EVO offering more flexibility, ease of use, and further development of detectors. The new ZEISS GeminiSEM family comes with a novel optical design. Users achieve better resolution, especially at low voltage. With 20 times greater in-lens detection signal, they always acquire crisp images fast and with minimum sample damage.","Published: August 8, 2015"

The study also produced further evidence of the interrelationship between the microbiota in the human gut, specifically bifidobacteria, and the immune system. B-GOS (Bimuno) is the only prebiotic to have demonstrated an immune modulating effect on the immune system of healthy elderly subjects. The results of the study are published in the British Journal of Nutrition in a paper entitled  Influence of galactooligosaccharide mixture (B-GOS) on gut microbiota, immune parameters and metabonomics in elderly persons . The study confirms the results of a separate study published by Clasado and the University of Reading in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The combined study results showed that the consumption of B-GOS (Bimuno) produced a very positive effect on both gut microbiota and the immune systems of the elderly. In the elderly, both the immune system and the gut microbiota weaken and deteriorate with age. Reversing those changes in gut microbiota can therefore support the immune system and boost gut health. The results are also applicable to other groups that are affected by immune system deterioration, including those that have used antibiotics, or experienced high levels of stress.  Whilst advances in global healthcare have led to increased life expectancy, this in turn has led to an increase in the elderly population, one that is vulnerable to a range of health related disorders. Increasing the effectiveness of the immune system in these individuals is therefore an important aid in counteracting the health concerns they can face,  said Graham Waters, CEO of Clasado.  This trial is part of a wider program of clinical research in which we are currently engaged, investigating the central role of the gut in a range of health concerns. By investigating the axes between the gut, the brain, and the immune system, Clasado hopes to contribute to future options for patients with under-served medical needs.  The randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over study tested the effect of a GOS mixture (Bimuno B-GOS) on gut microbiota, markers of immune function and metabolites in 40 elderly volunteers with an age range of 65 to 80. B-GOS consumption led to a significant increase in bifidobacteria. In addition, higher IL-10 (interleukin-10), IL-8, NK (natural killer) cell activity and lower IL-1 beta levels were also observed. Additional trials are planned by Clasado and the University of Reading studying the effects of B-GOS on the immune system, where further positive outcomes are expected. It is specifically hoped that the second generation prebiotic B-GOS (Bimuno) would be able to act as an adjunct to existing therapies for inflammatory diseases, for example rheumatoid arthritis or Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The human study is the latest in an on-going research programme of randomized controlled intervention trials and clinical trials being undertaken by Clasado in collaboration with Oxford University, the University of Reading and other internationally recognized research institutes. This study followed a recent human trial by Clasado and Oxford University, published in the journal Psychopharmacology, which showed for the first time that the advanced prebiotic (Bimuno) has the potential to reduce anxiety. Additional studies have demonstrated that modulation of the gut microbiota with Bimuno can lead to changes in brain biochemistry as well being able to target conditions such as metabolic syndrome and obesity.  There is a substantial body of evidence linking the brain, the gut microbiota and the immune system. This research provides additional confirmation that the immune system can be modulated through the gut microbiota,  said Dr Jelena Vulevic, Research and Development Manager, Clasado.  Further research is needed to ascertain the potential for gut bacteria modulation to provide additional therapies for conditions that have immune or inflammatory components.   In our research investigating the advanced prebiotic Bimuno, we have demonstrated excellent results with the ability to enhance the immune system through altering the gut microbiota,  said Professor Glenn Gibson, Professor of Food Microbiology, Head of Food Microbial Sciences, University of Reading.","Published: August 8, 2015"

For example, numerous developmental diseases cannot be studied using animal models, nor by isolating cells from patients. Now Yissum has introduced a novel platform technology for screening and evaluating small molecules as potential drugs for various human genetic disorders, which are essentially orphan diseases. The method, developed by Prof. Nissim Benvenisty, Director, The Azrieli Center for Stem Cells and Genetic Research at the Hebrew University, utilizes human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a model system that overcomes several limitations inherent to animal models. As part of the novel approach, Prof. Benvenisty's Center has generated hPSCs representing human genetic disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome or Down syndrome, as well as other genetic conditions such as some types of cancers or hereditary diabetes. Prof. Benvenisty and his group have developed 15 disease cell models for 13 genetic disorders, which can serve not only to understand the molecular basis underlying these diseases, but also as platforms for screening small molecules to treat these disorders. In addition, since the cellular models are derived from human cells, they can also serve to validate potential drugs intended for the treatment of human developmental genetic disorders. Yaccov Michlin, CEO of Yissum, commented,  The new disease model system developed by Prof. Benvenisty offers a complementary approach that can address many of the hurdles inherent to animal models. We are certain that this novel method will have a significant impact on drug screening and development, and Yissum is currently looking for partners in order to further advance this promising approach.  Animal models are an important step in the research and development of many drugs, but often fall short due to various limitations. This cellular system, based on human stem cells, enables, for example, cost-effective high throughput screening of small molecules as potential drugs for a variety of genetic and other conditions, screening which is not possible using many animal models. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate the genome of these cells in order to emulate various genetic diseases offers an extensive potential to study, understand and develop new therapies for many complex diseases with an underlying genetic basis.","Published: August 8, 2015"

Group revenues were EUR 82.6 million (H1 2014: EUR 30.5 million). The increase is attributable to revenue booked in connection with the ending of the collaboration with Celgene on MorphoSys's proprietary drug candidate MOR202. This comprised the full realization of deferred revenues from an up-front payment received from Celgene in 2013 together with a one-time termination payment. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to EUR 46.1 million (H1 2014: EUR 0.4 million). On 30 June 2015, MorphoSys held cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and financial assets classified as loans and receivables of EUR 324.9 million in comparison to EUR 352.8 million on 31 December 2014. Highlights of the Second Quarter 2015  At the end of the second quarter of 2015, MorphoSys's product pipeline comprised a total of 102 therapeutic antibodies, including 24 clinical programs. Three partnered programs are currently in phase 3 trials.  MorphoSys presented its updated phase 2 clinical results for MOR208 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) at the 2015 annual conference of the American Society of Oncology (ASCO). The clinical data showed that MOR208 is well tolerated with a low level of infusion reactions and demonstrated encouraging single-agent activity.  MorphoSys also presented preliminary clinical data on the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of MOR202 in multiple myeloma at the 2015 ASCO conference. MOR202 proved to be safe and well tolerated and showed early signs of clinical activity and cases of long-lasting tumor control.  In May 2015, MorphoSys acquired all outstanding shares in the Dutch biopharmaceutical company Lanthio Pharma. The acquisition added new development candidates to MorphoSys's proprietary portfolio, including a preclinical program for fibrotic diseases (MOR107).  In April 2015, MorphoSys announced that it had reached a clinical milestone with the initiation of a phase 2 study of the antibody guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis by its partner Janssen Biotech. The milestone payment was recognized in the first quarter of 2015.  Shortly after the end of the second quarter, MorphoSys announced that it had reached a clinical milestone associated with the IND filing of an antibody being developed to treat blood disorders by its partner Novartis, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2015.  At the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2015, Ms. Wendy Johnson, Mr. Klaus K hn and Dr. Frank Morich were newly elected to the Supervisory Board. Dr. Gerald M ller, Dr. Marc Cluzel and Ms. Karin Eastham were all re-elected to the Supervisory Board. Additionally, all resolutions proposed by the management were adopted.  MorphoSys repurchased 88,670 of its own shares in the second quarter of 2015. The shares will be used primarily for long-term incentive programs for the Management Board and Senior Management Group. ""The second quarter saw excellent progress with regard to our proprietary pipeline and the further expansion of our drug development capabilities in the biologics arena beyond antibodies. Clearly the highlight of the quarter from a pipeline perspective was the presentation of encouraging clinical data for our most advanced proprietary oncology programs MOR208 and MOR202,"" stated Dr. Simon Moroney, Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys AG. ""We are very pleased with the first half of 2015 and are on track to meet our goals for the full year. The addition of Lanthio's portfolio of therapeutic peptides to our pipeline combined with new therapeutic antibody programs initiated by our partners have increased the number of therapeutic candidates in different stages of development for the first time beyond the 100 program mark,"" commented Jens Holstein, Chief Financial Officer of MorphoSys AG. Financial Review for the First Half of 2015 (IFRS)Group revenues for the first six months of 2015 amounted to EUR 82.6 million (H1 2014: EUR 30.5 million). Reasons for the increase were one-time effects in H1 2015 in connection with the full realization of deferred revenues from an up-front payment received from Celgene in 2013 together with a one-time termination fee. The Proprietary Development segment recorded revenues of EUR 59.6 million (H1 2014: EUR 7.7 million), all of which were recorded in connection with the co-development agreement with Celgene. Revenues in the Partnered Discovery segment comprised EUR 21.0 million in funded research and licensing fees (H1 2014: EUR 21.4 million) and EUR 2.0 million in success-based payments (H1 2014: EUR 1.4 million).

The gene silencing therapy being tested by UBC researchers aims to reduce the levels of a toxic protein in the brain that causes Huntington's disease. The test was developed by Amber Southwell, Michael Hayden, and Blair Leavitt of UBC's Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics and the Centre for Huntington Disease in collaboration with colleagues from Mayo Clinic. It was recently featured in a study published in Scientific Reports. ""This is an important breakthrough for several promising gene silencing therapies in Huntington's disease that are now moving from the bench to the bedside,"" said Leavitt. ""We can move forward with these clinical trials and accurately measure whether our treatments are working."" The genetic mutation responsible for Huntington's produces a toxic form of a protein called huntingtin, which progressively injures brain cells. Reducing brain levels of this toxic protein should prevent or delay the onset of symptoms. Several huntingtin-lowering therapies have already shown great promise in animal models of Huntington's disease and are rapidly approaching trials in humans. The UBC research team found that they could accurately measure the levels of mutant huntingtin protein in the brain by collecting cerebrospinal fluid from a spinal tap. The ultrasensitive test detects small amounts of the toxic protein and can be used to follow changes in brain levels of the protein over time in response to new therapies. This study enables Leavitt to initiate a new clinical trial of a huntingtin gene-silencing therapy for patients at the Centre for Huntington Disease at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, a partnership between UBC and Vancouver Coastal Health. This trial will test the safety of a novel gene-silencing treatment in patients and is already in the process of screening patient candidates. The trial will be the first human study of a drug targeting mutant huntingtin. Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder but symptoms generally don't appear until later in life. It affects the brain and gradually worsens, causing problems with coordination and movement, mental decline and psychiatric issues. University of British Columbia   press release Hayden MR et al.

These findings could have relevance for understanding the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other forms of motor neuron disease (MND). ALS is the most common form of adult-onset motor neuron disease and kills over 1,200 people a year in the UK. The researchers developed a new model to study neurodegeneration in the common fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). In contrast to other methods used to study neurodegeneration such as looking at changes in eye morphology or studying larval stages, the researchers focused their attention on studying the neurons in a fruit fly's leg. Using the leg allows the detailed study of a single motor neuron. Compared to studying larval stages, the model also permits genuine aging studies as changes in neurons can be observed in flies of different ages. The adult fruit fly can live for over two months in the lab. Furthermore, the fruit fly also provides the benefits of rapid development (ten days from egg to adult), allowing high-throughput genetic screens. As described online in Current Biology, the researchers used the new model to study the role of a protein central to the development of ALS called TDP-43. Specifically overexpressing TDP-43 in fly legs caused neurodegeneration. Exposing these flies to a mutagen and looking for offspring showing reduced neurodegeneration allowed the researchers to identify three genes implicated in mediating the effects of TDP-43. One, shaggy/GSK3, was already know to be associated with the neurodegeneration process but two of them, hat-trick and xmas-2, were new discoveries. Dr. Jemeen Sreedharan, Senior Research Fellow in the signaling research program at the Babraham Institute and lead author on the paper said: ""We're extremely excited about our new approach to using the power of Drosophila genetics. Never before has anyone been able to study adult neurodegeneration in an invertebrate system with such ease. By modeling the earliest stages of ALS (synaptic and axon degeneration) we have identified three intriguing genetic suppressors of degeneration in the fly and are now validating these results in mammalian neuronal cultures. We hope that by using the fly we can accelerate progress towards eventually developing therapies for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases."" Babraham Institute   press release Freeman MR et al.

The research shows that this enzyme can be recreated in lab settings and possesses a number of promising characteristics for drug development.  Our research is in the early phase of drug development process, but the study tells us the enzyme has the right properties to eventually become a successful therapeutic,  said Kim Janda, the Ely R. Callaway Jr. Professor of Chemistry and member of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at TSRI. The new research, published online ahead of print  in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, offers a possible alternative to current smoking cessation aids, which are shown to fail in at least 80 to 90 percent of smokers. The idea behind an enzyme therapy would be to seek out and destroy nicotine before it reaches the brain depriving a person of the  reward  of nicotine that can trigger relapse into smoking. For more than 30 years, Janda and his colleagues have struggled to create such an enzyme in the lab, but they recently ran across a potential enzyme found in nature NicA2 from the bacteria known as Pseudomonas putida. It turns out this bacterium originally isolated from soil in a tobacco field consumes nicotine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen.  The bacterium is like a little Pac-Man,  said Janda.  It goes along and eats nicotine.  In the new study, the TSRI researchers characterized the bacterial enzyme responsible for nicotine degradation and tested its potential usefulness as a therapeutic. The researchers first combined serum (a component of blood) from mice with a dose of nicotine equivalent to one cigarette. When they added the enzyme, the nicotine s half-life dropped from two to three hours to just 9 to 15 minutes. Janda said a higher dose of the enzyme with a few chemical modifications could reduce the half-life of nicotine even further and keep it from ever reaching the brain. Next, the researchers subjected the enzyme to a barrage of tests to determine its practicality as a drug candidate.  It was a long shot,  said Janda.  If it didn t have the right metrics, it would be a bust.  The results were encouraging. The enzyme stayed stable in the lab for more than three weeks at 98 degrees Fahrenheit which Janda said was  pretty remarkable.  Importantly, the researchers detected no toxic metabolites produced when the enzyme degraded nicotine.  The enzyme is also relatively stable in serum, which is important for a therapeutic candidate,  said Song Xue, a TSRI graduate student and first author of the new study. Janda said the next step is to alter the enzyme s bacterial makeup, which will help mitigate potential immune liabilities and maximize its therapeutic potential.  Hopefully we can improve its serum stability with our future studies so that a single injection may last up to a month,  added Xue.

But now as an alternative to reliance on patient interviews, scientists are closing in on an objective test that could help clinicians distinguish between the two   and provide better treatment. Their method appears in the American Chemical Society s Journal of Proteome Research. For many reasons, bipolar disorder is commonly mistaken for MDD. One reason is that the condition often first becomes noticeable when the patient has a bout of depression. And, as bipolar disorder only affects about 1 percent of the population worldwide, clinicians sometimes forget to ask about hypomania, a euphoric, hyperactive state that also characterizes the condition. Current diagnostic techniques involve structured interviews with patients, but these can be subjective and misleading. An accurate diagnosis, however, is crucial to quickly getting patients the treatment they need. So Peng Xie and colleagues set out to develop an objective way to tell the difference between MDD and bipolar disorder. The researchers combined a couple of techniques   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance   to analyze urine metabolites in samples from patients who either had MDD or bipolar disorder. From these results, they identified a panel of six biomarkers with an 89 to 91 percent chance of predicting each disorder. American Chemical Society   press release Xie P et al.

Two studies published in PLOS Pathogens address what makes rabbits hard to infect with prions and how their resistance can be overcome. Prions are misfolded versions of a protein that, in its normal form (called PrPC, encoded by the PRNP gene), is found mainly in nerve cells of all mammals. The misfolded prions can trigger a domino effect by causing folding changes in their normal cellular counterparts, which turns them into toxic prions as well. Accumulation of toxic prions triggers the death of nerve cells and literally leaves holes in the brain, causing a spongiform (or sponge-like) appearance. In one study, Joaqu n Castilla, from CIC bioGUNE in Derio, Spain, and colleagues tested prion preparations from different species to see which ones could cause TSE in rabbits. To model the transmission barrier between rabbits and other species, they generated a transgenic mouse model that expressed the rabbit PRNP gene instead of the corresponding mouse gene. The researchers then exposed these transgenic mice to prion isolates collected from sick animals, including classical and atypical strains of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (i.e., mad cow disease), sheep Scrapie, and deer Chronic Wasting Disease. They found that the transgenic mice were susceptible to classical and atypical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy prions, and also to mouse-derived Scrapie prions. These results provide further evidence that rabbits are susceptible to TSE following exposure to prions from several other species, and the researchers urge that ""this information must be taken into account when assessing the risk of using ruminant derived protein as a protein source to feed rabbits."" Vincent Beringue, from INRA Virologie Immunologie Mol culaires in Jouy-en-Josas, France, and colleagues designed the second study to address what makes rabbits relatively resistant to prions. To clarify the respective roles of rabbit PrPC and non-PrP host factors in the rabbits' pronounced but not absolute resistance to TSE, they created transgenic rabbits that have both sheep and rabbit PRNP genes and tested their susceptibility to TSE. The sheep transgene they introduced into the rabbits coded for a version of sheep PrPC that is thought to be easily convertible to its toxic prion form. Following exposure to sheep prions, all rabbits with the sheep PRNP transgene in addition to the full complement of rabbit genes (including rabbit PRNP) developed typical TSE after 6-8 months, whereas rabbits without the sheep PRNP transgene remained healthy more than 700 days after inoculation. Despite the presence of normal rabbit PrPC in the nerve cells, only sheep prions (i.e. the toxic misfolded form) were detectable in the brains of the diseased rabbits. Beringue and colleagues conclude that their collective data demonstrate ""that rabbits do not bear non-PrP factors that make them intrinsically resistant to prions."" However, as the study by Castilla and colleagues suggests that the rabbit PRNP gene and its normal PrPC protein product do not act as absolute barriers to TSE development after exposure to prions from other species, they also acknowledge that ""what exactly makes the rabbit species comparatively resistant to prion disease remains to be clarified.""

IBM plans to acquire Merge, a leading provider of medical image handling and processing, interoperability and clinical systems designed to advance healthcare quality and efficiency, in an effort to unlock the value of medical images to help physicians make better patient care decisions. Merge s technology platforms are used at more than 7,500 U.S. healthcare sites, as well as most of the world s leading clinical research institutes and pharmaceutical firms to manage a growing body of medical images. The vision is that these organizations could use the Watson Health Cloud to surface new insights from a consolidated, patient-centric view of current and historical images, electronic health records, data from wearable devices and other related medical data, in a HIPAA-enabled environment. Under terms of the transaction, Merge shareholders would receive $7.13 per share in cash, for a total transaction value of $1 billion. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory review, Merge shareholder approval, and other customary closing conditions, and is anticipated to occur later this year. It is IBM s third major health-related acquisition - and the largest - since launching its Watson Health unit in April, following Phytel (population health) and Explorys (cloud based healthcare intelligence).  As a proven leader in delivering healthcare solutions for over 20 years, Merge is a tremendous addition to the Watson Health platform. Healthcare will be one of IBM s biggest growth areas over the next 10 years, which is why we are making a major investment to drive industry transformation and to facilitate a higher quality of care,  said John Kelly, senior vice president, IBM Research and Solutions Portfolio.  Watson s powerful cognitive and analytic capabilities, coupled with those from Merge and our other major strategic acquisitions, position IBM to partner with healthcare providers, research institutions, biomedical companies, insurers and other organizations committed to changing the very nature of health and healthcare in the 21st century. Giving Watson  eyes  on medical images unlocks entirely new possibilities for the industry.  Teaching Watson to  See  Medical ImagesThe planned acquisition bolsters IBM s strategy to add rich image analytics with deep learning to the Watson Health platform - in effect, advancing Watson beyond natural language and giving it the ability to  see.  Medical images are by far the largest and fastest-growing data source in the healthcare industry and perhaps the world - IBM researchers estimate that they account for at least 90% of all medical data today - but they also present challenges that need to be addressed:  The volume of medical images can be overwhelming to even the most sophisticated specialists   radiologists in some hospital emergency rooms are presented with as many as 100,000 images a day.  Tools to help clinicians extract insights from medical images remain very limited, requiring most analysis to be done manually.  At a time when the most powerful insights come at the intersection of diverse data sets (medical records, lab tests, genomics, etc.), medical images remain largely disconnected from mainstream health information. IBM plans to leverage the Watson Health Cloud to analyze and cross-reference medical images against a deep trove of lab results, electronic health records, genomic tests, clinical studies and other health-related data sources, already representing 315 billion data points and 90 million unique records. Merge s clients could compare new medical images with a patient s image history as well as populations of similar patients to detect changes and anomalies. Insights generated by Watson could then help healthcare providers in fields including radiology, cardiology, orthopedics and ophthalmology to pursue more personalized approaches to diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients. Cutting-edge image analytics projects underway in IBM Research s global labs suggest additional areas where progress can be made. They include teaching Watson to filter clinical and diagnostic imaging information to help clinicians identify anomalies and form recommendations, which could help reduce physician viewing loads and increase physician effectiveness.  As Watson evolves, we are tackling more complex and meaningful problems by constantly evaluating bigger and more challenging data sets,  Kelly said.  Medical images are some of the most complicated data sets imaginable, and there is perhaps no more important area in which researchers can apply machine learning and cognitive computing. That s the real promise of cognitive computing and its artificial intelligence components   helping to make us healthier and to improve the quality of our lives.  Watson Health and Merge Capabilities Will Benefit Researchers, Clinicians and IndividualsIBM s Watson Health unit plans to bring together Merge s product and solution offerings with existing expertise in cognitive computing, population health, and cloud-based healthcare intelligence offerings to:  Offer researchers insights to aid clinical trial design, monitoring and evaluation;  Help clinicians to efficiently identify options for the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring a broad array of health conditions such as cancer, stroke and heart disease;  Enable providers and payers to integrate and optimize patient engagement in alignment with meaningful use and value-based care guidelines; and  Support researchers and healthcare professionals as they advance the emerging discipline of population health, which aims to optimize an individual s care by identifying trends in large numbers of people with similar health status.  Merge is widely recognized for delivering market leading imaging workflow and electronic data capture solutions,  said Justin Dearborn, chief executive officer, Merge.  Today s announcement is an exciting step forward for our employees and clients. Becoming a part of IBM will allow us to expand our global scale and deliver added value and insight to our clients through Watson s advanced analytic and cognitive computing capabilities.   Combining Merge s leading medical imaging solutions with the world-class machine learning and analytics capabilities of IBM s Watson Health is the future of healthcare technology,  said Michael W. Ferro, Jr., Merge s chairman.  Merge s leading technology and proven expertise represent a unique combination of assets that will deliver unparalleled value to Watson Health clients.

7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/stricter-reporting-more-null-trials-210439,Stricter Reporting  More Null Trials A study has found that the adoption of new transparent reporting standards may have contributed to a significant reduction in the percentage of studies reporting positive research findings among large budget clinical trials funded by the National Heart  Lung and Blood Institute   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. In all, 57 percent of large-budget clinical trials evaluating drugs or dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease published from 1970 to 1999 reported positive outcomes, while only 8 percent of clinical trials published between 2000 and 2012 reported positive outcomes, researchers from Oregon State University and the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found. The new reporting standards were phased in around 2000.   Under the new regulations, researchers conducting drug or dietary supplement trials using human subjects are required to identify projected outcomes and register their trials on the website,ClinicalTrials.gov, before they begin to collect data, said the study s co-author, Veronica Irvin, an assistant professor in Oregon State University s College of Public Health and Human Sciences. ClinicalTrials.gov is a database of clinical trials using human subjects from studies around the world. When entering their trial into the database, researchers are required to state specifically the outcome they will focus on. In the past, a researcher might have published an aspect of a study that was successful, even if the study overall did not produce the expected results. But the new requirements mean investigators are less likely to change their analysis plan to consider another outcome that, by chance, may have shown a positive result following drug treatment, she said.  Some people focus only on positive results,  said Irvin, whose research interests include publication bias and transparency in reporting research outcomes.  Null outcomes, or results other than what was expected, might be disappointing, but they may inform doctors and patients about which treatments are not likely to be helpful. Publication of null results also prevents the unnecessary replication of the study by other investigators.  In many cases, trials that do not show a significant benefit of the drug lead to less patient use of ineffective or even harmful treatments, Irvin said. One of the trials included in the analysis was the Women s Health Initiative, which demonstrated that postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy was not helpful for most women, for example. ClinicalTrials.gov is accessible to the public, which improves transparency for clinicians, patients and others interested in learning more about a drug s development or efficacy, she said. Irvin began working on the project with the study s lead author, Robert M. Kaplan of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, while the two worked together in the National Institutes of Health s Office of Behavior and Social Science Research. They reviewed all large-budget clinical trials evaluating drugs or dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease that had received funding from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute between 1970 and 2012. They chose the large-budget, NHLBI-funded trials in part because outcomes from the trials were more likely to be published, even if they did not produce the expected result. In all, 55 studies were included in the research, including 30 published prior to the reporting changes in 2000 and 25 published after the changes. Of the 25 studies published after 2000, only two showed positive outcomes, while 17 of the 30 studies published from 1970 to 2000 showed positive results.  There may be other factors contributing to the decline in positive outcomes, but Kaplan and Irvin were unable to identify other compelling alternative explanations. One suggestion, for example, was that older trials were more likely to compare new treatments to placebos, while newer treatments were more likely to compare new treatments to established treatments. But when Kaplan and Irvin examined the data, they found that 60 percent of trials published before 2000 used placebo comparators and nearly the same amount, 64 percent, of trials after 2000 used placebos, making that an unlikely explanation. Although many of the studies found that treatments were not effective, the authors praised the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute for its leadership in enforcing transparent reporting requirements. Irvin said that the institute was an important leader in requiring higher standards for their clinical trials. While the researchers focused on clinical trials related to cardiovascular health, the new reporting requirements affect all drug trials using human subjects. It would be reasonable to see similar changes in results across other disease types, she said.  We don t know if this decrease in positive outcomes also affects drug trials for prevention and treatment of cancer, diabetes or other diseases, but it would not be surprising because they have the same reporting requirements,  she said. Irvin and Kaplan also are examining how results of clinical trials involving behavioral interventions may have changed under the new reporting requirements. At this time, researchers conducting studies involving behavioral changes are encouraged to register their trials but the National Institutes of Health is moving toward requiring the registration, Irvin said.","Published: August 7, 2015"

Now researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have illuminated another powerful factor in this process.  This work reveals and unravels an additional pathway for the origin of colon cancer,  said senior author Anil K. Rustgi, MD, the T. Grier Miller Professor of Medicine and chief of the Gastroenterology division. Explorations of this pathway could lead to new ways of categorizing and treating colon cancers, which, together with less common rectal cancers, kill about 50,000 Americans every year.The research follows a 2013 study in Genes and Development from Rustgi s group, which found that a protein called LIN28B promotes cancerous growth in intestinal cells by suppressing the Let-7 family of molecules. LIN28B has attracted keen interest among biologists in recent years. The protein s suppression of Let-7 molecules normally helps keep embryonic stem cells in their stem-like state, not only in humans and other mammals but in evolutionarily distant species too. When Let-7 molecules are allowed to work, cells tend to move out of the stem-like state and mature into specific cell types, with much less capacity for uninhibited growth. This ancient interaction between LIN28B and Let-7 is clearly important for the normal development of animals to maturity and for other growth-related processes such as tissue regeneration after injury.  But as Rustgi and other scientists have been finding, LIN28B s suppression of Let-7 is also abnormally switched on in many cancers. In the new study, Rustgi s team, including first author Blair B. Madison, PhD, who at the time was a postdoctoral fellow in the Rustgi laboratory and is now an assistant professor of Medicine at Washington University, looked downstream of the LIN28B/Let-7 interaction, to determine how Let-7 molecules normally keep intestinal cells from turning cancerous. Let-7 molecules are not proteins. They are short stretches of RNA (microRNAs, or miRNAs) that work within cells to regulate the expression of various genes. To understand better what Let-7 miRNAs normally do to prevent cancer, Rustgi s team created transgenic mice that produce no Let-7 miRNAs in the intestinal lining. The researchers observed that adenomas adenomatous polyps, as well as adenocarcinomas resembling typical human colon tumors, sprouted in the intestines of all these no-Let-7 mice by mid-adulthood, increasing their mortality compared to normal mice. Analyses of the tumors, and of derived  tumoroid  three-dimensional cell clusters cultured in the lab dish, pointed to a protein called Hmga2 as a major factor in the tumors  development. Hmga2 is normally produced during the fast-growth period of fetal life and is thereafter suppressed by Let-7 miRNAs. Rustgi s team observed that in the intestinal lining of the no-Let-7 mice, as well as in tumors and derived tumoroids, Hmga2 s gene was expressed at unusually high levels. Using antibodies to mark Hmga2 proteins, they found it to be particularly abundant in tumors that had begun to spread beyond the intestinal lining. The researchers also found that experimentally lowering Hmga2 s production, introduced by another line of transgenic mice, significantly suppressed tumors induced by Lin28b, and suppression of Let-7. What s more, experimentally lowering Hmga2 production in cultures of intestinal tissue from such mice significantly reduced the cells  tendency to proliferate, whereas increasing Hmga2 levels boosted that proliferation. Analyses of gene expression in the tumors showed a strong relationship between the elevated expression of Hmga2 and the elevated expression of genes considered classic markers of stem cells. That observation adds to findings in recent years that many cancers, including colon cancers, may be driven in part by cancer cells that are in a stem-like state which may enable them not only to proliferate more easily, but also to better withstand therapies. Clearly, other factors were also at work in spurring the development of tumors in the Let-7-suppressed mice. Indeed, the researchers found evidence in the tumors of the overactivation of the Wnt signaling pathway, a known promoter of colon cancer which in these cases may have become spontaneously switched on in some cells.  We suspect that that s the main dysregulation that occurs after Let-7 suppression to boost tumor progression,  said Rustgi. To check the relevance of these mouse results to humans, Rustgi s group examined several hundred human colorectal cancer samples, and found, among other things, lower-than-normal expression of Let-7 miRNAs, and higher-than-normal expression of HMGA2 (the human version of the mouse Hmga2 protein) as well as stem cell markers. In these human cancer samples, HMGA2 expression was also associated with a more advanced stage of tumor growth and reduced survival. The findings point to a surge in HMGA2 as one of the key factors that promotes colon cancer in the many cases where Let-7 levels are suppressed. HMGA2 is already being considered as a target for new treatments for other cancer types, and this study suggests that targeting HMGA2 perhaps in concert with Wnt signaling factors may make a difference in colon cancer too.  We think that there s an axis of cancer promotion here, from LIN28B to Let-7 to the targets of Let-7, including HMGA2, and if one could disrupt the latter with therapeutics, that might help alleviate colon cancer progression and maybe metastasis as well,  said Rustgi. HMGA2 levels may also have a prognostic value, since in this study high HMGA2 levels correlated with more advanced and invasive tumors and a poorer outcome.  We might consider a different therapeutic approach for such patients,  Rustgi noted.","Published: August 7, 2015"

The quest for early diagnosis of this life-threatening condition now takes a step forward, as Johns Hopkins University researchers report on a more effective way to spot hospital patients at risk of septic shock. The new computer-based method correctly predicts septic shock in 85 percent of cases, without increasing the false positive rate from screening methods that are common now. But the critical advance our study makes is to detect these patients early enough that clinicians have time to intervene,  said Suchi Saria, an assistant professor of computer science and health policy at Johns Hopkins  Whiting School of Engineering.  More than two-thirds of the time, the method was able to predict septic shock before any organ dysfunction. That is a 60 percent improvement over existing screening protocols. Peter J. Pronovost, a study co-author and senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the research promises significant progress in treating a condition that is estimated to hit about a million Americans and kill about 200,000 every year   many of them in hospitals and nursing homes.  We know a lot of those deaths would likely be preventable  if sepsis were diagnosed well before it develops into septic shock and organ failure, said Pronovost, who directs the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine.  Right now, much of sepsis is invisible until someone is on death s door.  Every passing hour before sepsis patients receive antibiotics, he said,  correlates strongly with risk of death.  Sepsis is caused by a powerful immune system reaction to infection that, if untreated, can cause inflammation throughout the body; the inflammation can trigger blood clots and leaking blood vessels. That hinders blood flow, which in the worst cases causes organ failure. The condition is a significant problem among vulnerable populations in hospitals and nursing homes. It can be triggered by invasive procedures, including catheterization. The study drew on electronic health records of 16,234 patients admitted to intensive care units   including medical, surgical and cardiac units   at Boston s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001 to 2007.  Researchers created an algorithm that combines 27 factors into a Targeted Real-time Early Warning Score  TREWScore   measuring the risk of septic shock.  One strength of this approach,  notes Katharine Henry, a PhD student in Saria s lab and first author of the study,  is that all of our inputs are routinely collected. You don t need specialized new measurements.  The method differs in several respects from previous attempts to predict septic shock. It s based on a larger data pool, takes account of more health indicators, and factors in several elements that could have confounded the results. One question now is how TREWScore can be used in a hospital or nursing home. David Hager, a co-author and director of the Medical Progressive Care Unit at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the algorithm could be programmed into an electronic health records system to alert doctors and nurses about a patient at risk of septic shock.  The tricky issue is thinking about how the clinical team is provided with the information,  Hager said. A hospital s electronic health records system could be set up to convey alerts to clinicians via pager or cell phone at regular intervals, he said.  But we have to do this in a way that it is well-integrated into the existing clinical workflow and does not cause alarm fatigue,  Saria said. That is the focus of ongoing study. Saria, whose lab is a center for big-data analysis of electronic health records, said the study is part of a broad effort at Johns Hopkins to help clinicians and patients by providing continuous, insightful monitoring.  Our methods are reaching a point where they can be a real aid to clinicians  she said,  especially in noticing subtle hints, buried deep in a chart that a problem is developing.  Pronovost said the effort seeks to make care safer and more humane for patients. That includes re-thinking what harms are preventable. Before this, conditions like sepsis were considered unavoidable.  This is a culture change,  he said.","Published: August 7, 2015"

It also enables Isis Pharmaceuticals to extend use of its antisense technology to diseases of the kidney. Antisense drugs are short, chemically modified, single-stranded nucleic acids (antisense oligonucleotides) that have the ability to target any gene product of interest. They offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention because they act inside the cell to influence protein production by targeting RNA to either prevent the production of disease-causing proteins, increase the production of proteins deficient in disease, or target toxic RNAs that are unable to generate proteins. AstraZeneca will pay an upfront fee of $65 million to Isis Pharmaceuticals plus development and regulatory milestones for each program that AstraZeneca advances to clinical development. Isis Pharmaceuticals is also eligible to earn tiered double-digit royalties on annual net sales for each program. Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicines & Early Development at AstraZeneca, said: ""Antisense-based therapies are rapidly gaining momentum in the clinic and becoming an important component of our early stage pipeline. This collaboration combines the world-class antisense drug research capabilities of Isis with our expertise in cardiovascular, metabolic and renal disease drug discovery and development. By working together, we aim to uncover targets and pathways that can be manipulated using antisense drug therapy."" B. Lynne Parshall, Chief Operating Officer at Isis Pharmaceuticals, said: ""This expansion of our collaboration with AstraZeneca establishes our second strategic relationship. This new collaboration will help broaden the application of our antisense technology to targets in the kidney. AstraZeneca is committed to finding novel best-in-class therapies for some of the largest, most complex and fastest growing disease segments in the developed world. Combining our antisense technology with AstraZeneca's strong knowledge, leadership and commitment in these areas should be very valuable in fully exploiting these opportunities and moving new therapies effectively and efficiently toward the market.""","Published: August 7, 2015"

The discovery solves a long-standing mystery as to how the organ, which is responsible for many metabolic processes, maintains itself when liver cells, most of which are called hepatocytes, grow old and die.  There s always been a question as to how the liver replaces dying hepatocytes,  said professor of developmental biology Roel Nusse, PhD.  Most other tissues have a dedicated population of cells that can divide to make a copy of themselves, which we call self-renewal, and can also give rise to the more-specialized cells that make up that tissue. But there never was any evidence for a stem cell in the liver. Researchers have assumed instead that mature hepatocytes would themselves divide to replace a dying neighbor. However, these cells have an abnormal amount of DNA, which would make cell division extremely difficult. Nusse is the senior author of the work. He is also a member of the Stanford Cancer Institute, the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. First author Bruce Wang, MD, an assistant professor of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of California-San Francisco, led the research as a visiting scholar in Nusse s lab. The liver is a large, multi-lobed organ that plays a vital role in filtering toxins from the blood. It also makes digestive enzymes and is involved in many important metabolic processes. A central vein carries blood through the organ; the stem cells identified by Wang and Nusse are found adjacent to this vein. Abundance of chromosomes Until now, it s been thought that there was just one class of hepatocytes in the liver. Most of these mature cells are polyploid, meaning they have more than the normal two copies of each chromosome. Although this abundance of chromosomes makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the cells to divide normally, it may confer other benefits.  If it s not necessary for a cell to maintain the capacity to divide, it can do whatever it wants with its genome,  said Nusse.  Red blood cells, for instance, have no DNA. Muscle cells have many copies of each chromosome.  An advantage of making extra copies of chromosomes could be the enhanced ability to quickly make large amounts of particular proteins, for example. In contrast, the cell population identified by Wang and Nusse in the mice is diploid, with a normal complement of DNA. They can divide to make others like themselves, or to make cells that start as diploid but then acquire additional copies of their genome as they move outward from the central vein into the main body of the liver.  People in the field have always thought of hepatocytes as a single cell type,  said Wang.  And yet the cell we identified is clearly different from others in the liver. Maybe we should accept that there may be several subtypes of hepatocytes, potentially with different functions.  Wang and Nusse identified the liver stem cells around the central vein by looking in mice for cells anywhere in the organ that expressed a protein called Axin2. The protein is produced by cells in response to the presence of members of the Wnt signaling protein family. Years of research in the Nusse laboratory have shown that the Wnt proteins play a critical role in embryonic development, and also in the growth and maintenance of stem cells throughout the body. Wang and Nusse further found that, in the liver, the endothelial cells that line the interior surface of the central vein make Wnt2 and Wnt9b. These Wnt proteins, in turn, confer stem cell properties on the neighboring hepatocytes. Finally, the researchers learned that a portion of the descendants of the Axin2-expressing cells move outward from the central vein over time. These cells become polyploid and begin to express other, hepatocyte-specific genes. After one year, these descendants had replaced about 30 percent of the entire mouse liver, and made up about 40 percent of all hepatocytes in the organ. The newly identified liver stem cell also expresses genes associated with very early embryonic development, which may give a clue as to when and where they arise.  Perhaps these stem cells in the adult liver actually arise very early in development,  said Nusse,  when the embryo sets aside a certain population of cells to maintain the organ during adult life.  Potential aid for drug testing Although the current research was conducted in mice, the possibility that there is more than one kind of hepatocyte in humans could transform the study of liver biology, the researchers said. For example, hepatocytes have proven notoriously difficult to grow in laboratory culture for study or for use in drug testing.  The most common reason that promising new drugs for any type of condition fail is that they are found to be toxic to liver,  said Wang.  Researchers have been trying for decades to find a way to maintain hepatocytes in the laboratory on which to test the effects of potential medications before trying them in humans. Perhaps we haven t been culturing the right subtype. These stem cells might be more likely to fare well in culture.  There s also an opportunity to better understand human disease.  Does liver cancer arise from a specific subtype of cells?  said Wang.  This model also gives us a way to understand how chromosome number is controlled. Does the presence of the Wnt proteins keep the stem cells in a diploid state? These are fundamental biological questions we can now begin to address. ","Published: August 7, 2015"

The discovery may also lead to new ways to diagnose and treat brain cancer, such as gliomas, medulloblastomas, and neuroblastomas; and skin cancer, known as melanoma.To reveal when cancer-causing genomic changes occur, a research group led by Harold  Skip  Garner, a professor in the departments of biological science, computer science, and basic science at Virginia Tech Carilion Medical School, analyzed an often ignored part of the human genome   repetitive DNA sequences referred to as microsatellites. More than 1 million microsatellites exist in the human genome, including in neural crest tissues, a thin layer of cells within an embryo that contains genetic instructions to build hundreds of cell types, from neurons to adrenal cells. When cells migrate from the neural crest, researchers say the instructions may become garbled, causing cancer cells to emerge. Neurological tumors, for example, may arise from glial cells that develop from the crest. Researchers with the institute s Medical Informatics Systems division say cancer types can be found or predicted from specific markers within these repetitive sequences, known as cancer-associated microsatellite loci, or CAML. Long considered  junk DNA  or  dark matter  within the genome because their function was unclear, microsatellites are known for their role in certain diseases such as Fragile X and Huntington s disease. Garner s group has shown that these regions can be informative about diseases ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. With more study, researchers believe interrelated hereditary and genetic traits of certain cancers can be traced to their common origin at the neural crest, leading to potentially better therapies and easier tumor identification. The findings have been licensed to Genomeon, a company co-founded by Garner to develop new ways to assess cancer risk, create diagnostics, and explore potential drug targets to help cancer patients.","Published: August 7, 2015"

The findings open the door to search for new drugs to treat tumors by cutting off their supply of oxygen and nutrients. ""For the first time, we have solved the structures of both HIF1-alpha and HIF2-alpha complexed with the ARNT subunit, a configuration required for HIF functionality,"" said Fraydoon Rastinejad, Ph.D., professor in the Metabolic Disease Program at SBP. ""Visualizing these multi-domain structures helps us understand their drug binding capabilities and takes us further toward the goal of developing drugs that inhibit the tumor promoting effects of HIFs."" HIF proteins regulate genes that play a role in the progression of a broad range of tumors, and modulating their activity is recognized as a promising approach in cancer therapeutics. There have been intense efforts in the pharmaceutical sector to find drugs that inhibit HIF pathways, but have only led to drug candidates that bind to another class of proteins called PHDs. PHD proteins regulate HIF activities, and there are a number of PHD inhibitors currently in clinical trials for anemia, chronic kidney disease, stroke, as well as cancer. ""This study advances efforts to find new drugs that bind to HIF directly, rather than PHDs. We identified five different pockets in the architecture of the HIF complexes, all of which may be used for targeting small-molecule inhibitors. These drugs could conceivably inhibit HIF functions by reducing their stability, their ability to interact with other protein partners, and by altering mechanisms critical for their function,"" added Rastinejad. Drugs that inhibit HIFs may be very useful for treating solid tumors because these cancers outgrow their blood supply and become starved for oxygen, stimulating HIFs to turn on genes that regulate many cancer cell survival pathways, including angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, increased expression of genes associated with anaerobic metabolism, and metastasis. The coordination of all these programs helps to promote tumor growth and drug resistance, ultimately leading to decreased patient survival. ""Our next step is to analyze a large number of patient samples with mutations in HIF proteins. We'd like to see where on the protein architectures these mutations occur, and how they manifest into HIF functional aberrations,"" said Rastinejad. ""Such mutations will offer a powerful glimpse into the structure-function activities of HIFs, and help us figure out how they turn genes on and off."" ""The insights we make into the structure, function, and regulation of HIFs may also progress the development of treatments for a range of disease states beyond cancer, including heart disease, fatty liver, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases.""","Published: August 7, 2015"

With more accurate accounts of individual gene variability driving disease, therapy selection will be refined for patient success. The initial six-month pilot for this project will enroll 100 patients across 8 primary US centers   potentially expanding to 1000 patients across 50 US centers. Patients enrolled into the Paradigm Registry will have neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy. The patient s cancer will undergo tumor profiling with the Paradigm platform. Precision oncology is an emerging approach for cancer treatment utilized mainly in the metastatic setting but with great potential to direct initial therapy. The primary goal of the Paradigm Registry is to accelerate tumor profiling based on disease biology so that relevant neoadjuvant clinical trials and/or refined treatment regimens can be identified particularly when competing options exist. Dr. Pat Whitworth, MD, Co-Principal Investigator stated,  Conventional thinking is that neoadjuvant therapy is offered to patients with large primary breast cancer to increase the likelihood of breast conservation therapy. However, more breast oncologists are utilizing it as a way to determine if standard chemotherapy is effective. Genomic analysis of breast cancers will help refine treatment based on the patient s individual cancer and not just population based therapies.  Dr. Peter Beitsch MD, and Co-Principal Investigator added,  While these new molecular tests are more commonly used to inform treatment selection when treating aggressive, rare or refractory disease, they are also becoming increasingly valuable in earlier breast cancer treatment selection and management. We look forward to working with Paradigm on this important project.  Robert J. Penny MD, PhD, CEO of Paradigm noted,  Not only do we anticipate patients enrolled in Paradigm s Neoadjuvant Breast Registry to benefit from tailored therapeutics, but we also aim to accelerate the pace of discovery in cancer genomics to move beyond the archaic  one-size-fits-all  approach to cancer treatment. Determining if next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other technologies assist in the selection of clinical trials and targeted treatments for patients being treated in the neoadjuvant setting with improved key clinical endpoints will be a first.  PCDx is a comprehensive clinical-grade NGS-based test that is designed to provide physicians and patients with a more targeted, personalized approach to cancer treatment by identifying the underlying genomic and proteomic alterations of a tumors DNA, RNA & Protein. The test interrogates the most relevant genomic targets at over 5,000x average depth of coverage with 67 therapeutic associations.

Since the 2013-2014 season, the Mailman School scientists have published weekly regional flu forecasts for over 100 cities in the United States using a system recognized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Much like weather forecasting, their system employs a computer model to generate multiple simulations that mimic the behavior of an outbreak and are then knit together to generate an overall prediction. In the new study, the researchers used data from a network of 50 outpatient clinics and laboratory reports in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2013 as a test case to retrospectively generate weekly flu forecasts. The system was able to forecast both the peak timing and peak magnitude for 44 epidemics in 16 years caused by individual influenza strains, including influenza A (H3N2), influenza B, and both seasonal and the 2009 pandemic outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1). The technique predicted the peak timing of the outbreak three weeks in advance of the actual peak with accuracy as high as 93 percent. Prediction accuracy varied depending on the strength of the outbreak and how far in advance the prediction was made. In general, forecasts for specific strains were more accurate than those for aggregate epidemics, and the peak and magnitude of outbreaks were more accurate than the timing of their onset or their duration. The researchers began publishing real-time flu predictions for U.S. cities with information on specific strains for the 2014-2015 flu season on the Columbia Prediction of Infectious Disease website and expect to publish real-time predictions for Hong Kong in advance of the next influenza season, which will appear on the Columbia website and the Hong Kong group website.  These forecasts provide information at lead times that can be valuable for both the public and health officials,  says senior author Jeffrey Shaman, PhD, associate professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School.  Individuals may choose to get a flu vaccine to protect themselves against infection, while officials can anticipate how many vaccines and other supplies are needed, as well as the number of clinicians and nurses needed.  With a population of over 7 million, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. The city is highly connected with mainland China and other regions around the world and attracts more than 50 million visitors annually.  Hong Kong is a crossroads to Asia and the rest of the world, serving as an entry and exit point for flu outbreaks year round, and the region of South East Asia with Hong Kong at its center is often referred to as the global epicenter for flu.  says Benjamin J. Cowling, PhD, professor at the School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong. Seasonal influenza outbreaks in temperate climates like the United States are restricted to the winter months. By contrast, outbreaks in the subtropics such as Hong Kong happen year-round.  In addition, outbreak intensity, duration, and timing are more variable in the subtropics than in temperate regions.  The irregularity of flu outbreaks in subtropical climates makes forecasting more challenging,  says first author Wan Yang, PhD, an associate research scientist at the Mailman School. Yang and her co-authors modified the flu forecasting system used in the United States to account for the dynamics of a subtropical climate, adding mathematical techniques that prompt the system to recalibrate itself and let go of certain assumptions.  We design the system to pay attention to the data when there are changing dynamics, and promptly recognize any change in flu activity throughout the year,  explains Yang. Looking ahead, the researchers hope to refine the system to account for cross-immunity due to prior infections from related strains, for varying transmission dynamics among age groups, or spatial connectivity among sub-regions. Worldwide, influenza kills an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 people each year. In the U.S. (population 320 million) about 35,000 and in Hong Kong (population 7.2 million) about 750 die from the flu every year. ","Published: August 7, 2015"

Traditionally these data have been difficult and expensive to collect, and the study authors believe their work could help make the process much easier and more accurate.  Researchers initially screened blood samples from 186 children in Uganda and looked at antibody responses to nearly 900 malaria parasite proteins. Using statistical analyses, they successfully identified combinations of antibody responses that could predict the date at which the children were last infected with the malaria parasite. Some of the proteins they identified were also able to predict the number of times the children had had malaria within the last year. When they compared this with the children s records, they found that the biomarker predictions accurately reflected the children s actual exposure to malaria.  Professor Chris Drakeley, co-principal investigator from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said:  This is a great example of marrying technology and epidemiology to identify biomarkers relevant for malaria control. The challenge now is to validate these findings in different malaria endemic areas. We hope our work could help pave the way for more frequent and accurate estimates of malaria incidence.   Further analysis in the study suggested that precise estimates of wider community exposure can be obtained from sampling a small subset of the community.  Dr Bryan Greenhouse, principal investigator of the project from University of California, San Francisco, said:  In many settings the current standard for malaria surveillance is the equivalent of intermittent, low resolution snapshots. What we are hoping to do with these new serologic assays would be the equivalent of getting high-resolution video footage for about the same cost. ","Published: August 7, 2015"

For each tumour, they assessed whether particular genetic faults were present in all the samples from each patient, or in only a proportion of them. They found that most tumours were made up of a patchwork of faults. The more complicated this patchwork and the greater the genetic differences within each tumour, the more aggressive the tumour and the less likely it was to respond well to cisplatin   a drug commonly used to treat oesophageal cancer. Importantly, the cells within these more aggressive tumours were also prone to picking up additional faults following cisplatin exposure, suggesting that the chemotherapy itself was driving new mutations and genetic chaos in drug resistant tumours. This knowledge could one day be used to identify groups of patients with more aggressive tumours that would benefit from different approaches, such as earlier surgery or combinations of  smart drugs  that target specific faulty molecules within tumours. Study leader Professor Charles Swanton from the UCL Cancer Institute and Francis Crick Institute, said:  Studies like this are edging us closer to being able to predict cancer s  next move , hopefully leading to sophisticated new treatment combinations that will outsmart the disease before it can really take hold. This will be particularly crucial for hard-to-treat cancers like oesophageal cancer, which has seen disappointingly little improvement in survival in recent decades.  Dr Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK s science information manager, said:  Oesophageal cancer claims nearly 8,000 lives every year and more than half of all patients die within twelve months of diagnosis, so we re urgently investing in more research to understand the disease, detect it earlier and treat it more effectively. By understanding the genetic chaos that lies at the heart of these tumours, we hope to make a real difference to this stark statistic and keep many more families together for longer.

It is currently being tested in an open-label, one-arm proof-of-principle trial to evaluate its safety and effect on immune tolerance in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The study involves frequent neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dr. Keith Martin, CEO of Apitope, commented:  We are pleased that Merck Serono has completed recruitment into a challenging clinical trial. The results of this trial in patients with relapsing MS will hopefully continue to build on the positive data from our first two studies. It will also potentially provide further clinical support for Apitope s approach in the treatment of serious autoimmune conditions.  ATX-MS-1467 is a potential novel treatment developed with the aim of working with the immune system to treat the underlying cause of the disease by restoring immunological balance, instead of only treating the symptoms or suppressing the entire immune system. Apitope has already successfully completed a Phase I clinical trial in six patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and a second Phase I trial in 43 relapsing MS patients, assessing safety as well as biological parameters.

The results hint that the treatment, already in phase 2 human clinical trials, may potentially benefit only a subset of stroke patients, offering knowledge that could help improve design of future studies on this drug. More broadly, the results published in Science Translational Medicine show how this type of study, called a preclinical randomized controlled trial or pRCT, may offer a potentially powerful tool for bridging the gap between the lab bench and the bedside. Designed and conducted to more stringent standards than are typical for animal studies, pRCTs could help select the most promising drug candidate before launching costly and potentially ineffective, or even harmful, clinical trials. ""Our study unequivocally proved that preclinical randomized multicenter trials are feasible, which has been doubted over the last decade,"" said Gemma Llovera from the University Medical Center Munich, Germany, the study's first author. ""We believe that pRCTs might become a new step within the pipeline from basic research [to] preclinical drug testing to clinical trials,"" said senior author Arthur Liesz, also from the University Medical Center Munich. The mouse trial was performed over the course of a year and four months and cost a total of $180,000 (USD) or  165,000, including more than  30,000 for the cost of the drug alone. ""Compared to the enormous financial and scientific loss caused by a negative clinical trial, preventing a single unnecessary or even harmful clinical trial by conducting a pRCT will outweigh the costs and time of a pRCT manifold,"" said Liesz. Biomedical research is widely known to be plagued by the ""reproducibility crisis"": the failure to replicate results of preclinical cell or animal research that normally precedes clinical or human studies. The research community is confronted with the fact that for many fields of research, including stroke and cancer, almost all of hundreds of drug candidates successfully tested in the lab fail in clinical trials, according to Liesz. Laboratory studies often suffer from the improper use of animal models that are poorly representative of human disease or limited sample sizes. Some studies do not randomly assign subjects to a treatment or control group, or perform ""blinding"" that conceals the type of treatment from the subject or researcher. Along with flawed statistical analyses or inadequate reporting of data, these issues can introduce bias or variables that make it difficult to reliably predict how humans will react to drugs tested in animal studies. Researchers have proposed preclinical trials modeled after a clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT), the gold standard in clinical drug development, as a way to address the replication crisis. Unlike most animal studies, RCTs require often large sample sizes, randomization, proper controls such as a placebo, blinded assessment of outcomes, and stringent data analysis and reporting. International research consortia that seek to perform pRCTs have already been established, including the European Union-funded Multicentre Preclinical Animal Research Team (Multi-PART) for stroke research and the U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded Consortium for preclinicAl assESsment of cARdioprotective therapies (CAESAR) for cardiac research. The European consortium led by Liesz investigated a candidate drug for stroke called CD49d-specific antibody therapy, also known as natalizumab, which has been approved to treat multiple sclerosis. Four rodent studies previously showed that these antibodies protected the brain from inflammation after ischemic stroke, but these results were contradicted by a fifth study showing no benefit. Nevertheless, a phase 2 clinical trial was launched in stroke patients. ""I think most researchers in the field   including me   had the feeling that this clinical study was somewhat prematurely initiated,"" said Liesz. To determine whether a preclinical trial could have better guided the decision to advance the CD49d-specific antibody to clinical trials, six independent research centers in Europe collaborated to conduct a multicenter, centrally coordinated, blinded pRCT. Each lab performed experiments in two different mouse models of stroke using similar rigorous procedures and many of the same materials, down to the surgical equipment and mice of identical age and gender from the same commercial breeder. The centers pooled results from a total of 315 mice. In mice with a form of confined stroke, the anti-CD49d antibody therapy stemmed inflammation and reduced brain damage after stroke. In another model of severe stroke, which caused more extensive brain injury, the antibody showed no protective effect in the mice, indicating that the success of the treatment may depend on the type and severity of the stroke. ""The results of our pRCT would suggest that potentially only a subpopulation of stroke patients will profit from immune-targeted stroke therapies,"" said Liesz. However, he added, researchers need to better understand the inflammatory response during stroke before they can pinpoint specific patients most likely to benefit from treatment. The researchers plan to compare their findings with the outcome of the recently completed phase 2 clinical trial, expected to be released later this year. If the preclinical and clinical results prove similar, this would support the pRCT as a valuable research tool for deciding whether or not a drug should advance to clinical testing. ""If supported by funding agencies and the pharmaceutical industry, pRCTs [may] become a mandatory step before testing a drug candidate in a clinical trial,"" said Liesz.

The two studies reinforce the idea that a purely chemical approach is a promising way to scale up cell reprogramming research that may avoid the technical challenges and safety concerns associated with the more popular method of using transcription factors. Both papers appear in the journal Cell Stem Cell. One of the challenges of forcing cells to change identity is that the cells you end up with may look normal but have different internal activities than their naturally forming counterparts. The two papers provide evidence that similar gene expression, action potentials, and synapse formation can be detected in transcription-factor-induced neurons as those generated from the chemical cocktails. (Both groups used mixtures of seven small molecules, but different recipes--outlined in detail in the supplemental information section of each paper--because they focused on different species). ""We found that the conversion process induced by our chemical strategy is accompanied by the down-regulation of [skin-cell] specific genes and the increased expression of neuronal transcription factors,"" said human study co-author Jian Zhao, of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and Tongji University. ""By coordinating multiple signaling pathways, these small molecules modulate neuronal transcription factor gene expression and thereby promote the neuronal cell transition."" The authors add that the direct conversion bypasses a proliferative intermediate progenitor stage, which circumvents safety issues posed by other reprogramming methods. Zhao's paper, co-led with cell biologist Gang Pei, also shows that the pure chemical protocol can be used to make neurons from the skins cells of Alzheimer's patients. Most of the work using patient stem cells has been done by using transcription factors--molecules that affect which genes are expressed in a cell--to create induced pluripotent stem cells. Chemical cell reprogramming is seen as an alternative for disease modeling or even potential cell replacement therapy of neurological disorders, but the ""proof-of-concept"" is still emerging. ""In comparison with using transgenic reprogramming factors, the small molecules that are used in this chemical approach are cell permeable; cost-effective; and easy to synthesize, preserve, and standardize; and their effects can be reversible,"" says mouse study co-author Hongkui Deng of the Peking University Stem Cell Research Center. ""In addition, the use of small molecules can be fine-tuned by adjusting their concentrations and duration, and the approach bypasses the technical challenges and safety concerns of genetic manipulations, which may be promising in their future applications."" Deng worked for four years with Zhen Chai and Yang Zhao, also of Peking University, to identify the small molecules that could create chemically induced mouse neurons. Researchers had been close for years, but a transcription factor was always necessary to complete the transformation. Through many chemical screens they identified the key ingredient, I-BET151, which works to suppress transcription in skin cells. They then found the right steps and conditions to mature the neurons post-transformation. The authors of both papers aim to learn more about the biology behind chemically induced reprogramming and to make the protocols more efficient. While their success is promising, there are still a number of hurdles to overcome. ""We hope in the future that the chemical approaches would be more robust in inducing functional mature neurons,"" Deng says. ""In addition, we are attempting to generate specific neuronal subtypes and patient-specific functional neurons for translational medicine by using pure chemicals."" Jian Zhao, of the human study, says: ""It should be possible to generate different subtypes of neurons with a similar chemical approach but using slightly modified chemical cocktails."" She adds: ""It also needs to be explored whether functional neurons could be induced by chemical cocktails in living organisms with neurological diseases or injury."" Cell Press Pei G et al.

The details are published in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution. The software, which converts digital photos to animal vision, can be used to analyze colors and patterns and is particularly useful for the study of animal and plant signaling, camouflage and animal predation, but could also prove useful for anyone wanting to measure colors accurately and objectively. The software has already been used by the Sensory Ecology group in a wide range of studies, such as color change in green shore crabs, tracking human female face color changes through the ovulation cycle, and determining the aspects of camouflage that protect nightjar clutches from being spotted by potential predators. Dr Jolyon Troscianko from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter's Penryn Campus said:  Viewing the world through the eyes of another animal has now become much easier thanks to our new software.  Digital cameras are powerful tools for measuring colors and patterns in nature but until now it has been surprisingly difficult to use digital photos to make accurate and reliable measurements of color. Our software allows us to calibrate images and convert them to animal vision, so that we can measure how the scene might look to humans and non-humans alike.  We hope that other scientists will use this open access software to help with their digital image analysis.  Until now, there has been no user-friendly software program that enables researchers to calibrate their images, incorporate multiple layers - visible and UV channels -, convert to animal color spaces, and to measure images easily. Instead, researchers have needed to do much of this manually, including the sometimes complex programming and calculations involved. This freely available open source software now offers a user-friendly solution. Color vision varies substantially across the animal kingdom, and can even vary within a given species. Most humans and old-world monkeys have eyes sensitive to three colors; red, green and blue, which is more than other mammals that are only sensitive to blue and yellow. It is impossible for humans to imagine seeing the world in more than three primary colors, but this is common in most birds, reptiles, amphibians and many insects that see in four or more. Many of them can also see into the ultraviolet range, a world completely invisible to us without the use of full spectrum cameras. So scientists studying these species need to measure UV to understand how these animals view the world. Using a camera converted to full spectrum sensitivity, one photograph taken through a visible-pass filter can be combined by the software with a second taken through an ultraviolet-pass filter. The software can then generate functions to show the image through an animal's eyes. The researchers have provided specific data on camera settings for commonly studied animals, such as humans, blue tits, peafowl, honey bees, ferrets and some fish. Flowers often look particularly striking in UV because they are signaling to attract pollinators that can see in UV, such as bees. UV is also often important for birds, reptiles and insects in their colorful sexual displays to attract mates. The software is free to download and is available here.

The scientists discovered that bone tumors exposed to normal forces express more of a protein, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), than detected in static cultures. The IGF-1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in resistance to current chemotherapy. The experiments were performed in a custom-made bioreactor by the Rice lab of bioengineer Antonios Mikos in collaboration with the MD Anderson lab of Joseph Ludwig.The study shows the value of incorporating mechanical forces when modeling tumors and treatments as opposed to analyzing tumor growth statically, said lead author Marco Santoro, a chemical and biomolecular engineering graduate student of Mikos.  Mechanical forces are present in our bodies even though we are not always aware of them,  he said.  Our cells are sensitive to the forces around them and change their behavior accordingly. Tumor cells behave the same way, changing their function depending on the forces they sense.  Mikos and his team specialize in materials and strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. As part of that work, they have created foam-like materials that serve as scaffolds for cells to inhabit and grow into as they become new bone or tissue. That material provided an opportunity for the latest experiments at Rice s BioScience Research Collaborative on bone tumor samples called sarcomas provided by MD Anderson. Sarcoma tumors, also a focus of the Mikos lab, are most often found in the bones of adolescents and young adults. The researchers placed sarcoma cells in their porous, biologically inert scaffold and put the scaffold inside a flow perfusion bioreactor to mimic the stimulation those cells would experience amid the tissue inside real bone. They subjected the cells to biomechanical stimuli, including shear stress, by changing the fluid viscosity and flow rate. Over 10 days they found the steady flow of fluid through the scaffold prompted the sarcoma cells to proliferate throughout the structure. The higher shear stress helped the cells significantly increase their production of the IGF-1 protein and also down-regulated the production of two other cancer-related proteins, c-KIT and HER2, compared with static tests. They also discovered that adjusting parameters in the bioreactor influenced the cells  sensitivity to Dalotuzumab, a drug that disrupts the IGF-1 pathway. Higher shear stress appeared to decrease the drug s effectiveness due to the associated increase in IGF-1 production.  For the first time, we showed how the effect of the drug changes according to the forces experienced by the cells,  Santoro said.  IGF-1 is crucial for this kind of sarcoma, which relies on this mechanism for growth. We show that the higher the mechanical stimulation, the more pronounced the secretion of this particular protein.  Mikos said the experiments should set a good example for cancer studies.  These experiments have to be tailored for each cancer, because the forces that cells experience vary in different parts of the body,  he said.  In the lungs, they wouldn t be the same as in the bones. But they give researchers a far more realistic way to mimic the tumor s local environment. ","Published: August 6, 2015"

Following the success of Aridhia s Research as a Service and translational informatics platform in the Horizon 2020 EU Research and Innovation programme, and other European healthcare projects, Aridhia s collaboration with Vancis is seen as a strong endorsement of the strength of the Netherlands  research sector. Rodrigo Barnes, Aridhia s Chief Technology Officer, called the partnership  a prime example of Aridhia s commitment to collaboration.  While it is widely acknowledged that good data and communication can accelerate research, the complexities involved in bringing high-quality data together, improving multidisciplinary communication and collaboration, and bridging the gap between research and clinical practice have often been a barrier to progress.  It was not hard to notice that many of the most innovative projects that we were being invited into either originated in, or had a footing in, the Netherlands. Vancis was therefore a natural partner to align with to extend the reach of Aridhia s services.  The Research as a Service solution hosted by Vancis will employ Aridhia's AnalytiXagility platform to provide advanced data science, collaboration and audit technologies for biomedical research, enabling researchers to easily collaborate on the analysis of vast amounts of data within secure, cloud-based environments. This will enable organisations such as the Netherlands  University Medical Centres to encourage and empower collaboration and innovation in biomedical research. The subscription based service will provide researchers with a private collaborative analytical workspace and the ability to bring a range of datatypes and tools into the AnalytiXagility environment. Furthermore, the partnership will continue to enrich the platform with additional services including data modelling and analytics, and powerful Artificial Intelligence learning algorithms in collaboration with partners MGRID, Care IQ and Xomnia. Sander Ruiter, Business Development Manager at Vancis points out:  We see our market for research production moving into a pay per use cloud service, so that customers are able to quickly, safely and easily start a scalable environment for their data and applications. Joining forces with Aridhia and the other consortium partners will enable us to deliver these services to researchers.  Barnes said:  Our cloud-based solution ensures that the complicated and expensive enablers of biomedical research - i.e. the infrastructure, hardware, privacy requirements, analytical software licences and so on associated with biomedical research are taken care of by Aridhia and Vancis, leaving researchers free to focus on bringing their data and skills together.   Research as a Service aims to make collaboration and data analysis even easier, and further the Netherlands  excellent track record in patient care, scientific research and education. This is the first time that Edinburgh-based Aridhia has signed a direct partnership agreement with another European country, although the company already has a foothold in the Netherlands as a result of two existing major projects.  When looking to integrate and analyse traumatic brain injury data from bedside monitors supplied by Amsterdam-based industry partner Philips Healthcare, the pan-European CHART-ADAPT project chose Aridhia s AnalytiXagility platform. AnalytiXagility is also the platform of choice for ADVOCATE, a  6 million Horizon 2020 funded oral health research project where it is being used to address the audit and reproducibility requirements of the 10 European partner organisations, including the Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam and Achmea Health Insurance.

What they lack, however, is good reconnaissance   a reliable way to obtain real-time data about how well a particular therapy is working for any given patient. Magnetic resonance imaging and other scanning technologies can indicate the size of a tumor, while the most detailed information about how well a treatment is working comes from pathologists  examinations of tissue taken in biopsies. Yet these methods offer only snapshots of tumor response, and the invasive nature of biopsies makes them a risky procedure that clinicians try to minimize.Now, researchers at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research are closing that information gap by developing a tiny biochemical sensor that can be implanted in cancerous tissue during the initial biopsy. The sensor then wirelessly sends data about telltale biomarkers to an external  reader  device, allowing doctors to better monitor a patient s progress and adjust dosages or switch therapies accordingly. Making cancer treatments more targeted and precise would boost their efficacy while reducing patients  exposure to serious side effects.  We wanted to make a device that would give us a chemical signal about what s happening in the tumor,  says Michael Cima, the David H. Koch (1962) Professor in Engineering in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and a Koch Institute investigator who oversaw the sensor s development.  Rather than waiting months to see if the tumor is shrinking, you could get an early read to see if you re moving in the right direction.  Two MIT doctoral students in Cima s lab worked with him on the sensor project: Vincent Liu, now a postdoc at MIT, and Christophoros Vassiliou, now a postdoc at the University of California at Berkeley. The sensors developed by Cima s team provide real-time, on-demand data concerning two biomarkers linked to a tumor s response to treatment: pH and dissolved oxygen. As Cima explains, when cancerous tissue is under assault from chemotherapy agents, it becomes more acidic.  Many times, you can see the response chemically before you see a tumor actually shrink,  Cima says. In fact, some therapies will trigger an immune system reaction, and the inflammation will make the tumor appear to be growing, even while the therapy is effective. Oxygen levels, meanwhile, can help doctors gauge the proper dose of a therapy such as radiation, since tumors thrive in low-oxygen (hypoxic) conditions.  It turns out that the more hypoxic the tumor is, the more radiation you need,  Cima says.  So, these sensors, read over time, could let you see how hypoxia was changing in the tumor, so you could adjust the radiation accordingly.  The sensor housing, made of a biocompatible plastic, is small enough to fit into the tip of a biopsy needle. It contains 10 microliters of chemical contrast agents typically used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an on-board circuit to communicate with the external reader device. Devising a power source for these sensors was critical, Cima explains. Four years ago, his team built a similar implantable sensor that could be read by an MRI scanner.  MRI scans are expensive and not easy to make part of routine care,  he says.  We wanted to take the next step and put some electronics on the device so we could take these measurements without an MRI.  For power, these new sensors rely on the reader. Specifically, there s a metal coil inside the reader and a much smaller coil in the sensor itself. An electric current magnetizes the coil inside the reader, and that magnetic field creates a voltage in the sensor s coil when the two coils are close together   a process called mutual inductance. The reader sends out a series of pulses, and the sensor  rings back,  as Cima puts it. The variation in this return signal over time is interpreted by a computer to which the reader is wired, revealing changes in the targeted biomarkers.  With these devices, it s like taking blood pressure. It s a simple measurement. You get the readout and move on,  says Ralph Weissleder, a radiologist and director of the Center for Systems Biology lab at Massachusetts General Hospital who is familiar with the research.  Whatever you can do right then and there without any complicated testing, the better it is. Cima s team successfully tested the sensors in lab experiments, including implanting them in rodents. While the sensors were only implanted for a few weeks, Cima believes they could be used to monitor a person s health over many years.  There are thousands of people alive today, because they have implantable electronics, like pacemakers and defibrillators,  he says.  We re making these sensors out of materials that are in these kinds of long-term implants, and given that they re so small, I don t think there will be a problem.  These initial experiments showed that the sensors could quickly, reliably, and accurately detect pH and oxygen concentration in tissue. The researchers next want to see how well the sensors do measuring changes in pH over an extended period of time.  I want to push these probes so we can use them to monitor tumor response,  Cima says.  We did a little bit of that in these experiments, but we need to make that really robust.  While the primary application of these sensors would be cancer care, Cima is also eager to collaborate with researchers in other fields, such as environmental science.  For example, you could use these to measure dissolved oxygen or pH from a lot of different sites all over a pond or a lake,  Cima says.  I m excited about using these sensors to bring big data to environmental monitoring. ","Published: August 6, 2015"

Professor Hagemeyer said this latest step offers a revolutionary difference between the current treatments for blood clots and what might be possible in the future. This life saving treatment could be administered by paramedics in emergency situations without the need for specialised equipment as is currently the case.  We ve created a nanocapsule that contains a clot-busting drug. The drug-loaded nanocapsule is coated with an antibody that specifically targets activated platelets, the cells that form blood clots,  Professor Hagemeyer said.  Once located at the site of the blood clot, thrombin (a molecule at the centre of the clotting process) breaks open the outer layer of the nanocapsule, releasing the clot-busting drug. We are effectively hijacking the blood clotting system to initiate the removal of the blockage in the blood vessel,  he said.  Professor Frank Caruso from the Melbourne School of Engineering said the targeted drug with its novel delivery method can potentially offer a safer alternative with fewer side effects for people suffering a heart attack or stroke.  Up to 55,000 Australians experience a heart attack or suffer a stroke every year.   About half of the people who need a clot-busting drug can t use the current treatments because the risk of serious bleeding is too high,  he said.","Published: August 6, 2015"

A serious disadvantage of vascular grafts is their tendency to get blocked due to clot formation, which results in compulsory and lifelong intake of anticoagulants among patients and sometimes may even require an additional surgical intervention. In the study, a research team led by Vladimir Vinogradov, head of the International Laboratory of Solution Chemistry of Advanced Materials and Technologies at ITMO University proposed a solution to the problem. The team managed to synthesize a thin film made of densely packed aluminum oxide nanorods blended with molecules of a thrombolytic enzyme (urokinase-type plasminogen activator). Adhered to the inner surface of a vascular graft, the film causes the parietal area of the graft to get filled with a stable concentration of a substance, called plasmin, which is capable of dissolving the appearing clots.The unique properties of the film arise from its structure, which represents a porous matrix, accommodating the plasminogen activator. The matrix protects the plasminogen activator from the aggressive environment of the organism, at the same time preserving the ability of the enzyme to interact with certain external agents through a system of pores. In particular, the matrix lets in plasminogen, a proenzyme naturally occurring in blood plasma. When plasminogen meets plasminogen activator inside the matrix, clot-dissolving plasmin forms. Yulia Chapurina, laboratory researcher and first author of the paper, set up several in vitro experiments that helped demonstrate just how effective the film is: ""In order to test how our improved vascular graft worked, we grew an artificial clot made of blood plasma mixed with thrombin and placed it inside the graft. The results of the experiment amazed us. Very soon the clot started to dissolve and leak through the graft. In reality, our coating would destroy clots at the stage of formation, constantly ensuring an unobstructed blood flow in the graft."" Latest-generation vascular grafts rely on drug-eluting technology, that is, they actively release medicine into the blood. The lifetime of such grafts is often determined by the amount of drug stored within the graft, which, in essence, means that they merely postpone the formation of clots. The system, developed by the researchers, is based on the entrapment of the drug inside a porous protective shell, which makes the lifetime of such a graft practically unlimited. ""Our approach is concept-based and can be applied not only to artificial blood vessels, but to any kind of implants. You just need to take the right kind of drug. For example, after the implantation of an artificial ureter, urease crystals often start to grow inside and doctors do not know how to deal with this problem. It is possible to apply a similar drug-containing coating that dissolves urease. The same approach may be used for kidney or liver surgery, but these are plans for the future,"" concludes Vladimir Vinogradov.","Published: August 6, 2015"

However tissues grown so far have not reached the size and final shape of natural tissue. Matsumoto and colleagues at Okayama, Osaka and Kansai Universities in Japan have now identified a tripeptide sequence that can be used to overcome both limitations. With hydrogel modified with the tripeptide they demonstrate enhanced tissue growth of a salivary gland both across a sheet of tissue and at specified localized points. The salivary gland studied - the submandibular gland - develops a branched structure through budding and the elongation of ducts, which is also typical of other structures such as lungs, kidneys, mammary glands and spleen. Previous research revealed the importance of the glycoprotein fibronectin in the morphological development and growth of salivary gland tissue. Consequently Matsumoto and colleagues focused their investigations on the effects of the specific tripeptide sequence arginine-glycine aspartic acid (RGD) that acts as a cell binding site on fibronectin. The researchers studied the growth of salivary gland tissue on hydrogel both modified with different concentrations of RGD and without and found significant growth enhancements that increased with RGD concentrations. They then experimented with RGD-modified hydrogel beads and demonstrated that localized growth enhancement occurred where the beads were situated, which could provide control over morphology in artificial tissue growth. Further studies also suggested that neuronal growth and the enhancement of growth factor proteins were responsible for the enhanced gland tissue growth observed. In their report of the work the researchers conclude,  This in vitro SMG tissue growth modulation system can have a variety of uses including tissue arrays for drug screening and as a biologic tool to understand tissue development.  BackgroundTripeptide in previous studiesThe shape development or morphogenesis of the submandibular gland develops through the formation of clefts that occur through a change in cell adhesion so that they bind to the surrounding extracellular matrix instead of each other. Previous research has shown that expression of the glycoprotein fibronectin is crucial for cleft formation. Integrin is a receptor protein that bridges interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. The domain of fibronectin that binds to integrin is the tripeptide sequence arginine-glycine aspartic acid (RGD) prompting studies of this tripeptide sequence on tissue growth. Investigations have already shown that transplanting composites containing RGD peptides onto the back of a mouse can result in the development of growth plates - the tissue at the ends of bones in growing children and adolescents. However so far there have been no studies into the growth and morphology of tissues in vitro. The ability to grow tissues in vitro is particularly important for drug screening and studies to better understand tissue growth. The role of FGFsFibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of proteins involved in embryonic development, wound healing and signalling pathways. Two specific FGFs play a crucial role in the growth of the two main tissue types in the submandible salivary gland   FGF7 induces budding in the epithelial tissue and FGF10 induces the elongation of ducts in the mesenchymal tissue. Matsumoto and colleagues imaged the salivary gland tissues grown in RGD-modified hydrogels using immunofluorescent staining and found both FGF7 and FGF10 were highly expressed. Experiments to grow the salivary gland tissues in the presence of FGF7 and FGF10 antibodies revealed that these antibodies inhibited tissue growth. The RGD-modified hydrogel was also ineffective at enhancing tissue budding in isolated epithelial cells alone. The role of neuritesPrevious studies have also suggested that neuron outgrowths -  neurites  - from a region known as the parasympathetic ganglion in submandibular gland tissue are key to tissue growth. The researchers observed an even distribution of the neurite network throughout the gland tissues they had grown. Antibodies to the neurotrophic factors, which are responsible for neuron growth and survival, also inhibited submandibular gland tissue growth in RGD-modified hydrogels.","Published: August 6, 2015"
9,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/molecular-tinkering-doubles-cancer-drugs-efficacy-201345,Molecular Tinkering Doubles Cancer Drug s Efficacy Researchers have packaged a widely used cancer drug into nanoparticles  more than doubling its effectiveness at destroying tumors  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The drug paclitaxel has been used for decades to fight breast, ovarian, lung and other cancers. But its effectiveness has been limited by its small molecular size and insolubility in water properties that allow the body to clear the drug too quickly, reducing its accumulation in tumors. Many molecular packaging systems have been developed to deliver the drug while counteracting these effects, with a protein-bound version of the drug called Abraxane currently the leading therapy. But Ashutosh Chilkoti, professor and chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University, thought his team could do better. By surrounding molecules of paclitaxel with self-assembling spheres composed of amino acids, the Duke team doubled tumor exposure to the drug compared to Abraxane while simultaneously reducing its effects on healthy tissue. This kept mice with tumors alive significantly longer and, in some cases, completely eradicated the tumors.The big difference between Abraxane and the Duke approach is the types of molecular bonds that are formed. In Abraxane, the paclitaxel is physically surrounded by albumin, a common blood protein. In the new packaging system, multiple copies of the drug are chemically bonded to an amino acid polypeptide, forming a water-soluble nanoparticle with the drug hidden in its core. These nanoparticles are highly soluble in blood and are the perfect size to penetrate and accumulate in tumors where they take advantage of a tumor s acidic environment.  The chemical bonds holding the polypeptide cage together are stable in blood, but dissolve in a tumor s lower pH levels,  said Jayanta Bhattacharyya, senior researcher in Chilkoti s lab and first author on the paper.  This delivers the drug directly to the tumor and helps prevent it from randomly absorbing into healthy tissue, reducing side effects.  To test their system, Chilkoti, Bhattacharyya and their colleagues used two groups of mice. The first group had human breast cancer growing in their own mammary glands. While none of the mice treated with Abraxane survived past 85 days, most of the mice treated with the new packaging system survived past 100 days. A second group of mice had human prostate tumors growing under their skin. Similarly, while they did not survive past 60 days when treated with Abraxane, every single mouse treated with the new packaging system survived past 70 days, with some experiencing a complete cure. As the mortality rates suggest, the Duke technology showed a higher concentration of paclitaxel in the tumors with more staying power than Abraxane, while simultaneously showing much lower levels throughout the rest of the mice s bodies.  Clearly in the animal model there is a night and day difference, and if that translates to people it will be transformative for patients,  said Neil Spector, an oncologist at Duke Medicine familiar with the work.  But it s not just the increase in clinical efficacy and outcomes that are exciting, it s also the improvement in targeting and reduction in toxicity, which is just icing on the cake. And since this platform could potentially be used for such a broad array of drugs, it could be a game-changer for cancer therapy.  In future work, Chilkoti and coworkers will begin applying the packaging system to other cancer drugs with the goal of developing a  one size fits all  technology to improve the effectiveness of many other cancer drugs.","Published: August 6, 2015"

The Rice lab of biochemist Yousif Shamoo identified a genetic mechanism that allows bacteria to develop resistance while simultaneously and quickly spreading the capability to others in a population.  This is really a double whammy,  Shamoo said.  Our finding that these bacteria become more antibiotic-resistant while at the same time spreading their resistance more efficiently was really surprising and worrying.  The researchers hope this knowledge will help predict when and how bacterial strains are likely to develop resistance to future antibiotics and perhaps act to halt   or at least slow   the process. Antibiotic resistance is responsible for hundreds of thousands of infections acquired in American hospitals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These infections kill thousands of patients. While progress is being made to control microbes that spread infection, the overriding concern remains that drugs developed to kill germs will ultimately stop working. Until now, the only effective way to keep antibiotics from losing their potency has been to use them sparingly, said Kathryn Beabout, a Rice graduate student and lead author of the new paper.  The best you can do is try to manage when you use the antibiotic,  she said.  But our idea is that if we can predict how resistance is going to emerge, we can come up with strategies to use antibiotics in a more intelligent way.  The lab used experimental evolution to study a specific combination of bacteria and an antibiotic that had not been in common contact. The bacteria of interest was Enterococcus faecalis, found in the gastrointestinal tract. The antibiotic was tigecycline, a highly effective but sparingly used derivative of tetracycline. The goal was to see how horizontal gene transfer   the means by which cells pass along favorable mutations   would work in the presence of the antibiotic. It worked quite well, they found. That was due mostly to a chunk of mutant DNA known as Tn916, a transposon that can change its position along the genome, duplicate itself and pass to other cells in a process known as parasexuality, the exchange of genetic material between cells. Tn916 carries the tetracycline-resistance gene called tetM, which has been found in many pathogens, according to the researchers. Without tigecycline, Tn916 moves only infrequently, as about one in 120,000 bacteria transfer their resistance to another bacteria. But in the presence of the antibiotic, Tn916 movement rose to one in 50 bacteria, due to a mutation that also causes overproduction of tetM. The resistance mechanism required the presence of two mutations, to Tn916 and to a gene that encodes the ribosomal S10 protein, both of which could be easily identified through pre- and post-experiment gene sequencing.  Tetracyclines bind to the cell s ribosome and prevent it from making proteins,  Beabout said.  TetM is a protein that comes in and kicks tetracyclines off and frees the ribosome, but it doesn t usually work against tigecycline. We didn t expect to see it emerge.  In their experiments, the researchers discovered the mutations led to the production of large amounts of tetM proteins.  When you have an abundance of tetM, they re able to have an effect against tigecycline,  Beabout said.  What s really interesting is that tetM is on a conjugative transposon (Tn916), which is a DNA element that s able to move around the genome and can be transferred to other cells.  An additional effect of this tetM overexpression is that the Tn916 transposon moves more,  she said.  It passes from cell to cell more. So we are seeing both resistance and an increase in the frequency at which resistance is able to transfer from cell to cell and move around genomes. That s definitely worrisome.  The lab allowed colonies of E. faecalis to grow rapidly in bioreactors for 19 and 24 days. The results showed the bacteria were remarkably proficient at picking up the resistance gene.  All the cells at the beginning had one copy of the transposon, and throughout the experiment they started acquiring additional copies. The copy number of the transposon was increasing very rapidly.  Shamoo hopes the research leads to drugs that inhibit resistance mechanisms and preserve the effectiveness of new antibiotics.  Our lab does a form of evolutionary reconnaissance into how bacteria will become resistant in the future,  Shamoo said.  The pharmaceutical industry and other labs can use this information to develop drugs to stay ahead of the pathogens. ","Published: August 6, 2015"

The new method first sends out an antibody as a ""spy"" to detect the diseased cells and then binds to them. This antibody in turn attracts a subsequently administered radioactively labeled probe. The scientists could then clearly visualize the tumor by utilizing a tomographic method. This procedure could improve cancer treatment in the future by using internal radiation.The human immune system forms antibodies that protect the body from pathogens. Antibodies can also, however, be produced in a laboratory to precisely bind to tumor cells. They are used in cancer research to detect and fight malignant tumors. For example, antibodies can serve as transport vehicles for radionuclides, with which the affected regions can be visualized or can even be damaged. Until recently, a stumbling block has been their large molecular mass. ""This causes them to circulate in the body for too long before they reach the diseased cells,"" explains Dr Holger Stephan from the Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research at HZDR. ""This is a disadvantage because organs that are not affected by the disease are exposed to radiation. It also makes the exact localization of the tumor in the body more difficult because the resulting images are less sharp."" Together with colleagues at the University of Zurich and the Ruhr-Universit t Bochum, the researchers from Dresden therefore chose an alternative strategy. ""By using what is known as 'pre-targeting', the antibodies' task is divided into two steps,"" Dr Kristof Zarschler, a member of Stephan's team, explains. ""In a figurative sense, we first send spies out in advance, over a longer period of time, to scout out the enemy - the tumor cells. The 'spies' then share their position with their troops, which we subsequently send out so that they will directly reach their target with the radioactive material."" The researchers fall back on the cetuximab antibody as the scout, which binds selectively to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In various types of tumors, there is an increase in this molecule's formation or it might be found in a mutated form, which then leads the cells to grow and multiply uncontrolled. The Dresden researchers combined the antibody with a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) derivative which Prof Gilles Gasser and Prof Nils Metzler-Nolte developed together with their respective working groups in Switzerland and Germany. ""It is a very stable synthetic variant of DNA,"" says Holger Stephan. ""Similar to a single strand of DNA, it consists of a certain sequence of the four organic bases. Complementary PNA with matching sequence binds to it in a highly precise and stable manner."" During their experiments, the scientists first injected the PNA-EGFR antibody into tumor-bearing mice and gave this ""spy"" time to accumulate at the tumor site. They then administered the PNA counterpart, labeled with the radioactive substance technetium-99m. ""Images we took using single photon emission computed tomography show that both the antibody and its counterpart located each other quickly,"" says Zarschler, pleased with the results. The tumor could thus be clearly visualized within a short period of time. ""Furthermore, the radioactively labeled probes had already disappeared from the bloodstream after sixty minutes,"" explains Holger Stephan. ""This minimizes radioactive exposure risk of healthy body tissue. By pre-targeting, we can overcome limitations of conventional, radioactively marked antibodies."" According to the researchers, it will, however, take some time before the combination of PNA antibodies and their matching PNA counterparts can be used in diagnosing tumors in humans. ""Our results however show that the PNAs we tested are suitable candidates for further preclinical studies,"" Stephan sums up. They could provide new possibilities not only for visualizing diseased cells but also for fighting them. ""If the method is proven to work, it could also be used to transport therapeutically effective radioactive substances to the tumor in order to irradiate it from within and ultimately damage it.""","Published: August 6, 2015"

Through a combination of high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and a unique methodology for image analysis, a team of researchers with Berkeley Lab and the University of California (UC) Berkeley has produced an atomic view of microtubules that enabled them to identify the crucial role played by a family of end-binding (EB) proteins in regulating microtubule dynamic instability.During mitosis, microtubules disassemble and reform into spindles that are used by the dividing cell to move chromosomes. For chromosome migration to occur, the microtubules attached to them must disassemble, carrying the chromosomes in the process. The dynamic instability that makes it possible for microtubules to transition from a rigid polymerized or  assembled  nucleotide state to a flexible depolymerized or  disassembled  nucleotide state is driven by guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice.  Our study shows how EB proteins can either facilitate microtubule assembly by binding to sub-units of the microtubule, essentially holding them together, or else cause a microtubule to disassemble by promoting GTP hydrolysis that destabilizes the microtubule lattice,  says Eva Nogales, a biophysicist with Berkeley Lab s Life Sciences Division who led this research. Nogales, who is also a professor of biophysics and structural biology at UC Berkeley and investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, is a leading authority on the structure and dynamics of microtubules. In this latest study, she and her group used cryo-EM, in which protein samples are flash-frozen at liquid nitrogen temperatures to preserve their natural structure, to determine microtubule structures in different nucleotide states with and without EB3. With cryo-EM and their image analysis methodology, they achieved a resolution of 3.5 Angstroms, a record for microtubules. For perspective, the diameter of a hydrogen atom is about 1.0 Angstroms.  We can now study the atomic details of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization to develop a complete description of microtubule dynamics,  Nogales says. Beyond their importance to our understanding of basic cell biology, microtubules are a major target for anticancer drugs, such as Taxol, which can prevent the transition from growing to shrinking nucleotide states or vice versa.  A better understanding of how microtubule dynamic instability is regulated could open new opportunities for improving the potency and selectivity of existing anti-cancer drugs, as well as facilitate the development of novel agents,  Nogales says.","Published: August 6, 2015"

Now, scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have made a discovery that brings them closer to a new therapy based on selectively erasing these dangerous and tenacious drug-associated memories.  We now have a viable target and by blocking that target, we can disrupt, and potentially erase, drug memories, leaving other memories intact,  said TSRI Associate Professor Courtney Miller.  The hope is that, when combined with traditional rehabilitation and abstinence therapies, we can reduce or eliminate relapse for meth users after a single treatment by taking away the power of an individual s triggers. The new stud , demonstrates the effectiveness of a single injection of an early drug candidate called blebbistatin in preventing relapse in animal models of methamphetamine addiction. The new study builds on previous work in Miller s lab. In 2013, the team made the surprising discovery that drug-associated memories could be selectively erased by targeting actin, the protein that provides the structural scaffold supporting memories in the brain. However, the therapeutic potential of the finding seemed limited by the problem that actin is critically important throughout the body taking a pill that generally inhibits actin, even once, would likely be fatal. In the new study, Miller and her colleagues report a major advance the discovery of a safe route to selectively targeting brain actin through nonmuscle myosin II (NMII), a molecular motor that supports memory formation. To accomplish this, the research used a compound called blebbistatin that acts on this protein. The results showed that a single injection of blebbistatin successfully disrupted long-term storage of drug-related memories and blocked relapse for at least a month in animal models of methamphetamine addiction.  What makes myosin II such an exciting therapeutic target is that a single injection of blebbistatin makes methamphetamine-associated memories go away, along with dendritic spines, the structures in the brain that store memory,  said Research Associate Erica Young, a member of the Miller lab and a key author of the new study, along with Research Associates Ashley M. Blouin and Sherri B. Briggs. Blouin added,  Drugs targeting actin usually have to be delivered directly into the brain. But blebbistatin reaches the brain even when injected into the body s periphery and, importantly, the animals remained healthy.  Moreover, the effect of this novel treatment approach was specific to drug-associated memories (not affecting other memories), and the animals were still able to form new recollections.  Our results argue for developing small molecule inhibitors of nonmuscle myosin II as potential therapeutics for relapse prevention, and that s exactly what we re doing with our colleagues here at Scripps with expertise in drug development,  said Briggs.","Published: August 6, 2015"

Specifically, they determined KLF4's pivotal role through its absence -- that is, the mitochondria malfunction without enough of the protein, which in turn leads to reduced energy. This decline is particularly problematic in the heart because lower energy can lead to heart failure and death. ""Some cells are incredibly dependent on mitochondria, particularly the heart and brain,"" Liao said. ""The brain is working all the time, too, even while we are sleeping, so it is particularly sensitive to mitochondrial function. Cancer also hijacks mitochondrial machinery to drive its spread. Therefore, the identification of KLF4 as a major regulator of mitochondria health may have implications beyond those we detailed in this article."" Mitochondria are described as ""power plant"" structures because they convert sugars and lipids to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency for all cells. The number of mitochondria, their ability to produce energy, and their repair and/or removal when damaged constitute some of the key aspects of mitochondria's lifecycle. The investigators found that KLF4 controls these critical aspects of mitochondrial biology. ""Xudong made the observation several years ago that mice lacking KLF4 in the heart developed profound heart failure in response to stress,"" said senior author Mukesh Jain, MD, the Ellery Sedgwick Jr. Chair and Distinguished Scientist, and director of the Case Cardiovascular Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. ""In this most recent research, he looked into the mechanisms for why the heart had failed so quickly and made the exciting observation that KLF4 controls major aspects of the mitochondrial biology."" The initial hint that KLF4 regulates mitochondrial biology came from genome-wide studies that revealed a strong signature for KLF4's control of mitochondrial genes. Next, Liao and his colleagues compared the effects of cardiac stress on normal mice and on those lacking KLF4 in their hearts. The normal mice adapted to the stress and didn't succumb to heart failure for weeks. In contrast, half the KLF4-deficient mice died of heart failure within a week; the rest experienced severe declines in the heart's ability to contract and pump blood. Further investigation revealed massive mitochondrial damage and energy reduction. From there, the researchers showed that KLF4 also regulates mitochondrial biogenesis (production of new mitochondria) and mitophagy (mitochondrial repair and maintenance). ""Mitochondria have their own life cycle, and KLF4 controls it,"" Jain said. ""Increasingly, there is a view that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to many forms of heart failure. The heart has an unrelenting need for energy and thus any mitochondrial dysfunction will impair the heart's ability to pump blood.""

They managed to obtain totipotent cells with the same characteristics as those of the earliest embryonic stages and with even more interesting properties.. Just after fertilization, when the embryo is comprised of only 1 or 2 cells, cells are  totipotent , that is to say, capable of producing an entire embryo as well as the placenta and umbilical cord that accompany it. During the subsequent rounds of cell division, cells rapidly lose this plasticity and become  pluripotent . At the blastocyst stage (about thirty cells), the so-called  embryonic stem cells  can differentiate into any tissue, although they alone cannot give birth to a foetus anymore. Pluripotent cells then continue to specialise and form the various tissues of the body through a process called cellular differentiation.For some years, it has been possible to re-programme differentiated cells into pluripotent ones, but not into totipotent cells. Now, the team of Maria-Elena Torres-Padilla has studied the characteristics of totipotent cells of the embryo and found factors capable of inducing a totipotent-like state. When culturing pluripotent stem cells in vitro, a small amount of totipotent cells appear spontaneously; these are called  2C-like cells  (named after their resemblance to the 2-cell stage embryo). The researchers compared these cells to those present in early embryos in order to find their common characteristics and those that make them different from pluripotent cells. In particular, the teams found that the DNA was less condensed in totipotent cells and that the amount of the protein complex CAF1 was diminished. A closer look revealed that CAF1 -already known for its role in the assembly of chromatin (the organised state of DNA)- is responsible for maintaining the pluripotent state by ensuring that the DNA is wrapped around histones. Based on this hypothesis, the Torres-Padilla team were able to induce a totipotent state by inactivating the expression of the CAF1 complex, which led to chromatin reprogramming into a less condensed state.","Published: August 6, 2015"

The execution of this regulatory code is what allows for the creation of very different cell- and tissue-types from the same set of genetic instructions found in the nucleus of every cell.  The vast majority of the human genome (~98% of the total genetic information) is not dedicated to encoding proteins, and this non-coding sequence was initially designated as ""junk DNA"" to underscore its lack of apparent function. Much of the so-called junk DNA in our genomes has accumulated over evolutionary time due to the activity of retrotransposable elements (RTEs), which are capable of moving (transposing) from one location to another in the genome and make copies of themselves when they do so. These elements have been considered as genomic parasites that exist by virtue of their ability to replicate themselves to high numbers within genomes without providing any beneficial function for the hosts in which they reside. However, recent studies on RTEs have shown that they can in fact encode important functions, and much of their functional activity turns out to be related to how genomes are regulated. RTEs have been linked to stem cell function, tissue differentiation, cancer progression and ultimately to aging and age-related pathologies.The study by Wang et al. provides a new perspective on the role that RTE-derived sequences play in the precise execution of the human genome's regulatory program. This study found that one particular class of RTEs - Mammalian-wide Interspersed Repeats (MIRs) - can serve as genetic landmarks that help to target specific regulatory mechanisms to a large number of genomic sites and thereby lead to the coordinated regulation of the genes located nearby these sites. This discovery was spearheaded by a team of computational biologists, led by Dr. King Jordan, Associate Professor and Director of the Bioinformatics Graduate Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who performed a ""big data"" analysis of massive datasets generated by hundreds of scientists from dozens of laboratories around the world working as part of the ""Encyclopedia of DNA Elements"" or ENCODE project. Their comprehensive and integrated data analysis, conducted by primarily by Dr. Jianrong Wang from Dr. Jordan's team, allowed them to pinpoint the location of thousands of individual MIR elements in the human genome that appear to function as so-called ""boundary elements"" in T lymphocyte cells of the immune system. Boundary elements are epigenetic regulatory sequences that separate transcriptionally active regions of the human genome from transcriptionally silent regions in a cell-type specific manner. In so doing, these critical regulatory elements help to provide distinct identities to different cell types, although they all contain identical sets of information. The regulatory programs that underlie these cell- and tissue-specific functions and identities are based largely on genome packaging. Genes that should not be expressed in a given cell or tissue are located in tightly packaged regions of the genome and inaccessible to the transcription factors that would otherwise turn them on. These boundary elements help to establish the geography of genome packaging by delineating the margins between silent regions in which genes are not expressed and active regions in which they are. In this critical role, boundary elements help to control the timing and extent of gene expression across the entire genome. As a result, defects in the organization of the genome by boundary elements are highly relevant for physiological and pathological processes. ""Our colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology were able to build upon our early discovery that another class of retrotransposon, the SINEB2 element, can provide boundary function at the mouse growth hormone locus,"" said Dr. Victoria Lunyak, CEO of Aelan Cell Technologies whose research team collaborated with Jordan lab on this project. ""We randomly picked a hand full of the MIR sequences predicted to serve as boundary elements by the Jordan lab and experimentally validated their activity in mouse cell lines and, with help of our Spanish collaborators, in Zebra fish upon embryonic development,"" Dr. Lunyak said. ""This testing revealed that MIR sequences can serve as punctuation marks within our genome that enable cells to correctly read and comprehend the message transmitted by the genomic sequences."" ""One thing that is particularly striking is the fact that these punctuation marks, as Victoria calls them, play a role that is deeply evolutionary conserved,"" said Dr. Jordan. ""The same exact MIR sequences were able to function as boundaries in human CD4+ lymphocytes, in mouse cell models and in Zebrafish."" ""This is an important discovery because the understanding of how RTEs punctuate messages encoded in the human genome can help researchers to develop treatments for a wide variety of human diseases, including aging,"" added Dr. Lunyak Aging is characterized by a number of global changes in genome organization and function, and aging-associated defects in how our genome is packaged can have severe pathological consequences. In particular, age-related defects in genomic packaging can greatly increase the susceptibility of the genome to damage. Based on the discoveries published in their PNASpaper, the Jordan lab at Georgia Tech and the Lunyak team at Aelan Cell Technologies and their partner Nuclea Biotechnologies are now working towards the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that target the critical roles of epigenetic regulators, such as human retrotransposons, in coordinating cell-type specific regulatory programs.","Published: August 6, 2015"

They re also 20 times more likely to contract childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia than the general population, making that chromosome an important avenue for researching the genetic basis of the cancer.  A major goal of my laboratory is to identify the specific gene   or genes   on chromosome 21 responsible for the increased incidence of leukemia in this population,  said study senior author John Crispino, PhD, Robert I. Lurie, MD, and Lora S. Lurie Professor in Medicine-Hematology/Oncology and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, and a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.In previous work, Crispino and colleagues found that a gene on chromosome 21 called DYRK1A contributes to the development of leukemia. Now they expanded on that research by studying the gene in depth. Specifically, they wanted to understand how DYRK1A plays a role in blood cell production. Over-production of immature lymphocytes is a hallmark of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With first author Benjamin Thompson, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow, Crispino generated a mouse model that lacks DYRK1A in blood cells. They saw that two types of white blood cells called B and T lymphocytes were severely blocked from developing without the gene. The scientists also found evidence that DYRK1A is normally responsible for regulating cell cycle progression in those lymphocytes. Because they have extra copies of chromosome 21, children with Down syndrome have more DYRK1A than usual.  This finding is exciting to us because human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases show increased levels of DYRK1A,  said Crispino.  The results suggest that DYRK1A may be a novel target for therapy in this form of leukemia. ","Published: August 6, 2015"

Thanks to the development activities of pharmacist Dr. Marc Waidmann, a particularly safe and effective culture media additive is now available for the cultivation of stem cells that meets the regulatory requirements for use on humans. Stem cells represent one of the rays of optimism in modern medicine, and stem cell therapies are being developed worldwide and are already undergoing tests in numerous clinical trials. The REGiNA project, a users' centre for regenerative medicine that forms part of the STERN BioRegion, is also devoted to this sector. As a result, the demand for human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) continues to grow. To produce quantities on a therapeutic scale, laboratories and research facilities have so far mainly used foetal bovine serum as a culture media additive. Although this is available in large quantities, it has the disadvantage   even apart from ethical considerations   that animal pathogens such as BSE can potentially infect the stem cell culture. For this reason, platelet lysate, which is generated from human blood donations, is now the gold standard for cultivating MSC. It contains growth factors and cytokines   proteins that regulate the growth and differentiation of cells   which stimulate the proliferation of the stem cells. ZKT has now been awarded the manufacturing licence for the production of human platelet lysate in accordance with the German Drug Law by the T bingen regional government office. The platelet lysate obtained under GMP cleanroom conditions is now supplied as ""raw material of human origin"" for pharmaceutical manufacturing   such as for use in clinical trials or for manufacturing licensed medicinal products for cell therapy.

Ongoing preclinical work has demonstrated the potential use of ARGX-110 to overcome imatinib resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), data which are published in the leading journal Science Translational Medicine.  The multi-faceted clinical potential of ARGX-110 in CD70 positive tumors is unfolding rapidly as we progress through preclinical and clinical development. Together with our collaborators in Bern, our discovery that CD70 blockade overcomes resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in CML patients offers an exciting in-road into combination therapy with ARGX-110. Through this collaboration, we have built a deeper understanding of the role of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in CML and how CD70 plays a role in establishment of resistance to standard of care therapies,  commented Hans de Haard, Chief Scientific Officer of arGEN-X.  LSCs are responsible for the development of imatinib resistance. This resistance is caused by imatinib-dependent increase of CD70 expression which signals through its known receptor, CD27, resulting in the alternative activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Combination therapy of imatinib and CD70 blockade has been shown to eliminate LSCs both in a murine CML model and in CML tumor xenografts,  emphasize Carsten Riether and Adrian Ochsenbein, who are leading the research project at the University of Bern.","Published: August 6, 2015"

The development and commercialization of this program by Heptares is covered by the existing collaboration agreement between the two companies. MorphoSys will receive a licensing fee and R&D funding from Heptares and is eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on the sales of any therapeutic antibodies resulting from the program. Further financial details were not disclosed.

We are delighted with the progress that has been made in the alliance, and to be adding this first antibody development program to our pipeline. This achievement highlights the power and versatility of our StaR  technology in both small molecule and biologics discovery for expanding our own pipeline and in partnerships."" In February 2013, MorphoSys and Heptares Therapeutics, the clinical-stage GPCR structure-guided drug discovery and development company, announced an agreement to discover novel antibody therapeutics targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Under the terms of the agreement, Heptares generates stabilized receptors (StaR ) for a set of GPCR disease targets proposed by MorphoSys. MorphoSys then utilizes its proprietary Ylanthia  library for the generation and further development of specific and functionally active anti-GPCR antibodies. The agreement also includes the option, now exercised by Heptares, to develop and commercialize a therapeutic antibody created by MorphoSys against a GPCR target selected by Heptares. GPCRs are membrane proteins involved in a broad range of biological processes and diseases, including inflammatory disease, neuroscience indications, metabolic diseases and cancer. They comprise the single largest class of targets for pharmaceuticals currently on the market. Technical challenges, however, have meant that GPCRs have been largely intractable to therapeutic antibody development and to date only one GPCR-targeting antibody has been approved (for adult T-cell lymphoma), which reflects the central technical challenge of accessing reliable high-quality GPCR antigen. The Heptares StaR  technology provides a solution to this challenge, enabling the purification of properly folded and functional protein removed from the cell membrane. StaR proteins also preserve epitopes from the desired pharmacological state (active or inactive) of the GPCR, thereby enabling generation of panels of functional antibodies targeting the disease-relevant form of the receptor. MorphoSys's Ylanthia  antibody library comprises more than 100 billion distinct, fully human antibodies, which makes it the industry's largest known antibody Fab library. Ylanthia's genetic composition translates into unprecedented structural diversity of the antibodies and offers optimized developability features. The library's diversity is expected to result in antibodies against previously inaccessible target molecules and to provide unique epitope coverage.","Published: August 6, 2015"

Regeneron has developed a novel and flexible manufacturing platform that enables efficient production of bi-specific antibodies that are otherwise similar to natural antibodies. Beyond PD-1, other programs in preclinical development include antibodies to lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), glucocorticoid-induced tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-related protein (GITR) and a programmed death ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor. Finally, the collaboration is advancing bi-specific antibodies that target hematologic and solid cancers, either as monotherapies or in combination regimens with other immune modulating treatments. ""Despite many advances over the last decades, cancer remains a leading cause of death and suffering around the world,"" said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President Clinical Sciences, Head of Translational Science and Oncology, Regeneron. ""Although initial advances with immuno-oncology have helped certain patients, there is a tremendous opportunity to further unlock the potential of this new approach to help even greater numbers of people living with cancer."" The framework of the new immuno-oncology collaboration is as follows:  Regeneron will be responsible for discovery, antibody generation and development through POC, at which time Sanofi will have the ability to opt-in to further development and commercialization. In the existing antibody collaboration, Sanofi has the opportunity to opt-in at the time of an Investigational New Drug application (IND).  The companies will alternate serving as the lead development and commercialization organization after Sanofi opts-in to an antibody program.  For programs where Regeneron is the lead, including REGN2810, Regeneron will serve as the U.S. commercial lead, including recording U.S. sales, and the companies will equally fund post-POC development. Sanofi will record sales and serve as the commercial lead for all countries outside the U.S. Sanofi will retain the right to co-promote in the U.S. and Regeneron will retain the right to co-promote outside the U.S.  For programs where Sanofi is the lead, Sanofi will serve as the U.S. commercial lead and fund 100 percent of post-POC development, with Regeneron reimbursing up to 50 percent of such costs through the IO collaboration development balance, which represents the amount of development funding that Regeneron is obligated to repay out of its share of profits as described below. Sanofi will record sales and serve as the commercial lead for all countries outside the U.S. Regeneron will retain the right to co-promote in the U.S. and outside the U.S.  Sanofi and Regeneron will share equally in worldwide profits from sale of collaboration immuno-oncology antibodies.  As in the existing antibody agreement, Regeneron will repay the immuno-oncology collaboration development balance from its share of overall profits of the immuno-oncology antibodies, in an annual amount equal to 10 percent of the Regeneron share of profits. The exclusive collaboration to discover and develop potential monotherapy or novel combination immuno-oncology antibody candidates through POC will last five years with an ability to extend the collaboration for selected ongoing programs for an additional three years.

The study by James Gangwisch, PhD, and colleagues in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center looked at the dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, types of carbohydrates consumed, and depression in data from more than 70,000 postmenopausal women who participated in the National Institutes of Health s Women s Health Initiative Observational Study between 1994 and 1998. Consumption of carbohydrates increases blood sugar levels to varying degrees, depending on the type of food ingested. The more highly refined the carbohydrate, the higher its score on the glycemic index (GI) scale. The GI scale, which goes from 0-100, measures the amount of sugar found in the blood after eating. Refined foods such as white bread, white rice, and soda trigger a hormonal response in the body to reduce blood sugar levels. This response also may cause or exacerbate mood changes, fatigue, and other symptoms of depression. The investigators found that progressively higher dietary GI scores and consumption of added sugars and refined grains were associated with increased risk of new-onset depression in post-menopausal women. Greater consumption of dietary fiber, whole grains, vegetables, and non-juice fruits was associated with decreased risk. This suggests that dietary interventions could serve as treatments and preventive measures for depression. Further study is needed to examine the potential of this novel option for treatment and prevention and to see if similar results are found in the broader population.

PeerJ is publishing the research, which provides the first evidence for a face-selective region in the temporal cortex of dogs. ""Our findings show that dogs have an innate way to process faces in their brains, a quality that has previously only been well-documented in humans and other primates,"" says Gregory Berns, a neuroscientist at Emory University and the senior author of the study. Having neural machinery dedicated to face processing suggests that this ability is hard-wired through cognitive evolution, Berns says, and may help explain dogs' extreme sensitivity to human social cues. Berns heads up the Dog Project in Emory's Department of Psychology, which is researching evolutionary questions surrounding man's best, and oldest, friend. The project was the first to train dogs to voluntarily enter a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner and remain motionless during scanning, without restraint or sedation. In previous research, the Dog Project identified the caudate region of the canine brain as a reward center. It also showed how that region of a dog's brain responds more strongly to the scents of familiar humans than to the scents of other humans, or even to those of familiar dogs. For the current study, the researchers focused on how dogs respond to faces versus everyday objects. ""Dogs are obviously highly social animals,"" Berns says, ""so it makes sense that they would respond to faces. We wanted to know whether that response is learned or innate."" The study involved dogs viewing both static images and video images on a screen while undergoing fMRI. It was a particularly challenging experiment since dogs do not normally interact with two-dimensional images, and they had to undergo training to learn to pay attention to the screen. A limitation of the study was the small sample size: Only six of the eight dogs enrolled in the study were able to hold a gaze for at least 30 seconds on each of the images to meet the experimental criteria. The results were clear, however, for the six subjects able to complete the experiment. A region in their temporal lobe responded significantly more to movies of human faces than to movies of everyday objects. This same region responded similarly to still images of human faces and dog faces, yet significantly more to both human and dog faces than to images of everyday objects. If the dogs' response to faces was learned - by associating a human face with food, for example - you would expect to see a response in the reward system of their brains, but that was not the case, Berns says. A previous study, decades ago, using electrophysiology, found several face-selective neurons in sheep. ""That study identified only a few face-selective cells and not an entire region of the cortex,"" says Daniel Dilks, an Emory assistant professor of psychology and the first author of the current dog study. The researchers have dubbed the canine face-processing region they identified the dog face area, or DFA. Humans have at least three face processing regions in the brain, including the fusiform face area, or FFA, which is associated with distinguishing faces from other objects. ""We can predict what parts of your brain are going to be activated when you're looking at faces,"" Dilks says. ""This is incredibly reliable across people."" One hypothesis is that distinguishing faces is important for any social creature. ""Dogs have been cohabitating with humans for longer than any other animal,"" Dilks says. ""They are incredibly social, not just with other members of their pack, but across species. Understanding more about canine cognition and perception may tell us more about social cognition and perception in general."" Emory University   Original reporting by: Carol Clark Berns GS et al.

This work was accomplished through collaboration with several international research teams. Among these researchers was St phane Jamain (CR1 INSERM, Universit  de Cr teil, France), a French geneticist specializied in psychiatric disorders. To communicate with each other, neurons use neurotransmitters. Among the classical neurotransmitters are dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and glutamate. Until recently, it was believed that a given neuron used only one classical neurotransmitter. Some time ago, Salah El Mestikawy's team contributed to the surprising discovery that subpopulations of neurons are able to use two transmitters. In other words, unlike the vast majority of neurons, these neurons are bilingual. Most neurons in the brain respond with either ""yes,"" ""no"" or ""maybe."" El Mestikawy and his colleagues found that in order to regulate our reward behaviors, a small population of neurons in our reward center are able to respond with both ""yes"" and ""no."" These neurons are known as cholinergic neurons, while the reward center is known as the nucleus accumbens. In this new work, the researchers discovered that when they shut down one of the languages (the ""no"") of cholinergic neurons within the reward center, mice showed a marked predilection for cocaine. This work explains the molecular mechanism underlying reward behavior, while identifying an unsuspected target in the treatment of addiction. Finally and perhaps even more important, the team found that humans with mutation of a key gene for this co-transmission were 10 times more vulnerable to very severe forms of addiction. ""These discoveries are bringing about a major transformation in the field of addiction. We are beginning to decipher and understand the complex regulation of basic behaviors"" says Salah El Mestikawy. Douglas Mental Health University Institute   press release El Mestikawy S et al.

It is already known that stress affects brain function and may lead to PTSD, but until now the underlying brain networks have proven elusive. Led by Prof Morten Kringelbach, the Oxford team's systematic meta-analysis of all brain research on PTSD is published in the journal Neuroscience and Biobehavioural Reviews. The research is part of a larger programme on PTSD in British war veterans run by the Scars of War Foundation based at The Queen's College, University of Oxford. The foundation uses neuroscience to advance understanding of the effects of war and disaster. The research team's initial survey of the scientific literature for all the published studies reporting brain activity in individuals with a diagnosis of PTSD yielded over 2000 records. This number was then reduced using stringent criteria to ensure the highest possible data quality for processing with meta-analytic tools. The team separated studies by type of control group: trauma-exposed (those who had experienced trauma but did not have a diagnosis of PTSD) and trauma-na ve (those who had not experienced trauma), and compared the individuals with PTSD to both groups. This yielded an insight into how the abnormalities in functional brain activity in PTSD comprise a whole-brain network. The analysis showed that there were differences between the brain activity of individuals with PTSD and that of the groups of both trauma-exposed and trauma-na ve participants. This suggests that even in the absence of symptoms, trauma may have an enduring effect on brain function. Critically, the research found that in parts of a region of the brain called the basal ganglia, brain activity was different when comparing people with PTSD to the trauma-exposed group. The findings suggest that the transition to clinical PTSD could be linked with imbalances specifically in the basal ganglia -- but linked with imbalances in a larger brain network. This view has been reinforced by new evidence uncovered by the team using whole-brain computational modelling of other neuropsychiatric disorders. This modeling showed that these disorders lead to specific imbalances in specific brain networks. Crucially, the meta-analysis has identified the need to directly compare trauma-exposed and trauma-na ve groups to identify potential biomarkers that could help early diagnosis and potentially novel treatments for PTSD. Professor Kringelbach said: 'This research suggests that there may be a spectrum of traumatic effect on the brain, where people who have experienced trauma may not meet the threshold for a diagnosis of PTSD but may have similar changes within the brain. This could make them more susceptible to PTSD if they experience a subsequent trauma. 'While PTSD is often seen and portrayed as an issue for war veterans, it can affect other groups, including emergency service workers and refugees from conflict or disaster. By understanding how the brain is changed, we may be better placed to prevent the effects of trauma developing into clinical PTSD.' PTSD often presents as a series of non-specific, confusing and distressing symptoms. The condition is therefore difficult for clinicians to differentiate from a wide variety of others. In particular among soldiers, PTSD can initially seem very similar to the effects of explosions and blows to the head. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and PTSD are especially common in soldiers and war veterans. After the end of World War One, the Report of the War Office Committee of Enquiry into ""Shell Shock."" announced the need to differentiate between the effects of trauma and brain injury. Resolving this long-outstanding question is an important part of the Scars of War Foundation's remit. The new insights are guiding the research team's brain imaging study of British war veterans, which is about to start and which will compare veterans with PTSD to veterans both with and without trauma. Better understanding of the brains of war veterans is a vital first step in the Foundation's aim of providing clinicians with the means to make early diagnoses, while increasing the accuracy of early diagnoses has the potential to avoid the progression to intractable chronic versions of these conditions. That could cut costs for war veteran care. It would also make possible the development of more effective treatments. The Director of Scars of War Foundation and Falklands War veteran Hugh McManners commented: 'A possible implication of our research is that because trauma seems to lead to brain changes in everyone who is exposed, PTSD may not actually be abnormal or a 'disorder' but the brain's natural reaction to events and experiences that are abnormal. There may therefore be more 'natural' military and social methods of preventing and treating it. We hope to elucidate this further in the scanning phase of this project. More immediately, this could prove significant in helping to remove the stigma suffered by Service men and women who develop PTSD.' University of Oxford   press release Kringelbach ML et al.

A bacteriophage, or phage, is a virus that attacks bacteria. Because they are abundant in the environment, scientists are trying to learn more about the different types and what specific bacteria each can attack. Scientists at AgriLife Research were able to isolate four phages that specifically target Xylella fastidiosa, the culprit in Pierce s disease.  The bacteria Xylella fastidiosa is native to the U.S. and causes disease in many plants including grapevines, oaks, peaches, almonds, coffee and citrus,  said Carlos Gonzalez, an AgriLife Research plant pathologist in College Station.  We have imported most of our grapevines from Europe, and so therefore the pathogen and the host   in this case the grapevine   did not co-evolve. That made the grapevines susceptible. The offending bacteria makes its way to plants via insects. In wine grapes, it s the glassy-winged sharpshooter. When the insect feeds on a plant, the bacteria is transmitted inside the plant where it travels throughout the xylem vessels, infecting as it goes. The resulting condition, called Pierce s disease, can cause a vineyard to die in anywhere from a few months to a few years after infection, according to Jim Kamas of Fredericksburg, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service horticulturist and outreach coordinator for the Texas Pierce s Disease Research and Education Program.  Instead of feeding on the leaves of a plant, the glassy-winged sharpshooter feeds on the cane of a grapevine and therefore spreads the bacterium much more efficiently,  Gonzalez explained. The insect, about the size of a grain of rice, could feed its way into an estimated $24.6 billion of California wine sales in the U.S., according to the Wine Institute, and the Texas Wine and Grape Growers Association  estimated $1.88 billion of economic value to the state. Stopping the rampage with potential to make such an enormous dent in food and beverage supply heretofore relied on insecticides aimed at the carrier bugs. However, the group of insecticides used have been shown to have adverse effects on beneficial insects such as honeybees and have already been banned in Europe, the scientists said. These concerns lead them to seek a biocontrol, or more natural way of preventing and treating diseases caused by Xylella fastidiosa, said Gonzalez, who also is part of the Center for Phage Technology in College Station where the research was done.  Our approach basically was to directly address the bacterium that causes the disease rather than focus on the insect,  Gonzalez said of his colleagues at the center, Ry Young, Mayukh Das and Tushar Suvra Bhowmick.  The phage treatment offers an alternative to pesticides for the treatment of diseases caused by Xylella fastidiosa.  Young said the idea of a phage cocktail is to include several different phages so that if a bacterial strain becomes resistant to one of the phages, then it will be killed by the others.  Like the famous boxer Jack Dempsey said,  if my right hand don t get ya, my left hand will.  That s pretty much how the cocktails work,  said Young, the center s director. But finding the right mix isn t easy, the researchers said. Das, Bhowmick and then-graduate student Stephen Ahern isolated numerous phages to examine their genetic diversity.  We have a phage bank with more than 100 phages,  Bhowmick said.  We picked the four candidates   known as Sano, Salvo, Prado and Paz   because of their physical and genetic characteristics. And they are very different from each other.  Grapevines grown in a greenhouse were inoculated with the bacteria and with the cocktail consisting of the four phages. The team experimented both with applying the phage cocktail after the plants had been infected with Xylella fastidiosa and to plants before infection by the bacteria. They found that the cocktail worked both to prevent infection of the grapevines and to stop the disease when infection had begun.  We got very promising results so we are pretty sure that this is an alternative therapy for Xylella fastidiosa,  Bhowmick said.  Phages have really great potential,  Das added.  There are a lot of diseases all over the world in terms of humans, animals and plants diseases in which a phage can be a  green  solution. This technology   phage therapy technology   could be transferred to other economically important crops like coffee, bananas and olives.  Bhowmick, who d never seen a grapevine in her native India before accepting her post-doctoral position with AgriLife Research, said the phage technology is also promising for treating pathogens such as cholera that plague people in developing countries where there are no other solutions.  Phage research is not new, but until now no other laboratory had been able to isolate and propagate phage for Xylella. Our lab is the first to do it and show that phages can control Pierce s disease,  she said. Gonzalez said the phage cocktail is currently being field tested in Texas. The research was supported by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Ridge Vineyards.","Published: August 5, 2015"

The same goes for grant-funded researchers designing quantum information devices or micro-scale sensors to measure cell movement  which is where the Washington Nanofabrication Facility comes in. The WNF makes things that aren t practical, economical or possible to fabricate at commercial foundries   inconceivably tiny parts, chips made from unconventional materials that industrial factories won t touch, devices that probe the boundaries of our universe. Part of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network, the lab on the University of Washington campus is the largest publicly accessible nanofabrication facility north of Berkeley and west of Minneapolis.To serve growing demand for nanofabrication services, the UW Board of Regents has approved spending up to $37 million to renovate the facility, which is housed in Fluke Hall. The overhaul, scheduled to begin in November, will upgrade basic building systems and roughly double the amount of highly-specialized fabrication space that academics and entrepreneurs increasingly rely on to build innovative devices. The  fab lab  in Fluke Hall   currently used by 48 UW faculty members and 134 students   has supported $32 million in UW research grant funding this year. A third of its 223 users are with commercial companies, which range from multinational corporations to UW spinouts to minority-owned local start-ups. Regional demand for nanofabrication services is growing rapidly, with WNF revenues nearly tripling in the last four years. Since the UW started operating the Washington Nanofabrication Facility in 2011, its users have included:  The Washington Nanofabrication Facility is vital to my existence,  said Jevne Branden Micheau-Cunningham, who launched a new company called FLEXFORGE six months ago. He s using WNF equipment and expertise to manufacture nanoscale electronics with applications in the automotive, aerospace and medical devices industries.  It allows entrepreneurs such as myself to flesh out ideas and bring products to life   the costs to get up and running on my own would have been prohibitive,  said Micheau-Cunningham.  Nanofabrication is also a pretty specific thing, and they ve really looked over my shoulder throughout the process.  The WNF houses nearly 100 different pieces of equipment that perform everything from electron beam lithography and atomic layer deposition to plasma etching and wafer bonding. User fees paid by academic and non-university clients are invested back into the facility. Applications for the devices those tools enable range from tissue engineering and silicon photonics to semiconductor technologies and basic scientific research.  Fabrication is basically a repetitive sequence of steps where we add or subtract material to create the microsystems and devices that people ask for,  said WNF associate directorMichael Khbeis.  A lot of companies don t have fabrication experts, so we also do a lot of design assistance and handholding to take an idea or concept and engineer a process and turn it into a prototype.  The UW assumed ownership of the nonprofit nanofabrication facility in 2011, which was formerly run by the Washington Department of Commerce. Through private donations, grants, UW funding and corporate gifts, the lab has invested in excess of $8 million over the last four years to modernize tools and equipment. But the infrastructure in Fluke Hall, built in 1988, needs upgrades to meet basic safety and environmental standards and the highly specialized needs of nanofabrication users. The renovation, which will be done in three phases over 14 months to minimize downtime, will allow the lab to better control temperature, humidity and air quality inside the  clean room,  where unwelcome fluctuations can poison an entire production line.  One dust speck can damage a device if it s in the wrong place, so this renovation will make a major difference,  said WNF director Karl B hringer, a UW professor of electrical engineering and of bioengineering.  The other advantage will be having more space   usage and revenues have increased, and we are bursting at the seams.  By helping fledgling companies realize prototypes and develop scalable production processes, the WNF plays an important role in the region s innovation ecosystem. With funding from the Washington Research Foundation, the lab has awarded $140,000 in Microfabrication Commercialization Grants that help bridge the gap from academic or applied research to commercialization of micro-fabricated devices. So far, those grants have supported two UW spin-out companies.The nanofabrication lab also offers an undergraduate research program for students who spend up to three years learning how to calibrate and operate the highly sensitive and specialized equipment. This summer s program will include 20 UW undergrads, up from three in 2011. The electronics industry workforce that spurred the development of personal computers and mobile devices is aging and retiring; nationwide there is a shortage of engineers entering the workforce to backfill essential positions and skillsets. By training students in real-world challenges, the WNF s workforce development mission supports the future success of the U.S. tech industry.  When they leave here, they re highly sought-after in the semiconductor and electronics and aerospace worlds,  Khbeis said.  Every one of our students has multiple offers, and those companies are extremely happy to get them. ","Published: August 5, 2015"

The protein RGS2 can delay an egg's development into an embryo in order to allow time for sperm to arrive and merge with the egg in a healthy fertilization process. The embryo cannot survive without the male chromosomes. ""These findings show the critical role that the protein RGS2 plays in preserving the fertilizability of the ovulated egg,"" said Carmen Williams, M.D., Ph.D., lead researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the NIH. ""Other researchers have shown that RGS2 plays an important role in regulating heart function and blood pressure, but this is the first demonstration of the protein's significant role in fertilization."" Dr. Williams explained that the immature egg found in the ovary is not very good at rallying the necessary calcium signaling that is needed to respond to sperm. However, during the maturation process, the egg stores calcium, preparing it for fertilization. At fertilization, the sperm causes calcium to release within the egg, turning it into a developing embryo. The mouse study, published online in the journal Development, shows that during maturation the egg synthesizes RGS2, which suppresses calcium signaling. This safety mechanism ensures that the egg does not begin releasing calcium and start developing before the sperm arrives. Beginning development too early prevents the egg from merging with the sperm. The RGS2 protein is being looked at as a therapeutic target for hypertension and other heart ailments. ""Understanding the role RGS2 plays in reproduction is important when considering the possible benefits and side effects of any new treatments, as well as understanding the impact that toxins might have on human fertility,"" said Linda Birnbaum, Ph.D., director of NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program.","Published: August 5, 2015"

Both projects involve extensive collaborations within the UC system and with other academic medical centers in California, as well as patient advocates and companies in Silicon Valley and the biotech industry. They were selected by an expert review panel from a highly competitive group of proposals submitted by collaborative teams around the state. One of the winning proposals will harness big data bioinformatics to help doctors identify effective treatments for California children with cancer who fail to respond to standard therapies. The other will enable detection of all known pathogens with a single DNA sequencing test, to diagnose acute infections in hospitalized patients.  Both of these projects are developing exciting new tools that promise to deliver precision medicine tests and therapies to patients within a very short timeframe, as quickly as 18 months to two years,  said Atul Butte, MD, PhD, who directs UCSF s Institute for Computational Health Sciences and is heading the precision medicine initiative.  We hope the success of these first two projects will inspire others to support this initiative, so we can fund additional promising precision medicine projects to help patients.  A team led by David Haussler, PhD, a professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and Theodore Goldstein, PhD,a research associate at UC Santa Cruz, will develop a secure Internet-based networking system to match cancer therapies to individual children based on the genetic characteristics of their tumors. The California Kids Cancer Comparison will enable clinicians to sort through a much larger pool of genetic data than has previously been available, including tumor sequencing data from children throughout California and around the world, as well as from adults. It also will enable patients, their advocates, clinicians and researchers to upload, analyze and communicate genomic information and associated data through MedBook, a social media platform that maintains privacy and security for patients' data. The project includes investigators from UC Irvine, UCSF and Stanford University, as well as the University of Southern California, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, including UCLA and UCSD, UC Davis, Hyundai Cancer Institute at Children's Hospital of Orange County, Children s Hospital Philadelphia and the Translational Genomics Research Institute. The team includes such industry partners as NuMedii, Cisco Systems and DNAnexus. And it builds on the UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Childhood Cancer Project, which enables combined analysis of adult and pediatric cancer genomic data sets, including those generated by the National Cancer Institute s tumor genomics initiatives, as well as pediatric clinical sequencing trials. ""Our goal is simple: Every kid in California with cancer who needs a second chance, should get a second chance,"" Haussler said. ""Currently, too many kids are not getting the full advantage of complete genomic analysis of their tumors. If the standard treatment does not cure a child with cancer, then we need to be doing all that we possibly can to use genomic analysis to come up with an alternate therapy."" The effort requires collaboration between patients, families, clinicians, advocates, researchers and entrepreneurs, and the team has enlisted support from Unravel Pediatric Cancer, Jacob s Heart and Kids v Cancer. The second winning proposal was from a team led by Charles Chiu, MD, PhD, an associate professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF. It aims to use genetic sequencing to diagnose patients who are hospitalized with acute, potentially life-threatening infectious diseases. Chiu s lab developed a novel, powerful DNA sequencing scheme that can detect all pathogens   viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites   with a single test. The test has been shown to rapidly and accurately diagnose infections in a number of patients, and it was critical to saving the life of a 14-year-old boy with bacterial encephalitis. The initiative-funded demonstration project will now enable validation of the test at three UC medical centers in patients presenting with encephalitis, meningitis, sepsis or pneumonia. Genetic data from the tests will be integrated into patients  medical records, and an around-the-clock precision medicine consult team will be available to interpret results and guide treatment. Chiu s team includes investigators from UCSF, UC Davis, UC Berkeley and UCLA, and from such private companies as Syapse, DNAnexus, Quest Diagnostics and Google Genomics. The team hopes to make the test available to hospitals around the state and, eventually, the country. The state s contribution to the work is being leveraged by donations from the Sandler and the William F. Bowes, Jr., foundations.  Routine clinical testing fails to identify the cause of more than half of meningitis and encephalitis cases in the hospital,  Chiu said, adding that he gets 10 to 20 inquiries a week from doctors and patients who are urgently seeking a diagnosis.  That is why we are especially grateful to the California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine for providing us with the opportunity to bring sequencing for infectious diseases into the acute care setting. We need these tools now to make a difference for our sickest patients. The California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine, announced in April, is an important step toward enabling the state s scientists to study any disease and even the health care system itself, using data from across the UC health care system and other academic medical centers and health care providers throughout California. The goal is to integrate clinical data with genomic, environmental, socioeconomic, mobile and other data from patients so scientists can determine disease mechanisms and develop precise therapies. UC San Francisco is hosting the two-year initiative through UC Health with $3 million in startup funds from the state; $2.4 million of this, divided evenly between the two proposals, is funding the demonstration projects. The public-private initiative aims to leverage these funds with contributions from other academic and industry partners. The initiative will also inventory the public and private precision medicine assets in the state, and convene experts in medicine, technology, privacy, bioethics and intellectual property to help ensure the secure, fair and respectful exchange of data and knowledge.","Published: August 5, 2015"

BCM, also known as BioLineRx s BL-1040, is an investigational, implantable medical device being studied for the prevention of heart failure following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack. The 303-patient, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study showed no statistically significant difference between patients treated with BCM versus placebo for both the primary and the secondary endpoints. BL-1040 was licensed to Bellerophon, then known as Ikaria, in 2009. Prior to partnering the project, BioLineRx invested slightly over $10 million in the development of BL-1040. To date, BioLineRx has received a total of $17 million for this asset under the license agreement.  While we share in Bellerophon s disappointment with the BCM results, we believe BioLineRx s true value remains in our ability to advance our deep in-house pipeline of mid-late stage assets, including future programs under our strategic collaboration with Novartis, and in particular, our expanding BL-8040 oncology platform,  said Dr. Kinneret Savitsky, CEO of BioLineRx. Dr. Savitsky continued,  We are on track to report top-line data from our Phase 2 clinical study of BL-8040 for treating relapsed/refractory AML in Q4 2015. Results from the dose escalation phase of this study demonstrated potential best-in-class mobilization of cancer cells from the bone marrow, as well as significant induction of cancer cell death. Additionally, we reported positive safety and efficacy results from a Phase 1 study for BL-8040 as a novel stem cell mobilization treatment for transplantation. We expect to meet with the FDA in order to discuss our next steps in the clinical development program for this indication, including the design of a planned follow-up Phase 2 study. We are also in preparations to initiate three additional Phase 2 studies for BL-8040 in consolidation AML, in AML patients with the FLT3-ITD mutation, and for hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia. We eagerly anticipate reaching several key inflection points for our BL-8040 platform over the next 12 months, which we hope will add significant value for BioLineRx and our shareholders.  Dr. Savitsky continued,  We remain well capitalized to achieve our corporate and clinical goals through 2018. So while today s news is unfortunate, we believe it has minimal impact on our business as a whole and our plans going forward.

By leveraging their natural metabolic processes, bacteria could be re programmed to convert readily available sources of natural energy into pharmaceuticals, plastics and fuel products. ""The basic idea is that we want to accelerate evolution to make awesome amounts of valuable chemicals,"" said Wyss Core Faculty member George Church, Ph.D., who is a pioneer in the converging fields of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and genetics. Church is the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT.Critical to this process of metabolically engineering microbes is the use of biosensors. Made of a biological component   such as a fluorescent protein   and a 'detector' that responds to the presence of a specific chemical, biosensors act as the switches and levers that turn programmed functions on and off inside the engineered cells. They also can be used to detect which microbial 'workers' are producing the most voluminous amounts of a desired chemical. In this way, they can be thought of as the medium for two way communication between humans and cells. But so far, scientists have only had access to a limited variety of biosensors that have little relevance to the bio manufacturing of valuable chemicals. Now, Wyss Institute researchers led by Church have developed a new suite of such sensors that not only increase the number of cellular ""switches and levers"" that scientists can use for complex genetic re programming, but also respond to valuable products such as renewable plastics or costly pharmaceuticals and give microbes a voice to report on their own efficiency in making these products. ""We can communicate with cells much more effectively, and vice versa,"" said the study s first author Jameson Rogers, a graduate researcher at the Wyss Institute who is pursuing his Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences from Harvard University. ""If we compared this to controlling a computer, it s almost like we have only had the up and down arrows available to us, and now suddenly we have doubled our control capabilities by adding the left and right arrows as well."" The Wyss team aims to leverage the new biosensors to aid in its efforts to develop renewable chemical production strategies using genetically engineered microbes. Linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP), the biosensors can be used to trigger individual cells to give off visible fluorescence in a rate directly proportional to how well they are able to produce a desired chemical commodity. Using the new biosensors, the most efficient microbial workers are easily identified so that they can serve as the predecessors for colonies of engineered bacteria that evolve to become more efficient at producing renewable chemicals with each subsequent generation. This drastically reduces the bottleneck of the design build test cycle, which has historically been caused by engineers having to sift through teeming bacteria colonies to find top producers. The findings could also lead to new applications in environmental monitoring using genetically engineered microbes to issue warning signals in the presence of pollutants or toxins, and could unlock new fundamental insights into metabolic pathways. ""Our team is developing several different ways to make even more custom biosensors,"" said Church. ""We re trying to control biological processes and we need new ways to get our hands in at the molecular level   we re now reaching in deeper than we ve previously been able to, and we still have many interesting new approaches."" ""With this work, George and his team are bringing us closer to a sustainable future in which we would rely on bio manufacturing for the clean production of chemical and pharmaceutical commodities,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald E.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/nanoparticles-used-to-breach-mucus-barrier-in-lungs-201930,Nanoparticles Used to Breach Mucus Barrier in Lungs Proof of concept study conducted in mice is a key step toward better treatments for lung diseases   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil have designed a DNA-loaded nanoparticle that can pass through the mucus barrier covering conducting airways of lung tissue   proving the concept, they say, that therapeutic genes may one day be delivered directly to the lungs to the levels sufficient to treat cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and other life-threatening lung diseases.    To our knowledge, this is the first biodegradable gene delivery system that efficiently penetrates the human airway mucus barrier of lung tissue,  says study author Jung Soo Suk, Ph.D., a biomedical engineer and faculty member at the Center for Nanomedicine at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins.  The mucus barrier protects foreign materials and bacteria from entering and/or infecting lungs. In healthy lungs, inhaled matter is typically trapped in airway mucus and subsequently swept away from the lungs via beating activities of cilia, or small, hairlike strands, to the stomach to be eventually degraded. Unfortunately, Suk notes, this essential protective mechanism also prevents many inhaled therapeutics, including gene-based medicine, from reaching their target.   His team s experiments with human airway mucus and small animals, Suk adds, were designed as a proof-of-concept study demonstrating that placing corrective or replacement genes or drugs inside a man-made biodegradable nanoparticle  wrapper  that patients inhale could penetrate the mucus barrier and one day be used to treat serious lung disorders. What s more, because a single dose might theoretically last for several months, patients would experience fewer side effects common to drugs that must be taken regularly over long stretches of time.   Suk says their work with nanoparticles grew out of failed efforts to deliver treatments to people with lung diseases. In patients with CF, for instance, they experience a buildup of excess mucus caused by impaired ciliary beating, resulting in an ideal breeding ground for chronic bacterial infection and inflammation. This pathogenic process not only worsens patients  quality of life   and often puts patients in life-threatening situations   but it also makes the airway mucus harder to overcome by inhaled therapeutic nanoparticles.  Most of the existing drugs for CF help clear infections but do not solve the disease s underlying problems. A couple of recently approved drugs designed to target the underlying cause of CF require daily treatment for the entire lifetime and can benefit only a subpopulation of patients with specific types of mutations. Yet this study, Suk notes, has demonstrated that delivering normal copies of CF-related genes or corrective genes via the mucus-penetrating DNA-loaded nanoparticles could mediate production of normal,  functional  proteins long term. This could eventually become an effective therapy for the lungs of patients, regardless of the mutation type. To date, no one has been able to figure out how to efficiently deliver those genes to the lungs, Suk says, noting that experiments using deactivated viruses to carry them have proven inefficient and expensive, and could potentially lead to severe side effects. Moreover, the body could develop resistance to these virus-based delivery systems, rendering the delivery mechanism moot. Alternatively, numerous nonviral, synthetic systems have been widely tested. However, previous research had shown that most of the nonviral, DNA-loaded nanoparticles possess positive charge that caused them to adhere to negatively charged biological environments, in this case the mucus covering the lung airways. In other words, conventional nanoparticles are too sticky to avoid unwanted off-target interactions during their journey toward the target cells. Further, these particles tend to rapidly aggregate in physiological conditions, rendering them too large to penetrate the mesh of airway mucus. For its design, the team developed a simple method to densely coat the nanoparticles with a nonsticky polymer called PEG, neutralized the charge and created a nonsticky exterior. They showed that these nanoparticles retained their sizes at a physiological environment and are capable of rapidly penetrating human airway mucus freshly collected from patients visiting the Johns Hopkins Adult Cystic Fibrosis Program directed by Michael Boyle, a co-author of the paper. The team also made the whole delivery system biodegradable so that it would not build up inside the body. To test whether the system provides efficient gene transfer to the lungs of animals, the researchers packed them with a gene that makes light-generating proteins once delivered into the target cells. They demonstrated that inhaled delivery of the genes via the mucus-penetrating nanoparticles resulted in widespread production of the protein to levels superior to gold-standard, nonviral platforms, including a clinically tested system. In addition, they showed that the treated lungs lit up for up to four months after a single dosing.  With one dose, you can get gene expression   i.e., production of therapeutic proteins   for several months,  Suk says, adding that the nanoparticles did not appear to show any adverse effects, such as increased lung inflammation. Suk and his team caution that more animal studies are needed to confirm and refine their proof-of-concept study, and that treatment of human disorders with nanowrapped therapies is years away.","Published: August 5, 2015"

Unlike other cell types, such as heart cells, neurons, and cells found in the gut, previous attempts to efficiently and accurately derive muscle cells from precursor cells or culture have not been fruitful. In a new study investigators from Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women s Hospital (BWH) report that by identifying and mimicking important developmental cues, they have been able to drive cells to grow into muscle fibers, producing millimeter-long fibers capable of contracting in a dish and multiplying in large numbers. This new method of producing muscle cells could offer a better model for studying muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, and for testing potential treatment options.Previous studies have used genetic modification to create small numbers of muscle cells in the lab, but the researchers, led by investigators from BWH and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, wanted a technique that would allow them to grow large numbers of muscle cells efficiently for use in clinical applications.  We took the hard route: We wanted to recapitulate all of the early stages of muscle cell development that happen in the body and re-create that in a dish in the lab,  said corresponding author Olivier Pourquie of Harvard Medical School s Department of Genetics and BWH s Department of Pathology.  We analyzed each stage of early development, and generated cell lines that glowed green when they reached each stage. Going step by step, we managed to mimic each stage of development and coax cells toward muscle cell fate.  The team found that a combination of secreted factors that are important at early embryonic stages are also essential for stimulating differentiation   the specialization of stem cells into particular cell types   in the lab. Using just the right recipe for differentiation, the team was able to produce long, mature fibers in a dish, derived from mouse or human pluripotent stem cells. They also cultured stem cells from the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, observing the striking branched pattern that dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers show in the body. The research team also was able to produce more immature cells known as satellite cells that, when grafted into a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, produced muscle fibers. Further studies will be needed to determine if the new strategy could be optimized to develop cell therapies for treating degenerative diseases in humans. In addition to developing a better model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the new protocol also may be useful for studying other muscle diseases, such as sarcopenia (degenerative muscle loss), cachexia (wasting away of muscle associated with severe illness), and other muscular dystrophies.  This has been the missing piece: The ability to produce muscle cells in the lab could give us the ability to test out new treatments and tackle a spectrum of muscle diseases,  said Pourquie.","Published: August 5, 2015"

While 3DP has been used previously to manufacture medical devices, this approval marks the first time a drug product manufactured with this technology has been approved by the FDA.  By combining 3DP technology with a highly-prescribed epilepsy treatment,SPRITAM is designed to fill a need for patients who struggle with their current medication experience,  said Don Wetherhold, Chief Executive Officer of Aprecia.  This is the first in a line of central nervous system products Aprecia plans to introduce as part of our commitment to transform the way patients experience taking medication.  ZipDose Technology enables the delivery of a high drug load, up to 1,000 mg in a single dose. As a result, SPRITAM enhances the patient experience - administration of even the largest strengths of levetiracetam with just a sip of liquid. In addition, with SPRITAM there is no measuring required as each dose is individually packaged, making it easy to carry this treatment on the go. SPRITAM is expected to be available in the first quarter of 2016.  In my experience, patients and caregivers often have difficulty following a treatment regimen. Whether they are dealing with a swallowing disorder or the daily struggle of getting a child to take his or her medication, adherence can be a challenge,  said Marvin H. Rorick III, M.D., neurologist at Riverhills Neuroscience in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Especially for children and seniors, having an option for patients to take their medication as prescribed is important to managing this disease.   Nearly three million people in the United States have been diagnosed with active epilepsy, with an estimated 460,000 of those cases occurring in children.  Additionally, in a recent survey of people age 65 and older living in an independent living facility, 15 percent reported difficulty swallowing. Other chronic conditions can impair the ability to swallow, further exacerbating the problem.  While there are many reasons, including swallowing difficulties, for which patients may not take their medication as prescribed, missed doses of medication can undermine 2 treatment outcomes for conditions like epilepsy. Patients with poor adherence to epilepsy drugs are more likely to have a breakthrough seizure.

Lu s team demonstrated that fumarase accomplishes this through a process critical for gene regulation and expression known as histone methylation. Many cancers are thought to result from misregulated histone methylation. Another crucial component of the DNA repair process is DNA-PK, a protein kinase that governs DNA damage response, helping to assure genetic stability. The researchers defined how DNA-PK and fumarase interact to increase histone methylation, allowing for DNA repair and restoration of healthy cells.  We know that histone methylation regulates DNA repair, but the mechanisms underlying this repair has not been fully understood,  he said.  Our research revealed a  feedback  mechanism that underlies DNA-PK regulation by chromatin-associated fumarase and the function of this fumarase in regulating histone methylation and DNA repair.  This chain-of-event repair process occurs at the DSB regions and initiates a DNA damage  fix  by joining the tail ends of the double strand breaks. Increasingly, inhibition of DNA-PKs and fumarase are being looked at for its potential to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It is hoped a more thorough understanding about how they accomplish this can lead to new approaches to cancer treatment. Dr. Lu s group previously reported that another metabolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) acts as a protein kinase in regulation of the Warburg effect, a process by which cancer cells produce energy, as well for regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression.  Our new findings on fumarase s role in DNA repair further demonstrate that metabolic enzymes can possess non-metabolic functions in crucial cellular activities of cancer cells,  said Lu.","Published: August 5, 2015"

The ability of environmental factors to promote epigenetic inheritance that subsequently promotes genetic mutations is a significant advance in our understanding of how the environment impacts disease and evolution,  they write. Skinner is a pioneer in the field of epigenetics, which looks at the effect of changes in how genetic information is passed between generations even if DNA remains unchanged. Earlier work by Skinner has found epigenetic effects from a host of environmental toxicants, connecting plastics, pesticides, fungicide, dioxin and hydrocarbons to diseases and abnormalities as many as three generations later. His recent study exposed gestating female rats to the fungicide vinclozolin. Sperm in the first generation of male offspring showed epimutations, or alterations in the methyl groups that stick to DNA and affect its activation. Third generation, or great-grand offspring, had increased genetic mutations, which the researchers saw in increased DNA structure changes known as copy-number variations. Multiple generations of control animals had no such variations. This, said Skinner, suggests that environment has a more important role in mutations, disease and evolution than previously appreciated, and appears to be one of the main drivers of intergenerational changes, not simply a passive component. In short, Skinner and his colleagues say, the environment and epigenetics can drive genetics.  There s not a type of genetic mutation known that s not potentially influenced by environmental epigenetic effects,  Skinner said.","Published: August 5, 2015"

HIV/AIDS is an epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa and, until now, we ve been really focused on treating people who already have the disease. But to stem the epidemic, we also need to prevent new infections,  said Urvi Parikh, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at Pitt and senior project advisor.  It is truly amazing to turn years of research in HIV prevention into action helping people in the real world.  Roughly 25 million people have HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for nearly 70 percent of the global total. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral (ARV)-based microbicides help prevent new HIV infections through a regimen of daily pills, a monthly vaginal ring that slowly releases medication or a medicated gel used before and after sex. A concern with widespread use of PrEP and ARV-based microbicides is that if a person becomes infected while on PrEP or microbicides, a strain of HIV could arise that resists drugs needed for treatment in the future. The resistant strain could then be spread to others.   The Pitt-led team is starting the project by analyzing laboratory data and previous research to create computer models and simulations that will balance the cost and inconvenience of testing with the risk of resistance to provide optimal testing recommendations, whether once a month, once every few months or once a year. These findings will be presented to stakeholders in Africa, including the community leaders, doctors and health policy professionals who will be involved in implementing the prophylactic treatment effort. In the third year, the team will provide finalized recommendations for HIV testing and then work with USAID and other groups, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, to implement recommendations in regions where PrEP and microbicides are distributed. Finally, the team will train local clinics in using low-cost tests to detect drug resistance so data can continue to be collected and guide future HIV prevention initiatives.  Through this carefully crafted, step-by-step process, we ll be able to provide critical data to develop cost-effective and appropriate HIV diagnostic and resistance testing and monitoring plans. As a result, we should be able to stay on top of any drug resistance that arises from antiretrovirals implemented for HIV prevention,  said John W. Mellors, M.D., chief of Pitt s Division of Infectious Diseases and project director.","Published: August 5, 2015"

Every year 140 children are diagnosed with cerebral palsy in Quebec. It has historically been considered to be caused by factors such as birth asphyxia, stroke and infections in the developing brain of babies. In a new game-changing Canadian study, a research team from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC) has uncovered strong evidence for genetic causes of cerebral palsy that turns experts  understanding of the condition on its head. The study could have major implications on the future of counselling, prevention and treatment of children with cerebral palsy.  Our research suggests that there is a much stronger genetic component to cerebral palsy than previously suspected,  says the lead study author Dr. Maryam Oskoui, Paediatric neurologist at The Montreal Children s Hospital (MCH) of the MUHC, co-director of the Canadian Cerebral Palsy Registry and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Paediatrics and Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University.  How these genetic factors interplay with other established risk factors remains to be fully understood. For example, two newborns exposed to the same environmental stressors will often have very different outcomes. Our research suggests that our genes impart resilience, or conversely a susceptibility to injury.  Children with cerebral palsy have difficulties in their motor development early on, and often have epilepsy and learning, speech, hearing and visual impairments. Two out of every thousand births are affected by cerebral palsy with a very diverse profile; some children are mildly affected while others are unable to walk on their own or communicate. Genetic testing is not routinely done or recommended, and genetic causes are searched for only in rare occasions when other causes cannot be found. The research team performed genetic testing on 115 children with cerebral palsy and their parents from the Canadian Cerebral Palsy Registry, many of which had other identified risk factors. They found that 10 per cent of these children have copy number variations (CNVs) affecting genes deemed clinically relevant. In the general population such CNVs are found in less than one per cent of people. CNVs are structural alterations to the DNA of a genome that can be present as deletions, additions, or as reorganized parts of the gene that can result in disease.  When I showed the results to our clinical geneticists, initially they were floored,  says Dr. Stephen Scherer, Principal Investigator of the study and Director of The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) at SickKids.  In light of the findings, we suggest that genomic analyses be integrated into the standard of practice for diagnostic assessment of cerebral palsy.  The study also demonstrates that there are many different genes involved in cerebral palsy.  It s a lot like autism, in that many different CNVs affecting different genes are involved which could possibly explain why the clinical presentations of both these conditions are so diverse,  says Scherer, who is also Director of the University of Toronto McLaughlin Centre.  Interestingly, the frequency of de novo, or new, CNVs identified in these patients with cerebral palsy is even more significant than some of the major CNV autism research from the last 10 years.

Scientists say their findings could aid the earlier diagnosis of prion diseases -- which include variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows. In people, the disease remains very rare -- 229 people have died from vCJD since it was first identified almost 20 years ago, of which 177 were from the UK. Prions are infectious proteins with abnormal shapes that can be passed between people and animals by eating contaminated meat. Until now, it was not known how prions spread from the gut to the brain after consuming infected meat. Researchers at University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute studied the course of prion infection in mice. They found that prions must first build up in specialized structures in the lining of the small intestine before they are able to spread throughout the body to the brain. The structures -- called Peyer's patches -- are part of the body's immune system and form the first line of defense against contaminated food. The study suggests prions hijack Peyer's patches to cause infection. Prions did not build up in similar patches in the large intestine until a later stage of infection, the team found. At this stage, prions were also detected in the spleen and lymph nodes. As many as one in 2000 people in the UK could be carrying infectious prions without showing any symptoms of disease, according to recent estimates. These are based on analysis of tissue taken during routine appendix removal operations. The researchers say that these estimates may fail to identify individuals in the earliest stages of infection, where prions have not yet spread beyond the small intestine. When prions get into the brain, they destroy nerve cells. This can lead to major neurological symptoms including memory impairment, personality changes, and difficulties with movement. Other prion diseases include scrapie in sheep and chronic wasting disease in deer. Professor Neil Mabbott, of The Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, who led the study, said: ""Whether all individuals with evidence of prion infection in their gut go on to develop neurological disease is not known. We need a greater understanding of what factors enhance our susceptibility to prion diseases so that we can put in place safeguards to prevent these conditions from spreading in people and farmed animals.""

This work is published in Molecular Psychiatry. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which affect 7.6 million people according to the World Health Organization, is a major challenge. Characterized by heterogeneous symptoms and a multifactorial origin, this complex condition evolves during brain development. The scientists thus chose to study adult olfactory stem cells as indicators of the early stages of ontogenesis in order to determine new genes involved in this disease.  Easily accessible from nasal biopsies, these cells - which belong to nerve tissues and can differentiate into neurons - constitute an interesting model to identify the genes and proteins whose expression is deregulated in patients with ASD.  The team discovered that the gene coding for the MOCOS (Molybdenum Cofactor Sulfurase) enzyme was under-expressed in stem cells from nine out of eleven of the ASD adults studied. This under-expression was particularly interesting because although hundreds of genes have already been identified for their presumed roles in autistic disorders, each one alone can at best only explain 1% of cases. Until now, the MOCOS protein was known for its role in purine metabolism, which notably leads to the production of uric acid. Through its involvement in this chemical pathway, MOCOS is thought to be active in the processes of immunity and inflammation, as well as in the destruction of free radicals, but until now it was not known to play a role at the cerebral level. The initial findings of the study nevertheless suggest that this enzyme may have other, as yet unknown, functions, so the scientists focused on the consequences of a deregulation of MOCOS synthesis. The analysis of different tissues demonstrated MOCOS expression in the brain cells and intestine of several species, and notably the C. elegans worm and mammals. In these different organisms, under-expression of the enzyme induced hypersensitivity to oxidative stress (i.e. to the toxicity of free radicals), a smaller number of synapses and abnormal neurotransmission due to a reduction in the number of vesicles carrying neurotransmitters. In view of the presence of MOCOS in many organs and its involvement in numerous biological and neurobiological functions, its dysfunction clearly corresponds to the heterogeneity of the symptoms that affect patients with ASD. The involvement of this enzyme in susceptibility to oxidative stress, which has frequently been observed in autistic children, its association with gastrointestinal diseases - which often accompany autistic disorders - and its role in nerve development and neurotransmission mean it is an ideal candidate for deregulation of its expression to lead to the abnormal brain development observed in ASD. The aim now is to identify the molecules that regulate expression of this gene upstream, and those that interact with the enzyme, to understand their modes of action and determine how normal MOCOS expression could be restored. The possible involvement of this protein in other functions also needs to be clarified. The laboratory where this discovery was made is now planning to study mice presenting with defective MOCOS expression in order to analyze how the enzyme and its regulators influence the development of the nervous system. This new study should help to shed light on how the brains of ASD patients establish abnormal connections, while revealing new clinical and biological disturbances in these patients. This work therefore opens new pathways for research and provides an opportunity to understand the roles of MOCOS and its regulators. This should, in the longer term, lead to the development of therapeutic tools and new diagnostic methods. CNRS   press release Erar-Garcia M et al.

We know from studies on jet lag and night shifts that metabolism how bodies use energy from food is linked to the body s circadian rhythms. These rhythms, regular daily fluctuations in mental and bodily functions, are communicated and carried out via signals sent from the brain and liver. Light and dark signals guide circadian rhythms, but it appears that microbes have a role to play as well. All humans have a set of bacteria, viruses and fungi living in our guts, called the gut microbiome, which helps us digest food and also interacts with the body in a number of other ways: there is evidence they affect allergies, mental health, weight and other metabolic conditions. Researchers found that mice with a normal set of gut microbes showed evidence of a regular daily microbial cycle, with different species flourishing in different parts of the day and producing different compounds as a result. These compounds appear to act on the liver they affected how circadian clock genes were expressed in the liver. A high-fat diet reduced the variation in the microbial cycle; the circadian clock genes were disrupted, and the mice gained weight. Meanwhile,  germ-free  mice raised without a normal gut microbiome showed evidence of a disrupted circadian clock cycle, but did not gain weight even on a high-fat diet.  The researchers hypothesize that high-fat diets change the compounds that microbes produce, thus disrupting the liver s circadian clock signaling.  The earlier explanation for microbiome-related weight gain was that some bacteria make calories from food more available to your body, but this is a fundamental alternative explanation,  said Jack Gilbert, an Argonne microbial ecologist who co-authored the study.  Next, Gilbert said,  we d like to more rigorously explore what kinds of diets trigger this response.

The chemical ""freezes"" the cancer cells within the sample, allowing physicians to look at the disease and plan a specific course of treatment. The process, however, coats the genetic material within the tissue, making it difficult to apply next-generation genetic analysis that could reveal better, personalized therapies. Now, a team of Stanford chemists and physicians has developed a technique that significantly improves the recovery of genetic material from those samples. ""Pathologists used to just look at tissues under a microscope, so it didn't matter that formaldehyde was there,"" said Eric Kool, a professor of chemistry at Stanford and senior author on the study. ""The trend now is to treat people based on their genetic situation, and the problem is, the formaldehyde gets in the way of this. We've found a way to reverse the process."" Scientists and physicians are eager to know both the quantity and sequence of RNA   the genetic material responsible for coding proteins   within a tissue sample, as this information can greatly improve the diagnosis of the disease. This in turn can inform the best route of treatment and lead to better and more accurate prognoses. For instance, one genetic variation of a particular type of cancer might respond well to a specific drug therapy, while another fares better with radiation. When the formaldehyde ""fixes"" the tissue, it bonds tightly to the RNA. The most effective means of removing the formaldehyde, however, involves heating the sample, which has undesirable effects. ""Heat destroys RNA faster than it removes formaldehyde,"" Kool said. ""What little we can recover from the sample is difficult to read."" Kool and his colleagues specialize in RNA and DNA chemistry, and they developed catalyst molecules that could operate at mild temperatures to selectively break the bonds between the formaldehyde and RNA, leaving the genetic material free and undamaged. The approach, Kool said, could conceivably be used to process any tissue sample. Formaldehyde presents the same challenges with rescuing DNA and proteins from samples, so Kool and his colleagues are now investigating whether a similar catalyst-based approach could improve the recovery of those molecules as well.","Published: August 4, 2015"

With 92 million new cases of Chlamydia worldwide and over 200,000 new cases in the UK per year, Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in the world. Symptoms can be serious including pelvic inflammatory disease that can lead to infertility and, in children infected by their mothers, even blindness. According to Dr Ted Fj llman, CEO of Prokarium,  the new vaccine uses synthetic biology to make the first safe and effective Chlamydia vaccine since the 1960s when conventional methods revealed unacceptable side effects and clinical efforts were abandoned. We have produced a carrier in the form of a re-engineered strain of Salmonella containing the blueprint for the vaccine. It will be taken orally and as it enters through the person s gut lining it is naturally engulfed by the body s own immune cells and only then triggered to produce the active vaccine exactly where it is needed and without side effects in other parts of the body. This is a uniquely suitable solution and has already raised interest from big pharmaceutical companies.  Dr Steve Chambers, CEO of SynbiCITE, explained that the new Prokarium vaccine was selected for funding because  the need for a Chlamydia vaccine is significant and the potential for this approach both for Chlamydia and as a model for treating other infections in the medium-term is very encouraging.  A National Chlamydia Screening Programme report[1] shows NHS spending of  45 per person on screening for Chlamydia and it is expected that a mass vaccination programme for 10-14 year olds would cost significantly less. Dr Steve Chatfield, Chairman of Prokarium and former Executive Director of the UK Health Protection Agency, says:  This SynbiCITE funding allows us to test a vaccine against the one of the world s most serious sexually transmitted infections. This endeavour, amongst others, has also enabled us to attract Dr Allan Jarvis, former Vice President of Corporate Development of Sanofi Pasteur to Prokarium s Board of Directors. Prokarium is now well set up to work with the best of the best in the vaccine arena. ","Published: August 4, 2015"

Melanoma rates in the US have been rising rapidly over the last 30 years, and although scientists have managed to identify key risk factors, melanoma's modus operandi has eluded the world of medical research. If melanoma is caught in time, it can be removed and the patient's life saved. But once melanoma invades the bloodstream, turning metastatic, an aggressive treatment must be applied. When and how the transformation into aggressive invasion took place was until now a mystery. ""To understand melanoma, I had to obtain a deep understanding about the structure and function of normal skin,"" said Dr. Levy, ""Melanoma is a cancer that originates in the epidermis, and in its aggressive form it will invade the dermis, a lower layer, where it eventually invades the bloodstream or lymph vessels, causing metastasis in other organs of the body. But before invading the dermis, melanoma cells surprisingly extend upward, then switch directions to invade. ""It occurred to me that there had to be a trigger in the microenvironment of the skin that made the melanoma cells 'invasive,'"" Dr. Levy continued. ""Using the evolutionary logic of the tumor, why spend the energy going up when you can just use your energy to go down and become malignant?"" After collecting samples of normal skin cells and melanoma cells from patients at hospitals around Israel, the researchers mixed normal and cancerous cells and performed gene analysis expression to study the traveling cancer's behavior. They found that, completely independently of any mutation acquisition, the microenvironment alone drove melanoma metastasis. ""Normal skin cells are not supposed to 'travel,'"" said Dr. Levy. ""We found that when melanoma is situated at the top layer, a trigger sends it down to the dermis and then further down to invade blood vessels. If we could stop it at the top layer, block it from invading the bloodstream, we could stop the progression of the cancer."" The researchers found that the direct contact of melanoma cells with the remote epidermal layer triggered an invasion via the activation of ""Notch signaling,"" which turns on a set of genes that promotes changes in melanoma cells, rendering them invasive. According to the study, when a molecule expressed on a cell membrane a spike on the surface of a cell, called a ligand comes into contact with a melanoma cell, it triggers the transformation of melanoma into an invasive, lethal agent. ""When I saw the results, I jumped out of the room and shouted, 'We got it!'"" Dr. Levy said. ""Now that we know the triggers of melanoma transformation and the kind of signalling that leads to that transformation, we know what to block. The trick was to solve the mystery, and we did. There are many drugs in existence that can block the Notch signalling responsible for that transformation. Maybe, in the future, people will be able to rub some substance on their skin as a prevention measure."" Dr. Levy is continuing to explore the research with the end goal of providing medical professionals with another tool of analysis of different stages of melanoma. ""Melanoma is a cancer with a very long gestation period,"" said Dr. Levy. ""If you can provide a simple kit with precise answers, you can catch it at the beginning stage and hopefully save lives.""","Published: August 4, 2015"

Dr Tatjana Crnogorac-Jurcevic's group has shown that the three-protein  signature  can both identify the most common form of pancreatic cancer when still in its early stages  - and distinguish between this cancer and the inflammatory condition chronic pancreatitis, which can be hard to tell apart. The study was funded by the UK charity, the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund. It looked at 488 urine samples: 192 from patients known to have pancreatic cancer, 92 from patients with chronic pancreatitis and 87 from healthy volunteers.  A further 117 samples from patients with other benign and malignant liver and gall bladder conditions were used for further validation. Around 1500 proteins were found in the urine samples, with approximately half being common to both male and female volunteers. Of these, three proteins - LYVE1, REG1A and TFF1 - were selected for closer examination, based on biological information and performance in statistical analysis. Patients with pancreatic cancer were found to have increased levels of each of the three proteins when compared to urine samples from healthy patients, while patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis had significantly lower levels than cancer patients. When combined, the three proteins formed a robust panel that can detect patients with stages I-II pancreatic cancer with over 90 per cent accuracy. With few specific symptoms even at a later stage of the disease, more than 80 per cent  of people with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed when the cancer has already spread. This means they are not eligible for surgery to remove the tumour - currently the only potentially curative treatment.  The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is the lowest of any common cancer, standing at 3 per cent. This figure has barely improved in 40 years. There is no early diagnostic test available. Lead researcher, Dr Tatjana Crnogorac-Jurcevic, said:  We ve always been  keen to develop a diagnostic test in urine as it has several advantages over using blood. It s an inert and far less complex fluid than blood and can be repeatedly and non-invasively tested. It took a while to secure proof of principle funding in 2008 to look at biomarkers in urine, but it s been worth the wait for these results. This is a biomarker panel with  good specificity and sensitivity  and we re hopeful that a simple, inexpensive test can be developed and be in clinical use within the next few years.  Although there is no universal cause of pancreatic cancer, people at higher risk of developing the disease include those with a family history of pancreatic cancer, heavy smokers, the obese and people over 50 years with new-onset diabetes. The team is hoping to conduct further tests on urine samples from people in high risk groups, to further validate the study findings. Dr Crnogorac-Jurcevic is also keen to access samples of urine  collected from volunteers over a period of 5-10 years. By examining samples from donors who went on to develop pancreatic cancer, this  longitudinal  information will allow the researchers  to see if the 3-biomarker signature is present  during the latency period   the time between the genetic changes that will cause the cancer to develop and the clinical presentation.   For a cancer with no early stage symptoms, it s a huge challenge to diagnose pancreatic cancer sooner, but if we can, then we can make a big difference to survival rates,  says co-author and Director of Barts Cancer Institute, Professor Nick Lemoine.  With pancreatic cancer, patients are usually diagnosed when the cancer is already at a  terminal stage, but if diagnosed at stage 2, the survival rate is 20 per cent, and at stage 1, the survival rate for patients with very small tumours can increase up to 60 per cent.  CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund, Maggie Blanks, said:  This is an exciting finding and we hope to see this research taken forward into a much needed early diagnostic test.  Early diagnosis is an important part of our overall efforts against this aggressive cancer, alongside developing new treatments to tackle the disease once diagnosis is made. It underlines the importance of increased research efforts to help improve survival rates.  Many of the urine samples from healthy individuals tested by Tanja s team were donated from the charity s own supporter community, and I know they will be extremely proud that they have directly contributed to research progress in ways that go beyond traditional financial support.

This acquisition further strengthens Shire s late-stage pipeline, has a clear strategic fit with lifitegrast, which is in late-stage development for treatment of dry eye disease, another ocular surface condition, and further demonstrates Shire s commitment to building a leadership position in ophthalmics.  With the acquisition of Foresight Biotherapeutics, Shire demonstrates its commitment to eye care while advancing its strategy of addressing high unmet medical need through transformative treatments for rare diseases and specialty medicines,  said Flemming Ornskov, M.D., CEO, Shire.  Ophthalmics is a highly-attractive growth area for Shire and this acquisition allows us to strengthen our presence in this therapeutic area. It is highly synergistic with the planned lifitegrast commercial structure. FST-100 and lifitegrast, if approved, would address two of the leading reasons people seek eye care treatment.  Michael Weiser, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Foresight Biotherapeutics, added:  We re excited about the potential benefits of FST-100 for patients and the physicians who care for them. In our discussions with experts in the field, we ve heard their enthusiasm for the possibility of a treatment that could reduce inflammation while killing virus and bacteria without the risk of unnecessary antibiotic use. We re pleased that Shire has committed to moving this program forward in development, so FST-100 might become an important treatment option for patients with either viral or bacterial conjunctivitis.  Currently no therapy exists to resolve both clinical signs and symptoms and eradicate adenovirus, which is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis. Approximately 50 percent of infectious conjunctivitis cases have a viral etiology, and 65 to 90 percent of these are caused by adenovirus. Viral conjunctivitis is highly infectious and transmissible, causing lost work and school days as well as increased healthcare costs and risks from unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.There are 5.9 million cases of infectious conjunctivitis annually in the United States and approximately 5.4 million cases in the EU annually. If approved by regulatory agencies, FST-100 has the potential to become the first agent to treat both viral and bacterial conjunctivitis. This is important as it is frequently difficult to ascertain the etiology of the condition based on clinical presentation.  As a researcher and clinician, I know first-hand the significant unmet patient need for an effective treatment for infectious conjunctivitis as well as the challenges associated with treating this condition, so I m excited about the potential of FST-100,  said Edward Holland, M.D., Director, Cornea Services at the Cincinnati Eye Institute and Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Cincinnati.  I m also pleased to know that Shire, with its research and commercial expertise, will further develop FST-100 with the goal of bringing it to market as a treatment option for this significant clinical problem."" Shire has acquired the global rights to FST-100 and will evaluate an appropriate regulatory filing strategy for additional markets outside the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, Shire will make a cash payment of $300 million to complete the acquisition of Foresight Biotherapeutics. The phase 2 proof-of-concept efficacy and safety clinical trial program for FST-100 involved two studies in adenoviral conjunctivitis   one three-arm study and another two-arm pilot study. While the two-arm study showed a trend toward efficacy, there were too few subjects testing positive for a viral presence for the study to deliver meaningful results, and it was not statistically significant. In the three-arm study, patients were randomized to receive FST-100, PVP-I or vehicle four times daily for five days. Patients treated with FST-100 showed a statistically significant improvement in rates of clinical cure and viral eradication vs. vehicle at Day 6 (30.6% vs. 6.4%, p=0.0033). In the same trial, there was a trend toward clinical significance for FST-100 versus PVP-I (30.6% vs.18.0%, p=0.1432). The most common treatment emergent adverse events were corneal infiltrates (19%), punctate keratitis (22.4%) and eyelid edema (12.1%). The phase 2 clinical data formed the basis of a meeting with the FDA, in which Foresight Biotherapeutics discussed the path forward to conduct a phase 3 clinical development program for FST-100 as a potential treatment for adenoviral conjunctivitis. Upon close of the transaction, Shire will take responsibility for the final development and implementation for the phase 3 clinical program for FST-100, to also include investigation for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Foresight Biotherapeutics conducted pre-clinical experiments evaluating bacterial killing speed of FST-100 against pathogens that may cause bacterial conjunctivitis, and the resulting data support further exploration. In May 2014, Shire established its Ophthalmics Business Unit, solidifying its commitment to growing in this therapeutic area. Shire s multi-faceted approach to discovery, development, and delivery in both rare diseases and specialty conditions includes our efforts to address unmet needs in eye care. Shire s growth in ophthalmics has been driven by a combination of strategic acquisitions and organic growth. The Company is focused on continuing to expand the ophthalmics portfolio to include treatment options for rare diseases and those for anterior and posterior eye conditions. Acquisitions in the last two years include SARcode Bioscience, Premacure AB, and BIKAM Pharmaceuticals, which has helped bolster Shire s early-, mid- and late-stage ophthalmics pipeline. The Company currently has an ophthalmics pipeline of investigational products in dry eye, retinopathy of prematurity, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and now adenoviral and bacterial conjunctivitis. The acquisition of Foresight Biotherapeutics positions Shire to potentially become a leader in providing treatments for ocular surface conditions, which encompass dry eye disease and infectious conjunctivitis.","Published: August 4, 2015"

This molecule   called arginase - creates a huge dip in the level of arginine found in the area around the tumour. As soon as the body s immune cells get close to the cancer, the sudden lack of their favourite energy source makes them lethargic and ineffective. Neuroblastoma cells have a molecule on their surface that marks them out as different from healthy cells. This had led to hopes that the immune system might be trained to recognise and destroy them. But this new research may explain why early attempts to harness the immune system in this way have so far been unsuccessful. Dr Francis Mussai, study author at the University of Birmingham, said:  We ve known for a while that harnessing the power of the immune system could be an effective way to treat neuroblastoma. But we didn t know why the immune cells were having such difficulty recognising and destroying the tumour.  Armed with this new knowledge about the role of arginine, we may be able to activate the immune system to attack cancer cells.  Dr Carmela De Santo, co-study author at the University of Birmingham, said:  Now the challenge is to develop new drugs which stop neuroblastoma from using arginine, and may make immune therapy more effective.  Around 90 cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the UK, mostly in children under five years old. Eleanor Barrie, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said:  These findings could have huge implications for treating neuroblastoma. Better understanding the role of arginine could help us to boost the body s immune cells and we hope this could lead to more effective treatments.  We recently launched Cancer Research UK Kids and Teens as part of our commitment to bringing forward the day when no young lives are lost to cancer. Our target is to find more cures and kinder treatments for children with the disease so that, in the future, every child with cancer can go on to live a long and healthy life.

It also enables Isis Pharmaceuticals to extend use of its antisense technology to diseases of the kidney. Antisense drugs are short, chemically-modified, single-stranded nucleic acids (antisense oligonucleotides) that have the ability to target any gene product of interest. They offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention because they act inside the cell to influence protein production by targeting RNA to either prevent the production of disease-causing proteins, increase the production of proteins deficient in disease, or target toxic RNAs that are unable to generate proteins. AstraZeneca will pay an upfront fee of $65 million to Isis Pharmaceuticals plus development and regulatory milestones for each programme that AstraZeneca advances to clinical development. Isis Pharmaceuticals is also eligible to earn tiered double-digit royalties on annual net sales for each programme. Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicines & Early Development at AstraZeneca, said:  Antisense-based therapies are rapidly gaining momentum in the clinic and becoming an important component of our early stage pipeline. This collaboration combines the world-class antisense drug research capabilities of Isis with our expertise in cardiovascular, metabolic and renal disease drug discovery and development. By working together we aim to uncover targets and pathways that can be manipulated using antisense drug therapy.  B.

This new collaboration will help broaden the application of our antisense technology to targets in the kidney. AstraZeneca is committed to finding novel best-in-class therapies for some of the largest, most complex and fastest growing disease segments in the developed world. Combining our antisense technology with AstraZeneca s strong knowledge, leadership and commitment in these areas should be very valuable in fully exploiting these opportunities and moving new therapies effectively and efficiently toward the market.

Using an ultra-sensitive technology, researchers   led by NIH Lasker Clinical Research Scholar and Chief of NINR s Brain Injury Unit, Tissue Injury Branch Jessica Gill, Ph.D., R.N.,   were able to measure levels of the protein, tau, in the blood months and years after individuals (in this case, military personnel) had experienced TBI. They found that these elevated levels of tau   a protein known to have a role in the development of Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease   are associated with chronic neurological symptoms, including post-concussive disorder (PCD), during which an individual has symptoms such as headache and dizziness in the weeks and months after injury. These chronic neurological symptoms have been linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)   progressive brain degeneration that leads to dementia following repetitive TBIs   independent of other factors such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   Our study was limited to identifying the effects of tau accumulation in military personnel who experienced long-term neurological symptoms after a TBI. With further study, our findings may provide a framework for identifying patients who are most at risk for experiencing chronic symptoms related to TBI. Identifying those at risk early in the progression of the disease provides the best opportunity for therapies that can lessen the cognitive declines that may result from these long-term effects,  said Dr. Gill, the study s lead author. About one-third of all U.S. military personnel who serve in combat operations experience at least one TBI. Individuals with TBI are more likely to experience ongoing complications such as PCD, PTSD, and depression and are also more likely to develop CTE   however, there is currently no way to identify those who are at greatest risk for developing these chronic symptoms. To help identify biomarkers to better pinpoint those at-risk, the researchers explored whether elevated levels of tau are related to chronic neurological symptoms in military personnel who had experienced TBI.  The work of Dr. Gill and colleagues has demonstrated that tau plays a continuing role in TBI and highlights its significant effects on long-term health and quality of life,  said NINR Director Patricia A. Grady, Ph.D., R.N. Tau is released from nerve cells, and is the protein that helps provide structural support to the axonal cytoskeleton   the framework that helps control the growth of the brain s neurons. Elevated levels of tau are a known sign of axonal injury   a serious type of TBI in which the brain s neurons are unable to communicate with other parts of the body, often leading to coma   and can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood immediately following a severe TBI. Levels of tau in the blood can be elevated in the hours and days following an injury, but were thought to return to normal levels within the months following a TBI. Included in the study were military personnel, with or without a history of TBI, who had been deployed for combat in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom within the previous 18 months. The researchers examined participant medical records as well as responses to the Warrior Administered Retrospective Casualty Assessment Tool to determine if participants had been diagnosed with or treated for a TBI. A total of 70 military personnel with a history of TBI and 28 without a history of TBI were enrolled in the study. Researchers used standard assessments to measure PTSD, depression, and other neurological and psychological symptoms among participants. Additionally, researchers took blood samples from each participant. The researchers also linked the physical PCD symptoms that can persist after TBI to elevated levels of tau, independent of other psychological symptoms such as PTSD and depression. These findings suggest that long after the primary brain injury, tau accumulations alone may contribute to chronic neurological symptoms. Tau concentrations in the blood of patients who experience chronic symptoms or negative effects of TBI have proven difficult to measure. Because of this difficulty, tau s role in chronic complications following TBI has been unclear. The investigators hoped that by using a new, ultrasensitive immunoassay technology, they could more easily measure the protein and clarify its role in long-term complications of TBI. The technology s increased sensitivity (it is about 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional methods of measurement) allowed researchers to accurately measure levels of tau in participants  blood, finding elevated tau levels in the blood samples of these military participants with a history of TBI compared with participants who had never suffered a TBI. Additionally, researchers found that participants with three or more deployment-related TBIs had significantly higher levels of tau compared with participants who had fewer TBIs. Knowledge of the relationship of tau accumulation to chronic complications related to TBI may also someday provide a therapeutic target for treating the causes of CTE and other neurodegenerative and psychological conditions that can result from these types of injury.  It s possible that further research could examine methods to reduce the accumulation of tau and discover ways to mitigate or eliminate associated chronic neurological symptoms,  noted Dr. Grady.","Published: August 4, 2015"

The polymer chemist Prof. Dr. Prasad Shastri, core member of the cluster of excellence BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, and the BIOSS graduate Jon Christensen, in collaboration with the biomedical researcher Dr. Daniel Vonwil from the University of Freiburg, have visualized and quantified the growth and composition of breast tumours over time in a living animal. Diagnosing and treating tumours remains one of the grand challenges of medicine in the 21st century. For the translation of laboratory findings into human patients, animal models play a critical role. O ne way to visualize internal structures in living systems is to use light to selectively illuminate certain tissue, and analyse the reflected light to determine the structure. In such light-based imaging techniques, fluorophores - used as dyes - provide specificity and contrast, to distinguish one tissue from the other and to delineate specific tissue components. The researchers from the University of Freiburg engineered breast cancer cells to express E2-Crimson - a protein that absorbs light in the far-red spectrum - and then grew these cells in a living system to form tumours. The scientists achieved the visualization of the tumour in real-time by illuminating the tumour expressing E2-Crimson with near infrared light followed by reconstruction of the tumour image using fluorescence molecular tomography. This enabled them to make two important findings: During the first four weeks of tumour development, the tumour volume increased not due to the increase in the tumour cells but due to the support matrix they were synthesizing. After four weeks, however, the tumour underwent a dramatic increase in the number of tumour cells. These new findings and the ability to provide visual and quantitative information on phases of tumour growth is important for selection of treatments and delivery of cancer drugs in the future.","Published: August 4, 2015"

The results of a proof-of-concept study suggest that lung cancer fluorescent imaging during surgery using targeted molecular agents may soon be a reality. While the methodology still needs refinement, the technique holds the possibility of precise visualization of tumor margins, detection of other tumors or metastases, localization of small malignant ground glass opacities, and accurate identification of lymph nodes containing metastatic cancer cells. More than 80,000 people undergo resection of a pulmonary tumor each year, and currently the only method to determine if the tumor is malignant is histologic analysis. A new study reports that a targeted molecular contrast agent can be used successfully to cause lung adenocarcinomas to fluoresce during pulmonary surgery. This enables real-time optical imaging during surgery and the identification of cancer cells. ""This approach may allow surgeons to perform resections with confidence that the entire tumor burden has been eliminated. In the future, with improved devices and molecular contrast agents, this approach may reduce the local recurrence rate and improve intraoperative identification of metastatic cancer cells,"" explained lead investigator Sunil Singhal, MD, of the Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine (Philadelphia). In this proof-of-concept study, 50 patients (ages 25-85 years) with diagnosed adenocarcinoma received 0.1 mg/kg of a fluorescent folate receptor alpha (FR )-targeted molecular contrast agent (On Target Laboratories) four hours before surgery. This agent binds to folate receptor  , a protein found on the surface of most lung adenocarcinoma cells. This resulted in fluorescence of 92% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas, allowing surgeons to visually identify tumor cells during surgery. Upon opening the chest cavity, the primary lesion was located using traditional methods of visual inspection and manual palpation. The cancer was imaged and photo-documented with a specialized imaging system [Artemis Fluorescence Imaging System (Quest Medical Imaging) and the FloCam system (developed in their laboratory)]. In seven of the 50 cases (14%), the tumor could easily be identified by its fluorescence. The tumors ranged in size from 1.1 to 8.0 cm, but size did not influence fluorescence. All of these tumors were within 1.2 cm of the lung surface. Of the remaining 43 tumors, 39 appeared fluorescent after the overlying tissue was opened and the tumor exposed. The fluorescence was uniform across the tumor's surface, and the demarcation between tumor and normal surrounding tissue was clearly visible. On average, the optical imaging was quick, ranging from five to 15 minutes. The technique proved to be particularly helpful in two cases. In a 50-year old man thought to have a 2.1 cm primary lung adenocarcinoma in the right upper pulmonary lobe, molecular imaging of the excised lobe identified a second pulmonary nodule that was fluorescent, leading to re-staging of the patient. In another patient, who was thought to have no evidence of metastatic disease, molecular imaging showed evidence of cancer elsewhere. Four tumors (8%) did not exhibit fluorescence, and further analysis showed that these tumors did not express FR  antigens to allow localization of the contrast agent to the tumor. Thus, the FR  imaging agent is not useful for all lung adenocarcinomas. ""This technology is safe,"" stated Dr. Singhal. ""The use of a visible-wavelength fluorophore avoids ionizing radiation and confers no risk to the patient, surgeon, or operating room personnel. In our experience, only one patient had a mild allergic reaction to the contrast agent that was easily managed with diphenhydramine. With miniaturization of imaging devices, this method will be particularly useful in minimally invasive surgery, such as VATS and robotic surgery."" ""What Okusanya and colleagues have discovered is that they can make 92% of all adenocarcinomas glow to the naked eye, requiring no special training at all,"" noted Michael I. Ebright, MD, of the Section of Thoracic Surgery, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center (New York) in an accompanying editorial. ""The Achilles' heel of the technique is tumor depth beneath the pleural surface,"" as fluorescence was not detectable to the operating surgeon in tumors buried within the lung. However, he added that ""this study should be viewed as a launching pad rather than be judged solely on practicality in its current form."" Dr. Ebright looks forward to modification of the system so that it can be used in minimally invasive surgery. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, with approximately 221,200 deaths due to lung cancer anticipated in 2015. About 85% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and adenocarcinoma of the lung is one of the most common forms of NSCLC, in both smokers and nonsmokers.","Published: August 4, 2015"

As a result, only a handful of dyes can be used at a time, since their spectral signatures would overlap.  Lead author Matja  Humar, PhD, also of the Wellman Center, adds,  The narrow-band spectrum of light emitted by these intracellular lasers would allow us to label thousands   in principal up to a trillion   of cells individually, and the very specific wavelengths emitted by these microlasers also would allow us to measure small changes happening within a cell with much greater sensitivity than is possible with broadband fluorescence. Previous studies by Yun s lab demonstrated the first laser based on a living cell, which used fluorescent proteins as the gain medium to amplify the light signal. But this first-generation cellular laser required a laser cavity consisting of a pair of mirrors placed outside the cell to generate laser light. For the current study, Yun and Humar used tiny spherical objects capable of confining light by reflection from their inner surfaces as microcavities for the amplification of laser light within the cavity. The first versions used droplets of oil   either injected into individual cells or naturally occurring within the fat cells called adipocytes   and showed that either could be induced to emit specific wavelengths of laser light by pumping energy from an external laser into fluorescent dyes diffused into the droplet, a process that produced minimal heating of the cells. Changes in the shape of the droplet induced by miniscule pressure alterations within the cell altered the spectra of light emitted, and those alterations could be readily measured. Along with showing lasing with a variety of cells   such as cancer cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes extracted from the skin of pigs   the researchers also induced adipocytes residing within a piece of porcine skin to emit clearly visible laser light.  Production of laser light within solid plastic fluorescent microbeads, which are readily taken up into cells, resulted in unique signature spectra based on the size and number of beads within a cell and the fluorescent dye used. The investigators calculated that it would be possible to tag individual cells with more than a trillion different laser signatures, a number that matches the estimated number of cells in the human body.   One immediate application of these intracellular lasers could be basic studies, such as understanding how cells move and respond to external forces,  says Yun, an associate professor of Dermatology at Harvard Medical School.  Another challenging step will be figuring out how to use biologically generated energy from mechanical movement or a biochemical reaction to pump a cellular laser in a living body. Cells are smart machines, and we are interested in exploiting their amazing capabilities by developing smart-cell lasers that might be able to find diseases and fire light at them on their own. We can envision lasers completely made out of materials that are safe for use within the human body, which could enable remote sensing within the body or be used in laser-light therapies.

To develop more accurate diagnosis and treatment approaches for patients with pulmonary diseases, we have to analyze sample cells directly from the lungs rather than by drawing blood,  said Tony Jun Huang, professor of engineering science and mechanics at Penn State and the inventor, with his group, of this and other acoustofluidic devices based on ultrasonic waves. For instance, different drugs are used to treat different types of asthma patients. If you know what a person s immunophenotype is, you can provide personalized medicine for their particular disease.  There are several problems with the current method for sputum analysis. The first is that human specimens can be contagious, and sputum analysis requires handling of specimens in several discrete machines. With a lab-on-a-chip device, all biospecimens are safely contained in a single disposable component. Another issue is the sample size required for analysis, which is often larger than a person can easily produce. The acoustofluidic sputum liquefier created by Huang s group requires 100 times less sample while still providing accuracy equivalent to the standard system. A further issue is that current systems are difficult to use and require trained operators. With the lab-on-a-chip system, a nurse can operate the device with a touch of a few buttons and get a read-out, or the patient could even operate the device at home. In addition, the disposable portion of the device should cost less than a dollar to manufacture. Po-Hsun Huang, a graduate student in the Huang group and the first author on the recent paper describing the device in the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Lab on a Chip, said,  This will offer quick analysis of samples without having to send them out to a centralized lab. While I have been working on the liquefaction component of the device, my lab mates are working on the flow cytometry analysis component, which should be ready soon. This is the first on-chip sputum liquefier anyone has developed.  Stewart J. Levine, a Senior Investigator and Chief of the Laboratory of Asthma and Lung Inflammation in the Division of Intramural Research at NHLBI, said,  This on-chip sputum liquefier is a significant advance regarding our goal of developing a point-of-care diagnostic device that will determine the type of inflammation present in the lungs of asthmatics. This will allow health care providers to individualize asthma treatments for each patient and advance the goal of bringing precision medicine into clinical practice. ","Published: August 4, 2015"

Maude Shoemaker professor of chemical and biological engineering. Identifying the protein  -5 laminin as a crucial component of a stem cell s extracellular matrix could help inform the development of synthetic environments, or substrates, that support hPSC culture, says Masters.  If you take an array of substrates that support hPSC growth and maintenance of pluripotency, one of things they all have in common is that they allow the hPSCs to produce  -5 laminin,  she says. The goal for many researchers who work with stem cells is simply to produce an environment that allows the cells to support their own survival. By identifying  -5 laminin as an important key to a cell s survival, the researchers can work to create a synthetic culture environment that encourages the protein's production, says Saha. Designing new synthetic substrates is about providing a receptive surface that keeps what the cells are producing endogenously in the right place, he says.  Spurred by growing expertise in and demand for genome editing, UW-Madison recently opened a genome-editing facility in its Biotechnology Center that allows researchers to take advantage of a relatively new tool called Cas9-CRISPR gene editing. The innovative technique enables researchers to disrupt a genome sequence with high precision, especially in hPSCs.  The research team used the tool to identify  -5 laminin as a key ingredient for stem cell survival. This tool can completely  knock out  a gene, not only reducing its expression, but removing it completely. Tailoring the method to a specific DNA sequence is faster and more practical than other well-known gene editing tools, such as zinc finger nucleases or transcription activator-like effector nucleases.  By knocking out the  -5 laminin gene, the team determined that without  -5 laminin, hPSCs can no longer survive, let alone maintain their pluripotency.  The evolution of substrates plays a definitive role in this research. Currently, most stem cell substrates are animal-derived and ill-defined, and researchers are working toward developing a more controlled synthetic environment that is less expensive and takes advantage of the cell s natural processes.  This work gives us a better idea of how to improve the substrate to make a completely defined and inexpensive culture system that s synthetic,  says Palecek. If stem cell researchers can create a supportive environment, the stem cells themselves can then modify that environment to suit their needs. Identifying  -5 laminin is a small step in the big picture of stem cell research, but it helps scientists and researchers further understand the demand and processes of these cells. Since inserting recombinant  -5 laminin into a cell s environment can be very expensive, presenting an environment where a cell can produce this protein on its own is a practical pathway to developing more effective, less expensive substrates. In the future, the researchers are looking into how a stem cell modifies its extracellular matrix during differentiation, says Palecek. This not only takes into account a cell s general well-being, but its ability to carry out processes, and what exactly the cell is doing and producing to promote these processes.   The implication here is, if we want to drive differentiation, what cues do we need to provide to the cell, and what is the cell going to make for itself?  he says.  If the cell is going to make it for itself, we can simplify the process by not adding it. ","Published: August 3, 2015"

TRACERx is a study of 840 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, funded mainly by Cancer Research UK, with additional funding from the Rosetrees Foundation and UCL. It aims to define the evolutionary paths of cancer by sampling and analyzing each tumor several times, both before and after surgery. Tumor sampling will include multiple biopsies of the tumor tissue, as well as liquid biopsy of ctDNA in blood, to measure tumor heterogeneity and its evolution over time. Natera was selected for the study by the TRACERx investigators at UCL Cancer Institute and Leicester, because of its comparative performance to other technologies in preliminary studies.

A few large clinical trials have supported the idea that fish oils confer therapeutic benefits to patients with cardiovascular disease. Researchers think that hearts and blood vessels may benefit in part from their anti-inflammatory properties. Synthetic versions of marine fish lipid-derived molecules called specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) show anti-inflammatory properties in cell cultures and live animal models. However, newer analyses of more than 50 randomized controlled trials and cohort studies have not settled the question of whether fish oils are helpful to people with heart disease. Getting clarity on the true benefit of fish oils first requires some elementary chemistry: When humans eat fish, we consume omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in triglyceride form (the source of SPMs), which are bound to a glycerol backbone. This is how fatty acids are stored in nature since free fatty acids oxidize quickly. To make fish oil supplements, fatty acids derived from marine fish are chemically detached from the glycerol backbone. These free fatty acids are then concentrated as ethyl-esters (how most synthetic fish oils are sold) or triglycerides. The main difference between natural and synthetic fish oils is how they are absorbed in the human intestinal tract - fish oil fatty acids in the natural triglyceride form are more easily digested and absorbed than in synthetic ethyl ester form.  We found that the clinical promise of these mediators is weak,  first author Carsten Skarke, MD, the McNeil Fellow in Translational Medicine, Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT), said.  There are few reliable data based on such rigorous detection methods as mass spectrometry confirming that SPMs form in humans after taking fish oil pills.  Most clinical trials reporting the formation of SPMs in human subjects rely on less precise methodology than that used in the Penn study. These methods are often applied to cells manipulated outside the body, rather than looking to see if natural SPMs are actually formed. Even if SPMs are formed from fish oils in humans, the question is then whether they are present in amounts sufficient to mimic the effects observed when the synthetic SPMs are injected to tame inflammation in experimental models.  Our study is different because we used rigorous approaches to measure SPM formation in humans, which is not the case in the vast majority of published studies addressing this question,  Skarke said. The team biased their ability to detect SPMs formed in healthy volunteers by giving fish oil in high doses which had been previously shown to influence blood pressure and platelet aggregation under placebo-controlled conditions. They also looked at lower doses, those more commonly consumed by the general public, for the formation of SPMs during an acute inflammatory response and its resolution. Simply put, the team failed to detect a consistent signal of SPM formation in urine or plasma of healthy volunteers who had taken fish oil. Even more strikingly, they found no alteration in their formation during the resolution of inflammation.  In humans, we fail, in large part, either to detect SPMs in a manner that relates either to the dose of fish oil or to the resolution of inflammation,  senior author Garret A. FitzGerald, MD, FRS, ITMAT director and chair of the department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, said.  Studies with synthetic SPMs raise the possibility of their providing a structural basis for building drugs that limit inflammation. However, our results question the importance of this system in the body s own response to inflammation. In particular, we found no evidence supporting their role in mediating an anti-inflammatory action of fish oils, a putative health benefit of such supplements which itself remains to be established.

The team was led by senior author Shelley Berger, PhD, a Daniel S. Och University Professor in the departments of Cell & Developmental Biology, Biology & Genetics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Weiwei Dang, PhD, a former Penn postdoctoral fellow who is now an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine, along with first author Payel Sen, PhD, currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Berger lab. Berger is also director of thePenn Epigenetics Program.Gene expression is regulated by chemical modifications on chromatin -- histone proteins tightly associated with DNA. Certain chemical groups on histones allow DNA to open up, and others to tighten it. These groups alter how compact DNA is in certain regions of the genome, which in turn, affect which genes are available to be made into RNA (a process called transcription) and eventually proteins.   Researchers have just started to appreciate how these epigenetic histone modifications may be playing essential roles in determining lifespan,  said Berger. She has been studying such epigenetic markings for over two decades and was among the first to pinpoint specific histone modifications that not only are altered during aging, but also directly determine longevity.  In this study, we found that a type of abnormal transcription dramatically increases in aged cells and that its reduction can prolong lifespan,  said Dang, who initiated this line of research while working in Berger s laboratory.  This longevity effect is mediated through an evolutionarily conserved chemical modification on histones. This is the first demonstration that such a mechanism exists to regulate aging.   We used budding yeast, a single-cell organism, to study the epigenetic regulation of aging and this simple model turned out to be quite powerful,  explained Sen. In yeast, aging is measured by the number of times a mother cell divides to form daughters before it stops. This number   a mean of 25 divisions -- is under tight control and can be either reduced or increased by altering histone modifications, as the researchers found.  They showed that when fewer chemical groups of a certain type attach to yeast histones, the abnormal transcription greatly increases in old cells. In contrast, the team found that in yeast strains with a certain enzyme deletion, this abnormal transcription is reduced and lifespan is extended by about 30 percent.    We have started investigating whether such a longevity pathway can also be demonstrated in mammalian cells , says Berger.  However, these investigations are confounded by the complexity of the genome in more advanced organisms. One of our long-term goals is to design drugs that can help retain these beneficial histone modifications and extend healthy lifespan in humans. ","Published: August 3, 2015"

We believe our findings will teach us how complex biological structures, such as AAVs (adeno-associated viruses), are built,  said senior study author Luk H. Vandenberghe, of Mass. Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School Department of Ophthalmology.  From this knowledge, we hope to design next-generation viruses for use as vectors in gene therapy.  Given its basic nature, a virus can be an ideal delivery system for gene therapy. In order to survive, a virus must infiltrate a host organism undetected and transfer its genetic material into the host s cells, where it will use the host to replicate and proliferate. Taking advantage of this, researchers can insert therapeutic genes into a virus, then use the viruses to shuttle the genes to the appropriate cells or tissues inside a human body. So far, AAVs used for gene therapy have been chosen from viruses that naturally circulate throughout the human population. If patients have been exposed to the virus, their bodies will likely recognize the virus, mount an attack, and destroy it before it can deliver the therapy. Engineering new, benign viruses could render the viruses unrecognizable and increase the number of people for whom a given gene therapy will work. However, efforts to engineer improved AAVs have been stymied by the intricate structure of these viruses. Like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, every protein in the shell of the virus must fit together perfectly for the virus to function normally. Altering proteins in one part of the virus to achieve a certain benefit, such as more efficient gene transfer or reduced recognition by host immune cells, could end up destroying the structural integrity of the entire shell. To overcome this challenge, Vandenberghe and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School, Schepens Eye Research Institute, and Mass. Eye and Ear have turned to evolutionary history for guidance. Over time, AAV ancestors have undergone a series of changes that kept the structural integrity of the virus while slightly altering some of its functions. The researchers were able recreate an evolutionary timeline of the changes and build in the laboratory nine synthetic ancestors viruses. When injected into mice, the most ancient, Anc80 successfully targeted the liver, muscle, and retina, without producing toxic side effects. In future studies, the researchers will characterize the interplay between the virus and host throughout evolution and continue to seek improved vectors for clinical applications. They will also examine the potential of Anc80 for treating liver diseases and retinal forms of blindness.  The vectors developed and characterized in this study demonstrate unique and potent biology that justify their consideration for gene therapy applications,  Vandenberghe says.","Published: August 3, 2015"

Now, a team of researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology has identified a pair of master regulators that control the fate of TFH cells. Their finding holds great promise for improved vaccine design and may lead to new treatments for immune disorders and possibly even cancer.  Almost all licensed human vaccines work on the basis of inducing a long-term, protective antibody response,  says the study s lead author Shane Crotty, Ph.D., a professor in the Institute s Division of Vaccine Discovery.  Being able to enhance or increase the frequency of follicular helper T cells may be an excellent approach for better vaccine design.  Before B cells can launch a full-blown antibody response against invading pathogens they undergo a tightly orchestrated, multi-step maturation process aided by TFH cells. Often compared to a miniaturized Darwinian struggle for survival, this process selectively promotes the proliferation of B cells that produce high-affinity antibodies and weeds out those that produce less potent ones.   B cells compete for TFH cells to survive,  explains postdoctoral researcher and first author Youn Soo Choi, Ph.D.,  Only those B cells that produce highly specific antibodies attract TFH cells and are able to proliferate.  The survivors undergo successive rounds of mutation and selection resulting in better and better antibodies during the course of an immune response.   TFH cells are essential for the production of most types of antibodies and defects in TFH function or frequency can have dramatic effects,  says Crotty.  It may be particularly important when antibody targets are difficult to recognize and B cells need to explore a bigger mutational landscape. A better understanding of how these cells are produced could really make a difference in how likely it is that your body manages to make good antibodies against an infection.  In an earlier study, Crotty s team had identified the BCL6 gene as a crucial mastermind in the differentiation of TFH cells but important pieces of the puzzles had still been missing. A combination of functional genomics and bioinformatics analysis allowed Choi to narrow the list of potential candidates down to a pair of transcription factors, LEF-1 and TCF-1. Transcription factors act as master switching by binding to regulatory regions in the genome, where they modulate gene activity. He then confirmed the importance of LEF-1 and TCF-1 for the differentiation of TFH cells with the help of mice genetically engineered to lack either LEF-1 or TCF-1.   Their activity pre-programs CD4+ T cells to respond to TFH induction signals,  says Choi.  It seems very likely that any perturbation that results in lower levels of these transcription factors could decrease the likelihood that T cells differentiate into TFH cells.  As a matter of fact, individual differences in the predilection to make more TFH cells could explain why some individuals produce highly efficient antibodies against HIV, while most individuals are unable to mount a potent immune response.  It is very difficult to create high-affinity antibodies for HIV, which are necessary to neutralize virus,  explains Crotty.  Interestingly, it turns out that those individuals that are able to make broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV, have unusually elevated levels of highly functional memory TFH cells. We speculate that these people may have a genetic bias to produce a really good TFH response but we haven t identified it yet. ","Published: August 3, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/error-correction-mechanism-in-cell-division-193663,Error Correction Mechanism in Cell Division Cell biologists have reported an advance in understanding the workings of an error correction mechanism that helps cells detect and correct mistakes in cell division early enough to prevent chromosome mis segregation and aneuploidy  that is  having too many or too few chromosomes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Cell biologists have reported an advance in understanding the workings of an error correction mechanism that helps cells detect and correct mistakes in cell division early enough to prevent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy, that is, having too many or too few chromosomes. Aneuploidy is believed to promote tumorigenesis and tumor evolution in somatic or non-sex cells, and causes genetic disorders such as Down syndrome when it occurs in sex cells. Maresca says his group s paper are the first to clarify the role of an enzyme called Aurora A kinase (AAK) in the error correction process and to discover the crucial importance of chromosome position in the spindle and how it affects division success. It s satisfying that we finally know the details of this pole-oriented error correction process,  Maresca says.  It s a significant advance to understand that where you are as a chromosome in the spindle makes a difference to how well your kinetochore interacts with microtubules.  As he explains, when a cell prepares to divide, it moves through several steps to assure that each replicated chromosome segregates accurately and one copy of every chromosome moves toward opposite poles to become part of separate daughter cells. Structures such as the mitotic spindle, with its highly dynamic microtubules, and kinetochores form during cell division to support this. The protein-based kinetochore is a large, complex protein-based structure that interacts with microtubules that grow and shrink by adding or subtracting subunits at their ends. The spindle positions itself like a long-armed referee ready to separate two fighters. Each replicated chromosome lines up in a configuration called bi-orientation as the spindle prepares to move copies to different corners or poles before the cell pulls apart into two daughter cells.  As you can imagine,  Maresca says,  it s not perfect. There are times when kinetochores interact with microtubules pointed toward the same pole instead of opposite poles. If they stayed in that position you d end up with aneuploidy, the incorrect number of chromosomes. Cancer cells are highly aneuploid. If aneuploidy happens in sex cells it causes miscarriage in most cases because the cells cannot survive. Or it can lead to developmental disorders.  When cells make a mistake, the error correction process disconnects microtubules from the kinetochore and starts over again. The most well studied regulator of this process, Aurora B kinase B (ABK), was known to phosphorylate or chemically modify substrates, in this case other proteins, forcing kinetochore proteins that bind microtubules to let go of them. Maresca, Lampson and colleagues studied ABK s close relative, AAK, which is found in high concentrations at spindle poles but its role was not understood. The researchers found that AAK activity contributed to locally destabilizing interactions between the kinetochore and spindle microtubules.    This is the first time anyone has clarified the role of AAK in this process,  Maresca says.  We found that as the bad attachments move toward the pole, they encounter high levels of this kinase activity. Looking at details of phosphorylation, which is a chemical reaction, we found evidence of an AAK phosphorylation gradient around spindle poles and this activity locally phosphorylated kinetochore proteins in a manner that is known to reduce the affinity of the kinetochore for microtubules.  He and colleagues did this work in Drosophila cells, but collaborated with Daniela Cimini s laboratory at Virginia Tech, where she found the same processes conserved in mammalian cells.  They saw very similar things as we were seeing in the fruit fly cells,  he notes. Another collaborator, Julie Welburn, at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology in Edinburgh provided evidence of the same process at work in human tissue culture cells. Maresca says,  It is really satisfying to go from an unexplained phenomenon initially observed over 10 years ago, to now identifying the kinase, the molecular target of that kinase and then showing that it s conserved from Drosophilato human. To me this is really great because it s rare to achieve all of that in one set of studies.  In a commentary in the journal, observers point out that Maresca and colleagues  work  reveals that Aurora A and Aurora B share a common substrate for the correction of improper microtubule attachments.  Further, the work  convincingly identifies the presence of an Aurora A-mediated error correction mechanism based on the destabilization of microtubule attachments near the spindle poles.

The virus infects the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, which can cause the human disease aspergillosis. This fungal infection targets the lungs and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. The mycovirus called Aspergillus fumigatus tetramycovirus-1 (AfuTmV-1) is comprised of four strands of double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) and possesses unique sequence features and genomic organisation. Unlike nearly all viruses its genetic information is not encapsidated but coated in a virus encoded protein and these ribonucleoprotein structures were visualised for the first time using atomic force microscopy. Most importantly, the genome of AfuTmV-1 can infect the fungus on its own, without a protein capsid, a feature which has never been shown previously for a dsRNA containing virus. Therefore, the genome can potentially be altered through genetic engineering and directly introduced into the fungus. It is hoped that AfuTmV-1 might eventually be used to develop a silencing vector, a tool to switch off fungal genes, in order to study what in Aspergillus fumigatus can cause aspergillosis in humans. AfuTmV-1 is the prototype of a new mycovirus family but is not unique since similar mycoviruses have also been discovered in different fungal genera suggesting potential utility of these dsRNA elements for constructing generic silencing vectors for fungi in the future.","Published: August 3, 2015"

They clocked the speed of heating the solution at around 55 degrees Fahrenheit per second. The rate of cooling was equally impressive, coming in at about 43.9 degrees per second.  PCR is powerful, and it is widely used in many fields, but existing PCR systems are relatively slow,  said study senior author Luke Lee, a professor of bioengineering.  It is usually done in a lab because the conventional heater used for this test requires a lot of power and is expensive. Because it takes an hour or longer to complete each test, it is not practical for use for point-of-care diagnostics. Our system can generate results within minutes.  The slowdown in conventional PCR tests comes from the time it takes to heat and cool the DNA solution. The PCR test requires repeated temperature changes   an average of 30 thermal cycles at three different temperatures   to amplify the genetic sequence, a process that involves breaking up the double-stranded DNA and binding the single strand with a matching primer. With each heating-cooling cycle, the amount of the DNA sample is doubled. To pick up the pace of this thermal cycling, Lee and his team of researchers took advantage of plasmonics, or the interaction between light and free electrons on a metal s surface. When exposed to light, the free electrons get excited and begin to oscillate, generating heat. Once the light is off, the oscillations and the heating stop. Gold, it turns out, is a popular metal for this plasmonic photothermal heating because it is so efficient at absorbing light. It has the added benefit of being inert to biological systems, so it can be used in biomedical applications.For their experiments, the researchers used thin films of gold that were 120 nanometers thick, or about the width of a rabies virus. The gold was deposited onto a plastic chip with microfluidic wells to hold the PCR mixture with the DNA sample. The light source was an array of off-the-shelf LEDs positioned beneath the PCR wells. The peak wavelength of the blue LED light was 450 nanometers, tuned to get the most efficient light-to-heat conversion. The researchers were able to cycle from 131 degrees to 203 degrees Fahrenheit 30 times in less than five minutes. They tested the ability of the photonic PCR system to amplify a sample of DNA, and found that the results compared well with conventional PCR tests.  This photonic PCR system is fast, sensitive and low-cost,  said Lee, who is also co-director of the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center.  It can be integrated into an ultrafast genomic diagnostic chip, which we are developing for practical use in the field. Because this technology yields point-of-care results, we can use this in a wide range of settings, from rural Africa to a hospital ER. ","Published: August 3, 2015"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/genetic-tug-of-war-195842,Genetic Tug of War Researchers have reported on a version of genetic parental control in mice that is more targeted  and subtle than canonical imprinting  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Not every mom and dad agree on how their offspring should behave. But in genetics as in life, parenting is about knowing when your voice needs to be heard, and the best ways of doing so. Typically, compromise reigns, and one copy of each gene is inherited from each parent so that the two contribute equally to the traits who make us who we are. Occasionally, a mechanism called genomic imprinting, first described 30 years ago, allows just one parent to be heard by completely silencing the other.  Now, researchers at the University of Utah School of Medicine report on a version of genetic parental control in mice that is more targeted, and subtle than canonical imprinting, so-called noncanonical imprinting is particularly prevalent in the brain, and skews the genetic message in subpopulations of cells so that mom, or dad, has a stronger say. The mechanism can influence offspring behavior, and because it is observed more frequently than classic imprinting, appears to be preferred.   The field has traditionally thought of genetics at the level of the whole animal, and sometimes the tissue. We re documenting it at the cellular level,  says senior author Christopher Gregg, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurobiology and anatomy.  Genetics is much more complicated than we thought.  A case in point is the impact of noncanonical signaling on motivated behaviors that prompt a timid mouse to leave its protective shelter when it needs to search for food. Five genes preferably controlled by mom, or dad, cluster within a biochemical pathway that creates serotonin and dopamine, neurochemicals that affect mood and behavior. The imprinting is further customized by being enriched in subregions of the brain known to control behavior (arcuate nucleus, and dorsal raphe nucleus). When the scientists remove the active, maternal copy of one of the genes, tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), they see a modest but consistent increase in the amount of time the mice spend out in the open, showing it controls the behavior. By contrast, mice with their muffled, paternal copy removed show no behavioral changes.  We speculate that a better strategy for imprinting is to do it in the cells that are needed to achieve the desired effect, rather than to do it in every tissue,  says Gregg.  In total, 80 percent of 210 imprinted genes analyzed   the vast majority - were subject to noncanonical imprinting. 64 percent of those genes showed parental bias exclusively in the brain or subregions of the brain, and not in non-neural tissues, liver or muscle. A novel method that visualizes active copies of genes shows that the bias stems from differences within populations of cells. While canonically imprinted genes have just one active copy in nearly every cell examined, noncanonically imprinted genes have one active copy in subsets of cells, and two active copies in others.  The results expand on previous work by another group who found a gene that imprints in specific neurons, and is reported to be associated with autism when mutated. This and the current study s behavior experiments highlight that in addition to fine-tuning parental control, noncanonical imprinting may have a downside.  Gregg speculates that the targeted form of imprinting gives rise to  high-risk  neurons that are especially vulnerable to mutations inherited from one parent because they don t express a second, healthy back-up copy to compensate for the mistake.  We think that subpopulations of cells that preferentially express mutated genes could disproportionately contribute to brain disorders such as autism,  he says. Future research will test the hypothesis and novel therapies to overcome the deficits.","Published: August 3, 2015"

However, the authors now show that NETs also form in atherosclerotic lesions and lead to the production proinflammatory cytokines and the accumulation of pathogenic immune cells in the lesion. The findings shed light on the processes that promote artherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside a patient's arteries. Atherosclerosis is among the most widespread of chronic inflammatory diseases and is a major cause of death in Western countries.Dr Veni Papayannopoulos of the Crick (currently based at Mill Hill) explained: ""Like many chronic inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis is driven by molecules called proinflammatory cytokines. In atherosclerosis, these proteins orchestrate the continuous recruitment of immune cells to the arterial walls, leading to the build up of cholesterol-containing lesions that can obstruct blood flow."" ""One of the key challenges in understanding inflammatory diseases that are not caused by infections is to discover what triggers the production of these inflammatory cytokines."" Previous work had showed that when the concentration of certain lipids increases in our blood, cholesterol crystals are produced. These crystals activate a process in immune cells called macrophages that is required to process proinflammatory cytokines into their mature and active form. However, it remained unclear how these molecules are produced in the first place. The team used a variety of methods to shed light on the topic. First, they isolated human neutrophils from healthy individuals and showed that cholesterol crystals,  trigger neutrophils to release NETs. They then placed mice on a high fat western diet to promote artherosclerosis and isolated their aortas (the main artery in their hearts) to measure the size of the artherosclerotic plaques and to look for the presence of NETs. Lastly, the team measured the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory immune cells in these plaques and in the blood of the mice. The research showed that exposure of neutrophils to cholesterol crystals promotes the release of NETs, which activate macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines and recruit additional disease-causing immune cells to the lesion. However, mice with a genetic mutation that hampered the ability to release NETs in response to cholesterol crystals, and mice receiving treatments that degrade NETs, had substantially lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and smaller lesions covering their aortas. Dr Annika Warnatsch of the Crick (also at Mill Hill) said: ""These findings explain how cholesterol crystals and other internal signals are sufficient to promote inflammation in the absence of infection. ""Our work sheds light on the mechanisms that drive atherosclerosis and potentially and other chronic inflammatory diseases and suggests new strategies for their treatment.""","Published: August 3, 2015"

This activates receptors causing them to twist, turn and spark chemical reactions inside cells. NIH scientists used atomic level images to show how the neuropeptide hormone neurotensin might activate its receptors. Their description is the first of its kind for a neuropeptide-binding G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), a class of receptors involved in a wide range of disorders and the target of many drugs.  G protein-coupled receptors are found throughout the body. Knowing how they work should help scientists devise better treatments,  said Reinhard Grisshammer, Ph.D., an investigator at the NIH s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the senior author of the study. Neurotensin is thought to be involved in Parkinson s disease, schizophrenia, temperature regulation, pain, and cancer cell growth. Previously, Dr. Grisshammer and his colleagues showed how neurotensin binds to the part of its receptor located on a cell s surface. In this study, they demonstrated how binding changes the structure of the rest of the receptor, which passes through a cell s membrane and into its interior. There neurotensin receptors activate G proteins, a group of molecules inside cells that controls a series of chemical chain reactions. For these experiments, scientists shot X-rays at crystallized neurotensin receptor molecules. Making crystals of receptors that activate G proteins is difficult. In most studies, scientists have investigated inactive receptors.  The receptor we crystallized is very close to the active form found in nature,  said Dr. Grisshammer.  We may have the first picture of a peptide-binding G protein-coupled receptor just before it engages with the G protein.  To achieve their results, the scientists made multiple genetic modifications to a less active version of the neurotensin receptor they had used before. Experiments performed in test tubes showed that mixing the receptor with neurotensin sparked the G protein reactions for which the scientists were looking. When the scientists looked at the structure of the new crystals, they discovered how binding of neurotensin to the receptor caused critical parts of the receptor located below a cell s surface to change shape. In particular, they saw that a region in the middle of the receptor dropped like a draw bridge to link the neurotensin binding site to parts of the receptor found inside cells that are important for G protein activation. The scientists concluded that this change may prepare the receptor for activating G proteins.  For years scientists have made educated guesses about how peptide receptors work. Now we may finally know,  said Dr. Grisshammer. His lab plans to continue its work in order to fully understand how neurotensin and other G protein-coupled receptors translate messages delivered by neuropeptides into reactions inside cells.","Published: August 3, 2015"

This in turn produces a small signalling molecule called cGAMP which acts as what s known as a second messenger, activating other elements of the body's immune response. Now, the Oxford team have discovered that as some viruses replicate, they incorporate cGAMP, meaning that as they infect new cells the cGAMP immediately prompts an immune response. Professor Jan Rehwinkel from the MRC Human Immunology Unit, within Oxford University s Radcliffe Department of Medicine, explained: 'We hypothesised that as the virus replicated, cGAMP was incorporated and carried to the next cell to be infected. This may not have been spotted before because in the lab researchers tend to use cells that are free of cGAS and therefore unable to produce cGAMP. 'By putting cGAS back into some of these cells, we were able to compare what happened as the virus moved to infect new cells. Viruses from cells that had been loaded with cGAS and could produce cGAMP stimulated a much more potent immune response when they moved into new cells than viruses that had come from cells without cGAS. 'This confirmed our hypothesis in cells with artificially high levels of cGAS but we needed to also test it using cells with naturally occurring levels of the protein. We used cells from mice and compared these to cells from genetically engineered mice that were cGAS free. The finding was the same   where cGAMP was produced, it travelled within the virus particles. 'It is not yet clear whether cells are tagging these virus particles deliberately or whether it is simply a by-product of how viruses replicate.' The Oxford team are now investigating whether the research could be used to improve a class of vaccines. Viral vectored vaccines are genetically engineered virus particles designed to prompt an immune response against particular diseases. The researchers will look at whether by loading these particles with cGAMP it is possible to stimulate a bigger immune response, making such vaccines more effective.","Published: August 3, 2015"

""They have functions that are hard to replicate in synthetic systems.""The researchers developed a second-generation synthetic water channel that improves on earlier attempts to mimic aquaporins   natural water channel proteins -- by being more stable and easier to manufacture. The peptide-appended pillar[5]arenes (PAP) are also more easily produced and aligned than carbon nanotubes, another material under investigation for membrane separation.  ""We were surprised to see transport rates approaching the 'holy grail' number of a billion water molecules per channel per second,"" said Kumar. ""We also found that these artificial channels like to associate with each other in a membrane to make 2-dimensional arrays with a very high pore density."" The researchers consider that the PAP membranes are an order of magnitude better than the first-generation artificial water channels reported to date. The propensity for these channels to automatically form densely packed arrays leads to a variety of engineering applications. ""The most obvious use of these channels is perhaps to make highly efficient water purification membranes,"" said Kumar.","Published: August 3, 2015"

Researchers assessed up to 224 preterm children at age five and age seven to examine the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after birth to identify infants at risk of later academic impairment. The study participants are from Melbourne, Australia and are part of a Murdoch Children s Research Institute study. The authors suggest that identifying infants at risk for low mathematical achievement at school age would assist clinicians in directing families to targeted early intervention and surveillance for educational difficulties many years before impairment is detected in school. Neonatal MRI is a useful method of predicting cognitive outcome in preterm children, according to the study. The researchers were looking for associations between diffusion MRI and local brain volumes on neonatal MRI with number skills and working memory in childhood. Neonatal brain microstructure was positively associated with working memory scores in childhood, while increasing tissue volumes in the left insula and putamen regions of the neonatal Jacobian map were positively associated with higher number skills scores in childhood. This meant they were able to identify brain microstructure and regions in the neonatal brain that are associated with childhood mathematical learning, as Henrik Ullman, co-author of the paper, explained:  Our findings demonstrate that brain microstructure and increased tissue volumes in regions located around the insula and putamen during the neonatal period are associated with better early mathematics in preterm children.  Megan Spencer-Smith, co-author of the paper, went on to say that:  this knowledge could assist in identifying infants at risk of mild academic impairments who would benefit from monitoring and referral to early intervention. Such an approach could assist in reducing the number of preterm children performing below their peers in mathematics.  The study also suggests that identifying these children early could reduce behavioral and emotional problems in childhood, as well as reducing well-being and mental health problems in adulthood.

After 2 years of treatment, the results point to a positive trend of the ladostigil treated group in comparison to the placebo treated group in the number of patients who did not progress from MCI to Alzheimer s disease. The interim results reflect data from all MCI patients who completed up to 2 years of treatment. The primary end point is to determine whether ladostigil can delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer s disease. The conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease is determined using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), a common measurement tool for determining the stage of dementia. The interim results also show statistically significant protection (p=0.01) of ladostigil against loss of whole brain volume as measured by MRI. Brain volume measurements are known biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease. Longitudinal MRI studies improve predictive power in assessing the prognosis of individuals with MCI. Furthermore, the data support the mechanism of action of the drug of reducing inflammation, as seen in improvement of immune parameters, and in particular reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines INF  and TNF . In addition, an independent expert committee evaluated the safety data on all patients participating in the trial. The expert committee concluded that there are no safety issues preventing continuation of the trial. There were no serious or unexpected adverse events related to the drug.  Based on the positive outcome of the two interim analyses to date, the Company intends to begin discussions with the FDA regarding further development of ladostigil towards a Phase 3 pivotal trial. The next step will be a pre-IND meeting with the regulatory authorities,  said Yona Geffen, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Avraham Pharmaceuticals. ""We are very encouraged from these additional positive interim results of this on-going Phase 2b study, and believe that ladostigil holds the potential of a disease modifying drug that will alleviate MCI symptoms and prevent progression to Alzheimer's disease.  Yaacov Michlin, Chairman of Avraham Pharmaceuticals and Chief Executive Officer of Yissum, said,  MCI often progresses to dementia, and in particular to Alzheimer's disease. Currently there is no treatment for MCI, and there is a high medical and human interest to be able to delay this progression. This Phase 2b trial is intended to assess the ability of ladostigil, a drug with neuroprotective activity, to slow the deterioration of people with MCI. We are thus very pleased with the favorable efficacy trend of the second interim results and the excellent safety profile of the drug, and look forward to the final results expected at Q3 2016.  Ladostigil s on-going Phase 2b trial is a 3 years, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that includes 210 MCI patients (allocated 1:1, ladostigil vs. placebo) in 16 centers in Europe and Israel.

Eribulin, a halichondrin class microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mechanism of action, is currently approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in approximately 60 countries worldwide. Structurally, eribulin is a simplified and synthetically produced version of halichondrin B, a natural product isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai. Eribulin is believed to work by inhibition of the growth phase of microtubule dynamics which prevents cell division. PEGPH20 is an investigational drug administered intravenously that targets the degradation of hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan - or chain of natural sugars throughout the body. Hyaluronan accumulates around cancer cells, increasing tumor interstitial fluid pressure and constricting tumor vasculature, subsequently inhibiting anticancer agents from reaching cancer cells. By degrading hyaluronan, PEGPH20 increases blood flow to the tumor which may allow cancer therapies to be more efficiently delivered to their target. Under the agreement, the companies will jointly conduct and share the costs of a Phase Ib/II clinical study seeking to determine whether or not the combination therapy of eribulin and PEGPH20 can improve the overall response rate in advanced breast cancer patients with high levels of hyaluronan. In hyaluronan-rich triple-negative breast preclinical animal models, the addition of PEGPH20 to eribulin showed a significantly higher tumor growth inhibition including tumor regression when compared to eribulin alone.

This discovery, published in the journal Neuron, could help researchers to develop new drugs that promote better sleep, or control hyperactivity in people with the medical condition mania. Scientists altered the neurochemistry of mice to help investigate why we need to sleep, what controls our wakefulness, and how a balance between these two states influences brain functions like concentration and memory and our general health. The chemicals they studied, histamine and GABA, are produced in a primitive part of the brain that is highly similar in mice and humans. The team of scientists was led by Dr Stephen Brickley, Professor Nick Franks and Professor Bill Wisden from the Department of Life Sciences and the Centre for Neurotechnology at Imperial College London. Professor Wisden said, ""Sleep is essential for health. We have to do it every day. But nobody yet knows why."" Scientists already know the chemical histamine sends signals to the brain to make it awake, which is why antihistamines are associated with drowsiness. The new research suggests that the chemical GABA acts against histamine, like a chemical 'brake' preventing wakefulness being too intense. The researchers found that GABA and histamine are made in the same brain cells, called histamine neurons, which led the scientists to question its function. They altered the levels of the GABA produced by the mice's brains and measured what changes this had on their brain activity over the day and night. Mice without the GABA chemical developed characteristics similar to a medical condition called mania, in which patients experience restlessness and sleeplessness. In humans these are often also symptoms of bipolar disorder, which affects around 2.4 million people in the UK. ""Wakefulness stimulated by histamine may be too much of a good thing, and so the brain has a built in brake on histamine's wake-inducing actions,"" said Dr Brickley. The scientists found that compared with normal mice, those without GABA ran twice as far and twice as fast, and maintained or even increased their overall activity over a 30 minute period. The mice also stayed awake much longer in the day, when they would otherwise be asleep. When they did sleep, the mice experienced just 65 per cent of the normal amount of non-REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a heavy sleep state with no dreaming. ""What particularly surprised us was how little the mice were affected by sleep deprivation,"" said Professor Franks. ""Normally mice that lose 5 hours of sleep would sleep for longer following this deprivation, and we would see a much lower level of activity. These mice kept up their hyperactive state over the following 16 hours they were awake. They didn't appear to need any recovery sleep at all."" The scientists have begun new work with mice to investigate the link between lack of sleep and memory loss. They hope this will lead to a better understanding of the link between poor sleep and mental health issues in humans.","Published: August 1, 2015"

""Most previous research into ways of delaying the onset of HD symptoms have focused on studying the mutant protein in cells or in animal models, but the relevance of abnormalities in those systems to what actually happens in patients remains a huge assumption,"" says James Gusella, PhD, director of the Center for Human Genetic Research (CHGR) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), corresponding author of the Cell paper. ""Our approach does not rely on model systems but on DNA samples and clinical data from human patients. In essence, we are analyzing the results of a 'clinical trial' conducted by nature, a trial in which naturally occurring variations in genes other than the HD gene intervened to influence the course of the disease. Now it is up to scientists to figure out how those genetic interventions work and to build on them to develop effective therapies based on understanding how these processes operate in humans."" Gusella led the effort that initially mapped the location of the HD gene to chromosome 4, and in 1993 the gene itself was isolated in the laboratory of MGH CHGR investigator Marcy MacDonald, PhD, in collaboration with Gusella and a consortium of research teams from around the world. Not long after the HD gene was isolated, studies led by MacDonald, also a co-author of the current investigation, found that a variation in the number of CAG trinucleotide repeats within the HD gene, which codes for a protein called huntingtin, is the primary determinant of the age at which HD symptoms appear, with a greater number of CAG repeats associated with an earlier symptom onset. But while that overall pattern has been consistently observed in HD patients worldwide, in some people the symptoms first appear somewhat earlier or later than would be expected based upon CAG repeat number alone, suggesting that inherited changes in the DNA of other genes affected symptom onset. While several studies in the intervening years have investigated whether particular genes were responsible for modifying HD onset, this is the first to employ genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, which scans an individual's whole genome to identify chromosomal regions containing variants that are associated with the disease traits that are being studied. Such studies require fairly large groups of participants, and while they are unable to pinpoint the specific responsible DNA variant, they identify the region on a particular chromosome where modifier genes are located. The MGH team has assembled a large number of DNA samples from HD patients who contributed them for research to the Massachusetts HD Center Without Walls and through collaboration with the Huntington Study Group. As a first step in the current study, the researchers genotyped 977 HD patients and then ran a second scan of samples from another 974 patients. After analyzing both scans together for DNA variants associated with differences between when each patient's movement-associated symptoms first appeared and when they would have been expected based on the number of CAG repeats, MGH CHGR investigator and lead author Jong-Min Lee, PhD, identified two locations on chromosome 15 where variants were significantly associated with either early or late symptom onset. The researchers then collaborated with many groups in the U.S. and Europe - including the European Huntington Disease Network - to form the Genetic Modifiers of HD (GeM-HD) consortium, which ran a third GWA analysis of another 2,131 patients, bringing the total number of participants to 4,082. The combined data improved the strength of the associations with the two chromosome 15 variants and revealed another significant variant on chromosome 8. The presence of additional modifying variants was suggested on chromosomes 3, 5 and 21; but the associations were not strong enough to be statistically significant. Gusella explains that the presence of two modifying variants on chromosome 15 - one associated with symptoms appearing an average of six years early, the other associated with an average one-and-a-half-year delay - implies that there may be two actual modifying variants that both influence one modifier gene but in opposite directions. Two important genes known to be close to the chromosome 15 variant region are involved with DNA repair and replication and with intracellular signaling. Genes close to the chromosome 8 region are also involved in cellular processes believed to play a role in HD, but at this point suggesting how these variants influence symptom onset would be speculative. ""What we can say for sure is that the modifier variants located on these chromosomal regions affect the disease process prior to the appearance of symptoms,"" he says. ""Figuring out the exact DNA sequence variations responsible and how they influence the disease process should provide us with a guide for developing drugs that we hope could have a much larger effect than the one to six years produced by the natural variations, possibly even preventing symptom onset altogether. We believe that we are closer to finding such therapies, but it's impossible to predict a specific timeline."" Massachusetts General Hospital","Published: July 31, 2015"

It is believed to be the first time voluntary leg movements have ever been relearned in completely paralyzed patients without surgery. The results are reported in the Journal of Neurotrauma.   These findings tell us we have to look at spinal cord injury in a new way,  said V. Reggie Edgerton, senior author of the research and a UCLA distinguished professor of integrative biology and physiology, neurobiology and neurosurgery. Edgerton said although it likely will be years before the new approaches are widely available, he now believes that it is possible to significantly improve quality of life for patients with severe spinal cord injuries, and to help them recover multiple body functions.  People who are paralyzed are often told very early on,  Don t have any hope because you re not going to recover function below the lesion,  he said.  They have been told that for decades, and still are today. But this was ridiculous before, and it s even more ridiculous now.  Last year, Edgerton and colleagues, the University of Louisville s Susan Harkema and Claudia Angeli and UCLA s Yury Gerasimenko, reported that four young men who had been paralyzed for years were able to move their legs, hips, ankles and toes following epidural electrical stimulation of their spinal cords. But that procedure required that the stimulator be surgically implanted and activated  and that device remains under the skin for years. Earlier this year, a team led by Gerasimenko and Edgerton, along with Ruslan Gorodnichev of Russia s Velikie Luky State Academy of Physical Education and Sport, demonstrated that they could induce involuntary stepping movements in healthy, uninjured people using noninvasive stimulation. The finding led Edgerton to believe the same approach could be effective for people with complete paralysis. In the new research, five men were given one 45-minute training session per week for 18 weeks. For four weeks, the men were also given twice daily doses of buspirone, a drug often used to treat anxiety disorders. Researchers placed electrodes at strategic points on the skin, at the lower back and near the tailbone and then administered a unique pattern of electrical currents. The electrical charges caused no discomfort to the patients, who were lying down.  The fact that they regained voluntary control so quickly must mean that they had neural connections that were dormant, which we reawakened,  said Edgerton, who for nearly 40 years has conducted research on how the neural networks in the spinal cord regain control of standing, stepping and voluntary control of movements after paralysis.  It was remarkable.  Edgerton said most experts, including himself, had assumed that people who were completely paralyzed would no longer have had neural connections across the area of the spinal cord injury. The researchers do not know yet whether patients who are completely paralyzed can be trained to fully bear their weight and walk. But he and colleagues have now published data on nine people who have regained voluntary control of their legs   four with epidural implants and five in the latest study.  Many people thought just a few years ago we might be able to achieve these results in perhaps one out of 100 subjects, but now we have nine of nine,  Edgerton said.  I think it s a big deal, and when the subjects see their legs moving for the first time after paralysis, they say it s a big deal.  The men in the newest study ranged in age from 19 to 56; their injuries were suffered during athletic activities or, in one case, in an auto accident. All have been completely paralyzed for at least two years. Their identities are not being released. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health s National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (grants U01EB15521 and R01EB007615), the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, the Walkabout Foundation and the Russian Scientific Fund.  These encouraging results provide continued evidence that spinal cord injury may no longer mean a life-long sentence of paralysis and support the need for more research,  said Dr. Roderic Pettigrew, director of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.  The potential to offer a life-changing therapy to patients without requiring surgery would be a major advance; it could greatly expand the number of individuals who might benefit from spinal stimulation. It s a wonderful example of the power that comes from combining advances in basic biological research with technological innovation.  ? Edgerton estimates that cost to patients of the new approach could be one-tenth the cost of treatment using the surgical epidural stimulator (which is also still experimental)   and, because no surgery is required, it would likely be more easily available to more patients. The study s co-authors were Gerasimenko, who conceived the new approach and is director of the laboratory of movement physiology at Russia s Pavlov Institute and a researcher in the UCLA department of integrative biology and physiology, as well as Daniel Lu, associate professor of neurosurgery, researchers Morteza Modaber, Roland Roy and Dimitry Sayenko, research technician Sharon Zdunowski, research scientist Parag Gad, laboratory coordinator Erika Morikawa and research assistant Piia Haakana, all of UCLA; and Adam Ferguson, assistant professor of neurological surgery at UC San Francisco. Edgerton and his research team also plan to study people who have severe, but not complete, paralysis.  They re likely to improve even more,  he said. The scientists can only work with a small number of patients, due to limited resources, but Edgerton is optimistic that the research can benefit many others. Almost 6 million Americans live with paralysis, including nearly 1.3 million with spinal cord injuries.  A person can have hope, based on these results,  Edgerton said.  In my opinion, they should have hope.

But in genetics as in life, parenting is about knowing when your voice needs to be heard, and the best ways of doing so. Typically, compromise reigns, and one copy of each gene is inherited from each parent so that the two contribute equally to the traits who make us who we are. Occasionally, a mechanism called genomic imprinting, first described 30 years ago, allows just one parent to be heard by completely silencing the other.Now, researchers at the University of Utah School of Medicine report on a version of genetic parental control in mice that is more targeted, and subtle than canonical imprinting. Published in Cell Reports, so-called noncanonical imprinting is particularly prevalent in the brain, and skews the genetic message in subpopulations of cells so that mom, or dad, has a stronger say. The mechanism can influence offspring behavior, and because it is observed more frequently than classic imprinting, appears to be preferred. The field has traditionally thought of genetics at the level of the whole animal, and sometimes the tissue. We re documenting it at the cellular level,  says senior author Christopher Gregg, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurobiology and anatomy.  Genetics is much more complicated than we thought. A case in point is the impact of noncanonical signaling on motivated behaviors that prompt a timid mouse to leave its protective shelter when it needs to search for food. Five genes preferably controlled by mom, or dad, cluster within a biochemical pathway that creates serotonin and dopamine, neurochemicals that affect mood and behavior. The imprinting is further customized by being enriched in subregions of the brain known to control behavior (arcuate nucleus, and dorsal raphe nucleus). When the scientists remove the active, maternal copy of one of the genes, tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), they see a modest but consistent increase in the amount of time the mice spend out in the open, showing it controls the behavior. By contrast, mice with their muffled, paternal copy removed show no behavioral changes. We speculate that a better strategy for imprinting is to do it in the cells that are needed to achieve the desired effect, rather than to do it in every tissue,  says Gregg.In total, 80 percent of 210 imprinted genes analyzed   the vast majority - were subject to noncanonical imprinting. 64 percent of those genes showed parental bias exclusively in the brain or subregions of the brain, and not in non-neural tissues, liver or muscle.A novel method that visualizes active copies of genes shows that the bias stems from differences within populations of cells. While canonically imprinted genes have just one active copy in nearly every cell examined, noncanonically imprinted genes have one active copy in subsets of cells, and two active copies in others.The results expand on previous work by another group who found a gene that imprints in specific neurons, and is reported to be associated with autism when mutated. This and the current study s behavior experiments highlight that in addition to fine-tuning parental control, noncanonical imprinting may have a downside.Gregg speculates that the targeted form of imprinting gives rise to  high-risk  neurons that are especially vulnerable to mutations inherited from one parent because they don t express a second, healthy back-up copy to compensate for the mistake.  We think that subpopulations of cells that preferentially express mutated genes could disproportionately contribute to brain disorders such as autism,  he says. Future research will test the hypothesis and novel therapies to overcome the deficits. University of Utah Health Care  press releasePaul J. Bonthuis, Wei-Chao Huang, Cornelia N.

Its findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms vital to the regulation of our circadian system, or internal clock. The work, which appears in the journal Cell, focuses on the regulation of ""neuronal plasticity""--changes in neuronal structure--and its function in the brain. ""Neuronal plasticity underpins learning and memory, but it is very challenging to tie changes in specific neurons to alterations in animal behavior,"" explains Justin Blau, the paper's senior author and a professor in the New York University (NYU) Department of Biology and at NYU Abu Dhabi. ""In our research, we've discovered how plasticity of a very small number of neurons helps run the biological clock and aids transitions to different seasons."" The paper's other authors were Afroditi Petsakou, a recent PhD graduate from NYU's Department of Biology, and Themistoklis Sapsis, an assistant professor at MIT. In their study, the researchers focused on the principal s-LNv clock neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila, which is commonly used for research on circadian rhythms--earlier studies of ""clock genes"" in fruit flies lead to the identification of similarly functioning genes in humans. Specifically, their work centered on the ends/tips of the axons of these neurons, where they release their signals. Previous research had established that these termini change their structure with a 24-hour rhythm, but it was unclear what function these alterations served. In the Cell study, the scientists quantified the daily changes in s-LNv axon termini and found that they grow and retract every 24 hours. They also identified the protein that drives these rhythms in neuronal plasticity: Rho1. Moreover, they found that plasticity of the s-LNvs is required both for maintaining circadian rhythms (the biological clock) and for allowing seasonal adaptation of these rhythms. Specifically, if s-LNvs are unable to retract then flies behave normally in winter but fail to predict the early dawn of long summer days. Conversely, if s-LNvs remain in a retracted state, then flies behave as if they are in summer on both short and long days. They also found rhythms in the proteins at the ends of the s-LNv axons. At dawn, s-LNvs have high levels of proteins involved in sending signals and low levels of the proteins that allow them to receive signals. The opposite is true at dusk. This unusual type of neuronal plasticity suggests that the function of s-LNvs changes dramatically over the day: from mainly sending signals at dawn to mainly receiving signals at dusk. The findings may also shed new light on a human affliction, spinocerebellar ataxia--a neurodegenerative disease that affects coordination and movement. Blau's group found that the daily changes in Rho1 activity are controlled by rhythms in transcription of a gene very similar to human Puratrophin-1. ""Since some forms of spinocerebellar ataxia are associated with mutations in human Puratrophin-1, our data support the idea that defective neuronal plasticity underlies loss of motor control and leads to neurodegeneration,"" notes Blau.

In Manchester we re well placed to take advantage of molecular pathology with the research expertise and the close support of NHS and industry partners, to turn the experimental work into practical solutions.  The project will last for an initial four years with funding coming from the University, Medical Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and NHS and industry partners.  By the end of the four year period, the team of researchers will have tested six biomarkers for their potential to indicate disease and will be working to roll these out across the NHS. MMPathIC will also develop training programmes to ensure that there are trained professionals in the future who can continue to develop molecular pathology as a discipline.  These will range from CPD courses for those currently working in the NHS and industry, through postgraduate education, to placements for sixth form students.

Computing science student A cha BenTaieb is designing a computer-aided diagnostic system at SFU s Medical Image Analysis Lab that will more accurately and more quickly identify ovarian cancer s many subtypes than the current technique. Currently, before treatment can begin, pathologists use a microscope to identify tissue samples from cancerous ovarian tumours. According to OVCARE, a B.C.-based ovarian cancer research team, every three-and-a-half-hours in Canada a woman is diagnosed with ovarian cancer one of the most fatal and least understood cancers. Time is of the essence. With research help from SFU computing science professor Ghassan Hamarneh and B.C. Cancer Agency pathologists Drs. David Huntsman and Hector Li Chang, BenTaieb s automated system will speed up decision-making on appropriate chemo- or radiation therapies.  Traditional classification can be easily impaired by technical factors such as lighting and the pathologist s experience,  explains BenTaieb.  Despite having guidelines for diagnosis, each pathologist has his or her own understanding of the disease, and the act of visually classifying something remains subjective. Classification can also be costly, as non-expert pathologists require long hours of training and additional testing might be needed.  BenTaieb s computer prototype is programmed to classify the appropriate cancer subtype using expert-annotated tissue-sample images. They have an agreed-upon subtype verified through biological testing. The system s built-in artificial intelligence is then able to interpret tissue samples and identify the appropriate cancer subtype by comparing the sample s visual appearance to annotated images. So far, the results have been promising. The system is already correctly classifying the subtypes in more than 92 per cent of cases.","Published: July 31, 2015"

But new findings suggest that it could be possible to delay its effects or even prevent it altogether, allowing people with the Huntington s gene to live healthy lives for longer. Huntington s disease is a degenerative brain disorder that usually affects people in middle age. The symptoms of this rare genetic condition can be extremely distressing both for patients and their families. They include uncontrollable movements, loss of cognitive abilities and even changes in behaviour and personality.  Leading the UK arm of a major international collaboration, Professor Lesley Jones and her team at Cardiff University s MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics (MRC CNGG) examined the biological mechanisms that underlie the illness.  The team compared the age of onset and the DNA of over 6000 people with Huntington s disease. They found that biological processes in the body that control the manufacture and repair of DNA can influence the age at which a person will develop the condition.  This discovery could be the key to developing new treatments, explains Professor Jones:  We have known for over 20 years that the number of times a certain sequence of DNA repeats itself plays a part in the age at which the symptoms of Huntington s disease develop. This research goes a step further, and tells us that the way that repeated sequences of DNA are handled by brain cells is likely to be critical in Huntington s disease.  In understanding the mechanisms by which nature influences the age of onset of this devastating condition, we have identified a target for potential treatments. If we can develop a way to interfere with these processes, then we could possibly delay or even prevent the onset of the disease.  Professor Jones stresses that a treatment could still be a decade or more away, but that these new findings open up exciting new avenues for research.  Our findings may not be able to help those already affected by Huntington s disease, but this could prove to be a turning point in how we treat the disease in future generations.

MIT researchers have revealed why proliferating cells   including those in tumors   require mitochondrial respiration. While there are other ways to make ATP, cells can t proliferate without access to electron acceptors provided by respiration.For proliferating cells, there must be plenty of aspartate present to create all of the new cell s RNA and DNA, as well as its proteins. Aspartate is an amino acid, one of the fundamental building blocks of proteins, but unlike the others it is not readily available in the bloodstream   indeed, it seems the body may actively limit blood levels of the amino acid   so each mammalian cell has to make its own. Furthermore, to make aspartate and nucleic acids, cells need to have a place to put extra electrons, because the end product has fewer electrons than the food cells ingest.  This is a problem that all proliferating cells must solve,  says Matthew Vander Heiden, the Eisen and Chang Career Development Associate Professor of Biology, and a member of MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.  It is a problem in metabolism I had not considered before, but there are people in the bacterial world who have spent lots of time on it.  Vander Heiden and his colleagues have been investigating the ways in which mammalian cells solve this problem, to get those excess electrons out of the way. They used cancer cells whose mitochondria   organelles that have their own DNA   were genetically modified to disable respiration. With no intervention, these cells fail to proliferate, and their population gradually declines as some of the cells die off. Add some aspartate, however, and their population grows exponentially, showing that the cells were not able to create their own aspartate without respiration. The researchers then took the experiment a step further to discover the exact role respiration was playing in the production of aspartate. If certain nutrients, such as pyruvate, that can act as electron acceptors are added to the disabled cells, they are able to proliferate just as well, even without aspartate. This suggests that the cells are able to make aspartate using the added pyruvate as a place to put extra electrons when oxygen is not available. This finding is important for cancer research, because it s a loophole cancer cells can use to get around any attack on their respiration.  That s the name of the game for tumors. They ve got to grow bigger,  says Celeste Simon, a professor of cell and developmental biology at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the research.  We didn t appreciate that aspartate was so important. The assumption was that it was about generating metabolic building blocks.  Simon and her colleagues work on metabolic problems in renal cancer.  What Matt s paper tells us is that cells with defects in their electron transfer chains become dependent on pyruvate, which serves as an alternative electron acceptor for generating aspartate,  she says. Since tumors have limited access to nutrients and oxygen, they likely generate aspartate in a different way. Knowing that cancer may be dependent on pyruvate to serve as an alternative electron acceptor, as one way to get around checks on its growth, means that researchers can look at ways to close that loophole. Writing in the same issue of Cell, David Sabatini, a professor of biology at MIT and member of the Whitehead Institute and the Koch Institute, reports on his use of a different approach to determine the link between aspartate and cell respiration. Sabatini and his colleagues conducted a genetic screen using the genome-editing tool CRISPR, which revealed that without the enzyme GOT1, cells will die when respiration is inhibited. Under normal circumstances, GOT1 consumes aspartate to transfer electrons into the mitochondria. Upon further study, the researchers found that when respiration is disabled, GOT1 will attempt to compensate for the lack of mitochondrial aspartate synthesis by catalyzing the reverse reaction, generating   instead of consuming   aspartate in the cytosol, or intracellular fluid. The researchers confirmed that pyruvate will promote this aspartate synthesis, rescuing cell proliferation by creating a place to put extra electrons.  Our work reveals that the main role of respiration in cell proliferation is not energy production, but rather making this simple amino acid, aspartate,  says Kivanc Birsoy, a postdoc in Sabatini s lab.  This result was quite surprising for us."" It s not just cancer research that might benefit from this key insight. For people who suffer from mitochondrial diseases, their conditions   many of them rare   often involve problems in cell respiration.  These are usually viewed in terms of ATP, but some of them might also have to do with electron acceptors,  Vander Heiden says. He also notes that in diseases of aging, mitochondria often seem to malfunction, and some of these defects could result from an electron imbalance. To be doubly sure that pyruvate s role as an electron acceptor was what enabled aspartate production, Vander Heiden tried the same process using another nutrient that only serves as an electron acceptor and fulfills none of the other functions of pyruvate in the cell. The results were identical.

If a gene is damaged or malfunctions, its double can pick up the slack. When it comes to inheritance, however, not all genes are created equal. Led by Catherine Dulac, the Higgins Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, a team of researchers has identified more than 40 new  imprinted  genes, in which either the maternal or paternal copy of a gene is expressed while the other is silenced. The findings reveal how genomic imprinting can dramatically expand biological diversity, and could have important implications for understanding the brain.  We looked at a single brain area   the cerebellum   in a very rigorous way, and found 115 imprinted genes, more than 40 of which were brand-new,  Dulac said.   That is a 30 percent increase in the number of known imprinted genes in the mouse, which is significant, but the other important idea this paper explores is the notion that these imprinted genes provide a way for the diversity of the brain to flourish. In addition to the diversity in our genetic sequence, the question of who are we inheriting these genes from adds to the diversity we see across a population.  The notion of genomic imprinting emerged in the late 1980s, when researchers began manipulating mouse embryos in the moments after fertilization. When sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote, Dulac explained, each temporarily forms a separate pronucleus   one carrying genetic information from the mother, the other from the father. These later fuse to become the nucleus of the embryo. When researchers began manipulating the pronuclei by replacing the paternal version with a second maternal copy, or implanting two paternal copies, embryos failed to develop.  That was very surprising,  Dulac said.  At the time, it was believed that you simply needed two copies of each gene, but this suggested that some genes are expressed only from one of the two parental genomes, and you need both to give rise to a full-blown organism.  After first focusing on the cerebellum, Dulac s team expanded its analysis to the entire brain.  In the second part of the paper, we looked at how these imprinted genes are distributed across the brain, and between brain and non-brain tissue. The big surprise is that we found a very large subset of imprinted genes that are only imprinted in the brain, and some only in a subset of brain regions.  The surprise came in part because scientists have long believed that if a gene is imprinted in one tissue, it is likely imprinted through most of the organism s tissues, including through the brain.  But we don t think that s the case,  Dulac said.  We think there s some very interesting regulation of imprinting from the brain to non-brain tissue, and even from one brain region to another.  While genomic imprinting is often thought to silence one copy of a gene, the study showed that many imprinted genes aren t completely silenced, but rather show a bias toward one copy.  So there may be 70 percent expression from the maternal allele, and 30 percent from the paternal,  Dulac said.  It s not all on or all off.  To understand whether these biases have biological significance, Dulac and colleagues targeted a gene called Bcl-X, which, in the adult cerebellum, is expressed 60 percent from the paternal genome and 40 percent from the maternal, and helps prevent cell death.  Our question is,  Does the brain care about that bias?  Dulac said.  If it doesn t we could remove either copy of the gene, and it shouldn t matter. But if that bias   even though it s not particularly strong   is important, when we remove the more highly expressed copy of the gene, we should see a different phenotype emerge.  When we did this, the results were spectacular. When we removed the paternal copy, we obtained mice with brains that were 15 to 20 percent smaller than mice in which we removed the maternal copy or mice which had both copies.  Importantly, Dulac said, tests showed that, in the cortex, inhibitory neurons were more affected by the change. Many researchers believe that the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neurons plays a key role in brain development, Dulac said, and that an imbalance between the two types could be related to a number of disorders, including autism and schizophrenia.","Published: July 31, 2015"

Scientists are reporting the first clear evidence that muscle cells distribute energy primarily by the rapid conduction of electrical charges through a vast, interconnected network of mitochondria   the cell s  powerhouse    in a way that resembles the wire grid that distributes power throughout a city. The study offers an unprecedented, detailed look at the distribution system that rapidly provides energy throughout the cell where it is needed for muscle contraction. The scientists accomplished the results using state-of-the-art imaging technologies at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This new information may lead to a better understanding of many diseases linked to energy utilization in the heart and skeletal muscle such as heart disease, mitochondrial diseases, and muscular dystrophy, they say.  The discovery of this mechanism for rapid distribution of energy throughout the muscle cell will change the way scientists think about muscle function and will open up a whole new area to explore in health and disease,  says Robert S. Balaban, Ph.D., scientific director of NHLBI s Division of Intramural Research and chief of NHLBI s Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics. Dr. Balaban is the study s co-leader along with Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., a researcher with NCI s Laboratory of Cell Biology.  For the current experiments, the NIH scientists collaborated in a detailed study of the mitochondria structure, biochemical composition, and function in mouse skeletal muscle cells. The researchers used 3D electron microscopy as well as super-resolution optical imaging techniques to show that most of the mitochondria form highly connected networks in a way that resembles electrical transmission lines in a municipal power grid. The movement of muscles, from flexing your arms to the pumping of the heart, requires lots of energy that must be distributed throughout the cell. For example, the skeletal muscle rate of energy utilization can increase 100-fold with strenuous exercise. As a result, muscle cells contain many mitochondria, microscopic structures that are specially equipped to convert foods, including sugars and fats, into useable high-energy molecules, particularly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), for work. As part of this process, known as oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondria, like small cellular batteries, use an electrical voltage across their membranes as an intermediate energy source in converting food into ATP. Thus, this mitochondrial membrane voltage can be considered one of the primary sources of energy in the cell. Scientists have long-believed that mitochondria distribute energy to muscle cells mainly by molecular diffusion, or the slow spread of the end products of oxidative phosphorylation, including ATP and other compounds, through the crowded cell. However, recent genetic studies suggest that diffusion alone does not fully support the distribution of energy in heart and skeletal muscle cells. Researchers have suspected that a faster, more efficient energy pathway might exist but have found little proof of its existence   until now. After using high-resolution 3D images to reveal the structure of the mitochondrial power grid, the scientists used specially designed optical probes to subsequently demonstrate that these mitochondrial  wires  were electrically conductive. Using these probes, the researchers were able to demonstrate that most of the mitochondria were in direct electrical communication through the interconnecting network, demonstrating that the mitochondria are electrically coupled and can rapidly distribute the mitochondrial membrane voltage   the primary energy for ATP production   throughout the cell. The study provides unprecedented images of how these mitochondria are arranged in muscle.  Structurally, the mitochondria are arranged in such a way that permits the flow of potential energy in the form of the mitochondrial membrane voltage throughout the cell to power ATP production and subsequent muscle contraction, or movement,  Dr. Balaban explained. Mitochondria located on the edges of the muscle cell near blood vessels and oxygen supply are optimized for generating the mitochondrial membrane voltage, while the interconnected mitochondria deep in the muscle are optimized for using the voltage to produce ATP, Balaban added.  These observations solve the problem of how muscle rapidly distributes energy in the cell for movement,  Dr. Balaban said.  The findings also challenge the older model that energy is distributed by the slow diffusion of high-energy molecules through the remarkably dense muscle cell.  The use of focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy, called FIB-SEM, played a critical role in unraveling the 3D architecture of mitochondrial networks in these muscle cells. Dr. Subramaniam and his colleagues were the first to develop and use this imaging approach almost a decade ago to image cells and tissue.  We originally developed these biological imaging methods to explore mechanisms of HIV-1 infection and structural changes in melanoma cells,  said Dr. Subramaniam.  It is very satisfying to see how the methods are now useful in a completely different sphere of biology with this interdisciplinary collaboration.  Identifying this basic property of the muscle cell in how it distributes energy has potential implications for disease diagnosis and treatment. These findings could spark new avenues of scientific and medical research, the scientists said. In the future, scientists may use muscle biopsies or sophisticated non-invasive imaging techniques to determine how defects in mitochondrial networks impact different diseases.","Published: July 31, 2015"

The artificial ribosome, called Ribo-T, was created in the laboratories of Alexander Mankin, director of the UIC College of Pharmacy s Center for Biomolecular Sciences, and Northwestern s Michael Jewett, assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering. The human-made ribosome may be able to be manipulated in the laboratory to do things natural ribosomes cannot do. The researchers describe the design and properties of Ribo-T, a ribosome with subunits that will not separate. Ribo-T may be able to be tuned to produce unique and functional polymers for exploring ribosome functions or producing designer therapeutics   and perhaps one day even non-biological polymers.  No one has ever developed something of this nature.   We felt like there was a small   very small   chance Ribo-T could work, but we did not really know,  Mankin said.  Mankin, Jewett and their colleagues were frustrated in their investigations by the ribosomes  subunits falling apart and coming together in every cycle of protein synthesis. Could the subunits be permanently linked together? The researchers devised a novel designer ribosome with tethered subunits   Ribo-T.   What we were ultimately able to do was show that by creating an engineered ribosome where the ribosomal RNA is shared between the two subunits and linked by these small tethers, we could actually create a dual translation system,  Jewett said.   It was surprising that our hybrid chimeric RNA could support assembly of a functional ribosome in the cell. It was also surprising that this tethered ribosome could support growth in the absence of wild-type ribosomes,  he said.  Ribo-T worked even better than Mankin and Jewett believed it could. Not only did Ribo-T make proteins in a test-tube, it was able to make enough protein in bacterial cells that lacked natural ribosomes to keep the bacteria alive.  Jewett and Mankin were surprised by this. Scientists had previously believed that the ability of the two ribosomal subunits to separate was required for protein synthesis.   Obviously this assumption was incorrect,  Jewett said.  Our new protein-making factory holds promise to expand the genetic code in a unique and transformative way, providing exciting opportunities for synthetic biology and biomolecular engineering,  Jewett said.   This is an exciting tool to explore ribosomal functions by experimenting with the most critical parts of the protein synthesis machine, which previously were  untouchable,  Mankin added.

No significant associations between telomere length and other cancer types or subtypes were observed. The study, led by scientists from the University of Chicago, uses a novel method to measure genetic predisposition for telomere length, rather than physiological measures which are confounded by factors such as age and lifestyle.  ""Our work provides compelling evidence of a relationship between long telomeres and increased risk for lung adenocarcinoma,"" said study leader Brandon Pierce, PhD, assistant professor of public health sciences at the University of Chicago. ""The prevailing hypothesis has been that short telomeres are bad for health, but it appears that this does not necessarily translate to some types of cancer."" Telomeres are protective caps of DNA that prevent damage to the ends of chromosomes. A portion of the telomere DNA is lost during cell division. This leads to telomere shortening over time, which has been thought of as a time-delay ""fuse"" that can trigger cell death or genomic instability. Shortened telomeres have been implicated in aging and cardiovascular diseases, but their relationship with cancer risk is thus far unclear. Because telomeres can vary greatly due to factors such as age, lifestyle and cancer progression, efforts to study the direct associations between cancer risk and telomere length have been difficult. To address this issue, Pierce and his colleagues used Mendelian randomization, a method which calculates telomere length based on genetic factors. They created a score based on a combination of genetic variants identified by prior genome-wide association studies as being associated with telomere length. Since genetics remain unchanged even as telomeres physically shorten, this measurement allowed for unbiased comparisons to cancer risk. Using genome data from more than 50,000 cancer cases and 60,000 controls through the GAME-ON (Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology) network, the team compared telomere lengths with the risk of developing breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian and prostate cancers, including subtypes. They found that longer telomeres were significantly associated with increased risk for lung cancer   specifically lung adenocarcinoma, which more than doubled in risk for every 1000 base pair increase in telomere length. Surprisingly, the researchers found no associations between shortened telomeres and cancer risk. Aside from lung cancer, only prostate cancer risk showed a modest positive association with long telomeres. ""Mendelian randomization is an important tool that allows us to examine telomere length without the problematic biases that come with physically measuring it,"" said study author Chenan Zhang, graduate student in public health sciences at the University of Chicago. ""The positive association between telomere length and lung adenocarcinoma should be further investigated with the long term goal of improving prediction and prevention of this common cancer subtype."" The team suggests a potential explanation for this observation is that long telomeres enable more rounds of cell division than short telomeres, which could allow cells to live longer and have more opportunities to accumulate carcinogenic mutations. While their results shed light on the unclear role of telomeres in cancer biology, Pierce and his colleagues warn that Mendelian randomization produces estimates of causal relationships, but the estimates could be biased if the genetic variants measured in the study affect cancer risk and telomere length independently. However, the method holds significant advantages and has successfully been used to investigate associations such as those between heart disease and cholesterol types. The team is now examining telomere length in additional populations to evaluate whether some groups based on age, gender, smoking history and other factors may be at additional increased risk. ""The complex relationship between telomeres and cancer risk is one that we need to further understand,"" Pierce said. ""This study gives us an estimate of a causal relationship that could serve as a guidepost for the development of interventions in the future.""","Published: July 31, 2015"

Some genes are virtually always on, like the clock light on a microwave; others sit unused for years at a time, like some regrettable appliance you bought, stuffed into the back of the closet and forgot. Some genes can be always on in one person and always off in another. A minority of genes switch on and off, like a favorite cell phone app. A new technology, which makes it possible to study the molecules that regulate all of that switching in living people as they go about their lives, has revealed some intriguing surprises, according to a study from the Stanford University School of Medicine. One of those discoveries is that the genes that switch on and off differently from person to person are more likely to be associated with autoimmune diseases. Another is that women and men use different switches to turn on many immune system genes. It s too soon to be sure, but that difference in activity might explain the much higher incidence in women of autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  Part of why this is possible is a new technology that was invented at Stanford for measuring the accessibility of the genome to regulatory elements,  explained the study s senior author Howard Chang, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology. The new technique, called ATAC-seq and developed by Chang s team, lets researchers sample living cells in real time to see what they are up to.  In the past,  he said,  people needed a huge number of cells to do this kind of measurement. You d actually need a pound of flesh to get certain rare cell types. So you can t get that out of a live person   and certainly not more than once, right?  Researchers coped by growing cells in the lab, so they had enough cells to study.  But now,  continued Chang,  you are studying copies of copies; you aren t studying the original cells anymore. Those months of being grown in the lab completely changes how the cells are behaving and so you are no longer looking at the personal. How the laboratory cells behave has nothing to do with what the person just ate, whether they had a fight with their girlfriend or whether they had an infection,  said Chang. With lab-grown cells, the cells haven t experienced any of those things, all of which can alter the regulation of individual genes. The new study took ordinary blood samples from 12 healthy volunteers to measure how certain genes are switched on and off, and how that measure varied from individual to individual. Chang s team also looked at how much change occurred at different times in the same volunteers. The researchers looked exclusively at specialized immune cells called T cells, which are easy to isolate from a standard blood test, easy for volunteers supply and an important component of the immune system. One goal of the study was to establish a baseline measure of how much this gene-switching activity varies among healthy people. That way, when other researchers make similar measures in people who are ill, they ll have an idea of what is normal. Another goal was to refine the new technique for measuring gene activity in standard blood samples.  We were interested in exploring the landscape of gene regulation directly from live people and look at differences,  said Chang.  We asked,  How different or similar are people?  This is different from asking if they have the same genes.  Even in identical twins, he said, one twin could have an autoimmune disease and the other could be perfectly well. And, indeed, the team reported that over a third of the variation in gene activity was not connected to a genetic difference, suggesting a strong role for the environment.  I would say the majority of the difference is likely from a nongenetic source,  he said. Across the 12 healthy volunteers, 7 percent of the genes were switched on in different patterns from person to person. For each person, these patterns persisted over time, like a unique fingerprint.  But the single greatest predictor for genes  tendency to turn on and off was the sex of the person. In terms of significance,  said Chang,  sex was far more important than all the other things we looked at, perhaps even combined.  When the team measured gene activity levels from 30 of the top 500 genes the researchers expected would show gender-influenced activity, they found that 20 of the 30 genes showed significant differential activity between men and women. Chang directs the Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes at Stanford University, which aims to map the  regulome    the complete set of all the switches that turn genes on and off in real time.","Published: July 31, 2015"

The work, which appeared in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics in June, shows that soot pollution on and above the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau area warms the region enough to contribute to earlier snowmelt and shrinking glaciers. A major source of water, such changes could affect the people living there. The study might help policy makers target pollution reduction efforts by pinpointing the sources that make the biggest difference when cut. ""If we really want to address the issue of soot on the Tibetan Plateau,"" said Yun Qian, a study co-author at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, ""we need to know where we should start.""Overall, the work shows that, of worldwide sources, India's wildfires, cooking fuel and fossil fuel burning contribute the most soot to the mountain range and plateau region, followed by fossil fuel burning in China and other East Asian countries. However, the work also zooms in on regions of the plateau. In this close up, India contributes the greatest amount of soot to the most regions, especially the Himalayas and the central Plateau. China contributes the most soot to the northeast Plateau. Finally, sources in central Asia, the Middle East and Tibet are only important to the northwest Plateau. The researchers identified where the soot went and also determined how much warming it caused there. In addition to confirming previous work that soot causes net warming over the entire Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau region, one area stood out. Soot increased the amount of warming on the snowy northwest Plateau in the spring by more than 10 times the annual average of the entire plateau. ""Soot on snow in the northwest plateau causes more warming than all other sources in the area,"" said corresponding author Hailong Wang, an atmospheric scientist at PNNL. ""It's bigger than the effect of greenhouse gases and soot in the atmosphere. The strong heating caused by soot on snow and in the atmosphere can change air circulation over the Plateau, leading to a broader impact on climate."" Often called the Third Pole due to how much ice and snow accumulates there, the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau are the source of major rivers in nearby countries and changes to them can affect the largest populations in China and India. The mass of frozen water also contributes to the global climate, which is changing as Earth's temperature rises. Although earlier work showed soot's warming effect over the whole region, the researchers wanted to pinpoint what kind of sources contribute. The team looked specifically at fossil fuel sources, biofuel and biomass sources of soot. For example, people in the surrounding countries use much wood, grass and agricultural wastes to cook with, which the team categorized as biofuel. To track the soot, the team developed a new way to tag the soot particles emitted from individual sources within a climate model. The method had advantages over other source-attribution methods, which either don't completely isolate contributions from particular sources or require running the model many times to turn the sources off and on one at a time. Essentially, the team ""dyed"" 16 sources of soot in a well-known climate model called the Community Atmosphere Model version 5, also known as CAM5. After running the model, the team compared the model's results to actual soot data taken from seven sites in the Tibetan Plateau/Himalayan region and to satellite data of snow cover to see how well it represented soot and snowfall. The model performed well, and taking into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the model, the team focused on the soot. While the soot tracker showed where the soot fell or where it hovered in the air above ground, the tracker also showed the path the soot took to its ending position. ""We got a vertical and horizontal view of the pathways,"" said Wang. ""Not only where the soot came from, but also how the air moves it, and how much got removed on its path."" By zooming in on the plateau, the scientists got a great bit of detail, more than would have shown up on a global map. In the close up, the majority of soot that arrives in the Himalayas and the central Plateau comes from biofuel and fossil fuel burning in India; soot arriving in the northeast Plateau in all seasons and the southeast Plateau in the summer come from fossil fuel and biomass burning in China. In the northwest Plateau, emissions from central Asia and the Middle East also contribute significantly. Running the computer model in this way not only showed which source sent the most soot over, but also can determine which source would make the biggest impact if emissions are cut. The soot destination that changed the most was the northwest Plateau by cuts in central Asia's fossil fuel burning. Cuts in South Asia can effectively reduce the soot level on the entire plateau, especially in the Himalayas. ""The model can be used to test how efficient it would be to cut any particular amount of worldwide emissions,"" said Wang. ""For example, if we wanted to cut global emissions by an eighth, our results can tell us where to cut from to make the biggest reduction on the Tibetan Plateau."" The authors suggest this type of research could be helpful to policymakers interested in reducing the effects of climate change at the Third Pole.","Published: July 31, 2015"

Gudjonson s project focuses on lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that s found in vertebrates  immune systems. In addition to the three main types of lymphocytes T cells, B cells, and NK cells immunologists have recently identified new types of innate lymphoid cells, each of which is tailored to play a specific role in defending the body from foreign invaders. All these varieties originate from a common progenitor cell and only mature later into their more specialized forms, but exactly how a cell  knows  what form to take is unclear.It s impossible to track all the proteins in the cell, so instead, Gudjonson and co-workers are measuring concentrations of messenger RNA, an intermediary between the DNA and the final proteins. A cell s mRNA can be extracted and sequenced relatively easily, thanks to recent advances in DNA sequencing technology. Being one level removed from proteins, it s  not the full story,  said Dinner.  It s a shadow in some sense.  For one thing, the mRNA can t tell you if the protein is in an active or inactive state. For another, the measurements of the mRNA themselves aren t perfect, he cautioned.  You re effectively doing a massively parallel measurement inside your test tube,  Dinner said.  You ll have some variations in each one of those measurements and need a probabilistic model to reconstruct the actual information from that measurement.  Despite all this, the researchers say it s the best data they can get for all species in cell at the same time. The interdependent probabilities and statistical analyses demanded by this project called for high-performance computing. Having access to the Research Computing Center s Midway doesn t just speed up their research, explained Gudjonson.  It gives you more flexibility in the kinds of test you can choose,  making more difficult analyses easier and allowing the researchers to approach problems in multiple ways. In addition, the researchers used Midway to run verifications on their experiments, and RCC set up guest accounts on Midway for the Dinner group s collaborators at Northwestern University. This allowed them to share data with their Chicago counterparts and review the results seamlessly. Gudjonson s work has already helped to identify key intermediary steps in the development of lymphocytes, showing that certain cells express molecules associated with two or more different types of cells before  deciding  on which immune response specialization to take up. The next step, said Dinner, is trying to apply machine learning techniques to explore the sequence of the cells  developmental steps, as well as to better understand what fraction of cells at one stage of development become each type at the next.  In principle,  Dinner said,  these studies could lead to therapies for congenital immune deficiencies, and also for associated cancers.

This discovery, published in the journal Neuron, could help researchers to develop new drugs that promote better sleep, or control hyperactivity in people with the medical condition mania. Scientists altered the neurochemistry of mice to help investigate why we need to sleep, what controls our wakefulness, and how a balance between these two states influences brain functions like concentration and memory and our general health. The chemicals they studied, histamine and GABA, are produced in a primitive part of the brain that is highly similar in mice and humans. The team of scientists was led by Dr Stephen Brickley, Professor Nick Franks and Professor Bill Wisden from the Department of Life Sciences and the Centre for Neurotechnology at Imperial College London. Professor Wisden said, ""Sleep is essential for health. We have to do it every day. But nobody yet knows why."" Scientists already know the chemical histamine sends signals to the brain to make it awake, which is why antihistamines are associated with drowsiness. The new research suggests that the chemical GABA acts against histamine, like a chemical 'brake' preventing wakefulness being too intense. The researchers found that GABA and histamine are made in the same brain cells, called histamine neurons, which led the scientists to question its function. They altered the levels of the GABA produced by the mice's brains and measured what changes this had on their brain activity over the day and night. Mice without the GABA chemical developed characteristics similar to a medical condition called mania, in which patients experience restlessness and sleeplessness. In humans these are often also symptoms of bipolar disorder, which affects around 2.4 million people in the UK. ""Wakefulness stimulated by histamine may be too much of a good thing, and so the brain has a built in brake on histamine s wake-inducing actions,"" said Dr Brickley. The scientists found that compared with normal mice, those without GABA ran twice as far and twice as fast, and maintained or even increased their overall activity over a 30 minute period. The mice also stayed awake much longer in the day, when they would otherwise be asleep. When they did sleep, the mice experienced just 65 per cent of the normal amount of non-REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a heavy sleep state with no dreaming. ""What particularly surprised us was how little the mice were affected by sleep deprivation,"" said Professor Franks. ""Normally mice that lose 5 hours of sleep would sleep for longer following this deprivation, and we would see a much lower level of activity. These mice kept up their hyperactive state over the following 16 hours they were awake. They didn't appear to need any recovery sleep at all. ""The scientists have begun new work with mice to investigate the link between lack of sleep and memory loss. They hope this will lead to a better understanding of the link between poor sleep and mental health issues in humans. Imperial College of London   press release Xiao Yu, Zhiwen Ye, Catriona M.

They can devastate lives, careers, and families. Some severely ill patients may be unable to attend to even the basic elements of self-care, while others attempt or complete suicide. Because of the clinical urgency, deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatments for depression have been developed over the past 15 years. These treatments require surgery to make a small hole in the skull through which an electrode is passed into a specific brain region. Once positioned, a standard electrical stimulation procedure is initiated, which is modeled after highly effective DBS treatments that are used for Parkinson s disease, essential tremor, and other neurologic conditions. DBS does not damage healthy brain tissue. It works by using electrical pulses to  block  neural signals from the targeted brain area that is the known or suspected source of the symptoms. A large number of relatively small open-label studies have supported the effectiveness of various forms of DBS for both depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the current issue of Biological Psychiatry, Dr. Darin Dougherty and his colleagues report the results of the first large-scale, randomized, sham-controlled trial of deep brain stimulation treatment for treatment-resistant symptoms of depression. Thirty patients received active DBS or sham  placebo  stimulation for 16 weeks, targeted at the ventral capsule and ventral striatum, brain regions implicated in reward and motivation. A two-year open-label continuation phase followed. This study, conducted at five medical centers across the U.S. that collaborated on the project, failed to find that DBS reduced depression symptoms better than sham stimulation.  While initial open-label trials of DBS at the ventral capsule/ventral striatum target were promising, the results of this first controlled trial were negative,  explained Dougherty, Director of Neurotherapeutics at Massachusetts General Hospital and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Thomas Schlaepfer, an expert on DBS treatment unaffiliated with this study, from Johns Hopkins University and University Hospital Bonn in Germany, wrote a companion piece to this article and commented,  On first sight, this might be seen as a crisis for the whole field of neurostimulation therapies for depression  [but we] believe that these are examples of failed studies and not failed treatments.   This study raises serious questions about the advisability of continuing to stimulate these reward regions in the manner employed in this study,  said Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry.  It is critical to understand that this study is not a universal indictment of DBS as a strategy for depression. It may turn out that stimulating other brain regions or stimulating these regions in different ways could provide important benefit.   Given the degree of response that we have seen in some of the most treatment refractory patients, we agree with Dr. Schlaepfer and Dr. Krystal. Alternative study designs will have to be considered as we conduct future clinical trials in this critical area,  concluded Dougherty. press release Darin D. Dougherty, Ali R. Rezai, Linda L.

Specifically, drugs to treat late-stage cancers are less costly to develop than drugs for earlier-stage cancers, partly because the late-stage drugs extend people s lives for shorter durations of time. This means that the clinical trials for such drugs get wrapped up more quickly, too   and provide drug manufacturers more time to control patented drugs in the marketplace. There is a pattern where we get more investment in drugs that take a short time to complete, and less investment in drugs that take a longer time to complete,  says MIT economist Heidi Williams, co-author of a new paper in the American Economic Review that details the findings of the study. The social cost is significant: The researchers estimate that the lack of investment in longer-term drugs resulted in a loss of 890,000 life-years among people diagnosed with cancer in the year 2003 alone. The paper also suggests three policy adjustments that might produce more long-term research on anti-cancer drugs. The finding  doesn t mean that the private firms are doing anything wrong,  Williams adds, given the incentives they face. However, she observes,  The public sector is more willing to invest in these long-term projects than is the private sector,  suggesting that new policies could produce more types of drugs for patients. The paper is co-authored by Williams, who is the Class of 1957 Career Development Assistant Professor in MIT s Department of Economics; Eric Budish, an economist at the University of Chicago s Booth School of Business; and Benjamin Roin, an assistant professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed four decades of data from a variety of comprehensive sources, including the National Cancer Institute, which has a registry of clinical trials and data on cancer incidence and survival in the U.S., as well as data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves anti-cancer drugs. In all, the study encompassed over 200 subcategories of cancers detected at different stages of development. Before reaching their conclusions, however, the researchers had to establish that the tendency toward short-term drug research was due significantly to the shorter duration of clinical trials. They concluded this, in part, by studying what happens when clinical trials do not use mortality to establish effectiveness, but instead use  surrogate endpoints    that is, biomarkers that stand as proxies for eventual outcomes and help estimate how effective the drugs will be. By examining the historical data, Budish, Roin, and Williams found that in some cases where surrogate endpoints are allowed in cancer research clinical trials   including many types of leukemias   there were relatively more trials and money poured into research, other things being equal.  When you have good surrogate endpoints, you see a dramatic increase in R&D investment, which means lives saved,  Roin says. Budish, Roin, and Williams suggest three new policy approaches that could, they think, spark the development of a greater number of long-term cancer drugs. The first is continued use of surrogate endpoints   or at least, initially, more research to find out if wider use of surrogate endpoints for additional cancers is valid. A second possible policy change is more public funding of research and development for anti-cancer drugs, since such funding is free of short-term, private-sector shareholder pressure to produce returns. There are only six cancer drugs in existence that are preventative in nature   and all six have been developed because of public funding, or relied on surrogate endpoints. These first two points, are related, Williams emphasizes, noting,  No individual private firm wants to come in and provide all of the evidence that you need to validate a surrogate endpoint, because once one is validated, that s going to be used by all of the firms on the market.  A third potential new policy, suggest the researchers, would be changing the terms of drug patents, which typically run from the time of patent filing, to run from the time when the drug hits the market. That said, the FDA can currently grant exemptions that lengthen drug patents to account for the time R&D takes. Roin, an expert in patent law and biomedical innovation, says future congressional changes to this policy are  extremely realistic, although it would take time.  Other scholars who have read the paper say it makes a significant contribution in the economics of medical innovation.  It's a persuasive and important paper,  says David Ridley, a health economist at Duke University s Fuqua School of Business. The researchers, he thinks, have  carefully demonstrated how these incentives drive drug discovery. They were able to explain why some types of cancer receive more attention than others. The results are relevant beyond cancer, though. Consider hormone therapies: Before approving these hormone therapies, the FDA wants years of data to demonstrate that they are safe in long-term use. But years of data are expensive because of the time value of money, and because the patent clock is ticking.  In the larger picture, Ridley adds,  It s worthwhile to ask whether a  one-size-fits-all  patent policy is optimal.  Williams emphasizes that, as economists, she and her colleagues are only advocating the use of surrogate endpoints where they have been accepted by the consensus within mainstream medicine. As it happens, surrogate endpoints have been validated and used regarding heart disease through the Framingham Heart Study, a major, multidecade project, although their incorporation into cancer research has been more gradual.  We re not attempting to be doctors,  Williams says.","Published: July 30, 2015"

From early 2018, the Consortium will form a major constituent of the new Milner Therapeutics Institute, which has been made possible through a  5 million donation from Jonathan Milner and will be located in a new building at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, the centrepiece of the largest biotech cluster outside the United States. The Consortium will connect academic and clinical researchers at the University of Cambridge, the Babraham Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute with pharmaceutical companies Astex Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). It will provide researchers with the potential to access novel therapeutic agents (including small molecules and antibodies) across the entire portfolio of drugs being developed by each of the companies, in order to investigate their mechanism, efficacy and potential. The terms of the Consortium allow for fast and easy access to these agents and information. Each industry partner within the Therapeutics Consortium has committed funding to spend on collaborative projects and will collectively fund an executive manager to oversee the academic/industry interactions. Collaborative projects are expected to lead to joint publications, supporting a culture of more open innovation. Professor Tony Kouzarides from the University of Cambridge, who will head the Therapeutics Consortium and the Milner Institute, is currently deputy director at the Gurdon Institute. He says:  The Milner Institute will act as a  match-making  service through the Therapeutics Consortium, connecting the world-leading research potential of the University of Cambridge and partner institutions with the drug development expertise and resources of the pharmaceutical industry. We hope many more pharmaceutical companies will join our consortium and believe this form of partnership is a model for how academic institutions and industry can work together to deliver better medicines.  Dr Harren Jhoti, President and CEO of Cambridge-based company Astex Pharmaceuticals, now part of Japan s Otsuka Group, said:  As a company that was founded right here in Cambridge we are delighted to support this new Consortium working together with leading Cambridge academic and clinical researchers to help us to research and develop ever better treatments for patients.  Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicines & Early Development at AstraZeneca said:  We are pleased to be part of this exciting new consortium that brings together world-leading science and technology into a dedicated multi-disciplinary institute focused on translational research.  The proximity of the Institute to our new R&D centre and global headquarters in Cambridge will ensure our scientists can work closely with those at the Milner Institute.  Professor Michael Wakelam, Director of the Babraham Institute, said:  The Institute s participation in the Therapeutics Consortium provides yet one more channel by which our excellence in basic biological research is built upon in partnership with industry-based collaborators. We know from experience that bringing together the best academics and the best pharmacological research is both efficient and enlightening and we look forward to making joint progress.  Dr Rab Prinjha, Head of GSK s Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, said:  Late-stage attrition is too high   very few investigational medicines entering human trials eventually become an approved treatment.  As an industry, we must improve our success rate by understanding our molecules and targets better.  This innovative institute which builds on GSK s very successful collaboration with the Gurdon Institute and close links with many groups across Cambridge, aims to increase our knowledge of basic biological mechanisms to help us bring the right investigational medicines into human trials and ultimately to patients.  The Consortium will initially operate from the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, but will move into the Milner Institute in early 2018. One of the major aims of the Institute will be to help understand how drugs work and to push forward new ideas and technologies to improve the development of novel therapies. A major, but not exclusive, focus of the Institute will be cancer. It is envisaged that the Milner Institute will be equipped with core facilities, such as high-throughput screening of small molecules against cell lines, organoids ( mini organs ) and tumour biopsies, as well as bioinformatics support to help scientists deal with large datasets. Its facilities will be available to researchers working on collaborative projects within the Therapeutics Consortium and, capacity permitting, to other scientists and clinicians within the Cambridge community. In addition, the Milner Institute will have space for senior and junior scientists to set up independent research groups. There will also be associated faculty positions, which will be taken up by scientists in different departments, whose research and expertise will benefit from a close association with the Milner Institute. The Milner Institute will be housed within the new Capella building, alongside the relocated Wellcome Trust/MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, a new Centre for Blood & Leukaemia Research, and a new Centre for Immunology & Immunotherapeutics. Jonathan Milner, whose donation has made the Milner Therapeutics Institute possible, is a former member of Tony Kouzarides  research group and experienced entrepreneur. In 1998 they founded leading biotechnology company Abcam together with Professor David Cleevely, which has gone on to employ over 800 people and supply products to 64% of researchers globally.","Published: July 30, 2015"

Natural killer cells, or NK cells, are lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. NK cells  increased diversity, the scientists learned, may stem from prior exposures to viruses. The findings could spur the development of blood tests capable of flagging individuals  susceptibility to viral infection. The study also offers insights into the workings of NK cells, a somewhat poorly understood but crucial group of immune cells.   This puts NK-cell diversity on the map as a metric of immune function,  said Catherine Blish, MD, PhD, assistant professor of infectious diseases and geographical medicine and the study s senior author.  But it was a first foray. Before we can say definitively that NK-cell diversity predicts a person s susceptibility to infection, we need to validate these findings by looking at large numbers of individuals in a different population.  NK cells are particularly suited to detecting and demolishing virally infected or cancerous cells,  Blish added.  They arrive on the scene quickly, and they act quickly. An NK cell can kill an infected cell in 10 minutes.  Unexpectedly, it was higher, rather than lower, diversity in this immune-cell population that turned out to be associated with increased HIV susceptibility in the study. The investigators had figured that, as is the case with B cells and T cells   the two other, better-known types of lymphocytes   diversity in NK cells would be a strength, not a detriment, Blish said.  Our hypothesis was wrong,  she said.  We didn t think NK-cell diversity would be a bad thing, or that NK cells  diversification would occur to the extent that it does with viral exposure.  Using a cutting-edge, single-cell analytic technology called mass cytometry, Blish and her colleagues, including the study s lead author, graduate student Dara Strauss-Albee, showed that overall diversity in people s NK-cell repertoires is low at birth and steadily accumulates over the course of a lifetime. An individual T cell has surface receptors that recognize unique protein snippets, called peptides, on other cells  surfaces. The structures of these receptors, which can discern  healthy  versus  suspect  peptides, differs from T cell to T cell. So a healthy person s legion of T cells can surveil and sort out hundreds of millions of different peptides representing possible invaders. Unlike their T cell cousins, NK cells don t have surface receptors that recognize unique peptides. Instead, these lymphocytes harbor various combinations of generic receptors. Some receptors recognize signs of other cells  normalcy, and others recognize signs that a cell is stressed   due, say, to viral infection or cancerous mutation. On recognizing their targeted features on other cells  surfaces, an NK cell s  normalcy  receptors tend to inhibit it, while its stress-recognizing receptors activate it. All told, NK cells can have many thousands of different combinations of these receptors on their surfaces, with each combination yielding a slightly different overall activation threshold. An NK cell s surface features also vary depending on its degree of maturation. Mass cytometry analysis of NK cells exposed in a dish to HIV   as well as to West Nile virus, which differs substantially from HIV in its makeup and its modus operandi   showed that exposure to virus-infected cells leads to differentiation of NK cells and to an increased diversity among them. But diversification in the NK-cell population, the experiments indicated, was associated with a diminished ability of these cells  ability to replicate and kill. The researchers also showed that while healthy human adults differ considerably from one another in the diversity of their NK-cell populations, a given adult s NK-cell population remains quite stable, changing little over periods of many months. An examination of NK cells extracted from umbilical-cord blood showed that newborns  NK-cell population is much less diverse. Blish said she believes that viral exposure during one s lifetime is the driving force behind the maturation, differentiation and diversification of NK cells. In order to assess the impact of NK-cell diversity on adult humans  viral susceptibility, Blish and her associates turned to blood samples that had been drawn during the Mama Salama Study, a longitudinal study of just over 1,300 healthy pregnant or postpartum Kenyan women. In that study, 25 of the women were found to have HIV. For 13 of these women, blood drawn both before and after infection was available. Using mass cytometry, the researchers carried out a precise analysis of NK cells in the women s blood and observed a strong positive correlation between the diversity of a woman s NK cell population and her likelihood of becoming infected with HIV. This correlation held up when the scientists controlled for age, marital status, knowledge of sexual partners  HIV status and history of trading sex for money or goods. The two groups of women were also statistically indistinguishable with respect to their sexually transmitted disease status or their reported frequency of recent unprotected sex. The NK-diversity-dependent difference in these women s likelihood of HIV infection was huge. Those with the most NK-cell diversity were 10 times as likely as those with the least diversity to become infected. A 10-fold risk increase based solely on NK-cell diversity is far from negligible, said Blish.  By way of comparison, having syphilis increases the risk of contracting HIV two- to four-fold, while circumcised men s HIV risk is reduced by a factor of 2.5 or 3,  she said. The observations could have clinical potential, most immediately by spotlighting people who need to be closely monitored for possible viral infections and, perhaps, prophylactically treated. But Blish cautioned that the study remains preliminary.","Published: July 30, 2015"

Acetylation is a means by which a cell can control the expression of its genes.The study reveals the effect of lysine acetylation in histone tails. ""The most relevant acetylation reactions take place in a mysterious part of the nucleosome: the histone tails,"" explains Modesto Orozco. ""Histone tails are loosely structured protein fragments. They are unfolded under normal conditions and when they move, they can touch other nucleosomes, thereby condensing chromatin,"" he adds. Nucleosomes are structures that make up the fundamental units of chromatin, which is the complex within which DNA is organized in eukaryotic cells. Using simulation and nuclear magnetic resonance, the researchers found that the histone tails with lysine acetylation acquire a certain structure. ""By forming this structure, they become shorter and lose their ability to touch other nucleosomes. As a result, the internucleosomal contact that condenses unmodified chromatin, doesn't happen and this produces DNA molecules that are more accessible to effector proteins and therefore more active,"" the researcher describes. This is the first mechanical explanation at the atomic level of an epigenetic effect, one of the most important, that connects an epigenetic modification with a phenotypic effect,"" assures Orozco. ""This leads us to believe that there is a similar explanation for other epigenetic modifications. There may be a very basic mechanism that accounts for the effect that they have on gene structure and expression,"" he concludes.","Published: July 30, 2015"

However, it can be difficult to discover the genetics driving a patient's cancer, and the effects of drugs designed to target a genetic abnormality often go beyond their intended target alone. The result is threefold: sometimes a drug is prescribed to treat a target that proves to be irrelevant to the disease, sometimes an existing drug could be used to treat a cancer for which there is no approved targeted therapy, and sometimes a combination of targeted treatments could be used to simultaneously silence more than one genetic cause of a patient's cancer. ""For example, we know that the disease Chronic Myeloid Leukemia is driven by the fusion gene bcr-abl and we can treat this with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which targets this abnormality. But for many other cancers, the genetic cause and best treatments are less distinct. The KAR tool clarifies the drug or combination of drugs that best targets the specific genetic abnormalities driving a patient's cancer,"" says Aik Choon Tan, PhD, investigator at the CU Cancer Center, associate professor of Bioinformatics at the CU School of Medicine, and the paper's senior author. KAR makes its predictions based on two data sources. First is data describing the full spectrum of effects of the drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). ""A lot of these kinase inhibitors inhibit a lot more than what they're supposed to inhibit. Maybe drug A was designed to inhibit kinase B, but it also inhibits kinase C and D as well. Our approach centers on exploiting the promiscuity of these drugs, the 'drug spillover',"" says Tan. For example, the drug crizotinib was designed, tested, and approved to silence the ALK-EML fusion gene that drives a subset of lung cancers, but also happens to act against a similar rearrangement of the ROS1 gene. The paper reports the successful treatment of patients with ROS1 rearrangement, with the drug crizotinib. In this case, what researchers and doctors first called an ""ALK inhibitor"" turns out to have other, important uses. And, in fact, for each drug in this class of kinase inhibitors, there is a profile or signature describing the few or many kinases each drug fully or partially inhibits. Tan and colleagues combine these kinase inhibition signatures with the results of high-throughput screening - a method for testing hundreds of drugs against a panel of cancer cells. Specifically, Tan used the publicly available Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database to discover which compounds have been shown to be active against which cancer cell lines. The result is KAR, which does two things: for any cancer cell line, like those derived from a patient with cancer, the program ranks the kinases that are most important to the growth of the disease; then the program recommends the combination of existing kinase inhibitors drugs (TKIs) that is likely to do the most good against the implicated kinases. The recent paper describes the success of the KAR tool. First, based on samples from 151 leukemia patients, KAR was able to correctly predict the outcomes of patients treated with certain drugs. The same was true in 21 lung cancer cell lines - KAR predicted the degree of sensitivity of these cells to certain drugs, matching the results of experiments that show these sensitivities. Finally, the researchers asked KAR to rank the kinases most important to the proliferation of the lung cancer cell line H1581 and to recommend a combination of targeted treatments to attack these cells. KAR suggested the combination of ponatinib with experimental anti-cancer agent AZD8055, and, in fact, this combination proved highly effective at controlling these cells, creating what the researchers call a ""synergistic reduction in proliferation."" ""This is a new tool, a new way of looking at drugs and how we combine drugs to target kinase dependency in cancer,"" Tan says.","Published: July 30, 2015"

The findings suggest that the current approach, in which vaccine design is guided by an understanding of structure of viral components and their interactions with host cells, holds promise for developing a similar human MERS vaccine regimen. Currently, no licensed vaccines are available for MERS, a disease that first appeared in 2012. An outbreak in the Republic of Korea that began in May has caused more than 180 confirmed infections, including 36 deaths, through July 15 as well as widespread social disruption.The research team was led by Barney S. Graham, M.D., Ph.D., Wing-Pui Kong, Ph.D., and colleagues at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  Vaccine Research Center. The investigators used structural information about a viral protein called the spike (S) glycoprotein, which MERS-CoV uses to enter cells, to design a number of experimental vaccines that they administered to mice in a two-step regimen involving an initial  priming  injection followed several weeks later by the same or a different  booster  vaccine. The three prime-boost regimens that elicited the most robust immune responses in mice were then tested in groups of macaques and were found to elicit similar immune system responses. A separate group of 18 macaques (12 vaccinated, six unvaccinated) were exposed to MERS-CoV 19 weeks after the vaccinated animals received the boost injection. Although macaques do not develop overt MERS disease, the researchers observed that unvaccinated animals experienced lung abnormalities indicative of pneumonia that were more profound and longer lasting than those seen in the vaccinated animals.

Their bodies lack the ability to make the clotting factor responsible for the coagulation of blood so any cut or bruise can turn into an emergency without immediate treatment.  Hemophilia A occurs in about 1 in 5,000 male births and almost half of severe cases are caused by identified  chromosomal inversions .  In a chromosomal inversion, the order of the base pairs on the chromosome are reversed so the gene doesn t express properly and the sufferer lacks the blood coagulation factor VIII (F8) gene, which causes blood to clot in healthy people.A Korean team led by Director of the Center for Genome Engineering Jin-Soo Kim, Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and Professor Dong-Wook Kim at Yonsei University has experimented with hemoplia A-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and hemoplia mice and found a way to correct this inversion and reverse the clotting factor deficiency that causes hemophilia A.  This was the first time a type of stem cell called iPSCs--which possess the ability to change into any cell type in the body--was used in a procedure like this. The urinary cells were collected from patients with the chromosomal inversions causing hemophilia to make iPSCs, the team applied CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR associated protein 9) to them.  The CRISPR-Cas9 reverted the F8 genes which enabled them to function correctly.  Corrected-iPSCs were induced to differentiate into mature endothelial cells which expressed the F8 gene.  These new endothelial cells were able to reverse the F8 deficiency.  To verify that the process worked, the endothelial cells with the inversion-corrected genes were transplanted into F8 deficient mice (mice with hemophilia A) and the mice started producing the F8 clotting factor on their own, which essentially cured them of hemophilia A. According to Director Jin-Soo Kim,  We used CRISPR RGENs [RNA-guided engineered nucleases] to repair two recurrent, large chromosomal inversions responsible for almost half of all severe hemophilia A cases.  Professor Dong-Wook Kim added,  To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first demonstration that chromosomal inversions or other large rearrangements can be corrected using RGENs or any other programmable nuclease in patient iPSCs.  What may be equally as important to the ability to reverse the chromosomal inversion is the fact that there was no evidence of off-target mutations resulting from the correction.  This was a precision procedure: only the parts of genome that the team wanted to change were affected. These findings open the door for further testing and if the results are anything like the mice trials, the future of this treatment looks promising.","Published: July 30, 2015"

AIS is a complex and mysterious disease with awkward spinal deformities that can be a nightmare for affected people,  explains team leader Shiro Ikegawa.  We were excited to find a single nucleotide polymorphism located on human chromosome number nine that is significantly associated with the disease. The discovery began with a genome-wide association study using more than ten thousand volunteers with and without scoliosis. This type of study looks for small differences in genes called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs that occur more frequently in people with a certain disease. After confirming the association between a particular SNP (pronounced  snip ) in two additional independent populations one in Japan and one in China they determined that it is located near the part of the DNA that codes for the protein BNC2. The team then examined where BNC2 is expressed in humans. Using quantitative RT-PCR, they found that it is most highly expressed in the uterus, spinal cord, bone, and cartilage.  This result told us that we were on the right track,  says Ikegawa,  and evidence that the SNP variation associated with the disease led to higher levels of BNC2 expression told us that this SNP has the potential to regulate expression of BNC2.  The team tested this hypothesis and found that not only was BNC2 expression triggered by the protein YY1 which binds to the DNA around the SNP but that for genes with the at-risk SNP variant, the amount of BNC2 produced when YY1 was present was much greater than for genes with the non-risk variant. The BNC2 gene is highly conserved across diverse species, and plays roles in a variety of tissues. To test how over-expression of BNC2 affects development, the team expressed it in zebrafish embryos and found that it resulted in severe body curvature that was positively correlated to the amount of BNC2. These results and the abundance of BNC2 in the human spine and bones make it likely that adolescents with the disease-associated SNP variant may begin to produce excess BNC2 at puberty if other genetic or environmental factors are also present. The next step is to understand how BNC2 causes scoliosis and why it is so much more prevalent in women than in men.  The expression of BNC2 in the uterus and changes that occur during puberty could help explain the large sex difference,  explains Ikegawa.  Additionally, knowing what genes are downstream of BNC2 will provide us with potential targets for therapeutic interventions. ","Published: July 30, 2015"

These findings are published in the Journal of Alzheimer s Disease.   Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal stage of Alzheimer s disease (AD) and dementia. As no effective treatment exists to modify the natural history of this neurodegenerative disorder, the identification and subsequent management of risk/protective factors may be crucial for prevention of MCI and its progression to AD and dementia. Among diet-associated factors, coffee is regularly consumed by millions of people around the world and owing to its caffeine content, it is the best known psychoactive stimulant resulting in heightened alertness and arousal and improvement of cognitive performance. Besides short-term effects of caffeine-containing beverages, some case-control and cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies evaluated the long-term effects on brain function and provided evidence that coffee, tea, or caffeine consumption or higher plasma caffeine levels may be protective against cognitive impairment and dementia, with some notable exceptions. An interesting finding in this study was that cognitively normal older individuals who modified their habits by increasing with time their amount of coffee consumption (> 1 cup of coffee/day) had about two times higher rate of MCI compared to those with reduced habits (< 1 cup of coffee/day) and about one and half time higher rate of MCI in comparison with those with constant habits (neither more nor less 1 coffee/day). Moreover, those who habitually consumed moderate amount of coffee (1 or 2 cups of coffee/day) had a reduced rate of the incidence of MCI than those who habitually never or rarely consumed coffee. No significant association was verified between who habitually consumed higher levels of coffee consumption (> 2 cups of coffee/day) and the incidence of MCI in comparison with those who never or rarely consumed coffee.   These findings from the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging suggested that cognitively normal older individuals who never or rarely consumed coffee and those who increased their coffee consumption habits had a higher risk of developing MCI. Therefore, moderate and regular coffee consumption may have neuroprotective effects also against MCI confirming previous studies on the long-term protective effects of coffee, tea, or caffeine consumption and plasma levels of caffeine against cognitive decline and dementia,  said investigators Vincenzo Solfrizzi, MD, PhD, and Francesco Panza, MD, PhD, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy. The authors hypothesized different potential mechanisms in explaining the neuroprotective effects of coffee consumption observed in this study. The long-term neuroprotective effect of caffeine may involve competitive antagonism of excessive activation of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs), which may attenuate damage caused by ?-amyloid (A?), the toxic peptide accumulating in AD brains. Indeed, both acute or long-term caffeine administration were shown to reduce brain A? levels in AD transgenic mice and memory restoration and reversal of AD pathology in mice with pre-existing A? burden. Adenosine is a neuromodulator that operates via the most abundant inhibitory adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs) and the less abundant, but widespread, facilitatory A2ARs. A1Rs play a key role in neuroprotection, decreasing glutamate release and hyperpolarizing neurons, and their activation attenuates brain damage, whereas their blockade exacerbates damage in adult animals.  In contrast, A2ARs blockade confers robust brain neuroprotection in adult animals. Moreover, while central A1Rs  are down-regulated by chronic noxious situations, the brain neuroprotective effect of A2AR antagonists is maintained in chronic noxious brain conditions without observable peripheral effects, thus justifying the interest of A2AR antagonists as novel protective agents in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Therefore, the ability of caffeine to prevent memory deterioration in animal models of aging or AD may be related to the action of A2ARs rather than A1Rs, suggesting that an adequate adenosinergic tonus is required for normal memory performance and that over- or down-activation of the adenosine system may result in impaired memory functioning.  This hypothesis could in part explain why, as shown in this study, both no or rare and higher consumption of coffee (> 2 cups/day) were associated with higher risk of the incidence of MCI. Accordingly, moderate doses of caffeine improve memory performance in rodents, whereas higher doses of caffeine may impair memory acquisition. Biological effects of caffeine on brain function also included modulation of white matter lesions and/or microvascular ischemic lesions, and improved insulin sensitivity, so reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, which is a strong risk factor for cognitive decline. Moreover, caffeine could in part compensate the cognitive decline in older individuals because its effects on vigilance and attention, mainly in situations of reduced alertness. Finally, habitual and moderate consumption of coffee may prevent MCI through attenuation of subclinical neuroinflammation, and reduction in oxidative stress.  The authors concluded:  More sensitive outcomes such as findings from neuroimaging studies should become available from experimental data, so further explaining the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of coffee, tea, and caffeine consumption. Larger studies with longer follow-up periods should be encouraged, addressing other potential bias and confounding sources, so hopefully opening new ways for diet-related prevention of dementia and AD.

New research on the brain s capacity to learn suggests there s more to it than the adage that  practise makes perfect.  A music-training study by scientists at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital -The Neuro, at McGill University and colleagues in Germany found evidence to distinguish the parts of the brain that account for individual talent from the parts that are activated through training. The research involved brain imaging studies of 15 young adults with little or no musical background who were scanned before and after they underwent six weeks of musical training. Participants were required to learn simple piano pieces. Brain activity in certain areas changed after learning, indicating the effect of training. But the activity in a different set of brain structures, measured before the training session had started, predicted which test subjects would learn quickly or slowly.  Predisposition plays an important role for auditory-motor learning that can be clearly distinguished from training-induced plasticity,  says Dr. Robert Zatorre, a cognitive neuroscientist at The Neuro who co-directs Montreal s International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS) and is lead author of the study in Cerebral Cortex.  Our findings pertain to the debate about the relative influence of  nature or nurture,  but also have potential practical relevance for medicine and education.  The research could help to create custom-made interventions for students and for neurological patients based on their predisposition and needs. Future cognitive neuroscience studies will explore the extent to which individual differences in predisposition are a result of brain plasticity due to previous experiences and to people s genetics.

The new study, published in Nature Communications, is the first to explore the role of intestinal microbiota in the altered behavior that is a consequence of early life stress. ""We have shown for the first time in an established mouse model of anxiety and depression that bacteria play a crucial role in inducing this abnormal behavior,"" said Premysl Bercik, senior author of the paper and an associate professor of medicine with McMaster's Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine. ""But it's not only bacteria, it's the altered bi-directional communication between the stressed host -- mice subjected to early life stress -- and its microbiota, that leads to anxiety and depression."" It has been known for some time that intestinal bacteria can affect behavior, but much of the previous research has used healthy, normal mice, said Bercik. In this study, researchers subjected mice to early life stress with a procedure of maternal separation, meaning that from day three to 21, newborn mice were separated for three hours each day from their mothers and then put back with them. First, Bercik and his team confirmed that conventional mice with complex microbiota, which had been maternally separated, displayed anxiety and depression-like behavior, with abnormal levels of the stress hormone corticosterone. These mice also showed gut dysfunction based on the release of a major neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Then, they repeated the same experiment in germ-free conditions and found that in the absence of bacteria mice which were maternally separated still have altered stress hormone levels and gut dysfunction, but they behaved similar to the control mice, not showing any signs of anxiety or depression. Next, they found that when the maternally separated germ-free mice are colonized with bacteria from control mice, the bacterial composition and metabolic activity changed within several weeks, and the mice started exhibiting anxiety and depression. ""However, if we transfer the bacteria from stressed mice into non stressed germ-free mice, no abnormalities are observed. This suggests that in this model, both host and microbial factors are required for the development of anxiety and depression-like behavior. Neonatal stress leads to increased stress reactivity and gut dysfunction that changes the gut microbiota which, in turn, alters brain function,"" said Bercik. He said that with this new research, ""We are starting to explain the complex mechanisms of interaction and dynamics between the gut microbiota and its host. Our data show that relatively minor changes in microbiota profiles or its metabolic activity induced by neonatal stress can have profound effects on host behavior in adulthood."" Bercik said this is another step in understanding how microbiota can shape host behaviour, and that it may extend the original observations into the field of psychiatric disorders. ""It would be important to determine whether this also applies to humans. For instance, whether we can detect abnormal microbiota profiles or different microbial metabolic activity in patients with primary psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and depression,"" said Bercik.

The advance could lead to improvements in future brain-computer interfaces that provide people with severe paralysis a means to control robotic arms and hands using their thoughts. The key finding of a research team based at Brown University is that neurons in the area of the brain responsible for planning grasping motions retain information about the object to be gripped as they make their movement plan. The collective neural activity therefore looks different when executing the same grip on one object versus another. This may help the brain design unique patterns when similar actions are performed in different environments. For designers of brain-computer interfaces, whose goal is to translate neural patterns into commands for a prosthetic device, it may be important to know that the emerging plan to execute a ""power grip"" style, for example, may look different when the object is a hammer versus a soda can. Because the information is distributed across many neurons in a local network, it is possible to have many of these special object-action representations together. ""Many groups have looked at encoding of different grips and different hand positions,"" said lead and corresponding author Carlos Vargas-Irwin, an investigator in the lab of senior author John Donoghue, the Henry Merritt Wriston Professor of Neuroscience and Engineering. ""Typically what's studied is the relationship between a single object and a grip associated with it. What had not been done before is to investigate how the brain can formulate different grips on the same object or the same grip on different objects."" When his team did that, they found that the brain has many ways to formulate a grip command, and those seem to be influenced by what it's gripping. ""You can have the same movement resulting from very different activity patterns within the context of different objects,"" Vargas-Irwin said. ""If we are trying to build a [brain-computer interface] decoder we need to take into account the bigger context of what the target of the movement is."" The research team made its findings by recording and analyzing the neural activity in the ventral premotor cortex of three trained rhesus macaques as they participated in a series of grip tasks. Over about a five-second span, the researchers would present one of two different objects. Then they'd show a red or yellow light to signal which of two different grips to use for each, and then flash a green light to signal that the grip should begin. After analysis, the researchers were able to observe how the patterns of neural activity were changing at each stage of each task. Vargas-Irwin used an analysis technique he developed, called SSIMS, that can accurately detect patterns of activity in collections of neurons without relying on any assumptions about what the brain is trying to do. The patterns can be distinguished based on differences in their activity and can cluster together based on their similarities without the researchers imposing their own view of events going on in the task. What the analysis showed is that neurons in the ventral premotor cortex follow patterns that differentiate objects and actions. They began to show distinct, identifiable patterns of activity as soon as the object was presented but the animal knew how it was supposed to grasp that object. By the time grips were actually made, the patterns had become so distinct that all four object-grip combinations could be distinctly identified with about 95 percent accuracy. ""We just look at the neural activity patterns in and of themselves and the relationships between them; we can quantify their relative similarity and group them without any knowledge of the what the kinematics are,"" Vargas-Irwin said. ""In this particular experiment we see that we can subdivide the neural activity patterns into groups that correspond to the basic grips and objects."" This was somewhat surprising, Donoghue added, because this ""motor"" part of the brain is thought to be near the end stages of making a movement, well after sensory processing like object discrimination has been completed. The new findings suggest that this isn't so. The results of the study demonstrate that objects have a significant effect on the evolution of the grip plan. That the brain can produce a variety of activity patterns and still arrive at an appropriate grip plan suggests the brian is flexible enough to handle a wide variety of object contexts and can do so with a local network of neurons. It's also apparent in the study that the plan to grip an object evolves well in advance of actual execution. Early interpretation of grip planning, including accounting for the distinctive form that plans take in the context of different object, could allow a brain computer interface decoder to get a motion command to a prosthesis more quickly and accurately with information about what is to be gripped, Vargas-Irwin said. Vargas-Irwin and his colleagues are continuing with experiments to determine how well the findings can be generalized -- to a wider variety of objects, for instance -- and how much the structure of the experiments and training affects the neural patterns. Vargas-Irwin said he is optimistic that the findings could ultimately have direct application to improving brain-computer interface design and performance for patients with severe paralysis.

The work really focuses on trying to understand the dependence of cancer cells on the microenvironment that surrounds them,  said senior author Tannishtha Reya, PhD, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology. The microenvironment refers to the normal cells, molecules and blood vessels around the cancer that may support and fuel its expansion. In the study, the researchers showed that tetraspanin3 (Tspan3), a cell surface molecule, serves as a key link for cancer cells to interact with supportive parts of the microenvironment that help them replicate and flourish.  We found that blocking this molecule leads to a very profound inhibition of leukemia growth,  said Reya.The researchers demonstrated their results in both AML mouse models and patient cancer samples.   Reya said these findings are particularly important because AML is a cancer that often doesn t respond to current therapies. In addition, Tspan3 is a surface molecule, making it of greater translational interest as a target for antibody-mediated therapy.  There s been great progress in pediatric leukemia research and treatment over the last few years,  said Reya.  But unfortunately, children with acute myeloid leukemia are often poor responders to current treatments. So identifying new approaches to target this disease remains critically important.  AML affects a group of white blood cells called myeloid cells, which normally develop into the various types of mature blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. It is a less common, but very aggressive form of leukemia that will produce an estimated 20,830 new cases in 2015 and kill 10,460 Americans, according to the National Cancer Institute.  The latest findings build on earlier work by Reya and colleagues, which identified Musashi (Msi) as a critical stem cell signal that is hijacked in several blood cancers.  We had this idea that analysis of the molecular programs controlled by Musashi may identify new genes important for these leukemias,  she said.  The researchers conducted a genome-wide expression analysis of Msi-deficient cancer stem cells from two kinds of aggressive leukemia, blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia (bcCML) and AML.  We identified genes commonly regulated by Msi in both leukemias,  said Reya, who is also a member of the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine and Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health.  Unexpectedly, the analysis identified Tspan3 as one of the core genes controlled by Msi in leukemia. The protein is part of a large family of membrane proteins active in diverse cellular processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation and hematopoietic stem cell function and blood formation.  We are particularly excited about this work because, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a requirement for Tspan3 in any primary cancer,  said Reya. To explore the connection further, the researchers took a  leap of faith  and generated the scientific community s first Tspan3  knockout  mouse, bred to be deficient in Tspan3. In testing, the researchers found that Tspan3 deletion impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly improved survival in animal models of AML. In patient samples, Tspan3 inhibition blocked growth of AML, suggesting Tspan3 is also important in human disease.","Published: July 29, 2015"

This epigenomic characterization potentially allows medical doctors to create personalized treatment of diseases by understanding the state of a patient, making the forecast, and tuning the treatment strategy accordingly. However, such tests require a huge number of cells. At one point, the study of in vivo genome-wide protein-DNA interactions and chromatin modifications required approximately 10 million cells for an individual test. This enormous requirement practically ruled out such analysis on patient samples. For well more than a decade, Chang Lu, a professor of chemical engineering at Virginia Tech, has worked on the development of tools to effectively analyze living cells with the long-term goal of gaining a better understanding of a range of diseases. In his lab, Lu and his students develop small microfluidic devices with micrometer features for examining molecular events inside cells. Microfluidics is a branch of science that deals with the performance, control, and treatment of fluids that are constrained in some fashion. The latest breakthrough comes from Lu's collaboration with Kai Tan at the University of Iowa, a systems biologist and associate professor of internal medicine. Together, they demonstrated that a technique called microfluidic oscillatory washing based chromatin immunoprecipitation (MOWChIP-Seq) allows analysis of epigenomic modifications using as few as 100 cells.  ""The use of a packed bed of beads for ChIP allowed us to collect the chromatin fragments with a very high efficiency. At the same time, effective washing for removing undesired molecules and debris guarantees the purity of the collected molecules. These two factors constitute a successful strategy for epigenomic analysis with extremely high sensitivity"" Lu said. The entire MOWChIP process takes about 90 minutes as opposed to many hours that conventional ChIP assays took. They used their technology to study the epigenomes of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells isolated from the fetal liver of a mouse in Tan's lab. As Tan explained, ""Little is known about the dynamics of the epigenome during embryonic hematopoiesis, largely due to the difficulty in isolating sufficient quantities of these cells from developing embyros. This technology is the perfect tool for tackling this problem."" ""Our technology paves the way for studies of epigenomes with extremely low number of cells from animals and from patients,"" Lu said. Supported by several NIH grants, the team plans to use this technology to study other epigenomic changes involved in inflammation and cancer in the near future.","Published: July 29, 2015"

First small, simple molecules, or monomers, banded together to form larger, more complex molecules, or polymers. Then those polymers developed a mechanism that allowed them to self-replicate and pass their structure on to future generations.  We wouldn't be here today if molecules had not made that fateful transition to self-replication. Yet despite the fact that biochemists have spent decades searching for the specific chemical process that can explain how simple molecules could make this leap, we still don't really understand how it happened.  Now Sergei Maslov, a computational biologist at the U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE)'s Brookhaven National Laboratory and adjunct professor at Stony Brook Univ., and Alexei Tkachenko, a scientist at Brookhaven's Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), have taken a different, more conceptual approach. They've developed a model that explains how monomers could very rapidly make the jump to more complex polymers. And what their model points to could have intriguing implications for CFN's work in engineering artificial self-assembly at the nanoscale. To understand their work, let's consider the most famous organic polymer, and the carrier of life's genetic code: DNA. This polymer is composed of long chains of specific monomers called nucleotides, of which the four kinds are adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine (A, T, G, C). In a DNA double helix, each specific nucleotide pairs with another: A with T, and G with C. Because of this complementary pairing, it would be possible to put a complete piece of DNA back together even if just one of the two strands was intact.  While DNA has become the molecule of choice for encoding biological information, its close cousin RNA likely played this role at the dawn of life. This is known as the RNA world hypothesis, and it's the scenario that Maslov and Tkachenko considered in their work.  The single complete RNA strand is called a template strand, and the use of a template to piece together monomer fragments is what is known as template-assisted ligation. This concept is at the crux of their work. They asked whether that piecing together of complementary monomer chains into more complex polymers could occur not as the healing of a broken polymer, but rather as the formation of something new. ""Suppose we don't have any polymers at all, and we start with just monomers in a test tube,"" explained Tkachenko. ""Will that mixture ever find its way to make those polymers? The answer is rather remarkable: Yes, it will! You would think there is some chicken-and-egg problem that, in order to make polymers, you already need polymers there to provide the template for their formation. Turns out that you don't really."" Maslov and Tkachenko's model imagines some kind of regular cycle in which conditions change in a predictable fashion say, the transition between night and day. Imagine a world in which complex polymers break apart during the day, then repair themselves at night. The presence of a template strand means that the polymer reassembles itself precisely as it was the night before. That self-replication process means the polymer can transmit information about itself from one generation to the next. That ability to pass information along is a fundamental property of life. ""The way our system replicates from one day cycle to the next is that it preserves a memory of what was there,"" said Maslov. ""It's relatively easy to make lots of long polymers, but they will have no memory. The template provides the memory. Right now, we are solving the problem of how to get long polymer chains capable of memory transmission from one unit to another to select a small subset of polymers out of an astronomically large number of solutions."" According to Maslov and Tkachenko's model, a molecular system only needs a very tiny percentage of more complex molecules even just dimers, or pairs of identical molecules joined together to start merging into the longer chains that will eventually become self-replicating polymers. This neatly sidesteps one of the most vexing puzzles of the origins of life: Self-replicating chains likely need to be very specific sequences of at least 100 paired monomers, yet the odds of 100 such pairs randomly assembling themselves in just the right order is practically zero.  ""If conditions are right, there is what we call a first-order transition, where you go from this soup of completely dispersed monomers to this new solution where you have these long chains appearing,"" said Tkachenko. ""And we now have this mechanism for the emergence of these polymers that can potentially carry information and transmit it downstream. Once this threshold is passed, we expect monomers to be able to form polymers, taking us from the primordial soup to a primordial souffl .""While the model's concept of template-assisted ligation does describe how DNA as well as RNA repairs itself, Maslov and Tkachenko's work doesn't require that either of those was the specific polymer for the origin of life. ""Our model could also describe a proto-RNA molecule. It could be something completely different,"" Maslov said. The fact that Maslov and Tkachenko's model doesn't require the presence of a specific molecule speaks to their more theoretical approach.  ""It's a different mentality from what a biochemist would do,"" said Tkachenko. ""A biochemist would be fixated on specific molecules. We, being ignorant physicists, tried to work our way from a general conceptual point of view, as there's a fundamental problem."" That fundamental problem is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that systems tend toward increasing disorder and lack of organization. The formation of long polymer chains from monomers is the precise opposite of that. ""How do you start with the regular laws of physics and get to these laws of biology which makes things run backward, which make things more complex, rather than less complex?""  Tkachenko queried. ""That's exactly the jump that we want to understand."" The work is an outgrowth of efforts at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials, a DOE Office of Science User Facility, to use DNA and other biomolecules to direct the self-assembly of nanoparticles into large, ordered arrays.  While CFN doesn't typically focus on these kinds of primordial biological questions, Maslov and Tkachenko's modeling work could help CFN scientists engaged in cutting-edge nanoscience research to engineer even larger and more complex assemblies using nanostructured building blocks. ""There is a huge interest in making engineered self-assembled structures, so we were essentially thinking about two problems at once,"" said Tkachenko. ""One is relevant to biologists, and second asks whether we can engineer a nanosystem that will do what our model does."" The next step will be to determine whether template-aided ligation can allow polymers to begin undergoing the evolutionary changes that characterize life as we know it. While this first round of research involved relatively modest computational resources, that next phase will require far more involved models and simulations. Maslov and Tkachenko's work has solved the problem of how long polymer chains capable of information transmission from one generation to the next could emerge from the world of simple monomers. Now they are turning their attention to how such a system could naturally narrow itself down from exponentially many polymers to only a select few with desirable sequences. ""What we needed to show here was that this template-based ligation does result in a set of polymer chains, starting just from monomers,"" said Tkachenko. ""So the next question we will be asking is whether, because of this template-based merger, we will be able to see specific sequences that will be more 'fit' than others. So this work sets the stage for the shift to the Darwinian phase.""","Published: July 29, 2015"

Instead of analyzing snapshots of RNA to try to understand functioning, Sticky-flares help create an experience that is more like watching live-streaming video.  This is very exciting because much of the RNA in cells has very specific quantities and localization, and both are critical to the cell s function, but until this development it has been very difficult, and often impossible, to probe both attributes of RNA in a live cell,  said Chad Mirkin, PhD, professor in the Department of Medicine and a nanomedicine expert.  We hope that many more researchers will be able to use this platform to increase our understanding of RNA function inside cells.  Mirkin is the corresponding author of the study, and also a professor in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Sticky-flares are tiny spherical nucleic acid gold nanoparticle conjugates that can enter living cells and target and transfer a fluorescent reporter or  tracking device  to RNA transcripts. This fluorescent labeling can be tracked via fluorescence microscopy as it is transported throughout the cell, including the nucleus. In the PNApaper, the scientists explain how they used Sticky-flares to quantify  actin mRNA in HeLa cells (the oldest and most commonly used human cell line) as well as to follow the real-time transport of  actin mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Sticky-flares are built upon another technology from Mirkin s group called NanoFlares, which was the first genetic-based approach that is able to detect live circulating tumor cells out of the complex matrix that is human blood. NanoFlares have been very useful for researchers that operate in the arena of quantifying gene expression. AuraSense, Inc., a biotechnology company that licensed the NanoFlare technology from Northwestern University, and EMD-Millipore, another biotech company, have commercialized NanoFlares. There are now more than 1,700 commercial forms of NanoFlares sold under the SmartFlare name in more than 230 countries. The Sticky-flare is designed to address limitations of SmartFlares, most notably their inability to track RNA location and enter the nucleus. The Northwestern team believes Sticky-flares are poised to become a valuable tool for researchers who desire to understand the function of RNA in live cells.","Published: July 29, 2015"

Rice is the only major crop grown under flooded conditions. It is this flooding that releases inorganic arsenic, normally locked up in soil minerals, which is then absorbed by the plant. Too much arsenic is associated with a range of health problems including, at worst, bladder and lung cancer. Rice has, typically, ten times more inorganic arsenic than other foods and according to the European Food Standards Authority, people who eat a lot of rice, as is the case in many parts of the developing world, are exposed to worrying concentrations. Children and infants are of particular concern as they eat, relatively, three times more rice than adults   baby rice being a popular food for weaning   and their organs are still developing. In this new study, researchers at Queen s tested two methods of percolating technology, one where the cooking water was recycled through condensing boiling-water steam and passing the freshly distilled hot water through the grain in a lab setting, and one where tap water was used to cook the rice held in an off-the-shelf coffee percolator in a domestic setting.  Both approaches proved highly effective, with up to 85% of arsenic removed from a variety of different rice types and brands, including wholegrain and white. Andy Meharg, Professor of Plant and Soil Sciences at Queen's Institute for Global Food Security said:  This is a very significant breakthrough as this offers an immediate solution to decreasing inorganic arsenic in the diet.  In our research we rethought the method of rice cooking to optimise the removal of inorganic arsenic and we discovered that by using percolating technology, where cooking water is continually passed through rice in a constant flow, we could maximise removal of arsenic.  Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic can cause a range of health problems including developmental problems, heart disease, diabetes and nervous system damage. However, most worrying are lung and bladder cancers. This new breakthrough is the latest example of the commitment of researchers at Queen s to changing lives and advancing knowledge that will have a lasting impact around the globe.  Queen s is at the patent stage for the development of a bespoke rice cooker based on a percolation system which means consumers could soon have this technology in their own kitchen.","Published: July 29, 2015"

However, these devices, often created with nondegradable elastic polymers, bear an inherent risk of intestinal obstruction as a result of accidental fracture or migration. As such, they are usually designed to remain in the stomach for a limited time. Now, researchers at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have created a polymer gel that overcomes this safety concern and could allow for the development of long-acting devices that reside in the stomach, including orally delivered capsules that can release drugs over a number of days, weeks, or potentially months following a single administration.This polymer is pH-responsive: It is stable in the acidic stomach environment but dissolves in the small intestine s near-neutral pH, allowing for safe passage through the remainder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The material is also elastic, allowing for the compression and folding of devices into easily ingestible capsules   meaning this polymer can be used to create safe devices designed for extremely prolonged residence in the stomach.  One of the issues with any device in the GI tract is that there s the potential for an obstruction, which is a medical emergency potentially requiring surgical intervention,  says Koch Institute research affiliate Giovanni Traverso, also a gastroenterologist at MGH and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.  A material like this represents a real advance because it is both safe and stable in the stomach environment.  Traverso and Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, are the senior authors of a paper in the July 27 issue of Nature Materials that describes the application of this new polymer gel for creating gastric devices. Shiyi Zhang, a postdoc at the Koch Institute, is the paper s lead author. Designing devices for the stomach is a complicated matter of sizes and shapes. The stomach naturally empties its contents in a matter of hours, so for devices to be retained, they must be wider than the pylorus   the valve at the end of the stomach, about 1.5 to 2 centimeters in diameter, that allows gastric contents to pass into the small intestine. However, because the most convenient path to deliver these devices is through the esophagus, which is only marginally wider than the pylorus, the researchers were interested in developing a polymer with elastic properties.  An elastic device can be folded into something small, such as a capsule, and be easily ingested through the esophagus before expanding in the stomach, restoring its original shape,  Zhang says.  When you have a device that s larger than the pylorus, there s a much higher probability that it will be retained longer in the stomach.  But the size and shape of existing devices with elastic polymers have been limited by safety concerns, as there is a greater risk for fracture if a device is too large or too complex. Because of this, the researchers wanted their polymer to also be enteric   or have a mechanism that would enable it to pass through the stomach unaltered before disintegrating in the intestines.  To lower any possible risk of obstruction, we wanted a material that could dissolve in the intestines, thereby dissociating the device, and safely pass out of the body,  Zhang says. To create this new material, the researchers synthesized an elastic polymer and combined it in solution with a clinically utilized enteric polymer. Adding hydrochloric acid and centrifuging the solution resulted in a flexible, yet resilient, polymer gel that exhibits both elastic and enteric properties. The researchers used the gel polycaprolactone (PCL), a nontoxic, degradable polyester, to construct several device prototypes. They first created ring-shaped devices by using the gel to link arcs of PCL in a circular mold. These elastic devices had a diameter of 3 centimeters   wider than the pylorus   before they were folded into orally ingestible capsules. In testing the capsules in pigs, the researchers found that the rings expanded into their original shape within 15 minutes of ingestion and remained in the stomach for up to seven days. After the device passed out of the stomach, the polymer gel dissolved, allowing for the safe passage of the small PCL pieces without obstruction. The researchers also created larger devices in various shapes that could be folded and delivered through the esophagus with the assistance of an endoscope. These devices remained in the stomach for up to five days, after which the gel similarly dissolved, allowing for the remnants of the device to safely pass. The combined enteric and elastic properties of this polymer gel could significantly improve the design and adoption of gastric-resident devices. Devices that could incorporate this material include bariatric devices for the treatment of obesity, which control how hungry or full a person feels; ingestible electronics, which can diagnose and monitor a variety of conditions in the GI tract; or extended-release drug-delivery systems that could last for weeks or months after a single administration.  This delivery system provides a flexible and smooth external covering that slowly disintegrates, which could release drugs or small devices for monitoring and imaging the GI tract,  says Edith Mathiowitz, a professor of medical science and engineering at Brown University who was not involved with this study.  This is a very smart approach.  In particular, the authors say they are excited for the drug-delivery applications of this technology. With further work in adjusting the polymer composition or the design of the system, they say that they could tailor devices to release drugs over a specific timeframe of up to weeks or months at a time. MIT is negotiating an exclusive license agreement with Lyndra, an early-stage biotechnology company developing novel oral drug-delivery systems, for this and other related technologies.  I m delighted to see these new oral systems provide an opportunity that I ve not seen previously   enabling patients to swallow a single pill that can then act for whatever length of time is desired,  Langer says. Such single-administration events could improve medication adherence, which remains a major clinical barrier. According to the World Health Organization, patients  adherence to long-term therapies for chronic illnesses is only 50 percent in developed countries, with lower rates of adherence in developing nations.  Medication nonadherence costs the U.S. an estimated $100 billion every year, the bulk of which comes in the form of unnecessary hospitalizations. The researchers also say that single-administration delivery systems for the radical treatment of malaria and other infections could significantly benefit from these technologies.","Published: July 29, 2015"

New antibiotics to which bacteria are unlikely to develop resistance are urgently needed to combat the rise of superbugs   drug-resistant bacteria. Professor Cooper, Director of the IMB Centre for Superbug Solutions, said bacteria were less likely to become resistant to an antibiotic based on a modified version of their own sugar.  Bacteria have cell walls similar to the walls of a brick house, except instead of mortar the walls are held together by sugar polymers,  Professor Cooper said.  But if you add one of our modified sugar molecules, they stop the linking process, destroying the cell wall and killing the bacteria.   The cell wall has been a target for antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin before, but the difference here is that we are stopping a centrally important part of the cell wall linking process.  Dr Zuegg said the team examined hundreds of versions of Alchemia s modified sugar molecules to find those that will kill bacteria and are non-toxic to human cells.  Most molecules screened to become drugs have a flat, planar shape, whereas these molecules are three dimensional,  Dr Zuegg said.  This means we can build on the sugar core in a variety of ways to make thousands of different combinations in three dimensional space.

UW-Madison genetics Professor John Doebley and a team of researchers describe how, during the domestication of corn, a single nucleotide change in the teosinte glume architectural gene (tga1) stripped away the hard, inedible casing of this wild grass, ultimately exposing the edible golden kernel.""A huge proportion of the world is economically dependent on the crop and understanding how it was constructed 10,000 years ago is more than just intellectually satisfying,"" Doebley says. He has spent his long career studying the evolution of maize, the plant from which corn grows. ""It tells us something about how important this genetic change was."" Seen side by side, maize and teosinte do not look as if they belong on the same family tree. Teosinte is branched and bushy; its miniscule ""ears"" bear a stronger resemblance to wheat and contain just 10 to 12 kernels. Maize, meanwhile, is tall and stalked and grows massive ears containing hundreds of kernels. Yet research by Doebley years ago traced maize's roots to a weedy form of teosinte in a valley in southwestern Mexico. ""The big question is, when we look out the window and see a diversity of forms in the plants and animals around us, what were the genetic changes that took place to make all of that happen?"" Doebley says. ""Two closely related plants, why do they have a different shape of leaf; or two people, why is one a little taller?"" The answer often lies in mutations, the currency of evolution. Sometimes single letters are changed in the genome of a species, while other times, whole paragraphs are lifted or moved around. Sometimes, these changes don't alter the meaning of the story, while other times they do. When those changes are beneficial, that altered copy survives the test of time. Sometimes that means the creation of a whole new species. In the case of maize, in the process of domesticating it for food, humans decided which mutations were good and which to eliminate by growing more of the plants they preferred. Previous studies from Doebley's lab had identified the tga1 gene as responsible for the transition from encased to exposed kernels, but until now, no one knew just how. The research team began with the information it had: There were six potential mutations in the gene that could explain the change. Researchers investigated these suspects by studying large numbers of corn and teosinte genomes and learned that just one mutation was consistently different between the two plants. ""Knowing that was the important one, we tried to characterize how it altered the function of the gene,"" says Doebley. The team learned that the single letter change led to a difference in the protein made by tga1. Genes provide the codes to make proteins, which are the machines that do the work of cells. The researchers then embarked on a series of studies to determine how that altered protein operated. ""A series of experiments showed that this particular gene, tga1, is a master regulatory gene   a conductor of the orchestra,"" says Doebley. The protein made by the gene influences numerous characteristics of teosinte by determining which other genes get turned on and off. By changing the gene, and thus, the protein, the mutation altered the way the conductor was leading individual musicians, affecting the entire orchestra. ""Each musician is a target gene and the conductor is telling each one what to play and how loud to play,"" says Doebley. In this instance, the mutation caused the conductor to quiet its musicians, which prevented the hard fruitcase from surrounding the teosinte kernel and instead shuttled it to the core, or cob, of the ear. ""So, the kernel ends up naked, uncovered and exposed on the surface of the corn cob, to be eaten,"" Doebley says. This enabled corn to become a driver of trade and sustenance for billions of people and animals around the world. The study also helps inform existing questions in the evolution world about what kinds of genetic changes lead to dramatic differences in the form and function of species. These changes first inspired Charles Darwin to consider the idea of adaptive evolution   evolution driven by natural selection   and he, too, studied domesticated plants and animals in coming to his conclusions. At UW-Madison, Professor of Genetics Sean Carroll leads studies of adaptive evolution. In the evolution of maize, a small change in DNA led to a large change in form, and a change to the function of a single protein controlling the actions of genes caused the dramatic effect. ""When I was in graduate school, nothing like this could be done,"" says Doebley. ""We didn't even know that a gene was an operationally defined unit that behaved in certain ways at a molecular level, and now we can ... find those genes that control differences in a species. Over the last 50 years, we have gained the ability to answer biological questions and changes in profound ways that I could not have imagined back then.""","Published: July 29, 2015"
5,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/diagnostic-test-developed-for-enterovirus-d68-192408,Diagnostic Test Developed for Enterovirus D   researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St  Louis have developed a diagnostic test to quickly detect enterovirus D    EV D     a respiratory virus that caused unusually severe illness in children last year   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The outbreak caused infections at an unprecedented rate, with over 1,000 confirmed cases and 14 reported deaths nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results demonstrate that the test is extremely effective at identifying various strains of EV-D68 and reduces the amount of time needed to detect the virus. Earlier procedures for identifying enterovirus strains involved sequencing a region of the virus s genome, which is too cumbersome to perform on large numbers of patients. The new test can be completed in a few hours, while previous techniques took several days to process. The researchers also said the new test is more specific than commercially available diagnostic tests for enterovirus. Commercial tests for respiratory viral infections typically don t distinguish between rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, and enteroviruses, and within each of those groups there are many different types,  said senior author Gregory A. Storch, MD, the Ruth L. Siteman Professor of Pediatrics.   Having a tool to identify which cases of respiratory illness are actually EV-D68 is an advantage for public health,  he added.  These kinds of tests help treatment decisions because it is important to know that the patient doesn t have influenza or another disease that might require a specific treatment. It s also important in a hospital for preventing infections because doctors take patients with one particular virus and keep them apart from patients infected with other infectious agents.  Since details of the test s technique are published, other labs can use it as a template to create their own tests in the event of another outbreak. Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are common causes of respiratory illnesses. Clinicians often don t test patients for suspected infections with either virus especially when their illnesses are mild. But after last year s deadly outbreak of the D68 strain, a team of researchers led by Storch and Todd N. Wylie, instructor in pediatrics, started working to develop a test that could target EV-D68. There are a number of variants of enterovirus D68 that are closely related genetically. But slight variations in their genomes complicate researchers  ability to detect all variants with one test. Because of this variation, earlier EV-D68 tests will miss some of the EV-D68 variants. The researchers isolated tiny segments of viral DNA sequences that are common to every D68 subtype but no other virus. Wylie developed a computer program that allows large numbers of DNA sequences to be compared simultaneously. No other lab previously had used public databases in this manner to collect the nucleotide sequences of every variant of D68 available and compare them to the sequences of all other viruses for which sequence data is available. Wylie s technique made it possible to create a test that identifies every known subtype of enterovirus D68 while excluding all other known viruses. The new test is more effective than others for EV-D68, including one developed by the CDC in October that was deployed quickly in response to the public health crisis. To assess the new test, the researchers examined known panels of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Of the viruses they looked at, the new test did not miss any known samples of EV-D68, and it did not falsely identify EV-D68 in samples that were known to be other viruses. The test retained its accuracy even with tiny amounts of the virus.  There are a range of D68 viruses, and our assay was designed to detect them all,  Storch said.  We received many samples of enterovirus from other hospitals and ran the test blindly on all of them. In the viruses we looked at, the test worked 100 percent of the time. It only detected EV-D68 strains, and it did detect all of them; the test didn t detect any of the other enteroviruses or rhinoviruses.  The researchers described some possible limitations of the new test. There are many viruses with sequences that are not available and could not be considered in designing the test. In addition, the researchers said that EV-D68 potentially could mutate in the future so that the assay might fail to detect it. The new test was made possible by earlier work by Kristine M. Wylie, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics, and colleagues in the Department of Pediatrics and at the university s McDonnell Genome Institute, who sequenced the genome of EV-D68 that circulated in St. Louis last year. One future area of research is to investigate whether Wylie s technique can serve as a template to create more tests for other viruses whose genomes have been sequenced.","Published: July 29, 2015"

There s nothing children are more interested in than other people,  said UT Austin psychologist Cristine Legare.  Acquiring the skills and practices of their social groups is the fundamental task of childhood.  In order to function within their social groups, children have to learn both technical skills with instrumental goals, such as using a fork and knife to cut food, and social conventions with goals based on social conformity, such as forms of greeting (for example: handshakes, kissing and bowing). This research demonstrates that children are sensitive to the distinction between instrumental and conventional goals and flexibly adapt their behavior accordingly.  The more carefully you imitate a social convention, the better, more reliable group member you are. Tasks with instrumental goals allow for more innovation,  Legare said.  Young children adjust how carefully they imitate and when they innovate, depending on the perceived goal of the behavior or reason for action.  Legare and her colleagues examined imitative and innovative behavior in children between the ages of 4 and 6 after watching one of two videos that illustrated conventional and instrumental uses of various geometric objects and a box. Both videos showed an experimenter performing a pattern of arbitrary but intentional tasks with the objects. In the conventional video, the start- and end-state of the objects was identical. But in the instrumental video, the experimenter used the final object in the pattern to open the box and place the object inside. After the video, children were given the same group of objects. The children imitated the conventional behavior with higher fidelity. Those who observed an instrumental behavior engaged in more innovative behavior.   In a second study, children were also more accurate in detecting variation in conventional than instrumental behavior, suggesting that conventional behavior is driven by expectations for social conformity.  We are socially oriented in ways that other species are not, and we are very well equipped to acquire and adapt to the culture and skills of previous generations,  Legare said.  The core insight here is that children adapt their imitative and innovative behavior to different goals, even at very young ages, demonstrating that humans as a species are flexible, social learners,  Legare said.  Our research demonstrates that the early-developing distinction between instrumental and conventional behavior is fundamental to cultural learning in our species.

But when it comes to taking on intellectually challenging tasks, groups of neurons tune in to one another for a fraction of a second and harmonize, then go back to improvising, according to new research led by UC Berkeley. These findings, reported today in the journal Nature Neuroscience, could pave the way for more targeted treatments for people with brain disorders marked by fast, slow or chaotic brain waves, also known as neural oscillations. Tracking the changing rhythms of the healthy human brain at work advances our understanding of such disorders as Parkinson s disease, schizophrenia and even autism, which are characterized in part by offbeat brain rhythms. In jazz lingo, for example, bands of neurons in certain mental illnesses may be malfunctioning because they re tuning in to blue notes, or playing double time or half time.  The human brain has 86 billion or so neurons all trying to talk to each other in this incredibly messy, noisy and electrochemical soup,  said study lead author Bradley Voytek.  Our results help explain the mechanism for how brain networks quickly come together and break apart as needed.  Voytek and fellow researchers at UC Berkeley s Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute measured electrical activity in the brains of cognitively healthy epilepsy patients.  They found that, as the mental exercises became more demanding, theta waves at 4-8 Hertz or cycles per second synchronized within the brain s frontal lobe, enabling it to connect with other brain regions, such as the motor cortex.  In these brief moments of synchronization, quick communication occurs as the neurons between brain regions lock into these frequencies, and this measure is critical in a variety of disorders,  said Voytek, an assistant professor of cognitive science at UC San Diego who conducted the study as a postdoctoral fellow in neuroscience at UC Berkeley. Previous experiments on animals have shown how brain waves control brain activity. This latest study is among the first to use electrocorticography   which places electrodes directly on the exposed surface of the brain   to measure neural oscillations as people perform cognitively challenging tasks and show how these rhythms control communication between brain regions. There are five types of brain wave frequencies   Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta   and each are thought to play a different role. For example, Theta waves help coordinate neurons as we move around our environment, and thus are key to processing spatial information. In people with autism, the connection between Alpha waves and neural activity has been found to weaken when they process emotional images. Meanwhile, people with Parkinson s disease show abnormally strong Beta waves in the motor cortex. This locks neurons into the wrong groove and inhibits movement. Fortunately, electrical deep brain stimulation can disrupt abnormally strong Beta waves in Parkinson s and alleviate symptoms, Voytek said. For the study, epilepsy patients viewed shapes of increasing complexity on a computer screen and were tasked with using different fingers (index or middle) to push a button depending on the shape, color or texture of the shape. The exercise started out simply with participants hitting the button with, say, an index finger each time a square flashed on the screen. But it grew progressively more difficult as the shapes became more layered with colors and textures, and their fingers had to keep up. As the tasks became more demanding, the oscillations kept up, coordinating more parts of the frontal lobe and synchronizing the information passing between those brain regions.  The results revealed a delicate coordination in the brain s code,  Voytek said.  Our neural orchestra may need no conductor, just brain waves sweeping through to briefly excite neurons, like millions of fans in a stadium doing  The Wave.

In a paper appearing online in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, Professor Nicholas Tonks, FRS, and colleagues, demonstrate that treatment with small-molecule drug candidates significantly extends lifespan in male mice that model Rett syndrome and ameliorates several behavioral symptoms of the disorder in model female mice. ""At this time, there is no disease-modifying therapy for Rett syndrome,"" Tonks noted, ""and the focus of most current therapies is management of symptoms. Our approach represents a new strategy. In the research we're reporting today, we have clear evidence in mice that we can actually reverse symptoms - supporting the concept that the disorder is not irreversible and may be amenable to treatment with small molecule drugs."" Rett syndrome is a so-called X-linked disorder affecting the brain and nervous system. It is caused by mutations in a gene on the X chromosome called MECP2, which regulates the activity of other genes. Males have one copy of the X chromosome and one copy of the Y chromosome. Females have no Ys and two Xs, one of which is normally inactivated. Boys born with the MECP2 mutation have no other copy of the gene to fall back on, and often die in the first year or two of life. Girls with the mutation often survive because they have another copy of the gene. The first year or two of life is often normal, but by age two developmental pathologies strike, including cessation of brain development, impairment of gait, and loss of already acquired social skills. Nine in 10 Rett patients are girls, since most boys don't emerge from infancy. The encouraging research reported today is the product of 25 years of research by Professor Tonks. In 1988, Tonks, a biochemist, discovered an enzyme called PTP1B that would prove to be the first of a family of such proteins that now has 105 members; all are phosphatases, enzymes that remove phosphate groups from other proteins. These enzymes are central players in cascades of signals sent among and within cells to control fundamental processes such as growth and metabolism. In fact, PTP1B has been shown to function in suppressing signaling by the hormones insulin and leptin, which, respectively, are central in the pathology of diabetes and obesity. Consequently, drug candidates that inhibit PTP1B activity have been recognized for their potential as new approaches to treating these major diseases. Identifying and characterizing such drug candidates is one focus of the research in Professor Tonks' group. Realizing that metabolic regulation appears to be abnormal in Rett syndrome - ""an underappreciated fact,"" he says -- Navasona Krishnan, Ph.D., a Research Associate who works with Professor Tonks, proposed using inhibitors of PTP1B to see if they might address any of the range of symptoms seen in the disease. He demonstrated early on that PTP1B levels were abnormally elevated in the model mice. This was an encouraging sign that inhibitors of PTP1B might have a beneficial effect in Rett syndrome mice. In young male mice lacking the Mecp2 gene (the analog of the MECP2 human gene implicated in Rett), one of Tonks' PTP1B inhibitors extended median lifespan from 50 days to about 75 days. Another molecule worked even better, extending survival up to 90 days. In more mature female mice modeling the syndrome, PTP1B inhibitors improved symptoms in behavioral tests. In one, a paw-clasping behavior analogous to stereotactic hand movements seen in human patients was decreased following administration of a PTP1B inhibitor - the incidence among the treated mice was cut to 25% from nearly 100% prior to treatment. And on a walking test, mice modeling Rett placed on a rotating wheel showed partially restored function - they could remain on the wheel without falling off for significantly longer than untreated model mice. Tonks, Krishnan and colleagues wanted to know if the glucose-regulating properties of the PTP1B inhibitors used in the experiments were alone responsible for the improvements observed. When the model mice were given two mainstay treatments for diabetes, metformin and rosiglitazone, there was no improvement. This suggested there was something more going on when PTP1B inhibitors were administered. But what? Further experiments revealed a connection between PTP1B and the neural growth factor called BDNF, critical in early brain development (and in subsequent function of the brain). BDNF docks at cell receptors called TRKB (""track-B""). ""Under normal conditions, PTP1B levels are low and signaling via TRKB is promoted,"" Tonks explains. ""In Rett syndrome, PTP1B levels are extremely high and signaling through TRKB is attenuated."" This suggests a molecular-level explanation of why PTP1B inhibitors helped to improve Rett symptoms. ""When you inhibit PTP1B, as our drug candidates do, you restore BDNF signaling through the TRKB receptor."" Some current drug development efforts seek to activate the TRKB pathway in Rett syndrome, to restore BDNF responses. However, such approaches do not take into account the barrier that high levels of PTP1B represent. Tonks likens this to trying to drive a car by putting your foot down on the gas while the brakes are still on. If you hammer away at the gas, the car still won't move forward very well. ""Since PTP1B acts as the 'brake' in the Rett syndrome model,"" he says, ""our approach of inhibiting PTP1B shows what happens when you simply take your foot off the brake!"" Tonks' lab has now entered into collaborations with other labs expert in the clinical manifestations of Rett syndrome, to understand in much greater detail how the inhibition of PTP1B will modify the varied effects of the disorder in the body.

The vast majority of pituitary tumors are noncancerous, but can cause headaches and profound fatigue, and can also disrupt hormone function. Currently, surgeons rely on radiologic images and MRIs to gather information about the size and shape of the tumor, but the resolution of such imaging technologies is limited, and additional surgeries to remove more of the tumor may be needed if a patient's symptoms persist. In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) present a new technique that could help surgeons more precisely define the locations of tumors in near real-time. The new strategy uses a visualization technique (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging - MALDI MSI) that can analyze specific hormones, including growth hormone and prolactin, in tissue. In the newly published study, the researchers find that it's possible to use MALDI MSI to determine the composition of such hormones in a pituitary sample in less than 30 minutes. This could give surgeons critical information to help distinguish tumor from normal gland. ""Our work is driven by a clinical need: we've developed a test specifically tailored for the needs of our neurosurgeon colleagues,"" said corresponding author Nathalie Agar, PhD, director of the Surgical Molecular Imaging Laboratory in the Department of Neurosurgery at BWH. ""A surgeon may sacrifice half of the pituitary gland in an effort to get the tumor out. Without a tool to distinguish healthy tissue from tumor, it's hard to know in real-time if the surgery was a success. With this technology, in under 30 minutes a surgeon will be able to know if a sample contains normal pituitary tissue or a pituitary tumor."" ""Patients show up with the clinical symptoms of a pituitary tumor, but the tumor itself may not be visible on an MRI,"" said co-author Edward Laws, MD, director of the Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Center at BWH. ""This technique, which maps out where excess concentrations of hormone levels are located, has the potential to allow us to confirm that we've removed the abnormal tissue."" ""Evaluating whether a piece of pituitary tissue is abnormal can be challenging on frozen section,"" said co-author Sandro Santagata, MD, PhD, of BWH's Department of Pathology. ""This approach has wonderful potential for enhancing our diagnostic capabilities. It is clearly an important step toward providing intra-operative molecular characterization of pituitary tissues."" To test the technique, the research team analyzed hormone levels in 45 pituitary tumors and six normal pituitary gland samples, finding a distinct protein signature unique to the normal or tumor sample. Mass spectrometry, a technique for measuring chemicals present in a sample, is currently used in the operating room to help inform clinical decisions, but up until now, the focus has been on small molecules - metabolites, fatty acids and lipids - using a different type of approach. By analyzing proteins, MALDI MSI offers a way to visualize hormone levels. Current methods used to detect hormone levels take too long to fit the time constraints of surgical intervention. Surgeons must either remove a larger amount of potentially healthy pituitary gland or perform follow up surgery if the tumor has not been fully removed. ""We're hoping that techniques like this one will help move the field toward more precise surgery: surgery that not only removes all of the tumor but also preserves the healthy tissue as much as possible,"" said Agar. In the next phase of their work, Agar and her colleagues plan to test out the technique in BWH's AMIGO suite and analyze the impact of the technique on clinical decision making.

Using their novel approach, the scientists were able to disable a protein on the T-cell surface called CXCR4, which can be exploited by HIV when the virus infects T cells and causes AIDS. The group also successfully shut down PD-1, a protein that has attracted intense interest in the burgeoning field of cancer immunotherapy, as scientists have shown that using drugs to block PD-1 coaxes T cells to attack tumors. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has captured the imagination of both scientists and the general public, because it makes it possible to easily and inexpensively edit genetic information in virtually any organism. T cells, which circulate in the blood, are an obvious candidate for medical applications of the technology, as these cells not only stand at the center of many disease processes, but could be easily gathered from patients, edited with CRISPR/Cas9, then returned to the body to exert therapeutic effects. But in practice, editing T cell genomes with CRISPR/Cas9 has proved surprisingly difficult, said Alexander Marson, PhD, a UCSF Sandler Fellow, and senior and co-corresponding author of the new study. ""Genome editing in human T cells has been a notable challenge for the field,"" Marson said. ""So we spent the past year and a half trying to optimize editing in functional T cells. There are a lot of potential therapeutic applications, and we want to make sure we're driving this as hard as we can."" The new work was done under the auspices of the Innovative Genomics Initiative (IGI), a joint UC Berkeley-UCSF program co-directed by Berkeley's Jennifer Doudna, PhD, who is world-renowned for her pioneering research on CRISPR/Cas9, and Jonathan Weissman, PhD, professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at UCSF and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. Marson is an affiliate member of the IGI. Doudna, professor of chemistry and of cell and molecular biology at Berkeley, and an HHMI investigator, said that the research is a significant step forward in bringing the power of CRISPR/Cas9 editing to human biology and medicine. ""It's been great to be part of this exciting collaboration, and I look forward to seeing the insights from this work used to help patients in the future,"" said Doudna, co-corresponding author of the new paper. Cas9, an enzyme in the CRISPR system that makes cuts in DNA and allows new genetic sequences to be inserted, has generally been introduced into cells using viruses or circular bits of DNA called plasmids. Then, in a separate step, a genetic construct known as single-guide RNA, which steers Cas9 to the specific spots in DNA where cuts are desired, is also placed into the cells. Until recently, however, editing human T cells with CRISPR/Cas9 has been inefficient, with only a relatively small percentage of cells being successfully modified. And while scientists have had some success in switching off genes by inserting or deleting random sequences, they have not yet been able to use CRISPR/Cas9 to paste in (or ""knock in"") specific new sequences to correct mutations in T cells. As will be reported online, a team led by first authors Kathrin Schumann, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Marson's laboratory, and Steven Lin, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Doudna lab, cracked these problems by streamlining the delivery of Cas9 and single-guide RNA to cells. In lab dishes, the group assembled Cas9 ribonucleoproteins, or RNPs, which combine the Cas9 protein with single-guide RNA. They then used a method known as electroporation, in which cells are briefly exposed to an electrical field that makes their membranes more permeable, to quickly deliver these RNPs to the interior of the cells. With these innovations, the researchers successfully edited CXCR4 and PD-1, even knocking in new sequences to replace specific genetic ""letters"" in these proteins. The group was then able to sort the cells using markers expressed on the cell surface, to help pull out successfully edited cells for research, and eventually for therapeutic use. ""We tried for a long time to introduce Cas9 with plasmids or lentiviruses, and then to express separately the single-guide RNA in the cell,"" Schumann said. ""Using RNPs made outside the cell, so that the cell is responsible for as little of the process as possible, has made a big difference."" Marson stressed that, while recent reports of CRISPR/Cas9 editing of human embryos have stirred up controversy, T cells are created anew in each individual, so modifications would not be passed on to future generations. He hopes that Cas9-based therapies for T cell-related disorders, which include autoimmune diseases as well as immunodeficiencies such as ""bubble boy disease,"" will enter the clinic in the future. ""There's actually well-trodden ground putting modified T cells into patients. There are companies out there already doing it and figuring out the safety profile, so there's increasing clinical infrastructure that we could potentially piggyback on as we work out more details of genome editing,"" Marson said. ""I think CRISPR-edited T cells will eventually go into patients, and it would be wrong not to think about the steps we need to take to get there safely and effectively.""","Published: July 28, 2015"
1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/study-finds-nongenetic-cancer-mechanism-210562,Study Finds Non Genetic Cancer Mechanism Cancer can be caused solely by protein imbalances within cells  a study of ovarian cancer has found  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The discovery is a major breakthrough because, until now, genetic aberrations have been seen as the main cause of almost all cancer.  The research demonstrates that protein imbalance is a powerful prognostic tool, indicating whether or not patients are likely to respond to chemotherapy and whether a tumour is likely to spread to other sites.  The findings also open the possibility of new therapies aimed at measuring and preventing dangerous imbalances in cells.  Lead author Professor John Ladbury, Dean of the University of Leeds  Faculty of Biological Sciences and Professor of Mechanistic Biology, said:  There has been huge investment in sequencing the human genome with the idea that if we get all the relevant genetic information we can predict whether you have a predisposition to cancer and, ultimately, use a precision medicine-based approach to develop a therapeutic approach. Our study demonstrates that genetic screening alone is not enough.  The research, led by scientists at the University of Leeds and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, focused on the  Akt pathway,  a signalling pathway within cells that drives cancer formation and the spread of cancers through the body. Under normal conditions, the cell receives external signals through a cell wall-bound receptor (FGFR2 in this study). As a result of this stimulus the receptor is  switched on  inside the cell. This results in the recruitment of signalling proteins and the initiation of the Akt pathway, which is responsible for committing the cell to proliferate. In some cancerous cells, this pathway is permanently switched on. A conventional approach to diagnosing this cancer would be to look for genetic modification of the receptor (or recruited proteins), which could be responsible for maintaining the switched on state."" The new study looked at isolated cancer cells without external stimulation and found that the  Akt pathway  could be activated without genetic modifications. Two proteins; Plc 1 (pronounced  plc-gamma-1 ) and Grb2 (pronounced  grab-2 ), compete for binding to FGFR2. The relative concentration of these proteins will dictate which one binds. When Plc 1 prevails, it triggers the Akt pathway. In this way, an imbalance in the amount of the two proteins can lead to cell proliferation and cancer formation.  Dr Zahra Timsah, University Academic Fellow at the University of Leeds  School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, who was the lead researcher on the study, said:  This competition for binding to the receptor represents an unexpected way in which cancer can occur. We found that in cells where Grb2 is depleted, FGFR2 was vulnerable to Plc 1 binding and that this triggered uncontrolled proliferation.  Increasing the amount of Grb2 rescued this effect to maintain normal FGFR2 activity. What we think is happening is that under normal conditions the two proteins compete fairly evenly and that the Plc 1 binding events allow useful cell housekeeping. When the proteins get imbalanced, Plc 1 can get out of control.  The researchers also looked at the process in a mouse model and found that Grb2 depletion results in the development of multiple tumours in the vicinity of a primary tumour, indicating that protein imbalance can have a role in metastasis, the spread of a cancer through the body. This makes sense because Plc 1 can play a role in increasing cell movement. Finally, the researchers looked at whether imbalance between Grb2 and Plc 1 was predictive of the progress of ovarian cancers in patients. Measuring the levels of the proteins in patient tissues followed by database analysis of clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other sources revealed that a high level of Grb2 relative to Plc 1 and FGFR2 was associated with a significantly more favourable prognosis than patients with elevated levels of Plc 1.  Statistical data reveal that just under 40% of patients with a favourable balance were still alive seven years after samples were taken. Less than 10% of patients with high levels of Plc 1 and FGFR2 binding sites survived the same length of time. Professor Ladbury said:  From the patient s point of view, the key findings are that these proteins are biomarkers. They could offer information to clinicians on who is going to benefit from therapy and, just as importantly, who is not. On the treatment side, the proteins  interaction could be a valid therapeutic target: you could, for instance, target Plc 1 to ensure it does not overwhelm the cell.  Previous research findings have emphasised the roots of cancer in genetic mutation. Some studies have pointed to cancers that occur without genetic causes, such as through epigenetic modifications of proteins, however the present study reveals that signalling though cell wall-based receptors can occur without receptor activation and therefore that non-genetic causes may be critical to understanding cancer in large numbers of patients. The researchers are now working with clinicians at the University of Leeds to study the same mechanisms in other forms of cancer. They are also exploring the possibility that other cell receptors could play a similar role to FGFR2 in sustaining oncogenic signalling without being activated themselves.","Published: July 28, 2015"

Scientists from the University of Freiburg have solved the molecular mechanism of a fish toxin that could be used in the future as a medication to treat cancer. The Yersinia species of pathogens can cause the bubonic plague and serious gastrointestinal infections in humans. The pharmacologist Dr. Thomas Jank and his fellow researchers in the research group led by BIOSS member Prof. Dr. Dr. Klaus Aktories at the University of Freiburg studied a pathogen of the Yersinia family (Yersinia ruckeri). This pathogen causes redmouth disease in Salmonidae, which includes salmon and trout, resulting in large financial losses in the fish industry. The research group was able to identify a toxin injection machine in the Y. ruckeri genome. The structure of this machine resembles that of viruses that normally attack bacteria. The group demonstrated that the toxin Afp18 in this injection machine is an enzyme that deactivates the switch protein RhoA. RhoA is responsible for many vital processes in the cells of humans and fish. For example, it controls the building up and breaking down of actin filaments. These filaments are not only necessary for cell division, but also for the spreading of tumour metastases in the body.In close collaboration with the developmental biologist and BIOSS researcher Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Driever,also from the University of Freiburg, the research group injected the toxin Afp18 into zebra fish embryos. The result was that cell division was blocked, and the fish embryos did not develop. The toxin caused the actin filaments in the fish cells to collapse. This is because the Afp18 attaches a sugar molecule, an N-acetylglucosamine, onto the amino acid tyrosine in RhoA. According to the scientists, this is a very unusual reaction in nature. The team was able to shed light on this mechanism at the atomic level through the X-ray analysis of Afp18-modified RhoA crystals. For this, they collaborated with Prof. Dr. Daan von Aalten from the University of Dundee, Scotland. Rho-regulatory proteins are involved in the growth of cancer, especially metastasis. For this reason, the researchers from the University of Freiburg believe that this fish toxin has great therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.","Published: July 28, 2015"

Under the terms of the agreement, Allergan will acquire Naurex for a $560 million upfront payment net of cash acquired, $460 million of which is payable upon the closing of the acquisition and $100 million of which is payable by January of 2016 (or upon the closing if the closing has not occurred by such time), as well as potential R&D success-based and sales-threshold milestone payments. The Company remains committed to de-leveraging to below 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of the first quarter of 2016. The acquisition will also add Naurex's development product NRX-1074, a next-generation drug candidate, the intravenous form of which has shown rapid and robust antidepressant efficacy in an initial single-dose Phase 2 study.  NRX-1074 is also an orally bioavailable drug candidate which is in Phase 1 studies. Rapastinel and NRX-1074 are both targeted modulators of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Both therapies have been found to be well-tolerated in all studies to date, with no drug-related serious adverse events or any of the dissociative side effects typically seen with NMDA antagonists. ""The acquisition of Naurex is a great fit for Allergan and a compelling and exciting investment. We expect Naurex will enhance Allergan's mental health portfolio and build on our strategy to lead in this important therapeutic area,"" said Brent Saunders, CEO and President of Allergan. ""Naurex's unique pipeline comprises compounds that utilize a new mechanism to target areas of significant unmet medical need in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including severe and/or treatment-resistant depression. These highly differentiated compounds will immediately bolster our exceptional mental health pipeline."" ""Our team at Naurex has been successful in bringing these two highly innovative treatments for depression through proof-of-concept clinical trials,"" said Norbert Riedel, Ph.D., President and CEO of Naurex. ""We recognized that Allergan's deep commitment and experience in mental health position them particularly well to progress these programs through further clinical development and into commercialization. This transaction also enables us to leverage our proven team and technology to continue innovating in this space through the spin-out of Naurex's platform and initiation of a research collaboration with Allergan, a credible and committed partner in the field."" Naurex has built a platform for discovering drugs that enhance synaptic plasticity, or strengthen the network for neural cell communication. Molecules discovered by Naurex achieve this through a novel mechanism that modulates the NMDA receptor   rather than shutting it down   resulting in drugs that are both highly effective and well-tolerated. Naurex's discovery platform has yielded a rich pipeline of NMDA receptor modulators, including subtype-selective molecules, with the potential to treat a broad set of psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition, Naurex will spin-out this discovery platform into a new company. Allergan and this new company will enter into a research collaboration focused on the discovery and early development of innovative small molecule NMDA receptor modulators for the treatment of certain psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Allergan will receive first right to in-license a defined number of drug candidates resulting from the collaboration for certain indications. Further details on the new company will be shared at a later date. ""Rapastinel and NRX-1074 offer the potential for faster onset of action, equal or greater efficacy and a more favorable safety and tolerability profile than traditional anti-depressants,"" said David Nicholson, EVP and President of Global Brands Research and Development for Allergan. ""If approved, they will provide a significant and complementary addition to our world-class CNS and mental health portfolio. Our ongoing research collaboration will also position us to continue to leverage Naurex's innovative drug discovery platform to drive further long-term value and provide patients with needed treatment options in this important therapeutic area."" About Rapastinel (GLYX-13) Rapastinel (GLYX-13) is a novel NMDA receptor modulator being developed as an adjunctive treatment for difficult-to-treat major depressive disorder. Unlike most currently approved antidepressants, which act on serotonin and related neurotransmitter pathways in the brain, rapastinel works through an entirely different mechanism, mobilizing glutamate pathways to enhance synaptic plasticity and improve the communication between neuronal cells. In Phase 2b clinical trial results presented at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology last year, it was demonstrated that repeat-dose adjunctive treatment with rapastinel resulted in robust and sustained antidepressant effects in subjects with inadequate responses to their current antidepressants. Rapastinel was well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events reported, including no sign of the psychotomimetic, or psychosis-like, effects associated with NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine. These data confirmed the efficacy and safety results from an earlier Phase 2 single-dose study of rapastinel, which also documented the drug's rapid onset of antidepressant activity in as little as two hours.  Naurex has completed an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Phase 3 program is expected to begin in 2016.","Published: July 28, 2015"

The system can be likened to a massive switchboard when the wrong switches are flipped, genes can be inappropriately turned on or off, leading to the onset of diseases. Now, VARI scientists have unraveled how an important plant protein, known as TOPLESS, interacts with other molecules responsible for turning genes off. The findings in plants provide a general model across species for this type of gene silencing, which is linked to several vital biological functions in humans. This is really a fundamental discovery our structure shows the corepressor TOPLESS interacting with key repressor motifs, which constitutes a major component of gene silencing in plants,  said Van Andel Research Institute s Karsten Melcher, Ph.D., one of the study s corresponding authors.  Understanding this interaction in plants gives us unique insight into similar pathways in humans that involve these proteins, which are notoriously tough to investigate.  Using a method called X-ray crystallography, the team determined the three- dimensional structure of TOPLESS, both on its own and when linked with other molecules responsible for turning genes off, thereby regulating gene expression. Although these interacting molecules were chosen from different signaling pathways in plants, they all linked up with TOPLESS in the same manner  This structure will allow us to take a more targeted approach to investigating TOPLESS s counterparts in humans and significantly expands our knowledge base,  said VARI s H. Eric Xu, Ph.D., who also is a corresponding author.  We re extremely excited to continue this work to better understand these proteins and how they interact with other molecules in health and disease states.  The new paper is the third in a trio of publications that unveil key components of fundamental molecular processes. Although the new study provides further insight into human molecular pathways, the work also directly describes how components of the molecular switchboard in plants interact to regulate responses to a multitude of stressors, including temperature fluctuations. The new findings follow an earlier Nature paper, which was included in the top ten list of scientific breakthroughs of 2009 by Science Magazine, and an earlier Science paper, both of which describe how plants respond to drought and temperature stress. Taken together, the papers not only have implications for developing hardier plants but also for determining molecular structures for components of entire pathways. ","Published: July 28, 2015"

Based in the purpose-built Laboratory Medicine Building at The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, the Glasgow Molecular Pathology Node will enable scientists, pathologists and clinicians to collaborate with our industry partners in developing new diagnostic tests. The University s investments at The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital have already established a world-leading reputation for Glasgow in precision medicine.  The Node will co-locate with the  20m the Stratified Medicine Scotland  Innovation Centre; a  32m Imaging Centre of Excellence, housing the UK s first 7-Tesla MRI scanner on a clinical site, which will provide ultra high-resolution imaging to support researchers and clinical trials; a  5m clinical research facility that will host precision medicine clinical trials; and the  30m Queen Elizabeth Teaching & Learning Centre, including dedicated incubator space for life sciences companies to engage with researchers and the NHS.The Glasgow Molecular Pathology Node will integrate laboratory medicine, including pathology and informatics disciplines, which handle and analyse the large datasets that emerge from molecular research.  Professor Anna Dominiczak, Vice Principal and Head of the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences at the University of Glasgow, said:  The goal of precision medicine is to provide the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right time, for the right cost and the right outcome.  We now understand more about abnormalities in DNA and other molecules which occur in disease.   This so-called  molecular pathology  is revealing significant variation in diseases which by standard classifications, for example by a pathologist using a microscope, have been indistinguishable.  So, for instance, we now know that pancreatic cancer is not just one disease but many different ones, potentially with different treatments.  Dr Karin Oien, the lead investigator, said:  Glasgow is central to stratified therapeutic development in the UK and worldwide. Our investigators include global opinion leaders with major roles in international academic studies and industry efforts.  Our Node will immediately integrate with current and emerging large-scale initiatives such as the Stratified Medicine Scotland Innovation Centre, the Precision Medicine Catapult, the Scottish Genomes Partnership, Genome England and the International Cancer Genome Consortium, the next iteration of which is focused on clinical delivery, to exploit opportunities provided through these mechanisms, and in turn substantially enhance them.  Our excellent training in molecular pathology, genetics, informatics and stratified medicine will address national skill shortages and contribute to a workforce capable of developing, undertaking, interpreting, and applying the results of novel molecular diagnostics, across a range of professions and expertise from geneticists, pathologists, clinical and other scientists, informaticians and clinicians across hospital practice and primary care.  Minister for Life Sciences George Freeman said:  Advances in medical genetics and the use of data are making it possible to design a new generation of 'Stratified' or 'Precision' medicines which work more effectively, with fewer side effects, in more targeted groups of patients. In cancer this is leading to personally-tailored therapies.  As an integrated healthcare system underpinned by our  1billion per annum National Institute for Health Research expenditure, the NHS is perfectly placed to pioneer this field.  This  5.4 million investment in projects at the Universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews will enhance our UK-wide capability to deliver 21st Century diagnostics and complement initiatives such as the Precision Medicine Catapult Centre to make sure that ground-breaking medicines technologies are adopted by the NHS and delivered to patients as quickly as possible.  Robert Calderwood, Chief Executive of NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, said:  This is a wonderful opportunity for our staff to work collaboratively with the University of Glasgow and industry partners in this exciting and innovative area of research which will be for the benefit of patients, both within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and across Scotland and the UK.  Jim Reid, CEO of Sistemic, one of the industrial collaboration partners for the Glasgow Molecular Pathology Node and a Director of the Scottish Life Science Association stated: ""This is a great boost for Glasgow and the UK. The formation of these Nodes will act to accelerate the development and translation of a range of molecular pathology products into the clinic and bring undoubted benefit to patients and the health service.  Additionally, as can be seen from the involvement of a number of SME's including Sistemic, there is the immediate potential to boost local industry and the broader economy. Bringing industry, academic research and the NHS closer together, which will be a key objective of the Pathology Nodes, will provide the ideal environment for the rapid development of health solutions, bring improved patient care and ensure the creation of sustainable economic growth.""

In 16 of 20 patients with advanced disease, there was a significant clinical response. The scientists found that the T-cell therapy was generally well-tolerated and that modified immune cells traveled to the bone marrow, where myeloma tumors typically are found, and showed a long-term ability to fight the tumors. Relapse was generally associated with a loss of the engineered T-cells.  This study suggests that treatment with engineered T-cells is not only safe but of potential clinical benefit to patients with certain types of aggressive multiple myeloma,  says first author Aaron P. Rapoport, MD, the Gary Jobson Professor in Medical Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  Our findings provide a strong foundation for further research in the field of cellular immunotherapy for myeloma to help achieve even better results for our patients.  The trial is the first published use of genetically modified T-cells for treating patients with multiple myeloma. The approach has been used to treat leukemia as well as lymphoma, according to Dr. Rapoport, who is the Director of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center. More than 77,000 people in the United States have multiple myeloma, with about 24,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Patients are treated with chemotherapy and in many cases an autologous stem cell transplant, but long-term response rates are low, and median survival is three to five years.  The majority of patients who participated in this trial had a meaningful degree of clinical benefit,  Dr. Rapoport notes.  Even patients who later relapsed after achieving a complete response to treatment or didn t have a complete response had periods of disease control that I believe they would not have otherwise experienced. Some patients are still in remission after nearly three years.  The research is a collaboration between the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Adaptimmune, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company which owns the core T-cell receptor technology and funded the study. Dr. Rapoport and co-authors Edward A. Stadtmauer, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center, and Gwendolyn K. Binder-Scholl, PhD, of Adaptimmune, contributed equally to the research. Dr. Rapoport is the study s principal investigator. In the clinical study, patients  T-cells were engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for a type of tumor antigen, or protein, known as a cancer-testis antigen (CT antigen). The target CT antigens were NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Up to 60 percent of advanced myelomas have been reported to express NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1, which correlates to tumor proliferation and poorer outcomes. According to Adaptimmune, the trial is the first published study of lentiviral vector mediated TCR gene expression in humans. Of the 20 patients treated, 14 (70 percent) had a near complete or complete response three months after treatment. Median progression-free survival was 19.1 months and overall survival was 32.1 months. Two patients had a very good partial response three months post treatment.  Half the patients were treated at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center and half at the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center. Researchers note that the response rate was better than would be expected for a standard autologous stem cell transplant. In addition, patients did not experience side effects which have been associated with another type of genetically engineered T-cells (chimeric antigen receptors, or CARS) used to treat other cancers. The study was originally developed by Carl H. June, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center, and Dr. Rapoport, who have been research collaborators for 18 years.  Multiple myeloma is a treatable but largely incurable cancer. This study reveals the promise that immunotherapy with genetically engineered T-cells holds for boosting the body s ability to attack the cancer and provide patients with better treatments and control of their disease,  says E. Albert Reece, MD., PhD, MBA, vice president for medical affairs at the University of Maryland and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  This trial is also an excellent example of significant scientific advances that result from collaborations between academic medical institutions and private industry. ","Published: July 28, 2015"

Insulin resistance is broadly defined as reduced tissue responsiveness to the action of insulin. According to the American Diabetes Association, 29.1 million individuals in the United States have diabetes and more than half of adults older than 64 have prediabetes. Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). Insulin has been increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the brain, according to the study background. Barbara B. Bendlin, Ph.D., of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, and coauthors studied 150 cognitively normal, late middle-age adults (average age nearly 61), who underwent cognitive testing, a fasting blood draw and fludeoxyglucose F 18-labeled positron emission tomography of the brain. Of the 150 participants, 108 (72 percent) were women, 103 (68.7 percent) had a parental history of AD, 61 (40.7%) had an APOE  4 allele and seven (4.7 percent) had type 2 diabetes. The authors found insulin resistance was associated with lower global glucose metabolism and lower regional glucose metabolism across large portions of the brain in the frontal, lateral, parietal, lateral temporal and medial temporal lobes. Lower glucose metabolism in the left medial temporal lobe was related to worse performance in immediate memory. ""The prevalence of AD continues to grow, and midlife may be a critical period for initiating treatments aimed at preventing or delaying the onset of AD. Accumulating evidence suggests that treatments targeting mechanisms involved in insulin signaling may affect central glucose metabolism and should be investigated in the context of presymptomatic AD,"" the study concludes.

The study released today will be presented at the Sports Concussion Conference in Denver, July 24 to 26, hosted by the American Academy of Neurology, the world s leading authority on diagnosing and managing sports concussion. The conference will feature the latest scientific advances in diagnosing and treating sports concussion from leading experts in the field. The study involved 148 college athletes from 11 sports at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. All had taken tests of learning and processing along with other measures of the brain s abilities, such as attention and working memory speed. Of the participants, 45 percent were female, 51 percent played a contact sport and 24 percent had experienced a concussion. They had an average of 0.3 concussions, ranging from zero to four. Men and women were equally likely to have a history of concussion, even after researchers adjusted for the percentage who played contact sports. Women who have had a history of at least one concussion do not score lower on computerized cognitive baseline testing. However, all women, regardless of concussion history, had greater symptoms, symptom severity and poorer cognitive performance than men at baseline. Women reported on average 1.5 more symptoms and scored three points higher on symptom severity than men. On a clinical reaction time task, women were 19 milliseconds slower to react than men. On cognitive tasks assessing processing speed, attention and working memory speed women scored on average seven percent below men with the greatest difference on processing speed (8.5 percent).  More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand why women may have lower performance at preseason baseline. The difference in performance between genders should be of great interest to athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, and doctors who utilize baseline assessments to aide recovery protocols,  said study author Kathryn L. O Connor of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.  This finding that cognitive skills were not significantly affected by having a concussion for either gender should be reassuring to athletes who have experienced a concussion and wonder about its later effects,  O Connor said.

Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has been a long-term mystery. In 2013, Tsuyoshi Shimmura and Takashi Yoshimura of Nagoya University have reported in Current Biology that the rooster's crowing mechanism is actually governed by their internal biological clock. (National Geographic ""How a Rooster Knows to Crow at Dawn"" (March 19, 2013)) Triggered by the first crow from a rooster, other roosters nearby also start to crow like a ripple effect. Crowing is considered to be an action by roosters to alert others of their territory. In addition, chickens are known to be highly social creatures and develop a dominance hierarchy called pecking order when a small number of chickens forms a group. This pecking order starts with the dominant chicken pecking all the chickens, the second dominant chicken pecking all the chickens apart from the dominant chicken and with the least dominant chicken remaining harmless. The social ranking of roosters is strongly reflected in the actions within the groups, and the highest ranking rooster has been known to have priority in eating and mating. Published online in Scientific Reports, Shimmura and Yoshimura discovered for the first time that the order of precedence of crowing in roosters is also based on social ranking within the group. Through observation of a group of 4 roosters, Shimmura in Yoshimura's research group, currently an assistant professor in the National Institute of Basic Biology in Japan, found that there was a systematic rule in the order of crowing. Further investigations revealed that the highest ranking rooster among the group was always the first one to crow in the morning. The crowing was followed by the second, third and fourth ranking roosters, which shows that roosters crow in descending order of their social ranking. In addition, the starting time to crow for the most dominant rooster varied from day to day, but the crowing of the lower ranking roosters always started right after the crowing of the highest ranking rooster. From these observations, Shimmura and Yoshimura identified that the most dominant rooster had priority to announce the break of dawn by being able to determine the timing to crow within the group. Upon removing the highest ranking rooster from the group, the second ranking rooster became the first to crow, showing that the second ranking rooster can also take the role of the most dominant rooster. Along with these results, they also showed that the frequency of voluntary crowing was lower for subordinate roosters compared to dominant roosters. On the other hand, upon stimulating the roosters to crow using light and/or sounds, they found that the subordinate roosters crowed as much as the dominant roosters. This indicates that although the subordinate roosters have the ability to crow, they have the patience to wait every morning for the most dominant rooster to crow before crowing themselves. ""We have discovered that roosters live in a strictly linear hierarchy, where social ranking reflects the order to announce the break of dawn,"" says Yoshimura, who led the research and is a principal investigator at the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules (ITbM) in Nagoya University.

The findings suggest that after sleep we are more likely to recall facts which we could not remember while still awake. In two situations where subjects forgot information over the course of 12 hours of wakefulness, a night's sleep was shown to promote access to memory traces that had initially been too weak to be retrieved. The research, published in the journal Cortex, tracked memories for novel, made-up words learnt either prior to a night's sleep, or an equivalent period of wakefulness. Subjects were asked to recall words immediately after exposure, and then again after the period of sleep or wakefulness. The key distinction was between those word memories which participants could remember at both the immediate test and the 12-hour retest, and those not remembered at test, but eventually remembered at retest. The researcher found that, compared to daytime wakefulness, sleep helped rescue unrecalled memories more than it prevented memory loss. Nicolas Dumay of the University of Exeter explains: ""Sleep almost doubles our chances of remembering previously unrecalled material. The post-sleep boost in memory accessibility may indicate that some memories are sharpened overnight. This supports the notion that, while asleep, we actively rehearse information flagged as important. More research is needed into the functional significance of this rehearsal and whether, for instance, it allows memories to be accessible in a wider range of contexts, hence making them more useful."" The beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established, and the act of sleeping is known to help us remember the things that we did, or heard, the previous day. The idea that memories could also be sharpened and made more vivid and accessible overnight, however, is yet to be fully explored. Dr Dumay believes the memory boost comes from the hippocampus, an inner structure of the temporal lobe, unzipping recently encoded episodes and replaying them to regions of the brain originally involved in their capture - this would lead the subject to effectively re-experience the major events of the day. Nicolas Dumay is an experimental psychologist at the University of Exeter and an honorary Staff Scientist at the Basque Centre for Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL), in Spain.

The embryo cannot survive without the male chromosomes.  These findings show the critical role that the protein RGS2 plays in preserving the fertilizability of the ovulated egg,  said Carmen Williams, M.D., Ph.D., lead researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the NIH.  Other researchers have shown that RGS2 plays an important role in regulating heart function and blood pressure, but this is the first demonstration of the protein s significant role in fertilization. Dr. Williams explained that the immature egg found in the ovary is not very good at rallying the necessary calcium signaling that is needed to respond to sperm. However, during the maturation process, the egg stores calcium, preparing it for fertilization. At fertilization, the sperm causes calcium to release within the egg, turning it into a developing embryo. The mouse study shows that during maturation the egg synthesizes RGS2, which suppresses calcium signaling. This safety mechanism ensures that the egg does not begin releasing calcium and start developing before the sperm arrives. Beginning development too early prevents the egg from merging with the sperm. The RGS2 protein is being looked at as a therapeutic target for hypertension and other heart ailments.  Understanding the role RGS2 plays in reproduction is important when considering the possible benefits and side effects of any new treatments, as well as understanding the impact that toxins might have on human fertility,  said Linda Birnbaum, Ph.D., director of NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program.","Published: July 27, 2015"

The main motivation for MAGI has been to reduce the computational burden required for researchers or doctors to explore and annotate cancer genomics data,  said Max Leiserson, a Ph.D. student at Brown who led the development of the tool.  MAGI lets users explore these data in a regular web browser and with no computational expertise required.  In addition to viewing TCGA data, the portal also allows researchers to upload data they may have collected on their own and compare the findings to those in the larger databases.  Over the last decade, researchers working with TCGA have sequenced genes from thousands of  tumors and dozens of cancer types in an effort to understand which mutations contribute to the development of cancer,  said Ben Raphael, director of Brown s Center for Computational and Molecular Biology, who helped oversee the project.  At the same time, as sequencing has gotten faster and cheaper, individual researchers have begun sequencing samples from their own studies, sometimes from just a few tumors.  By uploading their data to MAGI, researchers can leverage the large public datasets to help interpret their own data.  In cancer genomics, there s real value in large sample sizes because mutations are diverse and spread all over the genome,  Raphael said.  If I had just sequenced a few cancer genomes from my local tumor bank, one of the first things I d want to do is compare my data to these big public datasets and look for similarities.  MAGI has data from TCGA already loaded. Users can search by cancer type, by individual genes, or by groups of genes. The output offers several ways of visualizing the search results, showing how often a given gene is mutated across samples, what types of mutations they were, and other information. Those same search and visualization capabilities are available for user-uploaded data, which enables researchers to look at their own data side-by-side with TCGA data. Users can also annotate TCGA data, appending new findings, academic papers and other relevant information.  When someone uploads data to MAGI, they can use the public data to help them interpret their own dataset,  Raphael said.  But in the process, they might also be able say something about the public data. We thought: wouldn t it be great if users could record that information and share it?  The MAGI project started as a means of looking at the output from algorithms that Raphael s lab develops. Those algorithms comb through large genome datasets, helping to pick out the mutations that are important to cancer development and distinguishing them from benign mutations that are just along for the ride.  As we were developing tools to visualize our own results, we realized that other researchers might also find these tools useful,  Raphael said.  We decided to develop a public portal for the cancer genomics research community.  The lab is making MAGI available for free, with the hope that many in the cancer genomics community will take advantage of it.  We think this could be a really useful piece of software,  Raphael said.  There s great value in just being able to look at these data. We hope MAGI will lead to some new discoveries.

It seems that doctors will now get the job done with more ease thanks to new, nontoxic surgical glue that instantly seals a bleeding wound and helps it heal without a scar or inflammation. The product, called LAMBA, has emerged as a promising candidate for an ideal bioadhesive for its outstanding properties; LAMBA s compatibility with the human body, strong adhesiveness in wet conditions, and convenient handling point to the possibility of myriad medical applications.Mechanical fasteners like sutures and staples have accounted until recently for a major portion of conventional medical devices that are used to hold body tissues together. The invasive nature of traditional methods, however, has been the biggest drawback causing severe tissue damage, complicated post-treatment management, and scars. Their use is also limited when handling delicate tissues and internal organs, giving rise to a need for alternatives that do not require penetration. Tissue adhesives have been increasingly pursued these days as a more desirable bonding material, but the adhesives currently available in the market likewise have their own limitations. While chemically derived adhesives such as cyanoacrylates are likely to provoke an adverse reaction, biologically derived ones are not strong enough to close wounds like sutures do. A common and critical challenge, moreover, is that most surgical glues do not stick in a wet environment, which is essential for medical applications. Dr. Hyung Joon Cha, a professor of the Department of Chemical Engineering at POSTECH, and his student, Eun Young Jeon, have developed a new approach that readily overcomes these drawbacks. The new product LAMBA, a focus of their recent publication in Biomaterials, is an upgrade version of previously known mussel-inspired adhesives that copy mussels  ability to fix their body under water. Instead of producing recombinant mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) by modifying DOPA, a key element for the adhesive property, E.Y. Jeon et al., have created the new tissue adhesive via a photochemical reaction using blue visible light. E.Y. Jeon et al gained the idea for this more economic, facile, and reliable strategy from dityrosine crosslinks that are often found in dragonfly wings and insect cuticles. When visible light triggers a photo-oxidation reaction in MAPs plentiful of tyrosine, neighboring tyrosine residues are instantly coupled into dityrosine crosslinks, which in turn enhance structural stability and adhesive properties of the new MAPs in the form of hydrogel. The researchers report that animal studies have proved LAMBA s superiority to existing options including sutures and other surgical glues, potentially qualifying for an ideal tissue bonding material. The new adhesive hydrogel not only closes an open wound on a bleeding site within less than 60 seconds, but also effectively facilitates the healing process without inflammation or a scar.  LAMBA opens numerous doors for medical practices ranging from blocking air leaks and sutureless wound closures of delicate organs or tissues beyond surgeons  reach, to hemostatic agent and drug delivery medium, just to name a few,  commented Dr. Cha, a corresponding author of this study.","Published: July 27, 2015"

The self-limiting gene technique has already been trialled against dengue fever-carrying mosquitos, successfully reducing their populations by over 90% in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands   an unprecedented level of control by any method, and one that is leading to municipal projects following approval by the national biosafety group in Brazil for releases throughout the country. The approach was inspired by the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), which has been used worldwide for more than 50 years, where male insects are sterilized by radiation and released to mate with pest females. Without offspring the population crashes. Oxitec s approach harnesses the natural reproductive instincts of the male insects, but doesn t rely on radiation to sterilize them, which can affect many genes and the insect s ability to mate. Instead, a self-limiting gene is carried by the insects, in this case diamondback moths. The engineered male moths are released to mate with the pest females, and because their female offspring do not survive to reproduce, the number of pest moths dwindles. The Oxitec moths also carry a color marker for monitoring. In the new results published, scientists from the US, UK and China show that diamondback moth populations in greenhouses were well controlled within 8 weeks. Unlike insecticides, which can affect a broad variety of insect life including bees and other beneficial insects, this approach is entirely species-specific, affecting only the targeted pest population. The self-limiting gene is also non-toxic, so the moths can be eaten by birds or other animals with no adverse effects.  This research is opening new doors for the future of farming with pest control methods that are non-toxic and pesticide-free,  said Dr Neil Morrison, lead DBM Research Scientist at Oxitec and a co-author on the paper.  We all share an interest in safe and environmentally friendly pest control, so this is a very promising tool that could be put to good use by farmers as part of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for healthy and sustainable agriculture.  Co-author Tony Shelton, Professor of Entomology at Cornell University, is also an expert on IPM, and hopes that the new technology can be used as a part of more agro-ecological farming systems, including organic production.  Both conventional and organic pesticides are failing to control DBM, so it s time for scientists and farmers to work together to find new tools,  he said. The struggle with diamondback moth for cruciferous vegetable production costs farmers around the world up to $5 billion dollars each year. DBM is poorly controlled by current methods, especially as the moths are becoming increasingly resistant to insecticides.  Diamondback is a serious problem for farmers in New York State and around the world   anywhere cruciferous vegetables and field crops are grown. These moths invade and attack the crops, and they are developing resistance to insecticides, so we urgently need new tools to better control them,  added Professor Shelton, who is planning follow-up studies to test the Oxitec moths under harsher, outdoor conditions in upstate New York. These studies include field cage tests this summer, with plans for small-scale field releases in future. The upcoming trials have already been approved by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) following extensive review by independent experts and a public consultation last year. Oxitec s Dr Morrison concluded:  As agricultural challenges make the coexistence of diverse pest control methods increasingly important, farmers will   more than ever   need the support of their governments, public, and the scientific community to help provide them with the tools they need to put food on our tables.

Chan School of Public Health.  Data from this study clearly demonstrated the ubiquity of neonicotinoids in pollen and honey samples that bees are exposed to during the seasons when they are actively foraging across Massachusetts. Levels of neonicotinoids that we found in this study fall into ranges that could lead to detrimental health effects in bees, including CCD,  said Chensheng (Alex) Lu, associate professor of environmental exposure biology in the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard Chan School and lead author of the study.Since 2006, there have been significant losses of honeybee colonies. Scientists, policymakers, farmers, and beekeepers are concerned with this problem because bees are prime pollinators of roughly one-third of all crops worldwide. Previous studies analyzed either stored pollen collected from hives or pollen samples collected from bees at a single point in time. In this study, the Harvard Chan School researchers looked at pollen samples collected over time   during spring and summer months when bees forage   from the same set of hives across Massachusetts. Collecting samples in this way enabled the researchers to determine variations in levels of eight neonicotinoids, and to identify high-risk locations or months for neonicotinoid exposure for bees. The researchers worked with 62 Massachusetts beekeepers who volunteered to collect monthly samples of pollen and honey from foraging bees, from April through August 2013, using pollen traps on the landings of beehives. The beekeepers then sent the samples to the researchers. The researchers analyzed 219 pollen and 53 honey samples from 62 hives, from 10 out of 14 counties in Massachusetts. They found neonicotinoids in pollen and honey for each month collected, in each location   suggesting that bees are at risk of neonicotinoid exposure any time they are foraging anywhere in Massachusetts. The most commonly detected neonicotinoid was imidacloprid, followed by dinotefuran. Particularly high concentrations of neonicotinoids were found in Worcester County in April, in Hampshire County in May, in Suffolk County in July, and in Essex County in June, suggesting that, in these counties, certain months pose significant risks to bees. The new findings suggest that neonicotinoids are being used throughout Massachusetts. Not only do these pesticides pose a significant risk for the survival of honeybees, but they also may pose health risks for people inhaling neonicotinoid-contaminated pollen, Lu said.  The data presented in this study should serve as a basis for public policy that aims to reduce neonicotinoid exposure,  he said.","Published: July 27, 2015"

This investment into the Group s leveraged R&D business is in line with its strategy of driving scientific leadership and leveraging its technology platform as stated at IPO.  The leveraged R&D business is underpinned by the Group s gene editing, genetically-defined disease models, genetic and combination drug screening technology platforms, and its extensive know how in cancer research and drug discovery. The business is designed to deliver a portfolio of upside potential to investors over and above the products and services businesses that recently reported 118% growth in revenues to circa  8.6 million in H1, 2015 versus the same period in 2014. Shareholders currently stand to benefit from Horizon s historical investment of  4 million in this business, which has been recouped with a forward potential to recognise up to  158 million in pre-clinical and clinical drug development milestones from a range of programs, plus product royalties on its HD-001 program, now partnered with AstraZeneca. This targeted investment will be used to define novel drug targets and early stage New Chemical Entities (NCEs)/New Biological Entities (NBEs) that could lead to the discovery of novel cancer drug candidates across many different oncology indications. The Group will be seeking early partnerships for these programmes with therapeutic-focused companies. This strategy is expected to enable the Group to broaden the pipeline of potential revenue earning milestone agreements as programmes progress, as well as future royalties upon product sales.  The investment will be directed into two areas of research focus: synthetic lethality and immuno-oncology. Synthetic lethality exploits vulnerabilities arising from rewiring of cell signaling pathways by cancer-driving mutations, a strategy recently validated by the approval of AstraZeneca s drug Lynparza for the treatment of ovarian cancer (synthetic lethality also underpins the Group s HD-001 programme). Immuno-oncology can overcome the mechanisms by which cancer cells hide from the immune system, and give long-lasting cancer remission. Immuno-oncology successes include the marketed products Yervoy, Opdivo and Keytruda.  Dr. Darrin M. Disley, Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Discovery Group plc, commented:  In line with our strategy to reach profitability in 2017 driven by revenues derived from our products services and leveraged R&D businesses, we are investing to expand our milestone portfolio in two very promising areas of cancer research, which are predicted to represent 20-50% of the oncology market in ten years  time. By seeking early partnerships we will keep the portfolio broad whilst minimizing risk, with earlier and more predictable returns for the Company  Dr. Jon Moore, Chief Scientific Officer and Vice President, Oncology, said:  We anticipate that applying our technologies in a focused way will deliver valuable new targets for many cancer types that have not yet been proved treatable by existing therapies. Our goal is to bring the prospect of cures and long-lasting remission to millions more patients, and we believe that our technology and approach provides us with an advantage in finding these targets.

Scientists concluded that packing of the genome in a special state called ""fractal globule"", apart from other known advantages of this state, allows the genetic machinery of the cell to operate with maximum speed due to comperatively rapid thermal diffusion.  Fractal globule is a mathematical term. If you drop a long spinning fishing line on the floor, it will curtail immediately into such an unimaginably vile tangle that you will either have to unravel it for hours, or run to the store for a new one. An entangled state like this is an example of the so-called equilibrium globule. Fractal globule is a much more convenient state. Sticking to the fishing line example fractal globule is a lump, where the line is never fastened in a knot, instead it is just curled into series of loops with no loops tangled with each other. Such a structure -- a set of free loops of different sizes - can be unraveled by just pulling it by two ends.Due to this structure of loops or crumples,which reminds the structure of an instant noodle block, Soviet physicists Alexander Grosberg, Sergey Nechayev and Eugene Shakhnovich, who first predicted it back in 1988, named this structure ""crumpled globule"". In the recent years it is more often called a fractal globule. On the one hand, this new name just sounds more sophisticated and serious than ""crumpled globule"", but on the other hand, it fully reflects the properties of such a globule, because, like all fractals, its structure, which, in this case is represented by a set of loops of different sizes, is repeated in the small and large scale. For a long time the predicted crumpled globule state remained a purely theoretical object. However, the results of the recent studies indicate that the chromosomes in the cell nucleus may be packed into a fractal globule. There is no consensus on this issue in the scientific community, but the specialists working in this area are much intrigued about this possibility and during the last 5-7 years there has been a flood of research on fractal globule packing of the genome. The idea that chromatin (that is to say, a long strand consisting of DNA and attached proteins) in a cell nucleus may be organized in a fractal globule makes intuitive sense. Indeed, the chromatin is essentially a huge library containing all the hereditary information ""known"" to a cell, in particular, all the information about synthesis of all the proteins which the organism in principle is able to produce. It seems natural that such a huge amount of data, which should be preserved and kept readable in a predictable way, should be somehow organized. It makes no sense to make the strands consisting different parts of information entangled and knotted around each other, such an action seems akin to gluing or tying up together the volumes in a library: obviously, it makes the contents of the books much less accessible to a visitor. In addition, it seems natural that a strand in a fractal globule has, in the absence of knots, a greater freedom of movement, which is important for the genome function: it is necessary for the gene transcription regulation that the individual parts of the genome meet each other at the right time, ""activating"" the signal for reading the entire system and pointing the place where the reading should start. Moreover, all of this must happen quickly enough. ""According to the existing theories if the polymer chain is folded into a regular equilibrium globule, the mean square of the chain link thermal displacement increases with time as time to the power 0.25"", -- says Mikhail Tamm, a senior researcher at the Department of Polymer and Crystal at the Physics Faculty of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. According to Mikhail Tamm, he and his colleagues managed to come up with a somewhat similar theory for a link of a polymer chain folded in a fractal globule. ""We were able to evaluate the thermal dynamics inherent to this type of conformation. The computer simulations we have conducted are in good agreement with our theoretical result"", -- says Mikhail Tamm. Scientists from the Lomonosov Moscow State University developed a computer modeling algorithm that allows to prepare a chromatin chain packed in a fractal globule state and to monitor the thermal processes taking place there. Importantly, they managed to model a very long chain, consisting of one quarter million units, which is the longest accessible so far. According to Mikhail Tamm, chains in the modeling need to be long in order to get meaningful results, but modeling of long chains is usually hampered by the fact that it takes them a very long time to equilibrate, while without proper equilibration the results on thermal diffusion as well as other characteristics of the chains are unreliable. The researchers were able to successfully solve this problem by the combination of a properly constructed software and access CPU time on the MSU supercomputer ""Lomonosov"", and assess the dynamics of the thermal motion in a fractal globule. It was found that the links of the chromatin chain packed in a fractal globule moves faster than in a comparable equilibrium one. Indeed, the mean square thermal displacement of the link does not grow in proportion to the time to the power 0.25 anymore, but as time to the power 0.4. It means that the movement of the links turns out to be much faster. It seems to be an additional argument in support of the fractal globule model of the chromatin. The researchers hope that their work will help to provide better insight in the functioning of the gene storage and expression machinery in the cell nucleus. ""From the point of view of dynamics, we would like to understand what are the built-in characteristic times, what processes can occur simply due to thermal motion, and which ones inevitably require the use of active elements to speed up the functioning of DNA"", -- summed up Mikhail Tamm.","Published: July 27, 2015"

Upon recognizing that protein, the rice plants sense that a microbial attack is underway and are able to mount an immune response to fend off bacterial infection, reports a research team led by the University of California, Davis. Identification of the tiny protein, called RaxX, holds promise for developing more disease-resistant crop varieties and therapeutic treatments for blocking microbial infections in both plants and animals, said the researchers, who found particular satisfaction in this discovery, two years after retracting the announcement of a similar find. In this new study, researchers discovered that the RaxX protein was present in at least eight species of the disease-causing Xanthamonas bacteria that are known to attack rice -- the staple food for half of the world's population -- as well as maize, cassava, sugar cane, tomatoes, peppers, wheat, alfalfa, onions, banana and citrus. ""Our research team is delighted to announce discovery of the RaxX protein because it truly does pave the way for amazing developments in crop disease resistance and in therapeutics that can prevent infection in humans and animals,"" said Pamela Ronald, a professor of plant pathology, who directed the study. Ronald noted that her laboratory is currently investigating the role of RaxX during bacterial infection of rice in the absence of the immune receptor. The researchers have noticed that RaxX closely resembles a class of plant signaling factors that promote growth and modulate the immune response. They suspect that the bacteria could be mimicking these natural plant-signaling factors to inhibit the plant immune response and thereby enhance the competitiveness of the bacteria. In the long term, the researchers hope to use this information to develop new strategies to prevent infection in various crops. Publication of the new study is particularly poignant for Ronald and lead co-authors Rory Pruitt and Benjamin Schwessinger, because it brings the research team full circle in correcting unintentional errors that led the Ronald lab in 2009 to misidentify the protein now known to be RaxX. Ronald's laboratory has been studying rice genetics and disease resistance for more than two decades and in 1995 announced that a gene called Xa21 confers resistance to the bacterial blight pathogen. Bacterial blight, one of the worst bacterial plant diseases in the world, has been found in virtually every crop species including rice. The discovery of Xa21 was widely acclaimed by the scientific community and sparked further research into other key parts of the disease-resistance puzzle. Researchers were confident that if Xa21 produced a ""receptor"" in the plant cell that was capable of recognizing and thwarting a bacterial invasion, there must be a complementary protein in the bacteria that triggered that immune response in the plant. In 2009 the Ronald lab announced discovery of a bacterial protein called Ax21, which their research indicated was the protein that triggers the immune response by the Xa21 plant receptor. A second related study, based on identification of Ax21, was published in 2011. Then in 2013, as researchers in the Ronald lab began repeating the earlier experiments in preparation for a new study, they discovered that a bacterial strain had been mislabeled in the previous work and that one of the tests used in the earlier study turned out to be quite variable. These errors had led to the misidentification of Ax21 as the bacterial protein that sparks an immune response by the Xa21 receptor in the plant cells. After finding the errors, Ronald retracted two papers from her laboratory about this research, published in 2009 and 2011 in the journals PLOS One and Science, respectively.

The lab of Kai Johnsson at EPFL, led by Alberto Schena and Rudolf Griss, were able to add a small chemical tag on the enzyme luciferase, which produces the light of fireflies. The tag detects a target protein, and the luciferase gives out a light signal that can be seen with a naked eye. The team has proven expertise in this field: in 2014, they developed a quick and easy drug-monitoring molecule that led to a startup company, Lucentix. Thinking outside the box, they bypassed the pains of protein engineering altogether: instead of mutating the luciferase to make it sensitive for a target protein   which would require enormous labor - they simply attached it to a small chemical tag. The tag acts as a switch: it blocks luciferase, preventing it from producing light. When the tag detects its target protein, it attaches to that instead, removing the block from lucifarase. As a result, luciferase is free to turn on the lights, which is the signal that the target has been found. In short, the scientists have created a chemical solution for a biological problem.  You can think of the tagged luciferase as a cyborg molecule,  says Kai Johnsson.  Half bio, half synthetic. How could you make luciferase sensitive to the presence of another protein just through mutations? It s a lot of work. With this chemical trick, all we have to worry about is designing an appropriate tag that can recognize the target protein.  The activation of luciferase when it detects its target protein is dramatic enough to see with a naked eye. This means that the system does not demand expensive and complicated readout devices. But the success has wider implications.  This is a generalized design,  says Kai Johnsson.  It shows how you can exploit synthetic chemistry to create sophisticated biosensor proteins.

Using new laboratory technology, scientists have shown that cellular damage is detectable in patients after CT scanning, according to a new study led by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine.  We now know that even exposure to small amounts of radiation from computed tomagraphy scanning is associated with cellular damage,  said Patricia Nguyen, MD, one of the lead authors of the study and an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford.  Whether or not this causes cancer or any negative effect to the patient is still not clear, but these results should encourage physicians toward adhering to dose reduction strategies.   The use of medical imaging for heart disease has exploded in the past decade,  said Joseph Wu, MD, senior author of the study. Wu is a professor of medicine and of radiology and the director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.  These tests expose patients to a nontrivial amount of low-dose radiation. But nobody really knows exactly what this low-dose radiation does to the patient. We now have the technology that allows us to look at very subtle, cell-level changes. Along with the burgeoning use of advanced medical imaging tests over the past decade have come rising public health concerns about possible links between low-dose radiation and cancer. The worry is that increased radiation exposure from such diagnostic procedures as CT scans, which expose the body to low-dose X-ray beams, can damage DNA and create mutations that spur cells to grow into tumors. But there has been limited scientific evidence to date that shows the effects of this low-dose radiation on the body, according to the study. Currently, there is a bill winding its way through Congress to fund more research on the health effects of low doses of radiation, Wu said. This study s findings point to the need for more research, he said.  I think there are legitimate concerns about the exposure to low-dose radiation, but the problem is that it is difficult to prove a causal relationship with cancer,  Nguyen said.  Even though we show some damage is occurring at a cellular level, this damage is being repaired. It is the damage that escapes repair, or the cells that are not eliminated and are mutated, that go on and produce cancer. We can t track those cells with current technology.  In this study, researchers examined the effects on human cells of low-dose radiation from a wide range of cardiac and vascular CT scans. These imaging procedures are commonly used for a number of reasons, including management of patients suspected of having obstructive coronary artery disease, and for those with aortic stenosis, in preparation of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. A CT scan, which is used for imaging and diagnostic procedures throughout the body, exposes patients to at least 150 times the amount of radiation from a single chest X-ray, the study said. In 2007, the National Cancer Institute estimated that 29,000 future cancer cases could be attributed to the 72 million CT scans performed in the country that year. But the reliability of such predictions depends on how scientists measure the underlying link between radiation and cancer in the first place, Nguyen said.  Because we don t know much about the effects of low-dose radiation   all we know is about high doses from atomic bomb blast survivors   we just assume it s directly proportional to the dose,  said Nguyen.  We wanted to see what really happens at the cellular level.  Researchers examined the blood of 67 patients undergoing cardiac CT angiograms. Using such techniques as whole-genome sequencing and flow cytometery to measure biomarkers of DNA damage, researchers examined the blood of patients both before and after undergoing the procedure. Results showed an increase in DNA damage and cell death, as well as increased expression of genes involved in cell repair and death, the study said. Although most cells damaged by the scan were repaired, a small percentage of the cells died, the study said.  These findings raise the possibility that radiation exposure from cardiac CT angiography may cause DNA damage that can lead to mutations if damaged cells are not repaired or eliminated properly,  the study said.  Cumulative cell death after repeated exposures may also be problematic.   We need to learn more because it s not a benign effect, even at these low dosages,  Nguyen said.  Our research supports the idea that maybe physicians shouldn t just use the best image quality in all cases. We shouldn t eliminate CT scans because they re obviously important, but you can make it safer by reducing the doses, by getting better machines and technology, and by giving patients something to protect them.  Nguyen added:  It is important to note that we did not detect any DNA damage in patients receiving the lowest doses of radiation and who were of average weight and had regular heart rates.

The findings could lead to human trials in patients with cancer and blood disorders within a year or two, says senior investigator Leonard Zon, a member of the HSCI executive committee and a professor in Harvard s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. The compounds, known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, or EETs, boosted stem cell engraftment in both zebrafish and mice and could make human bone marrow transplants more efficient. Better engraftment could also allow umbilical cord blood to be used as an alternative to marrow as a source of blood stem cells, greatly increasing a patient s chances of finding a matched donor and enhancing safety.  Ninety percent of cord blood units can t be used because they re too small,  explains Zon, who directs the Stem Cell Program at Boston Children s.  If you add these chemicals, you might be able to use more units. Being able to get engraftment allows you to pick a smaller cord blood sample that might be a better match.  EETs are fats that appear to work by stimulating cell migration. They were among the top hits in a screen of 500 known compounds conducted in Boston Children s newly upgraded Karp Aquatics Facility. While zebrafish have previously led Zon s team to compounds that boost blood stem cell numbers, such as prostaglandin (currently in several clinical trials under the name ProHema), the new drug screen specifically tested the stem cells  transplantability and engraftment. The screen was done in a lab-created strain of zebrafish called Casper. Because the strain is see-through, Zon and colleagues could visually compare engraftment of transplanted blood stem cells chemically tagged to glow green or red, in what they dubbed the  Dr. Seuss experiment.  Led by co-first authors Pulin Li, Jamie Lahvic, and Vera Binder, the researchers first used tagging to color the fishes  marrow either red or green, then removed blood stem cells for transplantation. The green cells were incubated with various chemicals, while the red cells were left untreated. Next, the researchers injected a mixture of green and red marrow cells into other groups of zebrafish (10 fish per test chemical). The team then visually tracked the cells  activity in the transplant recipients and measured the green:red ratio.  We call this a competitive transplant model because we can literally compete a green stem cell against a red stem cell and see what wins,  says Zon.  The expectation was that if [the] chemical didn t increase engraftment, all the fish would be equal parts red and green. But if it was effective, green marrow would predominate.  That was the case for green marrow incubated with EETs, a finding that held up over thousands of marrow transplants.  In a mouse system, this experiment would cost $3 million,  notes Zon.  In fish, it cost about $150,000.  In a smaller-scale set of mouse experiments, the team confirmed EETs  efficacy in promoting homing and engraftment of transplanted blood stem cells in mammals. Although EETs are chemical cousins of prostaglandin (both are made from arachidonic acid, and both are made during inflammation), EETs work in a different way, by activating a pathway known as PI3K. EETs also enhanced PI3K activity in human blood vessel cells in a dish. After more studies in human cells to tease out how EETs work, Zon hopes to begin clinical trials of EETs within the next two years, likely in the setting of cord blood transplant. The lab is also investigating its other top hits from the zebrafish screen.  Every new pathway that we find has the chance of making stem cell engraftment and migration even better,  says Zon.  I think we ll end up being able to manipulate this process. ","Published: July 27, 2015"

What role fibroblasts play, and how specifically they affect cancer s growth, is unclear, but they could hold key applications in early cancer detection and treatment.  By using infrared (mid-IR beamline) one can detect chemical changes in the very early stages, before there are any morphological changes,  says Kumar. Hopefully, this would make it possible to detect breast cancer well before it started to physically grow or metastatize.Over the last six months, Kumar and his collaborators have shown the clear advantages of using non-invasive infrared imaging to detect both breast and skin cancers. Because of the brightness of synchrotron light, their technique makes it possible to map chemical information across thousands or millions of cells without altering the body s cells in any way. Infrared imaging could not only make it possible to screen for cancer in its infancy, but to predict possible drug treatment response on a patient-by-patient basis.  Generally there are several chemotherapy drugs, and right now there is no specific tool that says this chemotherapy drug will be efficient for this person but less for that person,  says Kumar.  We could potentially use this method to see person-sensitive responses to the treatment.  Kumar is a CIHR-THRUST fellow and an initial grant of this project was given by the CLS. Recently, Kumar was awarded with the prestigious Swedish grant  VINNOVA: Mobility for growth  to start as a project leader at Uppsala University, Sweden, in collaboration with the CLS.","Published: July 27, 2015"

The much-anticipated discovery, a decade in the making, could have broad impacts on development of more highly targeted and effective drugs with fewer side effects to treat conditions including high blood pressure, diabetes, depression and even some types of cancer.  The study has been hailed by researchers familiar with the work as one of the most important scientific results to date using SLAC s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), a DOE Office of Science User Facility that is one of the brightest sources of X-rays on the planet. The LCLS X-rays are a billion times brighter than those from synchrotrons and produce higher-resolution images while allowing scientists to use smaller samples. These ultrabright X-rays enabled the research team to complete the first 3-D atomic-scale map of a key signaling protein called arrestin while it was docked with a cell receptor involved in vision. The receptor is a well-studied example from a family of hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs, which are targeted by about 40 percent of drugs on the market. Its structure while coupled with arrestin provides new insight into the on/off signaling pathways of GPCRs. The research, led by scientists at the Van Andel Research Institute in Michigan in collaboration with dozens of other scientists from around the globe, represents a major milestone in GPCR structural studies, said Dr. Jeffrey L. Benovic, a biochemistry and molecular biology professor at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia who specializes in such research but was not a part of this study.  This work has tremendous therapeutic implications,  Benovic said.  The study is a critical first step and provides key insight into the structural interactions in these protein complexes.  Arrestins and another class of specialized signaling proteins called G proteins take turns docking with GPCRs. Both play critical roles in the body s communications  switchboard,  sending signals that the receptors translate into cell instructions. These instructions are responsible for a range of physiological functions. Until now, only a G protein had been seen joined to a receptor at this scale, one of the discoveries recognized with the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Before the study at SLAC, little was known about how arrestins   which serve a critical role as the  off  switch in cell signaling, opposite the  on  switch of G proteins   dock with GPCRs, and how this differs from G protein docking. The latest research helps scientists understand how a docked arrestin can block a G protein from docking at the same time, and vice versa. Many of the available drugs that activate or deactivate GPCRs block both G proteins and arrestins from docking.  The new paradigm in drug discovery is that you want to find this selective pathway   how to activate either the arrestin pathway or the G-protein pathway but not both -- for a better effect,  said Eric Xu, a scientist at the Van Andel Research Institute in Michigan who led the experiment. The study notes that a wide range of drugs would likely be more effective and have fewer side effects with this selective activation. Xu said he first learned about the benefits of using SLAC s X-ray laser for protein studies in 2012. The microscopic arrestin-GPCR crystals, which his team had painstakingly produced over years, proved too difficult to study at even the most advanced type of synchrotron, a more conventional X-ray source. In the LCLS experiments, Xu s team used samples of a form of human rhodopsin   a GPCR found in the retina whose dysfunction can cause night blindness   fused to a type of mouse arrestin that is nearly identical to human arrestin. Measuring just thousandths of a millimeter, the crystals   which had been formed in a toothpaste-like solution   were oozed into the X-ray pulses at LCLS, producing patterns that when combined and analyzed allowed researchers to reconstruct a complete 3-D map of the protein complex  While this particular sample serves a specific function in the body, people may start to use this research as a model for how GPCRs, in general, can interact with signaling proteins,  Xu said. His team had been working toward this result since 2005. SLAC Director Chi-Chang Kao said of the research milestone,  This important work is a prime example of how SLAC s unique combination of cutting-edge scientific capabilities, including its expertise in X-ray science and structural biology, are playing key roles in high-impact scientific discoveries.  Qingping Xu, a scientist in the Joint Center for Structural Genomics at SLAC s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource who helped to solve the 3-D structure, said it took many hours of computer modeling and data analysis to help understand and refine its details.  This structure is especially important because it fills in a missing piece about protein-binding pathways for GPCRs,  he said. Even so, he noted that much work remains in determining the unique structures and docking mechanisms across the whole spectrum of GPCRs and associated signaling proteins. Eric Xu said his group hopes to conduct follow-up studies at LCLS with samples of GPCRs bound to different types of signaling proteins.","Published: July 27, 2015"

Unfortunately, obtaining sufficient amounts of lunasin has been a costly, time-consuming and laborious affair. This, in turn, has impeded lunasin s investigation in large-scale animal and human clinical trials, according to Hari Krishnan, a molecular biologist with USDA s Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Plant Genetics Research Unit in Columbia, Missouri. Now, however, Krishnan and ARS colleague Thomas Wang report their development of a fast new procedure for extracting lunasin in amounts suitable to conduct these trials. Using the new procedure, they produced 3.2 grams of a concentrated form of lunasin, along with two protease inhibitors, from 100 grams of soybean flour. The actual extraction is done with a 30 percent solution of ethanol, followed by centrifuging steps and the addition of calcium chloride to further purify the concentrate, explains Krishnan. Wang leads the agency s Diet, Genomics, and Immunology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. The entire process takes less than 2 hours and yields far more lunasin and protease inhibitor concentrate than other methods that have been tried, including sophisticated chromatography procedures and live cultures of genetically modified yeast or bacteria. Besides being faster, the new method can also be easily scaled up to yield much larger amounts. Test-tube experiments conducted by Wang demonstrated the extract s biological activity, inhibiting the production of inflammation-causing cytokines by human leukemia cells derived from a line called THP-1, which is commonly used in biomedical research. Their investigations coincide with increased scientific attention on the preventive role that consuming soy or soy products can play in reducing breast, colon and other cancers.","Published: July 27, 2015"

Search ""vaping"" in YouTube and the result is nearly 400,000 videos offering everything from tips for building your own e-cigarettes and hookahs, to reviews of popular nicotine liquid flavors, to posturing puffers showing off the thickest clouds their lungs can muster. But look for scientific information about the devices   which are not subject to the same federal oversight as traditional tobacco products   and the sources become scant. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is now seeking to extend its authority to regulate tobacco to include e-cigarettes and the nicotine-containing ""e-liquid"" they vaporize, the potential risks and benefits of these devices have not been fully studied. Nor has the amount of nicotine or other potentially harmful chemicals inhaled during their use. People are studying these things rapidly, but the technology is evolving just as rapidly, and there are big gaps in our knowledge about them,"" said Bucknell Professor Jim Baish '79, biomedical engineering. ""The FDA's questions are still very much open questions."" Since last year, Baish and a small team of Bucknell student and faculty researchers have been working to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of e-cigarettes. Doing so has required leveraging a diverse set of University resources. Baish, along with chemical engineering professors Tim Raymond '97 and Dabrina Dutcher and students Mark Daley '17 and Jordan Berger '17, have measured particles with the engine exhaust particle sizer from Bucknell's powertrain lab. They've done metallurgical analysis of heating coil wire used in vaporizers with the geology department's environmental scanning electron microscope, and used a variety of equipment from Raymond and Dutcher's aerosol lab and the College of Engineering's environmental lab to study concentrations of nicotine and other molecules expelled by e-cigarettes in particle and vapor form. The project has even required building new equipment that mimics the way e-cigarette users puff on vaporizers. ""People who smoke cigarettes will take puffs of a certain duration with a certain repetition rate, and there are standards for how to study these things, because cigarettes have been studied for a long time,"" Baish said. ""But people use e-cigarette devices differently, so they puff with a different pattern. People often puff on them for longer. It's not necessarily stronger; it's just different."" Daley's first task as a research intern this summer was to design and build a computer-controlled e-cigarette puffer. The device, a small plastic box connected to rubber tubes and a 3-D printed mouthpiece that holds a vaporizer, uses an Arduino programmable microprocessor to automatically regulate puff duration, puff spacing, voltage given to the e-cigarette and flow rate. Turn it on and it takes uniform puffs at regular intervals, expelling vapor that can be collected and analyzed. ""Through this project I've done design work,"" said Daley. ""I've learned how to use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and how to do chemical analysis. I've done some basic coding for data analysis. It's been a very self-driven, multi-dimensional project on something that millions of people are using."" Armed with a uniform method for gathering data, Baish and Daley have begun examining the availability of nicotine in the particles and vapor expelled by e-cigarettes. ""In the particle phase nicotine is probably going to absorb more slowly, through membranes, versus the vapor, which is going to get deeper into the lungs and will be absorbed much faster,"" Baish said. Dutcher and Raymond are meanwhile studying other molecules produced by heating e-liquid, which in addition to nicotine usually contains the relatively innocuous chemicals propylene glycol and glycerol. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated e-cigarettes might produce formaldehyde, a carcinogen, but Dutcher is skeptical of those findings and wants to repeat the experiment herself. ""They were running the device very, very hot, and in fact they never measured formaldehyde; they measured something they said would probably be in equilibrium with formaldehyde,"" she said. ""I want to redo the work and either verify it or say, 'No, that's sensational. No one actually runs them this hot.'"" Dutcher plans to present some of her findings at the American Association for Aerosol Research Annual Conference in October, and Berger will present a paper based on his research at the American Society of Chemical Engineers Annual Meeting in November. The researchers are quick to point out that they don't have an agenda against e-cigarettes   Baish concedes the devices show promise to be much less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes   they've simply been attracted by the explosion in popularity and rapidly developing sophistication of the devices. ""Everything is evolving,"" Raymond said. ""You have single-coil and now dual-coil vaporizers, they all go to different wattages, and then you have different liquids, all with different additives and nicotine levels. There are a lot of unknowns in a lot of different areas. You could publish hundreds of papers on this if you spent forever looking at it."" Dutcher's interest even goes beyond nicotine to other, potentially beneficial uses for the devices. ""I have an interest in drug delivery in the aerosol phase,"" Dutcher said. ""That has huge implications for treatment of diseases like tuberculosis, something we're still really bad at. I'm really interested in how these work, not because I care about nicotine, but because I'm interested in seeing if they could ever be used in a different, more helpful way. You have to completely understand the device before you can do any of that.""","Published: July 27, 2015"

Her findings, presented at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Conference show that glyphosate, the most used weed-killing chemical in the world, does not accumulate over time in human milk. She conducted the study with Kimberly Lackey, Ph.D. candidate in zoology, laboratory technician Janae Carrothers and colleagues at the nearby University of Idaho. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is using the study as part of an ongoing review of glyphosate regulations prompted by public concern over a controversial report on the chemical released by the advocacy group, Moms Across America, last year.  The Moms Across America study flat out got it wrong,  said McGuire, who is an executive committee member for the International Society for Research in Human Milk and Lactation and a national spokesperson for the American Society for Nutrition.  Our study provides strong evidence that glyphosate is not in human milk. The MAA findings are unverified, not consistent with published safety data and are based off an assay designed to test for glyphosate in water, not breast milk.  A large body of scientific evidence shows breast feeding offers unparalleled nutritional and immunological benefits for both mothers and children. Taking this into consideration, you can imagine the consternation McGuire, a lactation physiologist with more than 25 years of research experience, felt when a study by activists publicly called into question the safety and healthfulness of breast milk. The Moms Across America and Sustainable Pulse study claimed that traces of glyphosate were found in three out of 10 breast milk samples submitted for analysis. The findings, which were published on the Moms Across America website, garnered national media attention and quickly led to a good deal of public concern about the safety of glyphosate, a product widely used for weed control for over 30 years. Independent regulatory and safety assessments of glyphosate conducted by scientists at organizations like the National Institutes of Health, the German Agency for Risk) and the Georgetown University School of Medicine have found no consistent effects of glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or developing offspring. In McGuire s research, she and her colleagues collected milk and urine samples from 41 lactating women living in or near the cities of Moscow, Idaho, and Pullman, Wash. The area is a highly productive agricultural region where glyphosate is routinely used in farming practices. Ten of the women reported living on or directly adjacent to a farm or ranch, 23 of the women described their personal diet as conventional and 5 had personally mixed or applied glyphosate sometime in the past. Milk and urine samples were analyzed for glyphosate and glyphosate metabolites using high sensitivity liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods specifically optimized for the task. The study detected neither glyphosate nor any glyphosate metabolites in any milk sample, even when the mother had detectable amounts of glyphosate in her urine. Urinary glyphosate levels were either non-existent or extremely low and not of concern, McGuire said. Additionally, no relationship was found between subjects who self-identified as consumers of conventionally grown foods instead of organics and urinary glyphosate levels. Nor was there a difference between women who lived on or near a farm and those who lived in an urban or suburban non-farming area. Analyses of the milk samples were conducted in Monsanto laboratories in St. Louis and independently verified at Wisconsin-based Covance Laboratories, which is not affiliated with the WSU/UI research team or Monsanto.  In conclusion, our data   obtained using sophisticated and validated methods of analyses   strongly suggest that glyphosate does not bioaccumulate and is not present in human milk even when the mother has detectable glyphosate in her urine,  McGuire said.

The mechanism, involving the NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase (NOX) proteins, NOX1 and NOX4, is now the subject of a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease.  Our study further illuminates the role of NOX proteins, in particular NOX4, in mediating diabetes-associated kidney dysfunction and identifies fumarate, a product of the TCA (tricarboxylic acid cycle) and urea cycles, as a key link in the metabolic pathways underlying diabetic kidney disease,  said senior author Kumar Sharma, MD, a professor of medicine and director of the Center for Renal Translational Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. By pinpointing fumarate, Sharma added, the research team has also discovered a new, and potentially better, biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring chronic diabetic kidney disease. Young-Hyun You, PhD, a project scientist in the Center for Renal Translational Medicine, was first author on the study. Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. An estimated 26 million American adults have chronic kidney disease, often requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant. Previous studies by UC San Diego researchers, including Sharma and David Brenner, MD, vice chancellor for Health Sciences and dean of the School of Medicine, and other research groups around the world, have shown that NOX 4 plays an important role in several progressive fibrotic and inflammatory diseases, including liver fibrosis and kidney disease. Sharma said their new study sought to delve deeper into how the NOX proteins cause problems in the kidneys and used the analysis of urine metabolites to better understand the process. Measuring numerous metabolites to detect and assess diabetic kidney disease is a recent diagnostic advance, said Sharma. Metabolites are the small molecules involved in or produced through metabolic processes in cells. As the by-products of metabolic processes, metabolites serve as lingering chemical fingerprints that researchers can analyze to learn more about how the body functions in health and disease. More than 10,000 distinct metabolites are estimated to reside in the human body and encompass a vast spectrum of chemical types. In the study, the researchers tested mice engineered to overproduce NOX4.  We identified that overproduction of NOX4 in kidney cells, called podocytes, produced many of the features of diabetic kidney disease,  said Sharma. The diabetic mice were then given a compound known as GKT137831, a NOX 1/4 inhibitor developed by Swiss pharmaceutical Genkyotex SA, and presently in phase II clinical trials for diabetic kidney disease, also known as diabetic nephropathy. The results of that trial are expected to be announced this year. The researchers analyzed urine metabolites in the mice and found interesting activity surrounding one particular metabolite.  Many of the TCA metabolites were elevated in the urine of untreated diabetic mice, but only fumarate showed a dose-dependent reduction with the administration of the NOX1/4 inhibitor,  Sharma said. Exploring further, the group found that a key enzyme called fumarate hydratase was reduced in both the human and mouse diabetic kidney, an action they believe may contribute to the elevation of fumarate. High levels of fumarate were found to be  a very powerful regulator of two important pathways that have been linked to diabetic kidney disease, hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1a) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b),  said Sharma. Fumarate also stimulated endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis of cells and matrix gene expression   all cellular processes previously shown to contribute to fibrosis, the scarring activity underlying diabetic kidney disease.  We found that administration of the NOX1/4 inhibitor GKT137831 had the downstream effect of reducing fumarate accumulation and fibrotic activity in the kidney,  said Sharma. As a measurable urine metabolite, Sharma said fumarate could serve as a new biomarker for diabetic kidney disease and could prove more effective than the urine albumin protein, which currently serves as a major indicator of kidney disease.  Using fumarate as a biomarker could not only indicate the presence of kidney disease, but also indicate the activity of a NOX4-inhibitor drug, since fumarate levels are tied to NOX4 inhibition,  he said.  You could gain the ability to decide how much of the drug to give by measuring its effectiveness (through fumarate levels) in individual patients,  he said. Sharma said next steps will be to further explore urine fumarate levels in human diabetic kidney disease.","Published: July 25, 2015"

The joint lab builds on Leti and Diabeloop s earlier three-year research project that included clinical trials in hospitals and demonstrated the promise of a closed-loop system for treating diabetes. The artificial pancreas envisioned in the joint lab will automatically deliver the appropriate dose of insulin to patients. It includes a sensor that measures patients  glucose levels, a pump that delivers insulin, and a smartphone with an embedded algorithm and patient interface that links the sensor and the pump. It also includes telemedicine capabilities for monitoring patients and linking them with health-care providers and dedicated nurses.  The Diabeloop system can fundamentally improve everyday life of diabetes patients,  said Diabeloop CEO Erik Huneker.  It will allow better control of their blood sugar and result in a strong reduction in hypoglycemic events and associated comas, as well as a decrease in diabetes-related complications, such as ocular and renal complications and amputations.  In the joint lab, Leti will further develop the system s regulation algorithm that takes into account the patients  carbohydrate intake, glycemia, physical-activity and emotional-state history. The system predicts at any time how a change of insulin dosage will impact patient glycaemia levels in the next few hours and computes the optimal dose, especially at mealtime.  This joint lab with Diabeloop will build on the success we had in the earlier research project, and bring the world s first artificial pancreas closer to reality,  said Pierre Jallon, Leti R&D manager for digital health-and-wellness systems.  Designed for maximum user convenience and optimal integration with health-care providers, Diabeloop is a smart system that will provide a very precise dosage for diabetics.  The three-year joint lab also will exploit both real and simulated data to improve insulin physiology numerical models with a focus on how physical activity and emotional states affect glycemia levels. Clinical trials involving patients living at home are expected in 2015.","Published: July 25, 2015"

This finding is the first strong indication that this population at substantial HIV risk could accept and reliably adhere to daily PrEP dosing. Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in New York and Thailand also successfully adhered to daily dosing. PrEP - which consists of a daily dose of two antiretrovirals, tenofovir and emtricitabine, in a single pill marketed as Truvada - prevents HIV infection when taken consistently. Although some previous placebo-controlled PrEP clinical trials in women in sub-Saharan Africa had found challenges with adherence, 76 percent of women assigned to take PrEP on a daily basis in the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 067 study adhered to the prescribed regimen. MSM and TGW from Harlem and Bangkok who participated in the study adhered to the daily regimen 65 percent and 85 percent of the time, respectively. Several investigators involved presented the key findings from the HPTN 067 trial, also known as the Alternative Dosing to Augment Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Pill Taking (ADAPT) study, at the 8th International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention in Vancouver, Canada.  These are encouraging findings, demonstrating that if given access to Truvada, women and men will take it daily to prevent HIV infection,  Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, said.  This study takes a solid step toward connecting people at particularly high-risk for HIV with a proven prevention strategy that can protect them from infection.  HPTN 067, a Phase II clinical study that began in 2013, was designed to identify the PrEP pill-taking schedules that people are most likely to follow. The study involved 179 women with a median age of 26 in Cape Town, South Africa; 179 black MSM and TGW in Harlem, New York; and 178 Thai MSM and TGW in Bangkok. Median ages of the Harlem and Bangkok participants was 30 and 31, respectively. HIV incidence in all of these populations is high. Study participants at the three sites were randomly assigned into three groups, each prescribed Truvada, with instructions and counseling to take the pill on either a daily schedule or one of two non-daily schedules for 24 weeks. The two non-daily schedules involved taking one pill either twice per week and another after sex, or one pill before and another after sex. Adherence was measured by techniques that included self-reporting, blood and hair analyses, and data from Wisepill devices, which record opening of pill cases. At all three study sites, adherence to the daily regimen was higher than adherence to the two non-daily regimens. Those enrolled in this open-label study were educated about the efficacy of daily PrEP and knew they were taking active drugs rather than placebo. Because daily use of PrEP is the only regimen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all participants were provided with HIV risk reduction counseling and offered condoms. Study participants who became infected during the course of the study were referred to local medical care for treatment.  This is an important step forward for optimizing HIV prevention strategies for people who would otherwise be at high risk for acquiring HIV infection,  said Robert M. Grant, M.D., M.P.H., of the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California, San Francisco and study chair.  The findings will inform the next generation of PrEP research and the development of best practices regarding PrEP adherence and counseling.  During in-depth interviews at the Cape Town study site, the women reported that daily dosing was the easiest regimen to follow, as taking a pill each day established a simple-to-follow habit at a convenient time. Focus groups of enrolled participants also indicated that community support and reminders delivered via cell phones aided adherence. Similar to the finding in South African women, MSM and TGW participants in New York and Thailand were most likely to take PrEP as directed when prescribed a daily dose. Participants at the Harlem site were predominantly black MSM, and average adherence was 65 percent when daily PrEP was prescribed. Adherence was significantly lower among those taking the non-daily PrEP regimens, with fewer than half of the participants sticking to the dosing schedule. MSM and TGW in Bangkok had the highest success with daily dosing with 85 percent taking the pills as instructed, while 79 percent took the twice-weekly pills combined with one pill after sex, and 65 percent took the schedule that involved one pill before and after sex. However, there were challenges in adhering to non-daily dosing, and it is unknown if these regimens work to prevent HIV infection. Daily oral PrEP dosing has proven effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection in multiple clinical trials. Both FDA approval and CDC guidelines are based on multiple large international clinical trials examining daily PrEP among different populations, including MSM, high-risk heterosexual women and men, and people who inject drugs.  HPTN 067 showed that daily dosing was the easiest PrEP regimen to follow. This is important and encouraging news, since we know that PrEP offers high levels of protection against HIV when taken daily,  said Jonathan Mermin, M.D., director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention at CDC. HPTN 067 was conducted by investigators from the NIH-funded HPTN at the Emavundleni Center in Cape Town and the Harlem Prevention Center in New York. CDC conducted the Bangkok arm of the study in collaboration with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and the Thailand Ministry of Public Health. In addition to NIAID support, funding for HPTN 067 came from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Office of AIDS Research at NIH. The Truvada used in the study was donated by Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Published: July 25, 2015"

A new approach to treat asthma: Silencing nociceptor neurons in the lungs Asthma sufferers regularly experience coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The lung contains sensory neurons called nociceptors that respond to chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli, and activate coughing reflexes to protect our airways. Asthma sufferers tend to have denser nociceptor fibers which respond more quickly to irritants, suggesting that these cells would be useful targets for therapy.   Specific protein as missing link for earliest known change in Alzheimer's pathologyA recent study conducted at Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research and NYU Langone Medical Center implicates a new culprit in Alzheimer's disease development. The research reveals that  CTF -- the precursor of the amyloid beta peptide -- acts at the earliest stage of Alzheimer's to initiate a range of abnormalities leading to the loss of groups of neurons critical for memory formation. Results from the study are published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.   Low levels of hormone linked to social deficit in autism A brain-chemistry deficit in children with autism may help to explain their social difficulties, according to new findings from the Stanford University School of Medicine. The research team found a correlation between low levels of vasopressin, a hormone involved in social behavior, and the inability of autistic children to understand that other people's thoughts and motivations can differ from their own.   Study uncovers key differences among ALS patients Researchers on Mayo Clinic's Florida campus have identified key differences between patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and those with the most common genetic form of ALS, a mutation in the C9orf72 gene. Their findings, reported in Nature Neuroscience, demonstrate that ALS patients show abnormalities in levels and processing of RNA.

Now, a group that includes two University of Florida Health researchers has found that it s a two-way street: Body fat can send a signal that affects the way the brain deals with stress and metabolism. While the exact nature of those signals remains a mystery, researchers say simply knowing such a pathway exists and learning more about it could help break a vicious cycle: Stress causes a desire to eat more, which can lead to obesity. And too much extra fat can impair the body s ability to send a signal to the brain to shut off the stress response. The findings are important and unique because they show that it s not simply the brain that drives the way the body responds to stress, said James Herman, Ph.D., a co-author of the paper and a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati.  It moved our understanding of stress control to include other parts of the body. Before this, everyone thought that the regulation of stress was mainly due to the brain. It s not just in the brain. This study suggests that stress regulation occurs on a much larger scale, including body systems controlling metabolism, such as fat,  Herman said. The findings, which reveal a novel fat-to-brain feedback network, were published in the June edition of the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology by a group that included Annette D. de Kloet, Ph.D., a research assistant professor in the UF College of Medicine s department of physiology and functional genomics, and Eric Krause, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the UF College of Pharmacy s department of pharmacodynamics. Researchers found that a glucocorticoid receptor in fat tissue can affect the way the brain controls stress and metabolism. Initially, such signals from the receptor can be lifesavers, directing the brain to regulate its energy balance and influencing stress responses in a beneficial way.  The stress response in the short term is adaptive. It s going to help you cope with stress,  Krause said.  The idea that fat is actually talking to the brain to dampen stress is new.  The researchers found that steroid hormones known as glucocorticoids activate their receptors within fat tissue in a way that affects a main component of the metabolic stress response. Using mouse models, they found a unique connection between glucocorticoid signaling in fat tissue and the brain s regulation of energy balance and stress response. Because glucocorticoid signaling is crucial to regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, fat tissue can directly affect central nervous system functions that link obesity, metabolic disease and stress-related problems, researchers concluded. Understanding fat-to-brain signaling is a first step toward someday being able to influence the broad, complex relationship between stress, obesity and metabolism. Herman credited de Kloet for pressing the search for a fat-to-brain signaling network. Now that researchers have established that a fat-to-brain signaling pathway exists, a fuller understanding of how it functions could someday lead to drugs or other therapies that ward off the negative effects of long-term stress.  The big question is the nature of that signal to the brain. We need to learn how to go in and break that cycle of stress, eating and weight gain,  Herman said.

The breakthrough has revealed a vulnerable period in the early stages of the brain's development that researchers hope can be targeted for future efforts in reversing schizophrenia. In a paper published in the journal Science, neuroscientists from Cardiff University describe having uncovered the previously unknown influence of a gene in ensuring healthy brain development. The gene is known as 'disrupted in schizophrenia-1' (DISC-1). Past studies have shown that when mutated, the gene is a high risk factor for mental illness including schizophrenia, major clinical depression and bipolar disorder. The aim of this latest study was to determine whether DISC-1's interactions with other proteins, early on in the brain's development, had a bearing on the brain's ability to adapt its structure and function (also known as 'plasticity') later on in adulthood. Many genes responsible for the creation of synaptic proteins have previously shown to be strongly linked to schizophrenia and other brain disorders, but until now the reasons have not been understood. The team, led by Professor Kevin Fox from Cardiff University's School of Biosciences, found that in order for healthy development of the brain's synapses to take place, the DISC-1 gene first needs to bind with two other molecules known as 'Lis' and 'Nudel'. Their experiments in mice revealed that by preventing DISC-1 from binding with these molecules - using a protein-releasing drug called Tamoxifen at an early stage of the brain's development - it would lack plasticity once it grows to its adult state, preventing cells (cortical neurons) in the brain's largest region from being able to form synapses. The ability to form coherent thoughts and to properly perceive the world is damaged as a consequence of this. Preventing DISC-1 from binding with 'Lis' and 'Nudel' molecules, when the brain was fully formed, showed no effect on its plasticity. However, the researchers were able to pinpoint a seven-day window early on in the brain's development - one week after birth - where failure to bind had an irreversible effect on the brain's plasticity later on in life. ""We believe that DISC-1 is schizophrenia's Rosetta Stone gene and could hold the master key to help us unlock our understanding of the role played by all risk genes involved in the disease,"" said Professor Fox. ""The potential of what we now know about this gene is immense. We have identified a critical period during brain development that directs us to test whether other schizophrenia risk genes affecting different regions of the brain create their malfunction during their own critical period. ""The challenge ahead lies in finding a way of treating people during this critical period or in finding ways of reversing the problem during adulthood by returning plasticity to the brain. This, we hope, could one day help to prevent the manifestation or recurrence of schizophrenia symptoms altogether."" Professor Jeremy Hall, an academic mental health clinician and director of Cardiff University's Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, said: ""This paper provides strong experimental evidence that subtle changes early on in life can lead to much bigger effects in adulthood. This helps explain how early life events can increase the risk of adult mental health disorders like schizophrenia."" Schizophrenia affects around 1% of the global population and an estimated 635,000 people in the UK will at some stage in their lives be affected by the condition. The projected cost of schizophrenia to society is around  11.8 billion ($18.3 billion US) a year.

For the first time we can perform a genome-wide search to identify the entire set of proteins that play a role in a drug s activity,  says study co-author Dr. Andrea Califano, the Clyde and Helen Wu Professor of Chemical Systems Biology and chair of the Department of Systems Biology at CUMC. Scientists design drugs to pinpoint molecular targets in the cell. However, when a drug enters the human body, it becomes part of an incredibly complex system, and can interact with other molecules in ways that are hard to predict. This unanticipated cross-talk causes side effects and stops many promising drug candidates from being used in clinical care. Unfortunately, current experimental methods don t allow scientists to identify the full repertoire of proteins that are affected by a drug. By analyzing drug-induced changes in disease-specific patterns of gene expression, a new algorithm called DeMAND identifies the genes involved in implementing a drug s effects. The method could help predict undesirable off-target interactions, suggest ways of regulating a drug s activity, and identify novel therapeutic uses for FDA-approved drugs, three critical challenges in drug development.  Members of Dr. Califano s lab have devised a new approach called DeMAND (Detecting Mechanism of Action by Network Dysregulation) to characterize a drug s effects more precisely. The method involves creating a computational model of the network of protein interactions that occur in a diseased cell. Experiments are then performed to track gene expression changes in diseased cells as they are exposed to a drug of interest. The DeMAND algorithm combines data from the model with data from the experiments to identify the complement of proteins most affected by the drug. DeMAND improves on more labor intensive and less efficient methods, which are only capable of identifying targets to which a compound binds most strongly. This provides a more comprehensive picture, because DeMAND identifies many molecules that are affected in addition to the drug s direct target. So far, DeMAND s predictions are proving to be accurate when tested with follow-up experiments. The researchers report that when they exposed human diffuse B-cell lymphoma cells to a panel of drugs, the algorithm identified 70% of previously documented targets.  The accuracy of the method has been the most surprising result,  says Dr. Califano. The algorithm makes it possible to identify a variety of compounds that cause similar pharmacological outcomes. Using DeMAND, the researchers showed that a similar subset of proteins is affected by the unrelated drugs sulfasalazine and altretamine. Altretamine is currently used to treat ovarian cancer, but these results suggest that, like sulfasalazine, it could be used for bowel inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis too. Co-senior author Mukesh Bansal sees great potential in this approach, saying,  DeMAND could accelerate the drug discovery process and reduce the cost of drug development by unraveling how new compounds work in the body. Our findings on altretamine also show that it can determine novel therapeutic applications for existing FDA-approved drugs. ","Published: July 24, 2015"

Mark Cohen, the current Chairman of Celsus, said,  We are very excited about the combination of Celsus and Volution, and believe the combined management team of the newly merged company will have the expertise necessary to successfully develop its lead anti-complement small protein, Coversin, to treat a range of rare and orphan diseases and deliver enhanced value to our investors.  Mark Cohen will continue as Vice Chairman of Akari. Coversin is a second-generation complement inhibitor that acts on complement component-C5, preventing release of C5a and formation of C5b-9 (also known as the membrane attack complex or MAC). C5 inhibition is growing in importance in a range of rare autoimmune diseases related to dysregulation of the complement component of the immune system, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), and Guillain Barr  syndrome (GBS). Coversin successfully completed a Phase Ia fixed dose clinical trial in healthy subjects in 2014, and will be used in a follow-up chronic dosing Phase Ib clinical trial in healthy subjects in the second half of 2015. The combined company plans to initiate a compassionate use program in late 2015 to treat patients resistant to Soliris  (eculizumab), the only currently approved treatment for PNH and aHUS. The combined company will then initiate Phase II clinical trials in several indications during 2016, including PNH, aHUS, and GBS. Details of the Proposed TransactionOn a pro forma basis and based upon the number of shares of Celsus common stock to be issued in the transaction, current Celsus securityholders will own approximately 8.32% of the combined company and current Volution Immuno Pharmaceutical SA securityholders will own approximately 91.68% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of both companies and by RPC Pharma, the sole shareholder of Volution Immuno Pharmaceutical SA. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015, subject to the approval of the shareholders of Celsus as well as other customary conditions. MTS Health Partners, L.P. served as financial advisors, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. served as legal counsel on US legal matters, and DLA Piper UK LLP on UK legal matters to Celsus. McDermott Will & Emery UK LLP served as legal counsel to Volution Immuno Pharmaceuticals SA with respect to the transaction. Management and OrganizationFollowing the closing of the transaction, the Akari Therapeutics board of directors will be led by Raymond Prudo, M.D. as Executive Chairman, and Mark Cohen as Vice Chairman. Akari management will be led by Dr. Gur Roshwalb as Chief Executive Officer.","Published: July 24, 2015"
4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/view-of-bacterial-pump-at-the-atomic-level-213654,View of Bacterial Pump at the Atomic Level Researchers have determined the structure of a simple but previously unexamined pump that controls the passage of proteins through a bacterial cell membrane  an achievement that offers new insight into the mechanics that allow bacteria to manipulate their environments   ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Bacteria have plenty of things to send out into world beyond their own boundaries: coordinating signals to other members of their species, poisons for their enemies, and devious instructions to manipulate host cells they have infected. Before any of this can occur, however, they must first get the shipments past their own cell membranes, and many bacteria have evolved specialized structures and systems for launching the proteins that do these jobs. This pump, called PCAT for peptidase-containing ATP-binding cassette transporter, is composed of a single protein, a sort of all-in-one machine capable of recognizing its cargo, processing it, then burning chemical fuel to pump that cargo out of the cell,  says study author Jue Chen, William E. Ford Professor and head of theLaboratory of Membrane Biology and Biophysics.  This new atomic-level structure explains for the first time the links between these three functions.  Of the many types of molecules cells need to move into and out of their membranes, proteins are the largest. PCATs specialize in pumping proteins out of the cell, and, because they are single-molecule machines that work alone, or with two partner proteins in some bacteria, they are the simplest such systems. Each PCAT molecule has three domains, each in duplicate: one recognizes the cargo by a tag it carries, and cuts off that tag; another binds to and burns ATP, a molecule that contains energy stored within its atomic bonds; and the third forms a channel that spans the cells membrane. Previous work had examined the structure of the first two domains, but the structure of the third, had remained a mystery, along with the details of how the components function together.  At this point, we have no idea how many PCATs exist, although we expect they are numerous, because each specializes in a specific type of cargo. For this study, we focused on one we called PCAT1, which transports a small protein of unknown function,  says first author David Yin-wei Lin, a postdoc in the lab.  To get a sense of how PCAT1 changes shape when powered by energy from ATP, we examined the structure in two states, both with and without ATP.  The team, which also included Shuo Huang, a research technician who is now a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology, purified and crystalized the PCAT1 protein from the heat-loving bacterium Clostridium thermocellum. To determine the structure of the crystals, they used a technique called X-ray diffraction analysis, in which a pattern produced by X-rays bounced off the crystallized protein can be used to infer the structure of the molecule. The first structure, determined without ATP, revealed a striking feature: a large, water-filled central channel, a natural environment for a water-loving, or hydrophilic, protein. Two side openings into this channel were guarded by the cargo-recognizing domain, acting as a sort of ticket taker. Sites on this domain would recognize and clip off the cargo s tag, before ushering the protein into the channel. When ATP is present, they found that the side entrances close, freeing the cargo-recognizing domain to move from its station outside of them. In addition, the ATP-binding domains at the bottom of the channel inside the cell come together. The researchers also saw the water channel shrink, leading them to hypothesize that energy from ATP allows PCAT1 to change conformation in such a way that it pushes its cargo out. This suggests that PCAT1 uses a strategy commonly seen in transport proteins known as alternate access, in which one end of the channel is open while the other closes. However, they qualify that PCATs that transport much larger proteins may function differently.  By visualizing the structure of this pump, we have been able to determine the details of a transport pathway that, in its simplicity, is fundamentally different from the more complex systems that have been closely studied before. This new information adds to the understanding of how cells send out proteins in order to interact with their environment,  Chen says.","Published: July 24, 2015"

The largest single human source of methane is rice cultivation. A new rice variety could change all that, although NIOO-microbiologist Paul Bodelier warns in the current issue of Nature that it's too early to get excited. Methane has an even higher capacity to absorb the heat from the earth's surface than CO2. But at least there's less of it in the atmosphere. Although global population growth means there's been a rising demand for the world's main staple food: rice. The dominant form of growing rice worldwide is paddy field farming. The rice plants are flooded, and under these warm and oxygen-less circumstances, microorganisms around the roots of the plants produce large amounts of methane. Research from 2002 suggested a correlation between the amount of greenhouse gas emitted in this way and the amount of grain carried by the plants. The more carbon is fixed in a plant's grains and stems, the less is available through its roots for soil microbes to turn into methane. It's taken until this year for researchers to develop an actual new rice variety based on this insight. The researchers produced their new, transgenic rice by adding a barley gene - SUSIBA2 - that increases the production of starch in stems and grains. Yields are up to 43% higher thanks to the extra starch. It also fixes more carbon, which ultimately means less methane. That's ""the cherry on top"" writes Paul Bodelier in Nature, commenting on the researchers' letter about their results that is published in the same issue. At the same time, Bodelier warns that in addition to the obvious ethical concerns raised by the modification, ""we do not yet have a clear picture of how it affects rice plants  survival and general function."" According to the NIOO-researcher, long-term measurements will be needed to establish this. A complicating factor is that the assembly of microbes around the roots of rice plants does more than just produce methane. Some bacteria benefit the plants by decomposing organic material and delivering essential nutrients. Without those nutrients, ""larger amounts of nitrogen fertilizer would need to be applied"" with deleterious effects for the environment. Ironically, the modification might also affect aerobic bacteria that consume rather than produce methane. The oxygen these bacteria need flows though the rice plant's stems and roots into the soil by the same route taken by the methane.""It is not known how the transport of gases is affected in the transgenic rice."" All the same, comments Bodelier whose own research also focuses on methane and bacteria, it is quite a feat that the researchers have managed to make rice available that is high in starch and low in methane emissions. ""This will spur scientists worldwide to conduct experiments to verify whether this variety will enable more sustainable cultivation of the crop that feeds half the human population.""","Published: July 24, 2015"
7,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/simple-technology-makes-crispr-gene-editing-cheaper-209520,Simple Technology Makes CRISPR Gene Editing Cheaper University of California  Berkeley  researchers have discovered a much cheaper and easier way to target a hot new gene editing tool  CRISPR Cas   to cut or label DNA  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The CRISPR-Cas9 technique, invented three years ago at UC Berkeley, has taken genomics by storm, with its ability to latch on to a very specific sequence of DNA and cut it, inactivating genes with ease. This has great promise for targeted gene therapy to cure genetic diseases, and for discovering the causes of disease. The technology can also be tweaked to latch on without cutting, labeling DNA with a fluorescent probe that allows researchers to locate and track a gene among thousands in the nucleus of a living, dividing cell. The newly developed technique now makes it easier to create the RNA guides that allow CRISPR-Cas9 to target DNA so precisely. In fact, for less than $100 in supplies, anyone can make tens of thousands of such precisely guided probes covering an organism s entire genome. As proof of principle, the researchers turned the entire genome of the common gut bacterium E. coli into a library of 40,000 RNA guides that covered 88 percent of the bacterial genome. Each RNA guide is a segment of 20 RNA base pairs: the template used by CRISPR-Cas9 as it seeks out complementary DNA to bind and cut. These libraries can be employed in traditional CRISPR-Cas9 editing to target any specific DNA sequence in the genome and cut it, which is what researchers do to pin down the function of a gene: knock it out and see what bad things happen in the cell. This can help pinpoint the cause of a disease, for example. The process is called genetic screening and is done in batches: each of the thousands of probes is introduced into a single cell on a plate filled with hundreds of thousands of cells.  We can make these libraries for a lot less money, which makes genetic screening potentially accessible in organisms less well studied,  such as those that have not yet had their genomes sequenced, said first author Andrew Lane, a UC Berkeley post-doctoral fellow. But Lane and colleague Rebecca Heald, UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology, developed the technology in order to track chromosomes in real-time in living cells, in particular during cell division, a process known as mitosis. This is part of a larger project by Heald to find out what regulates the size of the nucleus and other subcellular components as organisms grow from just a few cells to many cells.  This technology will allow us to paint a whole chromosome and look at it live and really follow it in the nucleus during the cell cycle or as it goes through developmental transitions, for example in an embryo, to see how it changes in size and structure,  Heald said. The new technique uses standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to generate many short lengths of DNA from whatever segment of DNA a researcher is interested in, up to and including an entire genome. These fragments are then precisely snipped at a region called a PAM, which is critical to CRISPR binding. Simple restriction enzymes are then used to cut each piece 20 base pairs from the PAM end, generating the exact size of RNA guide that CRISPR uses in searching the genome for complementary sites. These guide RNAs are then easily incorporated into the CRISPR-Cas9 complex, yielding tens of thousands of probes for labeling or cutting DNA.  By using the genome itself as a source for guide RNAs, their approach puts the creation of libraries that target contiguous regions in reach of almost any lab,  said Jacob Corn, managing and scientific director of the Innovative Genomics Initiative at UC Berkeley.  This could be very useful for genome imaging and certain kinds of screens, and I m very interested to see how it enables biological discovery using Cas9 tools. ","Published: July 24, 2015"
8,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/funding-boost-for-diabetes-research-195029,Funding Boost for Diabetes Research  Programme of research could be a game changer for people with Type   diabetes and insulin dependent Type   diabetes  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. University of Oxford research into a new and better treatment for diabetes has been boosted by a major grant. The DRIVE (Diabetes Reversing Implants with enhanced Viability and long-term Efficacy) consortium, which involves fourteen partners from seven European countries, has received  8.9 million ( 6.37 million) funding from the European Union s Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme. The programme will develop natural materials and new surgical devices to enhance the transplant and survival of insulin producing pancreatic islets for the treatment of diabetes.Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterised by high blood sugar (glucose). If not treated carefully, diabetes causes several debilitating side effects including heart disease, damage to the eyes, kidneys and nerve endings (e.g. hands, feet) and can lead to premature death. According to the international diabetes federation (IDF), 382 million people worldwide have diabetes and in 2013 an estimated 5.1 million deaths were attributable to the disease, representing 8.4% of global adult mortality. Blood glucose is high in diabetes because of the inability of the pancreas to produce sufficient insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Currently the main treatment for diabetes is the daily injection of insulin. In patients where control is poor, transplantation of pancreatic cells (which contain insulin-producing  -cells) is possible. However there are challenges with this therapy including the short supply of donor pancreases, the need to use 3-4 pancreases to get enough  -cells for treatment and poor graft survival and retention at the transplant site. The DRIVE consortium will address these challenges by developing a completely new system to deliver pancreatic  -cells effectively in a targeted and protected fashion. This will mean that fewer donor pancreases are needed for cell transplantation allowing more patients to get a more effective longer-lasting treatment with less demand on donor pancreases. Additionally, the consortium will investigate the combination of DRIVE s technology with future stem cell-derived  -cells that will widen the availability of islet transplantation therapy to all insulin-dependent patients. DRIVE s  -System consists of a  -Gel, which contains the pancreatic  -cells within a gel that mimics the pancreas; which itself is protected within a capsule called a  -shell. This is delivered using a specialised injection catheter, called  -cath, which offers a much less invasive surgical procedure than is currently used. The current transplantation technique offers patients natural glucose control for 1-2 years. DRIVE s  -system aims to provide control for up to 5 years by increasing the longevity of the  -cell transplant. The system offers further advantages through the slow release of immunosuppressant drugs by the  -shell, reducing the patient s need for long-term anti-rejection medication, which has harmful side effects. The  -shell will also be retrievable, so it can be removed and replenished after the 5-year period. DRIVE s 5-year work plan will include animal testing, with a view to human testing at the end of the project. Professor Paul Johnson, Director of the Oxford Islet Transplant Programme and Professor of Paediatric Surgery at the University of Oxford, said: 'Over the past 10 years, the transplantation of insulin-producing pancreatic cells known as islet cells (that can sense blood sugar levels and release insulin to maintain normal sugar levels) has achieved very promising results in adults who have developed the severest complications from insulin-dependent diabetes. The challenge is to now make sure that more people can benefit from this minimally-invasive treatment. 'Ultimately we would hope that it can be used to reverse diabetes in children soon after diagnosis. The DRIVE Consortium brings together some of the leading researchers in Europe in the fields of bioengineering, cell biology, and cell transplantation. Regenerative medicine and stem cell therapies have the potential to revolutionise the treatment of patients who have diabetes, and through DRIVE we will develop new technologies to enhance stem cell therapies for these patients by increasing targeting and ease of delivery using advanced biomaterials. 'The overall aim is to develop novel membranes to protect the transplanted islets from rejection ensure that islet transplantation can be undertaken without the need for the patient to take anti-rejection medication, with all the associated complications. This programme of research could be a real game-changer for people with Type 1 diabetes and the team in Oxford are very excited to be part of this state of the art research collaboration.' The DRIVE Consortium represents a major interdisciplinary effort between stem cell biologists, experts in advanced drug delivery, research scientists, clinicians and research-active companies working together to develop novel therapeutics to address the challenges of treating diabetes. The researchers will optimise adult stem cell therapy using smart biomaterials and advanced drug delivery, and couple these therapeutics with minimally-invasive surgical devices.","Published: July 24, 2015"

This and related theories were described in a  Perspectives  article authored by researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the University of Technology Sydney and Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Australia.   Teeth are of particular interest to us for the measurement of chemical exposure in fetal and childhood development: they provide a chronological record of exposure from their microchemical composition in relation to defined growth lines, much like the rings in a tree trunk,  said Manish Arora, BDS, MPH, PhD, Director of Exposure Biology at the Senator Frank Lautenberg Environmental Health Sciences Laboratory at Mount Sinai and Associate Professor in Preventive Medicine and Dentistry at the Icahn School of Medicine.  Our analysis of iron deposits in teeth as a method for retrospective determination of exposure is just one application: we believe teeth have the potential to help track the impact of pollution on health globally.  Dr. Arora, along with Dominic Hare, PhD, used the dental biomarker technology to distinguish breast-fed babies from formula fed babies. Now this technology can be applied to study the link between early iron exposure and late-life brain diseases like Parkinson s and Alzheimer s, which are associated with the abnormal processing of iron. While not all formula fed babies will experience neurodegeneration in adulthood, the combination of increased iron intake during infancy with a predisposition to impaired metal metabolism such as the inability of brain cells to remove excessive metals may damage those cells over time. Dr. Hare, a Chancellor s Research Fellow in the Elemental Bio-imaging Facility at the University of Technology Sydney, says  Only now do we have the technology available to use to look back in time at someone s diet as a child, more than 60 years after they stopped wearing diapers. State-of-the-art imaging technology is a chemical time machine that can tell us about decades-old chemical exposures that are equivalent to a drop of ink in a swimming pool.  In the case of baby formula, the need to better understand human iron metabolism has become more urgent with the global popularity of formula and fortified cereals. Adding iron to formula has been an industry standard for decades, in part because about two billion people worldwide   mostly in developing nations   are thought to have chronic anemia and iron deficiency. Evidence, however, that children in the United States or Europe, for instance, get too little iron is insufficient, according to the authors, and the reported developmental and nutritional benefits of iron are modest. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition have since stated that there s no evidence that babies of normal birthweight need iron supplementation, yet in the U.S. it s still commonplace. Dr. Hare continues:  While it might seem like drawing a long bow linking what happens in childhood to diseases we think of as associated with growing old, the increasing rates of these diseases mean we need to do everything we can to find out what might play a role in how the disease starts. Knowing this gives us something to target when designing new treatments.  Beyond the wide-reaching hypothesis that iron supplementation may increase risk of neurodegeneration, the authors think a priority in pediatric research should be the rigorous determination of iron supplementation needs of infants according to their individual iron status. Formula manufacturers have a responsibility to replicate the chemical composition of breast milk, particularly with regard to iron content. The current  one size fits all  approach to iron supplementation may be both clinically unnecessary and introduce an unacceptable risk later in life. Whether this hypothesis proves to be true or not, it calls into question decades of treatment dogma that deserves to be revisited with the most cutting-edge technology available.","Published: July 24, 2015"

As such, there have been repeated challenges to the admissibility of fingerprint evidence in courts of law.  We wanted to answer the question that has plagued law enforcement and forensic science for decades: Is fingerprint pattern persistent over time?  said Anil Jain, University Distinguished Professor, computer science and engineering, at Michigan State University.  We have now determined, with multilevel statistical modeling, that fingerprint recognition accuracy remains stable over time.""

If forensic investigators cannot find a match for DNA found at a crime scene, the DNA profile can end up sitting in a computer or in a frozen sample. But DNA has almost everything needed to give some clues about physical appearance. Walsh, a graduate of University College Cork, developed the first estimation of eye and hair color from DNA, which is now used by Dutch police in criminal investigations and in Australia for missing persons.

The name change affirms the successful integration of OnCore BioPharma and Tekmira Pharmaceuticals into a combined company with the singular goal of delivering a cure for chronic HBV. The combined entity currently fields the largest portfolio of HBV product candidates in the industry and is led by an experienced and proven leadership team shown below with notable prior experience.   Mark J. Murray, Ph.D., President and CEO; formerly of Protiva, Zymogentics, and Xcyte Therapeutics  Patrick T. Higgins, Chief Business Officer; co-founder of OnCore BioPharma; formerly of Pharmasset and Roche  Bruce Cousins, Chief Financial Officer; formerly of Aspreva and Johnson & Johnson  Michael J. Sofia, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer; co-founder of OnCore BioPharma; formerly of Pharmasset (inventor of sofosbuvir for hepatitis C), Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly  William T. Symonds, Pharm.D., Chief Development Officer; formerly of Gilead Sciences, Pharmasset (clinical development of sofosbuvir for hepatitis C), and GlaxoSmithKline  Mark Kowalski, MD, Chief Medical Officer; formerly of Gilead Sciences, YM BioSciences, and Viventia Biotechnologies  Peter Lutwyche Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer, formerly of Protiva, QLT, and Inex Pharmaceuticals ""We are very excited about the prospects for our integrated new company, which has undergone a transformation to a complete HBV solutions company. The company possesses exceptionally strong and proven clinical development, scientific, and commercial leadership teams and is very well resourced to execute against our goal of delivering a cure for chronic HBV. We believe that the market opportunity for a curative regimen for HBV is very significant, likely eclipsing the HCV market, and presents a meaningful opportunity for shareholders,"" said Dr. Mark J. Murray, President and CEO of Tekmira. ""We remain very confident in our potential to create value from our industry-leading strategy, team, and pipeline dedicated to developing therapeutic solutions to cure HBV."" Strategy for HBV Development We believe the solution to HBV lies in combination therapies. The development strategy of Tekmira is to first establish safety and activity of individual product candidates, followed by rapid progression to small cohort combination studies (with multiple products) to identify the most promising regimens. A key feature of this strategy is the planned speed of evaluation of different combinations, doses, and treatment durations - a strategy previously used by this leadership team at Pharmasset in developing sofosbuvir for HCV. Tekmira's broad pipeline of HBV product candidates, which will be further expanded through business development activity, will enable the company to rapidly advance the best product candidates and combination regimens and discontinue product development investment where it is no longer justified. Unique to our company is a commitment to a broad strategy and not to any individual product candidates. Our HBV pipeline currently consists of the product candidates shown in the chart that can be viewed by clicking the following link: http://media.globenewswire.com/cache/14025/file/35721.pdf Emerging Science and Advancing Pipeline Tekmira maintains a high level of activity in business development to evaluate additional assets that could be added to the Company's pipeline. As the understanding of chronic HBV evolves, new targets and technologies are emerging as potentially promising approaches to treating HBV. One example of this dynamic is a hypothesis that inhibition of PLK1 could have utility in treating HBV. As a result, Tekmira is planning to modify the clinical program for TKM-PLK1 to study the effect of PLK1 on viral parameters in chronic HBV patients enrolled in the HCC trial. Tekmira is committed to having at least four HBV product candidates advancing in clinical development in 1H16. Tekmira expects to file INDs for three additional HBV product candidates in 2016: a cccDNA formation inhibitor, a core protein inhibitor (also known as capsid assembly inhibitor), and a surface antigen secretion inhibitor. New Business Unit for Non-HBV Assets and Technology Tekmira is also announcing the formation of a discrete business unit to manage, develop and maximize the value of Tekmira's non-HBV assets. The division includes preclinical RNAi product candidates, IP and related know how of the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technology platform, and multiple strategic partnerships exploiting the LNP technology. The business unit will be independently financed and has a dedicated management team led by Dr. Michael Abrams, Managing Director, who was formerly CEO of AnorMed. The development activities related to TKM-Ebola will be suspended and a joint re-evaluation of the development contract with the US Department of Defense is underway. The management team of the new business unit will evaluate strategic alternatives for this asset. NASDAQ Bell Ringing and 2Q Financial Results Arbutus management will be ringing the opening bell at the NASDAQ Marketsite on Monday August 3, 2015. Tekmira plans to announce 2Q financial results after the market close on Wednesday August 5, 2015. Tekmira will not be hosting a conference call in conjunction with 2Q financial results.","Published: July 24, 2015"

The answer could give an insight into the way you think, say researchers from the University of Cambridge. In a study published in the journal PLoS ONE, a team of psychologists show that your thinking style -- whether you are an 'empathizer' who likes to focus on and respond to the emotions of others, or a 'systemizer' who likes to analyze rules and patterns in the world--is a predictor of the type of music you like. Music is a prominent feature of everyday life and nearly everywhere we go. It's easy for us to know what types of music we like and don't like. When shuffling songs on an iPod, it takes us only a few seconds to decide whether to listen or skip to the next track. However, little is known about what determines our taste in music. Researchers over the past decade have argued that musical preferences reflect explicit characteristics such as age and personality. For example, people who are open to new experiences tend to prefer music from the blues, jazz, classical, and folk genres, and people who are extroverted and 'agreeable' tend to prefer music from the pop, soundtrack, religious, soul, funk, electronic, and dance genres. Now a team of scientists, led by PhD student David Greenberg, has looked at how our 'cognitive style' influences our musical choices. This is measured by looking at whether an individual scores highly on 'empathy' (our ability to recognize and react to the thoughts and feelings of others) or on 'systemizing' (our interest in understanding the rules underpinning systems such as the weather, music, or car engines) -- or whether we have a balance of both. ""Although people's music choices fluctuates over time, we've discovered a person's empathy levels and thinking style predicts what kind of music they like,"" said David Greenberg from the Department of Psychology. ""In fact, their cognitive style -- whether they're strong on empathy or strong on systems -- can be a better predictor of what music they like than their personality."" The researchers conducted multiple studies with over 4,000 participants, who were recruited mainly through the myPersonality Facebook app. The app asked Facebook users to take a selection of psychology-based questionnaires, the results of which they could place on their profiles for other users to see. At a later date, they were asked to listen to and rate 50 musical pieces. The researchers used library examples of musical stimuli from 26 genres and subgenres, to minimize the chances that participants would have any personal or cultural association with the piece of music. People who scored high on empathy tended to prefer mellow music (from R&B, soft rock, and adult contemporary genres), unpretentious music (from country, folk, and singer/songwriter genres) and contemporary music (from electronica, Latin, acid jazz, and Euro pop). They disliked intense music, such as punk and heavy metal. In contrast, people who scored high on systemizing favored intense music, but disliked mellow and unpretentious musical styles. The results proved consistent even within specified genres: empathizers preferred mellow, unpretentious jazz, while systemizers preferred intense, sophisticated (complex and avant-garde) jazz. The researchers then looked more in-depth and found those who scored high on empathy preferred music that had low energy (gentle, reflective, sensual, and warm elements), or negative emotions (sad and depressing characteristics), or emotional depth (poetic, relaxing, and thoughtful features). Those who scored high on systemizing preferred music that had high energy (strong, tense, and thrilling elements), or positive emotions (animated and fun features), and which also featured a high degree of cerebral depth and complexity. David Greenberg, a trained jazz saxophonist, says the research could have implications for the music industry. ""A lot of money is put into algorithms to choose what music you may want to listen to, for example on Spotify and Apple Music. By knowing an individual's thinking style, such services might in future be able to fine tune their music recommendations to an individual."" Dr Jason Rentfrow, the senior author on the study says: ""This line of research highlights how music is a mirror of the self. Music is an expression of who we are emotionally, socially, and cognitively."" Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, a member of the team, added; ""This new study is a fascinating extension to the 'empathizing-systemizing' theory of psychological individual differences. It took a talented PhD student and musician to even think to pose this question. The research may help us understand those at the extremes, such as people with autism, who are strong systemizers.""

The research team found a correlation between low levels of vasopressin, a hormone involved in social behavior, and the inability of autistic children to understand that other people's thoughts and motivations can differ from their own. The research is published in the journal PLoS ONE. ""Autistic children who had the lowest vasopressin levels in their blood also had the greatest social impairment,"" said the study's senior author, Karen Parker, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. The findings raise the possibility that treatment with vasopressin might reduce social problems for autistic children who have low vasopressin levels, a hypothesis that Parker and her team are now testing in a clinical trial. However, the new research also showed that children without autism can have low vasopressin levels without displaying social impairment, Parker noted; in other words, autism is not explained by a vasopressin deficit alone. Autism is a developmental disorder that affects 1 out of every 68 children in the United States. It is characterized by social and communication deficits and repetitive behaviors. The new study examined a social trait that psychologists call ""theory of mind"": the ability to understand that others have different perspectives. Poor ""theory of mind"" makes it harder for people with autism to empathize and form relationships with others. Vasopressin is a small-protein hormone that is structurally similar to oxytocin. Like oxytocin, it has roles in social behavior. Vasopressin also helps regulate blood pressure. In the new study, the researchers first verified that vasopressin levels in the blood accurately reflected vasopressin levels in the brain by measuring the hormone's levels simultaneously in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of 28 people who were having the fluid collected for medical reasons. They then recruited 159 children ages 3-12 for behavioral testing. Of these children, 57 had autism, 47 did not have autism but had a sibling who did, and 55 were typically developing children with no autistic siblings. All of the children completed standard psychiatric assessments of their neurocognitive abilities, social responsiveness, theory of mind, and ability to recognize others' emotions, which is known as affect recognition. All children gave blood samples that were measured for vasopressin. In all three groups, children had a wide range of vasopressin levels, with some children in each group having low, medium and high levels. Children without autism had similar scores on theory of mind tests regardless of their blood vasopressin level, but in children with autism, low blood vasopressin was a marker of low theory of mind ability. Parker and her collaborator, Antonio Hardan, MD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, are now investigating whether vasopressin treatment improves social ability in children with autism. They are interested in whether the hormone is beneficial only for autistic children who start with low vasopressin levels or whether it might benefit all children with autism.

Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research (NKI) and NYU Langone Medical Center implicates a new culprit in Alzheimer's disease development. The research reveals that  CTF -- the precursor of the amyloid beta (A ) peptide -- acts at the earliest stage of Alzheimer's to initiate a range of abnormalities leading to the loss of groups of neurons critical for memory formation. Results from the study are published online in the journal, Molecular Psychiatry, and the article has been selected for an issue cover. The recent study findings involving  CTF have significant implications for treatment strategies and furthering the course of Alzheimer's drug development. Presently, the most common strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease is targeting the amyloid   peptide, which has had modest success in clinical trials. Findings from this research suggest that drugs that may reduce  CTF levels as well as beta-amyloid, such as the class of BACE1 inhibitors currently under development, may help slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease.  CTF is formed during endocytosis, the process by which cells absorb nutrients and sample various materials from the outside environment. It has been known for some time that abnormalities of endocytosis develop very early in Alzheimer's disease, well before clinical symptoms, and that variant forms of genes controlling endocytosis are frequently implicated as risk factors promoting Alzheimer's. Endosomes -- the membranous vesicles mediating endocytosis -- start to swell abnormally in some neurons beginning even in infancy in Down syndrome - a developmental disability that almost invariably leads to early-onset AD. Research indicates that more than 75 percent of those with Down's, aged 65 and older, have Alzheimer's disease. The NYU Langone - NKI research team led by Ralph Nixon, MD, PhD, professor in the departments of psychiatry and cell biology at NYU Langone School of Medicine and director of the Center for Dementia Research at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research found that, in Alzheimer's and Down Syndrome,  CTF forms more rapidly on endosomes triggering a molecular pathway leading to loss of neurons involved with memory. The researchers discovered APPL1, a protein unrelated to amyloid precursor protein (APP) despite its similar acronym, directly links  CTF to a second protein, rab5, known to activate the molecular chain of events leading to neurodegeneration. Lowering APPL1 levels in cells of individuals with Down syndrome abolished the abnormal endocytosis, indicating the vital role of APPL1 in this molecular cascade. The identification of APPL1 as the missing link in a well-described chain of events associated with very early Alzheimer pathology implies a direct contribution of  CTF to Alzheimer's disease development. Notably, a recently discovered APP mutation that uniquely lowers, rather than raising, risk for Alzheimer's is believed to act by slowing the formation of  CTF. While the current findings do not place any more or less importance to A  as a culprit and a target for Alzheimer's therapy, they now underscore the importance of  CTF as a key contributor to disease development. ""It will be important to consider the role of  CTF in the design of future therapies for Alzheimer's disease and in the interpretation of current clinical trials of BACE1 inhibitors. BACE1 inhibitor trials have been considered a test of the A /amyloid hypothesis but the primary action of these inhibitors is actually to block formation of  CTF, the precursor of A ,"" said Ralph A.

Clinical trials are still in the very early stages. However, with this kind of product, if we can get it commercialised and validated by the regulators it could be helping patients in two to three years.  Conditions of the heart, liver and brain are all under investigation as possible new stem cell treatments. People are already receiving stem cells derived eye cells for eye disorders.

Sequencing genomes requires breaking them into small manageable pieces and then working out how they go back together   similar to a million or billion piece jigsaw puzzle. To do this, a combination of short range (a jigsaw piece) and long range (tells you about the nearby pieces) sequence data is needed. While generating the short range data is relatively straightforward, the long range data is more problematic as quality and quantity of DNA are major factors influencing the outcome. Illumina s Nextera Mate Pair Sample Preparation Kit has helped improve the quality of long range (LMP) data, but they can still be challenging to generate. More complex genomes, typically benefit from accurately size selected LMP data to produce the highest quality genome assemblies. Although producing a single high-quality size selected LMP library can be difficult, several LMP libraries are often used for larger genome sequencing projects. This new approach allows construction of 12 libraries for less than twice the cost of a single library and reduces the time by 3 to 2 days. The TGAC team gained early access to a new piece of technology, the SageELF from Sage Scientific, with the aim to develop a more robust, global approach for accurately sized long-range sequence data. The protocol would be more tolerant to DNA quality and quantity and could ensure that the best possible data was generated for any given sample.  Improving LMP libraries has been a goal of TGAC s for some time, and we have previously published a software tool for processing this data to  clean it up  before using it in genome assemblies,  said Darren Heavens, Lead Author and Team Leader in the Platforms & Pipelines at TGAC.  Previous approaches limited us to targeting a single size range at a time, whereas using this new protocol we can simultaneously target up to 12 different size fractions improving the likelihood of achieving the best long range data from a given DNA source, saving both time and money. While most projects wouldn t require sequencing all 12 fractions we can select the best fractions for sequencing . The scientists hope that this new library construction approach will be widely adopted within the scientific community, having a positive effect in improving genome assemblies. Providing a better understanding of traits of economic interest in crops and animals which are seen as key requirements for breeders such as disease-resistance. Matt Clark, last author, Plant and Microbial Genomics Group Leader at TGAC, added:  Generating high-quality genome assemblies is important as they form the base upon which we build an understanding of an organism s genetics. Since its development, this approach has already been successfully implemented in a number of our high profile sequencing projects such as bread wheat, durum wheat, Aegilops sharonensis and a European Ash Tree more resistant to Ash Dieback Disease, all with very impressive results.  For all projects requiring long-range sequence information we are now promoting this method as our Gold Standard approach. Identifying new technologies and their applications is a key aspect of the work we do and we will continue to monitor opportunities in this area. ","Published: July 23, 2015"

Removing these toxic materials   which include pesticides and endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A (BPA)   with existing methods is often expensive and time-consuming. Researchers from MIT and the Federal University of Goi s in Brazil demonstrate a novel method for using nanoparticles and ultraviolet (UV) light to quickly isolate and extract a variety of contaminants from soil and water.Ferdinand Brandl and Nicolas Bertrand, the two lead authors, are former postdocs in the laboratory of Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. (Eliana Martins Lima, of the Federal University of Goi s, is the other co-author.) Both Brandl and Bertrand are trained as pharmacists, and describe their discovery as a happy accident: They initially sought to develop nanoparticles that could be used to deliver drugs to cancer cells. Brandl had previously synthesized polymers that could be cleaved apart by exposure to UV light. But he and Bertrand came to question their suitability for drug delivery, since UV light can be damaging to tissue and cells, and doesn t penetrate through the skin. When they learned that UV light was used to disinfect water in certain treatment plants, they began to ask a different question.  We thought if they are already using UV light, maybe they could use our particles as well,  Brandl says.  Then we came up with the idea to use our particles to remove toxic chemicals, pollutants, or hormones from water, because we saw that the particles aggregate once you irradiate them with UV light.  The researchers synthesized polymers from polyethylene glycol, a widely used compound found in laxatives, toothpaste, and eye drops and approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a food additive, and polylactic acid, a biodegradable plastic used in compostable cups and glassware. Nanoparticles made from these polymers have a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell. Due to molecular-scale forces, in a solution hydrophobic pollutant molecules move toward the hydrophobic nanoparticles, and adsorb onto their surface, where they effectively become  trapped.  This same phenomenon is at work when spaghetti sauce stains the surface of plastic containers, turning them red: In that case, both the plastic and the oil-based sauce are hydrophobic and interact together. If left alone, these nanomaterials would remain suspended and dispersed evenly in water. But when exposed to UV light, the stabilizing outer shell of the particles is shed, and   now  enriched  by the pollutants   they form larger aggregates that can then be removed through filtration, sedimentation, or other methods. The researchers used the method to extract phthalates, hormone-disrupting chemicals used to soften plastics, from wastewater; BPA, another endocrine-disrupting synthetic compound widely used in plastic bottles and other resinous consumer goods, from thermal printing paper samples; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carcinogenic compounds formed from incomplete combustion of fuels, from contaminated soil. The process is irreversible and the polymers are biodegradable, minimizing the risks of leaving toxic secondary products to persist in, say, a body of water.  Once they switch to this macro situation where they re big clumps,  Bertrand says,  you won t be able to bring them back to the nano state again.  The fundamental breakthrough, according to the researchers, was confirming that small molecules do indeed adsorb passively onto the surface of nanoparticles.  To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the interactions of small molecules with pre-formed nanoparticles can be directly measured,  they write. Even more exciting, they say, is the wide range of potential uses, from environmental remediation to medical analysis. The polymers are synthesized at room temperature, and don t need to be specially prepared to target specific compounds; they are broadly applicable to all kinds of hydrophobic chemicals and molecules.  The interactions we exploit to remove the pollutants are non-specific,  Brandl says.  We can remove hormones, BPA, and pesticides that are all present in the same sample, and we can do this in one step.  And the nanoparticles  high surface-area-to-volume ratio means that only a small amount is needed to remove a relatively large quantity of pollutants. The technique could thus offer potential for the cost-effective cleanup of contaminated water and soil on a wider scale.  From the applied perspective, we showed in a system that the adsorption of small molecules on the surface of the nanoparticles can be used for extraction of any kind,  Bertrand says.  It opens the door for many other applications down the line.  This approach could possibly be further developed, he speculates, to replace the widespread use of organic solvents for everything from decaffeinating coffee to making paint thinners. Bertrand cites DDT, banned for use as a pesticide in the U.S. since 1972 but still widely used in other parts of the world, as another example of a persistent pollutant that could potentially be remediated using these nanomaterials.  And for analytical applications where you don t need as much volume to purify or concentrate, this might be interesting,  Bertrand says, offering the example of a cheap testing kit for urine analysis of medical patients. The study also suggests the broader potential for adapting nanoscale drug-delivery techniques developed for use in environmental remediation.  That we can apply some of the highly sophisticated, high-precision tools developed for the pharmaceutical industry, and now look at the use of these technologies in broader terms, is phenomenal,  says Frank Gu, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada, and an expert in nanoengineering for health care and medical applications.  When you think about field deployment, that s far down the road, but this paper offers a really exciting opportunity to crack a problem that is persistently present,  says Gu, who was not involved in the research.  If you take the normal conventional civil engineering or chemical engineering approach to treating it, it just won t touch it. That s where the most exciting part is. ","Published: July 23, 2015"

Directed by The University of Melbourne s Professor Ben Howden, Director of MDU PHL, and Associate Professor Tim Stinear, this new technology will enable more rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, more timely identification of disease outbreaks and allow clinicians to make more informed therapeutic decisions. Professor Ben Howden said that aside from the technology, what made the Centre so powerful were its advanced, high-end computation capabilities.  Led by world-renowned bioinformatician Associate Professor Torsten Seemann from the Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative, these capabilities allow us to use the large amount of data generated by sequencing the microbes to ultimately fast track our investigations and respond to any outbreak.  Professor Elizabeth Hartland, Head of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, noted that the establishment of Centre was the result of renewed collaboration between the public health program and academic researchers from the Department, and would be vital to progressing their extensive work in antibiotic resistance and infection. Professor Sharon Lewin, Director of the Doherty Institute, said that adoption of this technology was beginning worldwide and the Centre was the first of its kind in Australia.  Opening the Doherty Centre for Applied Microbial Genomics is a major step forward for public health and clinical microbiology in Australia and will transform how we track and respond to infections caused by antibiotic resistant superbugs, amongst other uses,  Professor Lewin said.  I would like to congratulate Professor Howden, Associate Professor Stinear and their team on establishing the Centre, which will provide the expertise and leadership to assist other laboratories around Australia transition to this new approach.   A united and coordinated national effort is the key to harnessing the full power of genomics to fight infectious diseases. ","Published: July 23, 2015"

Changing behaviour in response to nutrients can occur at many levels: the activity of proteins can be varied or new genes can be activated to produce a different set of proteins. Research reveals that yeast go one step further and actually modify their genomes to act optimally in the current environment. We think of the information in our genome as stable, only changing occasionally through random mutation. However, a handful of genes in organisms from yeast to mammals are known to change rapidly at specific times and in specific cell types. A good example of this is the system which creates immune diversity in vertebrates. How these systems are controlled is a major question as mechanisms that cause genome change can be very dangerous if mis-directed. This is especially true for single-celled organisms like yeast, for which a genome change affects not just an individual but is passed down to all its descendants. This research looked at the genes encoding ribosomes - the factories that produce proteins in cells. To create an entire new cell requires the synthesis of a huge amount of proteins by the ribosomes, and a vast proportion of cellular resources are used in producing enough ribosomes to allow cells to divide at the maximum possible speed. TOR is a signalling pathway that coordinates growth rate in response to nutrient availability and controls the rate of ribosome synthesis. TOR signalling is conserved from yeast to mammals and controls numerous processes, one notable example being the response to caloric restriction which slows growth and can extend lifespan. The researchers show that TOR also responds to caloric excess, instigating a pathway that increases the number of ribosomal DNA genes in the genome. Yeast engineered to carry a sub-optimal complement of ribosomal DNA genes are known to undergo gene amplification to correct this deficit, but it was not known why. The researchers found that these cells perceive the normal environment as containing an excess of calories because they struggle to produce enough ribosomes to maintain normal levels of protein synthesis. TOR signalling responds to this caloric excess and initiates ribosomal DNA gene amplification. Amplification of the ribosomal DNA genes provides a long term, heritable increase in ribosome synthesis capacity to enable optimum reproduction rate and make best use of available nutrients. It will be fascinating to now ask whether TOR can also drive genome changes in higher organisms in response to an excess of calories, and what effects this might have on health and lifespan.","Published: July 23, 2015"

Recent studies show that contact with the Ebola virus through the mucus membranes that line the respiratory tract results in infection, suggesting that airway linings may be important portals of entry for the virus. Aerosolized delivery has never before been tested for an Ebola vaccine or any other viral hemorrhagic fever vaccine.  A needle-free, inhalable vaccine against Ebola presents certain advantages,  said lead author Michelle Meyer, UTMB postdoctoral fellow in the department of pathology.  Immunization will not require trained medical personnel. The study characterized the immune responsgenerated by vaccination against Ebola delivered to the respiratory tract as either an aerosol or liquid. Direct comparisons were made with an unrelated protective injectable Ebola vaccine. This included detailed comparisons between immune T cell responses in the lungs, spleen and blood. A single vaccination with the aerosol developed by the researchers protected non-human primates against the severe disease and death caused by lethal Ebola infection.  This study demonstrates successful aerosol vaccination against a viral hemorrhagic fever for the first time,  said virologist Alex Bukreyev, UTMB professor and a senior author.  A single-dose aerosol vaccine would enable both prevention and containment of Ebola infections, in a natural outbreak setting where healthcare infrastructure is lacking or during bioterrorism and biological warfare scenarios.  The findings of this study provide the basis for advancing this experimental vaccine to an NIH phase I clinical study. Pending approval through an Investigative New Drug Application, the aerosolized form of the vaccine will be evaluated for replication, safety and immunity development in a study in adults.","Published: July 23, 2015"

The researchers explored how disease or gossip might spread through London's transit network. Specifically, they illustrated how the street network overlaid with the London Underground network enables contagions to hop to a distant location. To analyze the behavior of a contagion, the researchers drew on ideas from 'topology', a branch of mathematics used to characterise the structure of complex shapes. By studying the 'shape' of the data that results from a contagion, it is possible to distinguish between contagions that take long-distance hops across a network and those that exhibit a local (and slower) wave-like spreading pattern.  This 'computational topology' technique has the potential to overcome many of the barriers to extracting useful information from big, 'noisy' data sets, such as those gathered during a disease epidemic or from gossip spreading over social media. Computational topology could, for example, yield insights into how fast a new contagion might spread or where it might emerge next. ""Underlying spatial networks have a big influence over how diseases or information spread, but in our ever-more-connected world, there are numerous 'shortcuts' that these can take that makes their spreading patterns difficult to predict,"" said report author Professor Mason Porter of Oxford University's Mathematical Institute. ""Our work shows a way to reconcile a wave-like model of spreading, which might approximate what happens at a local level, with behavior that includes shortcuts to distant locations."" To investigate how networks influence spreading processes, the team ran hundreds of scenarios. They considered various subtly different network structures, which encapsulate which 'nodes' (representing, for example, people or locations) are directly reachable from each other through a single short-range or long-range connection. In some scenarios, nodes can be 'stubborn' and resist a new infection or idea; but in others, they are not stubborn at all and quickly succumb to a contagion. The team found that the shape of how a contagion spreads is very sensitive to how inclined nodes are to adopt the contagion. Hooke Fellow Dr Heather Harrington, an author from Oxford University's Mathematical Institute, said: ""If nodes are very stubborn, a contagion doesn't spread much at all; whereas if they are compliant, the contagion quickly crops up all over the network. When the nodes are moderately stubborn   a so called 'sweet spot'   a contagion tends to spread gradually as a wave."" Professor Porter said: 'In other situations, when different nodes have different levels of stubbornness, and if we otherwise make the model more complicated, we still observe both wave-like and shortcut 'hopping' behavior, although naturally the results are messier.' By varying the location of the initial outbreak on a given network and tracking exactly who gets infected at what time (and stacking these layers of information on top of one another), the researchers constructed a mathematical object that they call a 'contagion map'. Using methods from computational topology to examine the shape of the data encompassed by the contagion map, the researchers looked for 'holes' in the data. 'You can think of it like looking for the hole in a doughnut shape that enables us to distinguish it from a sphere,' said Professor Porter. In simple scenarios, the approach can distinguish between a 'real' hole   which could represent where infections tend not to spread over shortcuts between distant locales   and a 'false' hole that arises from noise in the data (such that long-range spread could still be common). As the deluge of data gets ever deeper, developing tools that can distinguish genuine features from noise in large, intricate data sets is becoming increasingly important. Professor Porter said: 'Our work illustrates that these topological methods could be useful in a range of different scenarios. It s a good example of how pure mathematics and applied mathematics are increasingly working together.'","Published: July 23, 2015"

He added that Xoma will continue to work closely with Servier and uveitis experts  to conduct a thorough analysis of the data to fully understand gevokizumab's impact on several clinically relevant endpoints.  That data includes initial observations seen in the secondary endpoints  that are clinically important and meaningful to both clinicians and Beh et's disease uveitis patients,  added Ilknur Tugal-Tutkun, M.D., international coordinator for EYEGUARD-B and professor of ophthalmology and head, ocular immunology and uveitis service at Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine. The trial s secondary endpoints included total number of exacerbations, best corrected visual acuity, vitreous haze, retinal lesions, fundus assessments and macular edema. Gevokizumab appeared to be well tolerated in EYEGUARD-B, with comparable adverse events between gevokizumab and placebo treated groups, Xoma said. EYEGUARD-B was intended to demonstrate the superiority of gevokizumab, compared with placebo, on top of the current standard of care in reducing the risk of Beh et's disease uveitis exacerbations and to assess the safety of gevokizumab. The study was designed to enroll patients with a history of Beh et's disease uveitis with ocular involvement of the posterior segment who had experienced a recent ocular exacerbation that was treated successfully with high doses of corticosteroids, according to Xoma. The trial enrolled 83 patients in the core part of the study (40 on gevokizumab and 43 on placebo). Patients were randomized to either a 60 mg dose of gevokizumab or placebo administered subcutaneously once monthly, in addition to their current immunosuppressive and corticosteroid therapies. Patients were randomized when they reached the step of 20 mg/day equivalent oral prednisone and continued a standardized tapering regimen until they reached 5 mg/day during double-masked treatment. Xoma CEO John Varian said two additional trials of gevokizumab run by the company are still recruiting patients, EYEGUARD-A and  C.

4,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/new-diabetes-drug-has-unexpected-side-effect-202487,New Diabetes Drug has Unexpected Side Effect  A type of drug used to treat diabetes may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson s disease  according to new research  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. The research, led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, found that diabetes patients taking glitazone antidiabetes drugs (either rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) had a 28% lower incidence of Parkinson s disease than people taking other treatments for diabetes who had never taken glitazones.  Glitazones are a class of drug that activate the peroxisome proliferation-activated gamma (PPAR ) receptor, which is found inside cells in many different body organs. PPAR  activation by glitazones leads to reduced insulin resistance, which has been useful for treating people with diabetes, but the receptor has many other functions that have not been studied as thoroughly in humans.  Although the potential effect of glitazones on Parkinson s disease had previously been demonstrated in rodents and in vitro, the authors believe this is the first study to show the relationship between glitazone use and incidence of Parkinson s disease in humans.  The study, which was funded by The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson s Research, looked at more than 160,000 diabetes patients in the UK. Researchers used electronic health records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to match 44,597 glitazone users with 120,373 people using other antidiabetic drugs. Glitazone users were matched by age, sex, GP practice, and diabetes treatment stage with up to five users of other diabetic treatments.  Patients were followed up from 1999 (when glitazones were introduced to treat diabetes) until 2013, to determine how many were diagnosed with Parkinson s disease during that period.  The results showed a 28% reduction in incidence of Parkinson s disease among people taking glitazones compared with those taking other antidiabetic treatments. Adjustments for risk factors associated with Parkinson s disease (including smoking and head injury) had no impact on the findings.  The results suggest that the reduced risk of Parkinson s disease was only associated with current treatment with glitazones, and that there is little or no longer lasting benefit if people have taken the drug in the past before stopping or switching to another medication.  Senior author Dr Ian Douglas from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said:  We often hear about negative side effects associated with medications, but sometimes there can also be unintended beneficial effects.  Our findings provide unique evidence that we hope will drive further investigation into potential drug treatments for Parkinson s disease. It s thought that around one in 500 people are affected by Parkinson s, and to date no effective treatments have been found to directly tackle the neurodegenerative aspect of the disease.  Dr Ruth Brauer, who worked on the study while at the School before moving to King s College London, said:  Our results suggest that treatments which activate the PPAR  receptor in the same way as glitazones could be promising targets in future drug research. Although our study only looked at people with diabetes, we believe it s likely that the protective effect of glitazones may also be seen in people without diabetes.   The authors note that their study only included patients with diabetes who had not been diagnosed with Parkinson s disease when they started taking glitazones, and therefore they cannot establish whether taking the drug slows or prevents the progression of the disease. They also highlight that glitazones have been associated with some serious side effects including bladder cancer and cardiovascular issues. ","Published: July 23, 2015"

As the uptake of carbon dioxide has increased in the last century, so has the acidity of oceans worldwide. Since pre-industrial times, the pH of the oceans has dropped from an average of 8.2 to 8.1 today. Projections of climate change estimate that by the year 2100, this number will drop further, to around 7.8   significantly lower than any levels seen in open ocean marine communities today. Now a team of researchers from MIT, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and elsewhere has found that such increased ocean acidification will dramatically affect global populations of phytoplankton   microorganisms on the ocean surface that make up the base of the marine food chain. The researchers report that increased ocean acidification by 2100 will spur a range of responses in phytoplankton: Some species will die out, while others will flourish, changing the balance of plankton species around the world.The researchers also compared phytoplankton s response not only to ocean acidification, but also to other projected drivers of climate change, such as warming temperatures and lower nutrient supplies. For instance, the team used a numerical model to see how phytoplankton as a whole will migrate significantly, with most populations shifting toward the poles as the planet warms. Based on global simulations, however, they found the most dramatic effects stemmed from ocean acidification. Stephanie Dutkiewicz, a principal research scientist in MIT s Center for Global Change Science, says that while scientists have suspected ocean acidification might affect marine populations, the group s results suggest a much larger upheaval of phytoplankton   and therefore probably the species that feed on them   than previously estimated.  I ve always been a total believer in climate change, and I try not to be an alarmist, because it s not good for anyone,  says Dutkiewicz, who is the paper s lead author.  But I was actually quite shocked by the results. The fact that there are so many different possible changes, that different phytoplankton respond differently, means there might be some quite traumatic changes in the communities over the course of the 21st century. A whole rearrangement of the communities means something to both the food web further up, but also for things like cycling of carbon.  To get a sense for how individual species of phytoplankton react to a more acidic environment, the team performed a meta-analysis, compiling data from 49 papers in which others have studied how single species grow at lower pH levels. Such experiments typically involve placing organisms in a flask and recording their biomass in solutions of varying acidity. In all, the papers examined 154 experiments of phytoplankton. The researchers divided the species into six general, functional groups, including diatoms, Prochlorococcus, and coccolithophores, then charted the growth rates under more acidic conditions. They found a whole range of responses to increasing acidity, even within functional groups, with some  winners  that grew faster than normal, while other  losers  died out. The experimental data largely reflected individual species  response in a controlled laboratory environment. The researchers then worked the experimental data into a global ocean circulation model to see how multiple species, competing with each other, responded to rising acidity levels. The researchers paired MIT s global circulation model   which simulates physical phenomena such as ocean currents, temperatures, and salinity   with an ecosystem model that simulates the behavior of 96 species of phytoplankton. As with the experimental data, the researchers grouped the 96 species into six functional groups, then assigned each group a range of responses to ocean acidification, based on the ranges observed in the experiments. After running the global simulation several times with different combinations of responses for the 96 species, the researchers observed that as ocean acidification prompted some species to grow faster, and others slower, it also changed the natural competition between species.  Normally, over evolutionary time, things come to a stable point where multiple species can live together,  Dutkiewicz says.  But if one of them gets a boost, even though the other might get a boost, but not as big, it might get outcompeted. So you might get whole species just disappearing because responses are slightly different.  Dutkiewicz says shifting competition at the plankton level may have big ramifications further up in the food chain.  Generally, a polar bear eats things that start feeding on a diatom, and is probably not fed by something that feeds on Prochlorococcus, for example,  Dutkiewicz says.  The whole food chain is going to be different.  By 2100, the local composition of the oceans may also look very different due to warming water: The model predicts that many phytoplankton species will move toward the poles. That means that in New England, for instance, marine communities may look very different in the next century.  If you went to Boston Harbor and pulled up a cup of water and looked under a microscope, you d see very different species later on,  Dutkiewicz says.  By 2100, you d see ones that were living maybe closer to North Carolina now, up near Boston.  Dutkiewicz says the model gives a broad-brush picture of how ocean acidification may change the marine world. To get a more accurate picture, she says, more experiments are needed, involving multiple species to encourage competition in a natural environment.  Bottom line is, we need to know how competition is important as oceans become more acidic,  she says.","Published: July 23, 2015"

MGB-BP-3 is an antibiotic that has been shown to be active against a broad range of important multi-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The oral formulation of MGB-BP-3 is being developed by MGB Biopharma specifically for the treatment of Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for a growing number of hospital acquired infections. Approximately 40 healthy subjects will be enrolled into the single centre, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase I trial, which will determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple ascending doses of oral MGB-BP-3. The trial will also examine the effect of MGB-BP-3 on normal gut flora. Of the 40 subjects enrolled, approximately 16 will receive a single dose of MGB-BP-3 or placebo in up to 3 study sessions, the first of which has been completed successfully. A further 24 subjects will receive twice-daily, ascending, oral doses of MGB-BP-3 or placebo for 9 days, and a single dose on the morning of day 10. All subjects will attend a follow-up visit at 7 10 days after their dose of trial medication. The results of the trial are expected by the end of 2015. Miroslav Ravic, CEO of MGB Biopharma, said:  The start of the Phase I clinical trial with our oral formulation of MGB-BP-3 is a major milestone for the company. Infections by multi-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, are a growing worldwide problem that causes many deaths and higher morbidity in patients being treated in hospital. MGB-BP-3 has the potential to be the first truly novel antibiotic with a novel mode of action developed in more than a decade capable of treating infections of this type.  MGB Biopharma is also developing an intravenous formulation targeting the treatment of a range of systemic hospital acquired Gram-positive infections, including MRSA. This programme is in late-stage preclinical development, and shows very promising results. The IV formulation is expected to be IND-ready by the end of 2015.","Published: July 23, 2015"

Financial details were not disclosed. Under the terms of the agreement, SYGNIS AG has granted Thermo Fisher non-exclusive global rights to develop, to market and to sell products and services for the detection and analysis of protein interactions in vivo based on its proprietary Double Switch technology to researchers working in the field of proteomics.  We are happy about the license agreement with Thermo Fisher,  SYGNIS  CEO and CFO Pilar de la Huerta commented.  We see this agreement as a further endorsement of our Double Switch technology which addresses key needs in proteomics and drug development and are working on additional partnerships.  SYGNIS  Double Switch technology is based on a protease called  TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease  deriving from a plant virus. TEV protease has virtually no targets in the human proteome and therefore does not cause any damage to mammalian cells. The highly sequence specific TEV protease is a very useful tool for the analysis of protein-protein interactions as it cleaves fused proteins with simultaneous activation of a specific protein-coding. The knowledge of signaling pathways and interactions between proteins is a key contribution for understanding molecular processes for example in basic research, in the development and progression of diseases like cancer and in drug discovery and development.","Published: July 23, 2015"

The announcement follows a worldwide license agreement between Harvard s Office of Technology Development (OTD) and MediCollector. The software was developed as part of the Institute s infant apnea prevention program. During spells of apnea, normal breathing activity is interrupted in newborns and, if left untreated, this can result in a critical lack of oxygen that may cause developmental delays, long-lasting damage and even be life-threatening. The Wyss' apnea prevention technology incorporates three unique components: software that continuously acquires vital signals such as breathing activity from affected preemies, an algorithm that analyzes the stream of signals to accurately predict apneic episodes before they happen, and a therapeutic mattress that is set off to vibrate and restore normal breathing as soon as an apneic episode is predicted. The technology was validated in collaboration with clinicians at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, and Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. ""While we were developing and testing our apnea-prevention technology, it became increasingly clear that one of its components, the data-acquisition software, had great potential value for a broad range of applications in research and healthcare, and not just for newborns in the intensive care unit,"" said James Niemi, Lead Senior Staff Engineer in the Anticipatory Medical and Cellular Device Platform at the Wyss Institute.  In today s hospitals, clinically-relevant measurements, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are usually only recorded at infrequent intervals. Most of the vital data generated by medical devices at the bedside is therefore lost and never recorded,"" said John Osborne, a Senior Staff Engineer at the Wyss Institute who pioneered the software development effort. As an important first step, MediCollector further developed the software initially designed for the apnea prevention system, to become an independent, portable and user friendly software application capable of communicating with a variety of patient monitors and devices typically found in hospitals, and recording the data in a plug and-play fashion directly onto a user s hard disk. ""A wealth of data could be collected with this software and mined to better understand how critical physiological changes evolve in patients with varying conditions, as well as how they respond to treatments. In principle, this can lead to more effective therapies,"" said David Paydarfar, a Wyss Associate Faculty member and a Professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, who was the scientific lead on the apnea prevention project. Marking the software s commercial success and its potential impact at the bedside, The NanoVation GS (Haifa, Israel), a company spun out of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, is using the data acquisition software to test and validate their nanomaterial based respiration sensors on newborn infants battling apnea in hospital wards. ""The NanoVation GS device platform provides miniaturized, inexpensive, and easy to use monitoring of various vital signs, including respiration rate, heart rate, temperature and oxygen saturation"", said Sagi Gliksman, M.Sc and Chief Technical Officer at The NanoVation GS. ""MediCollector's software is a valuable tool for continuous collection of vital signs in hospital wards and for enabling comparisons of our newly developed technology with the currently available vital signs techniques used in clinical practice."" ""While the initial application of MediCollector s software will be research focused, down the road, the company will build a larger portfolio in which the software is integrated with clinical alarm systems,"" said Osborne, Founder of MediCollector. It has been shown that many of the alerts constantly beeping at the hospital bedside are actually false alarms that require no clinical response. This can lead to patient distress and loss of staff efficiency and, at worst, it can produce the widely recognized issue of 'alarm fatigue', where hospital staff ignore critical signals. But currently, there are no effective tools for collecting and analyzing alarm counts and response times. MediCollector's software could collect this data and make it available to hospital administrations aiming to improve their staff performance and operations. ""The MediCollector startup is another great example of how Wyss Institute researchers work collaboratively with clinicians to develop and de risk technologies, advancing research and speeding up impact at the bedside,"" said Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber who is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.","Published: July 23, 2015"

1,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/addicted-finding-solutions-283429,Addicted to finding solutions Growing up in West Virginia  Jill Turner saw firsthand the kind of havoc that drug addiction can wreak  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Growing up in West Virginia, Jill Turner saw firsthand the kind of havoc that drug addiction can wreak. ""I had a lot of friends who had very promising lives and promising careers ahead of them,"" the assistant professor in the South Carolina College of Pharmacy says, ""but they ended up either overdosing or going to jail for drug-related stuff. It's one of the reasons I went into drug addiction research."" Turner has been studying one of the fundamental biomolecules contributing to human addiction: the mu-opioid receptor. It's a protein in the human body that is affected by many different drugs, from nicotine to alcohol to heroin. One particularly interesting aspect of this opioid receptor protein is that a seemingly small change in its makeup can have a dramatic effect on many of the behaviors of the creature it is part of. Every protein is made of up many individual subunits called amino acids, and a variation in just one of those amino acids can sometimes mean big changes for the whole organism. There's only a limited number of amino acids -- about 20 -- that are used to construct proteins, which are often on the order of a few hundred amino acids long. So a protein is kind of like a mosaic made up of amino acids. With 20 'colors' to choose from, and a few hundred 'pixels' in a protein, the cell constructs a mosaic of a protein that has, in a manner of speaking, a distinct image. Altering just a single pixel in an ordinary mosaic results in very similar image, perhaps identical at first glance. In the biomolecular world, though, a single change in the makeup of the mu-opioid receptor has dramatic effects. Among humans, there are two relatively common versions of the mu-opioid receptor that differ only by one amino acid, sometimes called the A variant and the G variant. In Caucasians, the G variant only makes up perhaps 5 percent to 15 percent of the population. Population studies are still relatively new, but some associations between individuals having the variant and their behavior are becoming clear, Turner says. People with the G variant of the protein can quit smoking more readily. They're less susceptible to alcoholism. They're less likely to become addicted to heroin and can kick the habit more readily. As children, they seem to be more resilient in the face of stressful situations, such as abuse by elders or bullying. Turner is fascinated that such complex human behavior can be altered by just one amino acid. That protein difference arises from a singular difference in DNA: Organisms that have the G variant of the protein are said to have the G allele. ""At least for myself, it's hard to imagine that a single change in your DNA -- one point, one nucleotide -- can have such an effect,"" Turner says. ""How does it translate into such dramatic changes in behavior, in social responses and in pleasure seeking?"" Her lab has delved into the molecular details of that process. In a paper her team published in the journal Neuropharmacology, they addressed one of the fundamental questions researchers have been asking about the difference between individuals with the A and G variant: Is it caused by a difference in amount or in function of the mu-opioid receptor? Working with an animal model that has been shown to replicate addictive behaviors closely analogous to those in humans, the team compared individuals with the two variants. They found evidence that the G variant gives rise to a different kind of neural system in the hippocampus, a substructure in the brain. With the G variant, for example, the response to added morphine was attenuated in the hippocampal microcircuitry. An alternate hypothesis -- that the differences brought about by the G variant are the result of smaller amounts of the protein being expressed there -- wasn't categorically rejected, but the evidence for loss of function in the opioid receptor is strong, Turner says. Adding to the fund of knowledge about the opioid receptor, she adds, will increase the clinical potential that already exists for personalized medicine. ""Say someone is an alcoholic, and you don't bother testing for these genetic variations and give the patient a drug like naltrexone to help manage alcohol addiction,"" Turner says. ""Then they come back to you and they've relapsed. If you had genotyped them prior to giving them the drug, you would have known you should give them something else. They needed a different drug.

2,https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/pursuit-precision-medicine-ptsd-283421,In pursuit of precision medicine for PTSD  Brain scans may eventually help tailor therapy  ,"Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. Brain scans may eventually help tailor therapy Brain scans of war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have led researchers to an area of the prefrontal cortex that appears to be a good predictor of response to treatment with SSRIs--the first-line drug treatment for PTSD. The findings, published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, are hopeful news amid a new national push toward ""precision medicine,"" in which doctors will tailor drug regimens and other treatments based on patients' individual gene profiles or other factors. President Obama announced the initiative earlier this year. So far, though, little of this approach is in use in everyday psychiatry. ""This is the holy grail for brain imaging,"" says lead researcher Dr. K. Luan Phan, chief of neuropsychiatric research at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center and professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ""We hope in the future to be able to use scans to help distinguish PTSD from other illnesses, and then to predict how well someone will do with a certain medication, or with talk therapy. What we envision is being able to say to a patient, 'Given your scan value, you have an X percent chance of getting better on this treatment.'"" The approach, says Phan, will benefit patients and providers alike: ""We'll be saving a lot of resources on the clinical side, and more importantly, we'll also not be wasting patients' time sending them for a treatment that is not likely to help them."" His latest study included 34 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, half of them with PTSD. They all got functional MRI scans, which track blood flow in the brain to show which areas are using the most oxygen--a sign of increased activity. The researchers saw that among the PTSD group, who were all taking the drug paroxetine (sold as Paxil), the patients who showed the most improvement from the SSRI were those who showed the least activation, prior to treatment, of the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, also known as the inferior frontal gyrus. The region is known to help with emotional regulation. It serves as a rational counterbalance to parts of the brain that generate raw emotion. It helps with tasks like impulse control, cognitive flexibility, and executive function. ""These are all ingredients of emotional regulation,"" says Phan. One nuance in the findings was that the brain area that appeared to predict response to SSRIs--the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex--was not the exact area that appeared to be affected by SSRI treatment. According to the fMRI scans, it was a related area--the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which has similar functions--along with another region called the supplementary motor area, that showed more activation after treatment. Phan explains: ""It would be intuitive that something you're trying to correct would also be the very same thing that would predict how well you do. But data from our lab and others suggest this isn't always true. A mechanism of change could be different than a predictor of change. One area could change with treatment, but another area could predict your treatment response."" In any case, while the results need replication in larger trials, they point to a potential method to target drug therapy for PTSD patients. ""Patients with the least recruitment of prefrontal emotion regulatory brain regions may benefit most from treatment with SSRIs, which appear to augment activity in these regions,"" the researchers wrote. The first author was Annmarie MacNamara, a post-doctoral research fellow in Phan's lab. Paroxetine and sertraline (Zoloft) are both part of the SSRI class of antidepressants. They are currently the only drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat PTSD. Another SSRI, fluoxetine (Prozac), also has evidence of effectiveness for PTSD, but it's not yet approved for that purpose. Phan says the study was limited to patients using paroxetine, because while all SSRIs work similarly, there may be subtle differences among them, and the researchers wanted to control for this. He noted that some patients may respond well to one SSRI but not another. His lab is also involved in other efforts to tailor PTSD therapy based on brain patterns. In one VA-funded study, he is using a type of electroencephalography (EEG)--in which veterans wear an electrode-studded cap on their head--to trace brain patterns that may eventually serve as biomarkers. The research method is much less expensive and more portable than brain imaging--and it carries an added advantage for combat veterans, notes Phan. ""Functional MRIs typically cost around $500, and they are often not tolerated well by our veterans,"" he says. ""It can be a very claustrophobic experience. You can feel trapped in the tube, in this dark, tight space. And there are loud random noises that many veterans have told me remind them of artillery fire."" Besides being distressing for the veterans, says Phan, this can all detract from the research: ""It's problematic on two fronts. It makes them move during the scan, which is not great for our science. Also, it may evoke different kinds of emotions that we're not explicitly looking to test in the scanner. It induces a different emotional state that is hard to control for."" Phan is also collaborating on a multi-site randomized, controlled clinical trial that is comparing different PTSD treatments. The team is looking at how each affects the brain and whether brain markers can predict response to a particular treatment. The trial began in 2011 with VA and Army funding and is still ongoing at three VA sites and at Massachusetts General Hospital. It has involved more than 400 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with PTSD. Some are being treated with sertraline, and others with a type of psychotherapy called prolonged exposure therapy, which is one of the two main talk therapies used in VA for PTSD. Others in the study are receiving a combination of the two. Lead investigator Dr. Sheila Rauch, with the Atlanta VA Medical Center and Emory University, says it's too early in the study to compare how each of the therapies affects the brain--that is, which precise regions get activated or calmed--but some clues may come from past work on depression. ""Based on previous research on depression, we see some changes that are similar between treatments, but we also see distinct patterns,"" says Rauch. She, like Phan, believes the scanning approach may eventually yield reliable biomarkers to guide PTSD treatment, but she says it will likely take several more years. ""Within PTSD, this research is in the early stages,"" she says. ""We need larger studies that will allow replication and application to a treatment population,"" and those generally take at least five years to implement and yield results, she says. ""This is a marathon and not a sprint. Expecting an overhaul in the next couple of years is unrealistic, but I do think 10 years from now, PTSD care will be even more advanced and effective than it is today. We are moving in the right direction, but we are not there yet."" U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs - Research Communications   press release Luan Phan K et al.

The work, carried out by academics at UCL and the universities of Bristol and Queensland, hope the finding will allow a better understanding of why binge eating develops, and inform the development of future preventative strategies for teens at risk before they become overweight or obese. Around ten per cent of adults and teenagers binge eat (excessively overeat with a feeling of losing control over what they are consuming) and binge eating is most common in individuals who are overweight or obese. While it has been established that a combination of genetic and environmental factors lead to eating disorders, until now there has been limited research into how specific genes increase the likelihood of binge eating behaviours in adolescence that can lead to obesity.A team, led by Dr Nadia Micali at the UCL Institute of Child Health and Professor David Evans,who carried out some of the work while at Bristol before moving to Queensland s Diamantina Institute and MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, analysed data from 6,000 participants in the Children of the 90s (ALSPAC) study, also based at Bristol, when they were aged 14 and 16. Genetic variations associated with higher BMI (Body Mass Index) and obesity risk was investigated to see if they also predicted binge eating. The researchers found that if a young person had a particular variation in the FTO gene locus (rs1558902), they were over 20 per cent more likely to binge eat. The pattern was particularly evident in girls, who were 30 per cent more likely to binge eat if they had the variation. Lead author Dr Nadia Micali, Senior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Psychiatrist at the UCL Institute for Child Health and Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said:  This research offers an important first step towards understanding the genetic risk for binge eating and will help inform how we develop strategies to counter the obesity crisis.  We now know variations in the FTO gene can predict binge eating in teenagers, and binge eating in turn can predict obesity. Eventually this finding could allow us to develop more targeted treatment for binge eating, and enable much earlier intervention so young people don t develop obesity. ","Published: July 22, 2015"

Professor Knothe Tate is the first to use the system in humans. She has forged a pioneering partnership with the US-based Cleveland Clinic, Brown and Stanford Universities, as well as Zeiss and Google to help crunch terabytes of data gathered from human hip studies. Similar research is underway at Harvard University and Heidelberg in Germany to map neural pathways and connections in the brains of mice. Professor Knothe Tate presented several papers on her research into the human hip and osteoarthritis at the peer-reviewed Orthopedic Research Society meeting in Las Vegas. The imaging technology, developed by high-tech German optical and industrial measurement manufacturer Zeiss, was originally developed to scan silicon wafers for defects. Using Google algorithms, Professor Knothe Tate   an engineer and expert in cell biology and regenerative medicine   is able to zoom in and out from the scale of the whole joint down to the cellular level ""just as you would with Google Maps"", reducing to a matter of weeks analyses that once took 25 years to complete. Her team is also using cutting-edge microtome and MRI technology to examine how movement and weight bearing affects the movement of molecules within joints, exploring the relationship between blood, bone, lymphatics and muscle. ""For the first time we have the ability to go from the whole body down to how the cells are getting their nutrition and how this is all connected,"" said Professor Knothe Tate. ""This could open the door to as yet unknown new therapies and preventions."" Numerous studies have explored molecular transport within specific tissues but there has been little research on exchange between different kinds of tissue such as cartilage and bone. Professor Knothe Tate has already demonstrated a link between molecular transport through blood, muscle and bone, and disease status in osteoarthritic guinea pigs. Like humans, guinea pigs develop osteoarthritis as they age. The condition is increasingly believed to be the result of a breakdown in cellular communication. Understanding the molecular signaling and traffic between tissues could unlock a range of treatments, including physical therapies and preventative exercise routines, Professor Knothe Tate said. Critical to this work has been the development of microscopy that allows seamless imaging of organs and tissues across length scales   centimetres at the whole-joint level down to nanometer-sized molecules   as well as the capacity to sift and analyse huge sets of data. Professor Knothe Tate likened using the Zeiss technology in the hipbone to Google Maps' ability to zoom down from an Earth View to Street View. ""These are terabyte-sized data sets so the Google maps algorithms are helping us take this tremendous amount of information and use it effectively. They're the traffic controllers, if you like."" ""Advanced research instrumentation provides a technological platform to answer the hardest, unanswered questions in science, opening up avenues for fundamental discoveries, the implications of which may be currently unfathomable yet which will ultimately pave the way to engineer better human health and quality of life as we age.""

The collaboration builds on the complementary strengths of both the GIS and PacBio in the analysis and understanding of bacteria and viruses, including those that cause diseases such as diarrhoea, meningitis, urinary tract infection, dengue, and liver cancer, as well as those that we continuously live with, termed the microbiota. Understanding the dynamics of bacterial genomes is particularly relevant to address the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance in Singapore and the rest of the world.  Dr Swaine Chen, Dr Martin Hibberd, and Dr Niranjan Nagarajan from the GIS are spearheading the collaboration. Dr Chen said,  Working together with PacBio, we are able to fully sequence bacterial genomes and arrive at deeper insights into how bacteria cause disease .  This latest collaboration extends and expands the previous one with PacBio. Earlier in the year, Dr Chen and Dr Hibberd completed an initial formal collaboration with PacBio - one that provided insights into how E. coli causes urinary tract infection, the results of which are anticipated for publication later this year.  Ram Laxman, President and General Manager of Pacific Biosciences, Asia Pacific, commented,  SMRT  Sequencing technology is proving to be the Gold Standard in bacterial and viral sequencing due to its ability to fully resolve repeat regions and  finish  genomes. Other NGS technologies are not able to finish even the smallest of bacterial genomes due to their sequence context bias and very short sequencing reads.

In 16 of 20 patients with advanced disease, there was a significant clinical response. The scientists found that the T-cell therapy was generally well-tolerated and that modified immune cells traveled to the bone marrow, where myeloma tumors typically are found, and showed a long-term ability to fight the tumors. Relapse was generally associated with a loss of the engineered T-cells.  This study suggests that treatment with engineered T-cells is not only safe but of potential clinical benefit to patients with certain types of aggressive multiple myeloma,  says first author Aaron P. Rapoport, MD, the Gary Jobson Professor in Medical Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  Our findings provide a strong foundation for further research in the field of cellular immunotherapy for myeloma to help achieve even better results for our patients.  The trial is the first published use of genetically modified T-cells for treating patients with multiple myeloma. The approach has been used to treat leukemia as well as lymphoma, according to Dr. Rapoport, who is the Director of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center. More than 77,000 people in the United States have multiple myeloma, with about 24,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Patients are treated with chemotherapy and in many cases an autologous stem cell transplant, but long-term response rates are low, and median survival is three to five years.  The majority of patients who participated in this trial had a meaningful degree of clinical benefit,  Dr. Rapoport notes.  Even patients who later relapsed after achieving a complete response to treatment or didn t have a complete response had periods of disease control that I believe they would not have otherwise experienced. Some patients are still in remission after nearly three years.  The research is a collaboration between the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Adaptimmune, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company which owns the core T-cell receptor technology and funded the study. Dr. Rapoport and co-authors Edward A. Stadtmauer, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center, and Gwendolyn K. Binder-Scholl, PhD, of Adaptimmune, contributed equally to the research. Dr. Rapoport is the study s principal investigator. In the clinical study, patients  T-cells were engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for a type of tumor antigen, or protein, known as a cancer-testis antigen (CT antigen). The target CT antigens were NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Up to 60 percent of advanced myelomas have been reported to express NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1, which correlates to tumor proliferation and poorer outcomes. According to Adaptimmune, the trial is the first published study of lentiviral vector mediated TCR gene expression in humans. Of the 20 patients treated, 14 (70 percent) had a near complete or complete response three months after treatment. Median progression-free survival was 19.1 months and overall survival was 32.1 months. Two patients had a very good partial response three months post treatment.  Half the patients were treated at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center and half at the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center. Researchers note that the response rate was better than would be expected for a standard autologous stem cell transplant. In addition, patients did not experience side effects which have been associated with another type of genetically engineered T-cells (chimeric antigen receptors, or CARS) used to treat other cancers.  Multiple myeloma is a treatable but largely incurable cancer. This study reveals the promise that immunotherapy with genetically engineered T-cells holds for boosting the body s ability to attack the cancer and provide patients with better treatments and control of their disease,  says E. Albert Reece, MD., PhD, MBA, vice president for medical affairs at the University of Maryland and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  This trial is also an excellent example of significant scientific advances that result from collaborations between academic medical institutions and private industry. ","Published: July 22, 2015"

Researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and SNPsaurus LLC, have produced research that opens up the field of conservation genomics to the use of non-invasive sampling techniques. Information embedded within DNA has long contributed to biodiversity conservation, helping to reconstruct the past history of species, assess their current status, and guide strategies for their protection. Endangered and elusive species may be both rare and difficult to locate. As a result, conservation geneticists typically have to rely on sources of DNA collected non-invasively, such as from hair, feathers or feces. Until now, these approaches have been quite successful in obtaining genetic information from a handful of markers across the genome,  says Michael Russello, associate professor of biology in UBC s Okanagan s Irving K. Barber School of Arts and Sciences and principal investigator of the study.  However, so-called  next-generation DNA sequencing  (NGS) now allows researchers to collect massive volumes of genetic data on the scale of entire genomes, but harnessing such technology for endangered species can be quite challenging.  For example, NGS typically requires high quality and large quantities of starting DNA extracted from fresh tissues or blood. Acquiring such materials is trivial for humans; a mere cheek swab will usually do. This is not the case, say, for the Amur leopard, which is both rare and elusive. In such cases, scientists and managers must rely on non-invasively collected sources of DNA that typically yield low quality and low quantity of starting material. The new study demonstrates that the non-invasive sampling essential for many conservation-related studies is now compatible with the minimum requirements for harnessing NGS technologies. As a result, it will now be possible to further expand the field of conservation genetics in the genomics era.  We were able to collect genome-wide data from natural populations of the elusive and climate-sensitive American pika on a scale unheard of just a few years ago,  says Russello. The research relied on DNA extracted from hair samples collected using rolled packing tape by Matthew Waterhouse, a PhD candidate at UBC and co-author of the study.  The flexibility gained by using non-invasive approaches opens up sampling opportunities and increases sample sizes that are critical for our genetic studies, all while minimizing impact on the individual pika,  says Waterhouse. The innovative data collection approach pioneered by Eric Johnson and Paul Etter of SNPsaurus LLC, both co-authors of the study, enabled the sampling of almost 10,000 variable sites in the American pika genome using, in some cases, as little as 1 nanogram (one billionth of a gram) of starting DNA extracted from hair.  There are tremendous benefits for expanding our coverage of the genome when studying species of conservation concern, as it vastly improves our inferences of key genetic characteristics of populations and opens up new avenues for inquiry in the form of potentially identifying those parts of the genome that are involved in organisms  ability to adapt to changing environments,  says Russello. The use of NGS on non-invasively collected samples is not without its challenges, but can be overcome with a host of careful considerations pointed out by the authors. In an era in which global biodiversity continues to decline at rates consistent with a mass extinction, conservation scientists and managers can now add genomics to their toolkit for attempting to document and reverse this trend.","Published: July 22, 2015"

Now, a new study shows that scientists may be able to create a  universal  vaccine that can provide broad protection against numerous influenza strains, including those that could cause future pandemics.  ""The reason researchers change the vaccine every year is that they want to specifically match the vaccine to the particular viruses that are circulating, such as H1N1. If the vaccine is just a little bit different to the target virus, it is not expected to offer much protection,"" said principal investigator of the study Jeffery Taubenberger, MD, PhD, Chief of Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). ""What we have done is design a strategy where you don t have to think about matching the vaccine antigen to the virus at all."" In the new study, researchers at the NIAID used a virus-like particle vaccine cocktail that expressed a handful of different subtypes of a key surface protein of the influenza virus: hemagglutinin H1, H3, H5 and H7. ""There are 16 different hemagglutinin subtypes that circulate in birds and are thought to be the basis for current and future influenza pandemics,"" said Dr. Taubenberger. ""The hypothesis was that the presentation of these different viral proteins would stimulate the development of cross-protective immunity that would provide broader protection against multiple subtypes."" The researchers picked the H1 and H3 subtypes because they have been the major cause of human seasonal flu outbreaks since 1918. They chose the H5 and H7 subtypes because they have been the cause of recent bird flu outbreaks and have pandemic potential. This selection also provided a broad representation of hemagglutinins across the phylogenetic tree. In a series of experiments, the researchers found that 95% of mice vaccinated with the investigational cocktail were protected against a lethal challenge with eight different influenza strains expressing seven different influenza A subtypes, compared to only 5% of mice who received mock vaccinations.  ""Almost all of the animals that were vaccinated survived, including mice that were challenged with viruses that expressed hemagglutinin subtypes that were not in the vaccine at all, viruses that expressed H2, H6, H10, and H11,"" said Dr. Taubenberger. ""What that suggests is that this approach really gives us broad spectrum protection, and could serve as a basis for an effective pre-pandemic vaccine."" Additional experiments showed that the vaccine was durable, effective for at least 6 months, and that it worked well in older mice. This is important given that elderly people are particularly susceptible to severe disease following influenza infection, and current vaccines are less efficacious in the elderly than in younger people. ""These initial findings are very positive and suggest a promising and practical strategy for developing a vaccine with amazing, broad protection,"" said Dr. Taubenberger.","Published: July 22, 2015"

That at least is the hope of Canadian researchers whose study suggests that analyzing certain chemical compounds in saliva could provide a cheap, non-invasive way to learn whether the brain has begun to undergo the changes that culminate in loss of memory and cognitive function. Their study was one of several on the hunt for new biomarkers that were presented at the Alzheimer s Association International Conference in the District. Other biomarker research looked at the possibility of analyzing brain fluid for the elevated presence of neurogranin, a protein that is found only in the brain and plays an important role in conducting signals between the synapses of nerve cells, or using PET scans to identify inflammation, which can be fatal for brain tissue. The scientific gathering   which is expected to draw nearly 4,500 researchers from around the world   comes as several developed nations shift toward older populations. More than 5 million people are living with Alzheimer s in the United States, a number expected to increase to 13.5 million by 2050. With about 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day, Alzheimer s researchers and their advocates say the United States needs to step up the search for a cure or treatments before the costs to family caregivers and the federal government, through Medicare, begin to soar. A step forward means finding ways to diagnose the disease better, particularly in its early stages before symptoms appear. And it also is likely to involve a multi-pronged approach. A lot of attention was given to the search for new, reliable biomarkers of Alzheimer s disease. Because the preclinical stage of Alzheimer s can last as long as 20 years, scientists are devoting more attention to finding ways that could determine whether a person is at risk well before memory loss or cognitive impairment occurs. The ability to develop easy screening methods for them could allow doctors to intervene in ways to someday delay or prevent the onset of dementia. It is also key to enhancing pharmaceutical research, as drug companies are especially interested in identifying people at risk and enrolling them in clinical trials to test the efficacy of possible treatments. In recent years, scientists have reported discoveries on a number of possible biomarkers linked to Alzheimer s-related changes in the brain. Some might involve nothing more invasive than an eye scan or a skin test. But the test papers have been more hopeful than results. Shraddha Sapkota, a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Alberta, said her team studied the presence in saliva of metabolites   which are molecular byproducts of metabolism   to see whether they could be a reliable early indicator of metabolism changes in the brain that also signal the early stages of Alzheimer s disease. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the samples, the researchers distinguished between groups of participants who were aging normally, suffering from mild cognitive impairment, or already diagnosed with Alzheimer s. Sapkota said her team also found that higher levels of specific metabolites in the saliva also correlated to evidence of declining cognitive abilities.  So that s promising. What that does is it tells a physician in a regular doctor s office that this person should get more testing,  said Maria C. Carrillo, chief science officer at the Alzheimer s Association. Other scientists were more cautious. Creighton H.  Tony  Phelps, director of the National Institute on Aging s Alzheimer s Disease Centers program, said it would be wonderful if doctors could eventually ask someone to spit in a cup or submit to an oral swab and determine whether the person is at greater risk for dementia. But the research seemed preliminary, he said.  The idea is good. And I hope someday we ll be able to do that. But we ve had very bad luck with these panels of biomarker,  Phelps said. Marilyn Albert, director of the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University s Department of Neurology, presented a briefing whereher team assessed a variety of current diagnostic tools and found that about six measures were particularly useful in predicting which cognitively normal people would develop Alzheimer s within five years. Among the most useful measures were the Digit Symbol and Paired Associates Immediate Recall tests, which measure memory and cognition; analyzing cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of amyloid beta and tau, which are the two abnormal proteins that distinguish the presence of Alzheimer s; and MRI scans that assess the volume or thickness, respectively, of the hippocampus and the right entorhinal cortex, which are parts of the brain critical to memory.","Published: July 22, 2015"

Dr. Phillip Messersmith is the Class of 1941 Professor in the Departments of Bioengineering and Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. His research group is interested in understanding structure-processing- property relationships of materials in biological systems, and in using this information to inform the design, synthesis and application of biologically inspired synthetic materials used in a variety of practical applications. Current projects include molecular mechanochemical studies of biological wet adhesives, the design of biomimetic wet adhesive polymers and polymer composites, the control of biointerfacial phenomena in nanosystems and in antifouling surface coatings, and the development of novel biomaterials for regenerative medicine. One of the Group members, Dr Yang Wei, describes how they started to use JPK's range of SPM systems in a project about biologically inspired polymer adhesives. The goal is to understand wet biological adhesion and then to develop biologically inspired surgical adhesives for use in medicine and dentistry. Measuring forces of interaction between proteins and polymers and surfaces are crucial to understanding how organisms such as the mussel are capable of attaching to underwater surfaces. To achieve these measurements, atomic force microscopy has been applied to provide a very convenient way of performing biophysical studies of mussel adhesive proteins. In this work, multiple force-extension curves have been measured. Typical of this work, a single polymer chain containing the DOPA functional group adapted from mussel adhesive proteins is pulled from a surface using an AFM tip. This experiment was then automated with the use of JPK's ForceRobot 300 system. Speaking of its performance, Dr Wei said  I specifically enjoy using this fully automated force spectroscope with automated laser and detector alignment which provides high quality in terms of maximum sum values and lowest Z-sensor noise level in force data output.

This latest version of the industry's leading genome knowledge management solution provides new capabilities for reference-independent genome sequence comparisons while reducing data processing and analysis time. Genedata Selector 4.0's powerful new comparative genomics functionalities make it possible for the first time to compare and interpret genomic variants across assemblies and sequencing approaches. At the same time, the new automated processing pipeline optimizes user efficiency and lowers costs throughout the workflow, from integrating new knowledge, maintaining existing knowledge and interpreting data to generating reports. First-In-Class Reference-Independent Genomic Comparison and Analyses Across Lineages: Genedata Selector 4.0 Addresses Current ChallengesHigh-quality reference genomes serve important roles in identifying and understanding genomic variants across strains and lines. As new reference assemblies become available over time, organizations are faced with a significant challenge in order to retain existing knowledge and integrate it with the new references. Information from past analyses and the related intellectual property is often lost or dispersed over time, and no longer available for use in the discovery process. For researchers, the comparison of variants across reference systems is a difficult and time-consuming task, while for bioinformaticians, the re-alignment of historic data to new reference genomes is a challenge. Other data management systems that store variants relative to reference assemblies do not enable the performance of analyses that span different reference systems, or between genomes that are assembled without a reference genome (for example, de novo sequencing methods). Keeping all of the constantly accumulating variant knowledge current and accurate involves vast amounts of data, placing high demands on hardware and IT resources. As sequencing costs decrease and de novo sequencing approaches become more prevalent, there is a pressing need for knowledge management solutions with fewer limitations which reduce pressure on resources. Genedata Selector 4.0 has been specially designed to meet these challenges. New genome assemblies and re-sequenced genomes can now be easily integrated with existing genomic knowledge through a new processing pipeline which automatically updates variant data from previous analyses. Users now have the ability to analyze genomic sequences and protein affects across any available reference assembly. This includes choosing a reference from within the user interface, or directly comparing variants independent of any reference genome. Highlights of the new version of Genedata Selector:  Efficient, flexible management of variant data  An automated and scalable processing pipeline for easy integration of new genomes and calculation of genomic sequence differences  Interactive exploration, comparison and fast interpretation of genomic variant information  Querying and analysis of variant knowledge with no restrictions on the reference genome or sequencing approach used These new features are tightly integrated with the robust knowledge management and data analysis capabilities of the platform - capabilities currently valued by customers across a wide range of industries. Within a single, integrated framework, Genedata Selector manages and analyzes genome-related data for strain and cell line optimization.

Their findings pave the way for cell-based therapies that could one day replace the need for liver transplants. Researchers from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh transplanted liver stem cells into mice with liver failure. They found that over several months major areas of the liver were regrown from these cells, improving the structure and function of their livers. The liver has a great capacity to repair itself, however in conditions such as cirrhosis and acute liver failure, it becomes damaged beyond repair. Within the liver, hepatocytes are the essential cells that make many proteins and break down toxins, and while they have been used for transplantation their use has been limited as they don t grow well under laboratory conditions. Liver stem cells overcome this as they can be grown under laboratory conditions and have the flexibility to change into hepatocytes or other important types of liver cells. This is the first time that researchers have proven that liver stem cells can regrow the liver to such an extent. If they can show the same effect with human cells then they may be useful as a treatment for liver failure. Transplanting such cells into patients with liver failure could one-day offer an alternative to liver transplants. In the long term, scientists hope to find a way of stimulating the patient s own stem cells to repair the damaged liver using medicines. The research was funded by the Medical Research Council, the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform and the Wellcome Trust. It is published in the journal Nature Cell Biology. Professor Stuart Forbes, of the MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said:  Revealing the therapeutic potential of these liver stem cells brings us a step closer to developing stem cell based treatments for patients with liver disease. It will be some time before we can turn this into reality as we will first need to test our approach using human cells. This is much needed as liver disease is a very common cause of death and disability for patients in the UK and the rest of the world.  Dr Rob Buckle, Director of Science Programmes at the MRC, said:  This research has the potential to revolutionize patient care by finding ways of co-opting the body s own resources to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissue. Work like this, building upon a precise understanding of the underlying human biology and supported by the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform, will give doctors powerful new tools to treat a range of diseases that have no cure, like liver failure, blindness, Parkinson s disease and arthritis.

Baby rats with tapeworms avoided the brain inflammation that plagued worm-free rats after exposure to immune triggers in adulthood. What's more, the benefits began early, while still in the womb. Expectant mother rats with tapeworms passed similar protection on to their worm-free pups, the researchers found. The findings could point to new ways to treat or prevent the chronic brain inflammation linked to cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease, autism and depression. The study is published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Previous studies by Duke neuroscientist Staci Bilbo and colleagues showed that when rats get bacterial infections at a very early age, even elsewhere in the body, immune cells in their brains become hypersensitive to subsequent infections and pump out a continuous stream of messenger molecules called cytokines that can cause cognitive problems later in life. But for Bilbo, who is an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience and a member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, something didn't quite add up. Given how frequently bacterial infections strike, it was still unclear why a single infection at the wrong time would send the brain's immune cells into permanent overdrive. ""We have faced bacterial infections throughout our entire evolutionary history, presumably also during the neonatal period,"" Bilbo said. ""It always seemed kind of strange that the immune system would have evolved to overreact like that."" That got Bilbo thinking. ""Maybe this isn't how the immune system evolved to work,"" she said. According to what scientists call the ""Biome Depletion Theory,"" some autoimmune and inflammation-related diseases may be the result of too few of the life forms that once lived in and on the body -- particularly gut worms -- rather than too many. Tapeworms, roundworms and other wormy companions have inhabited the warm wet folds of animal intestines for more than 100 million years, bathing in a constant supply of food and nutrients. Over millions of years of co-existence, the theory goes, the immune system learned to tolerate these live-in guests, and eventually adapted to work with worms in mind. The theory is that now, with worms gone from our guts, the body's natural defenses can spiral out of control. ""Our bodies are essentially an ecosystem,"" said Duke immunologist and study co-author William Parker. Parker and Bilbo decided to see if restoring the internal ecosystem in the gut could bring the brain's immune cells back in balance. Laboratory rats are ideal for testing the idea, Parker said, because the life of a lab rat is a remarkably clean one. Scientists started breeding strains of rodents for laboratory experiments about 150 years ago. These animals are housed exclusively indoors, where their cages and bedding are regularly disinfected. A series of pumps and fans change the cage air more than a dozen times an hour. They eat processed food and sip treated water, and take deworming drugs and antibiotics to keep them free of parasites and pathogens. ""In a real sense we've done the same things to our lab animals that we've inadvertently done to ourselves,"" Parker said. The researchers did a first set of experiments comparing worm-free lab rats with rats that were raised on a farm where they were exposed to worms. When they infected the rats with bacteria, they found that the farm-raised rats avoided the damaging overproduction of cytokine proteins linked to cognitive decline later in life. ""We didn't see the same hyper immune response in the brain,"" Bilbo said. Next, the researchers studied two groups of rats in the lab. One group consisted of typical lab rats whose guts were worm-free. The other group was identical in diet, housing, exercise and genetics to the first, except they -- and their parents before them -- were deliberately given tapeworms. Both groups were injected with E. coli bacteria when the rats were newborns. Once the pups reached adulthood they were given a second injection, this time with a chemical from the cell walls of bacteria known to spring the immune system into action. The researchers then monitored changes in the rats' brains and behavior to see how they responded to the one-two punch. The worm-free rats responded to the second immune challenge with the same harmful outpouring of inflammatory cytokines seen in previous studies. But the wormy rats, and also rats that were worm-free but born to worm-infested parents, responded differently. Notably, the immune cells in their brains were able to respond to the second trigger without going into overdrive. They also didn't develop the same memory problems later in life that their worm-free counterparts did. Next, the researchers hope to figure out whether before or sometime after birth is the optimal time for treatment. ""Pregnancy is such an interesting time for the immune system,"" Bilbo said. ""Maybe that's why it worked so well. We just don't know yet."" Duke University   press release Bilbo SD et al. Got worms?

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, is the first systematic review to examine the effectiveness and cognitive effects of standard ECT treatment, brief pulse stimulation, versus the newer treatment, known as ultra-brief pulse right unilateral (RUL) ECT. It comes after previous trials had shown conflicting results. The latest study reviewed six international ECT studies comprising 689 patients with a median age of 50 years old. It found while standard ECT was slightly more effective for treating depression and required one less treatment, this came at a cost with significantly more cognitive side effects. ""This new treatment, which is slowly coming into clinical practice in Australia, is one of the most significant developments in the clinical treatment of severe depression in the past two decades,"" according to UNSW Professor of Psychiatry Colleen Loo. ""Our analysis of the existing trial data showed that ultra-brief stimulation significantly lessened the potential for the destruction of memories formed prior to ECT, reduced the difficulty of recalling and learning new information after ECT and was almost as effective as the standard ECT treatment,"" Professor Loo said. ECT delivers a finely controlled electric current to the brain's prefrontal cortex, an area that is underactive in people with depression. The current is delivered via electrodes on a patient's scalp while the patient is under general anaesthesia. Ultra-brief stimulation delivers staccato pulses of electricity, with each pulse on for only a very short time. As the pulses are so short, the stimulation of brain tissue is reduced by a third. It is estimated that up to 10,000 Australians with severe depression and who have not responded to first line treatments, such as medication, could benefit from the new treatment. Less than half of Australia's hospitals currently offer ultra-brief stimulation. Professor Loo, who is also director of ECT at Sydney's Wesley Hospital and a researcher with the Black Dog Institute, said she hopes the study will result in an improved uptake of the new treatment for people with severe depression. ""We are still working hard to change the broader medical profession's and general public's perception of ECT, which has struggled to shake off the tarnished image given to it by popular movies such as the 1975 film 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest',"" Professor Loo said. While the benefits of ultra-brief stimulation are significant, the study authors concluded that standard ECT treatment should still be considered over the new treatment, where urgency of response was paramount. The study only analysed the short-term effectiveness and side effects of ultra-brief stimulation. Studies into the long-term effects of ECT are ongoing.

""These predictions, most of them unconscious, include predicting what we're about to see,"" says Gary Lupyan, a University of Wisconsin-Madison psychology professor. Work in Lupyan's lab has demonstrated the predictive process through manipulating the connection between language and vision in the brain. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience shows that words have a profound effect even on the first electrical twitches of perception. Lupyan's collaborator, Bastien Boutonnet of Leiden University in the Netherlands, showed people dozens of pictures from a group of 10 common objects or animals. Before each picture appeared, participants first heard a word (""dog,"" for instance) or a nonverbal sound (such as a dog barking). The study subjects simply decided whether the word or sound matched the image. In an earlier study, Lupyan showed that people are faster to recognize pictures after hearing words than after hearing highly familiar nonverbal sounds. The new study by Boutonnet and Lupyan may have revealed the mechanism behind this ""label advantage."" Their study subjects wore nets of electrodes on their scalps, recording electrical activity in their brains as they viewed the images. The results showed that hearing words versus non-word sounds made a significant difference in a well-known peak in brain activity occurring within one-tenth of a second after the eyes fall on an image. The study, supported by the National Science Foundation, is the first to show that a word cue -- or a cue of any kind -- has such a basic effect on the way the brain processes visual information. ""Even in that first hundred milliseconds of the earliest stages of visual processing, half a second before they respond, you can see language shaping perceptual mechanisms to make more effective predictions of what is about to occur,"" Lupyan says. The results leave a puzzle: Nonverbal sounds like a bark can carry quite a bit more information than what is carried by a simple word like ""dog."" ""The volume and pitch of the bark can tell you not only that there's a dog nearby, but the size of the dog and whether it's angry or frightened or playful, right?"" Lupyan says. So why are labels better than nonverbal sounds in helping us recognize what is to come? In a study recently published in the journal Cognition, Lupyan and Pierce Edmiston, a graduate student at UW-Madison, write that all those specifics, while handy, are not necessarily relevant to the fundamental dog-ness of dogs in general. The word ""dog"" cuts through to the most simple and general information necessary for recognizing a picture as a dog. ""Words are ideal for activating categories in the mind,"" says Lupyan. ""Think about a guitar -- you can say 'guitar,' leaving unspecified whether it's an electric or acoustic kind. But if you were to see or hear a guitar, you would know immediately whether it's an electric or an acoustic one. Our senses cannot be ambiguous about this."" The only way to meaningfully convey the general notion of a guitar may be by using language. ""Language allows us this uniquely human way of thinking in generalities,"" Lupyan says. ""This ability to transcend the specifics and think about the general may be critically important to logic, mathematics, science, and even complex social interactions.""
